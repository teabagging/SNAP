Just reading some of the reviews I was shocked to find out that Foleys books were the first books they've ever read on their own! That has to say something! I think people enjoy his work more than some others is because he writes it himself, he is the one that sits down and spends his own time to tell us his life story instead of having a ghost writer, do none of the work yet get paid lots of money! (like Chyna..ahem...) When you read this book you just don't want to set it down. It is a continuation of his first book and it is GREAT!!

Buy this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the First !!!","review":"Foley is indeed good!!! And this book is that much better. It continues right on from where the first book left off, his winning the WWF Title. His story contains extrodinary accounts of \\"behind the curtain\\" action blended with the true human side of the performers that enter the ring for our entertainment. Foley uses a wonderful mesh of humor, lightheartedness and harsh truth and reality, to describe the world that he has lived his entire life. From the wicked chair shots to the hugs from his adoring wife and children, Foley paints a picture of the world that cannot be seen through watching wrestling on television. I recommend this book to all wrestling fans and to anyone who wants to know what the true life of a wrestler is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foley Has Done It Again","review":"Wow! My favorite wrestler, Mick Foley, has written another masterpiece. While his first book was totally autobiographical, this book takes you right into the world of Pro Wrestling. Mick gives his opinions on such things as wrestlings role in childhood injuries, censorship and responsible parenting. He gets you right into the locker room.The book is also as funny as heck with the usual Al Snow jokes, and more friendly insults towards fellow wrestlers.The autobiographical intrigue is also there, with Mick actually making you feel like you're a member of his family. Judging by his book, he's the kind of person whos family you wouldn't mind being in.Even if you aren't a wrestling fan, this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"foley is good at writing","review":"Foley has done it again. The first book was, with out a doubt the best book writen about pro wrestling. Now Foley comes out with his second book and its just as good at the last.

Foley has a real talent in writing books and I will look forward to another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foley Is Great","review":"Foley leaves where he left off in Have A Nice Day. He makes reference to several of his infamous matches with The Rock and The Game. He makes reference to his friends and family. He tells life outside of the ring.

It has action, comedy, and Foley's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome from the very begining to the very end!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i loved mick foleys first book this book is even better and more awesome i enjoyed this book alot mick foley is the babe ruth of wrestling!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly great!","review":"I had thought it would be difficult to top his previous book but I must say that the break down of this memoir as self contained observations and occasions rather than a chronological narrative of his life worked great. Essentially, it's Mick Foley's life and views in articles. The revelation of how meeting the man who was originally meant to ghost write his book resulted in turning in a chapter so awful, he had to write his autobiography without aid. It was also interesting to hear his take on Beyond the Mat without the camera in his face.

Ken Wilber has been instrumental in bringing it all together. His different books reflect the evolution of his theories. Many are very dense and a lot of folks give up. I find that when Ken talks about integral theory, I get it a lot easier than from reading him. These discs are a series of structured interviews that lead you step by step through his map of integral theory. Work with this and his next greatest work, Sex, Ecology and Spirituality flows a lot easier. Also his latest book on Integral Spirituality will sink in a lot easier. This is a must have if you want to really get integral theory and certainly if you want to understand Wilber. As an integral coach, this work is the foundation for my training lineage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great material","review":"These CDs are wonderful.

Ellul has done what so many have missed or distorted. Ellul's reading of the Book of Revelation is the most spiritually lucid intrepratation I ever read. It may just be the only one that does it justice. It rescues Revelation from the silliness that is rampant in most books on the subject. The primary import and purpose of the last book of the New Testament, according to Ellul, is AWE not fear, doxology not simplistic prognostications. This panoramic interpretation will cause you to see creation and his Kingdom in a new light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mental Poisoning","review":"I found this book to be highly overrated and overpriced.

Don't try to twist on it without shoes, it will hurt your feet. I tried to watch tv and twist (great concept), but you will twist around in a circle, and you work trying to stay facing forward and keep balanced. Otherwise, you just twist in a circle until you get tired.

I am not a festival-goer, but after seeing this portrait of the Salzburg festival, maybe in the future I will be.

It can be hit or miss with cats and their toys, but right after removing the wrapping, she started to chew on the swivel stick, bat the little streamers, and reach into the holes and bottom slot area to get the mouse inside.I like that you can replace the mouse with a different velcro-attached toy. It's nice not only when the mouse eventually gets chewed up, but it also rewards the cat if they pull hard enough to remove the prey.The toy actually allows the cat to play on their own when you're too tired, if you're cooking, or if you've had too much to drink and really just want to lay on the sofa and watch TV.The orange cat pictured playing with the toy his hilarious!

It is quite portable and even has a small carrying case so it can go with you on trips. Two small problems with it: The clamp that holds it to the top of the laptop does not hold it well; it is easily bumped off or askew. but it comes with a stand to set it on a level surface (if you have one). Second, the signal is a little slow. A hand motion -- even slow -- comes across as a blur. This may be because my computer is only 1.42 GHz speed, but that should be plenty given the 1.5 gigs of memory. Not sure if it will give more motion on a faster machine. Not likely. However, the Windows version does allow for use of the software tricks that work onlyon Windows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with my PowerBook","review":"Just plugged into my Apple PowerBook G4 (pre-Intel) and it worked right away...without installing software on disc.

The only plus I see with this product is that you don't get the rounded edges of the image that you would associate with webcams in general. Still, with long lag times, sound that is delayed, and fuzzy picture quality, I won't bother looking into using webcam technology for at least a few more years. Unless the parties on each end have good lighting (more light shining into your face than behind you is the key), the latest and fastest computers, fast internet speeds with few or no people downloading in your neighborhood, and high end cameras, the webcam experience is still downright brutal. And even if you do have all this, it still is in the beginning stages. Having said all of this, I do not think this is mainly a manufacturer issue, but more a technology issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work upon arrival","review":"When I got this product it didn't work - absolutely no response from 4 different PCs.

My wife tried to download the Logitec Vid software and could not get it to load past a few percent of the download. This overall installation process also resulted in our internet service going down twice. I had to re-power the cable modem after each installation attempt to restore it. This was baffling!It's also worth mentioning that I am PC savvy and evaluating video related software is part of my job. I walked away from this product after no small effort to make it work.

All three are out of focus irregularly across the field of view. If you're looking for good close-range (a few feet) pictures, this is not a bad choice. Use at long range (a nature scene viewed through a window) turned out to be woefully inadequate. I set the focus controls to manual and did a \\"live\\" adjustment of the focus, and yes I'm sure that the control is as good as it can be set, it's maxed at distance. Typically one side of the picture is blurry at long range but picks up some details sharply from the scene that are a few feet away, whereas the other side seems to be focusing at the middle distance, rather than at long range. It would seem that the focusing system is defective for long-range use. One positive point: when the sun is in the frame, these units do better than cheaper units in avoiding total washout. For what it's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent surround recording, very capable singing","review":"I got this for the Duruflé Requiem and have found myself more often playing Disc 2 for the shorter works, the performances of which I find more moving and inspired than that of the Requiem on Disc 1.

It is literally that AWFUL. The riffs are boring, the lyrics are excessively psuedo tough guy, and Matt Heafys vocals. Ughhhh, his vocals are awful. They sound like a cross between a sober James Hetfield and Cher (Heafy uses vocal enhancers by the way!)I wish upon no one this abomination.

I was apprehensive at their plan on changing their sound to reflect what they listened to more (as a million other people pointed out here, that would be Metallica). So, I got the CD with an open mind and I really don't like it. Only one of their songs sounds like their older stuff (Ignition). Two other songs on it are ok, so I'm giving it 2 stars rather than one, because even though I didn't like most of the CD or the direction they are heading in, I did like some of it.So, the fact that I gave it two stars would be most relevant to those who liked their old stuff and don't like Metallica. If you love Metallica AND their old stuff, this might be a 5 star CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trivium","review":"I highly recommend the purchase of this Cd for Metal lovers of all types. Their music is closely related to the early (80's) Metallica. Its a mix of Metallica, Testament, Megadeath, and Iron Maiden. I think every Metal fan of the 80's and 90's should own all of Trivium's albums. They are the best all around new band to come out in the 2000's. They have great metal ballads, a little Trash, speed, melodic, and Classic metal. BUY THE ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not Ascendancy!","review":"Ascendancy is in my top 10 all time favorite CDs. I saw The Crusade was coming out and I was pumped. When I first listened to it I was disappointed because The Crusade is very different than Ascendancy. Once I got over the fact that I wasn't getting Ascendancy II, it is in constant rotation on my iPod. You are getting 13 solid metal songs with a mixture of thrash metal, signature melodic Trivium vocals and guitar solos that seemed to have vanished from today's music.Standout songs: Ignition, Tread the Floods, Contempt Breeds Contamination, The RisingDefinately a must buy for Trivium fans, if you like Killswitch Engage and All That Remains you will definately dig this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGRACEFUL","review":"This new Trivium album is an utter disgrace to the metal world i ask what the hell happened to Trivium??Oh sure his throat was getting sore and what not who cares if u cant handle it get out of metal bloody wuse, the voice on this album is terrible what happened to the brilliant voice behind Ascendancy and the epic Ember to Inferno.I wipe my hands clean of Trivium if this is there future and for anyone thinking about getting into Trivium do not buy this album stick to Killswitch Engage or All That RemainsEven Metallicas ST ANGER was better then this and thats low"},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically correct metal","review":"This album recycles some good riffs from the 80's but you can tell these guys are right out of high school by reading their lyrics - the English class PC brainwashing hasn't quite worn off. They also use the thesaurus a little too loosely: \\"Wed-locked a prison Of antiquation\\" Good lord who wrote that? Their music may be copped from Metallica but the lyrics are something you would expect from Natalie Merchant (for you younger people she was the singer of 10,000 Maniacs in the 80's - a favorite of unpopular drama club girls who blamed all of their personal insecurities on society, patriarchy, sexism, homophobia and Ronald Reagan)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expect more from a band with creepy CD Covers","review":"A friend of mine recommended this band to me. While I do value his opinion I was not impressed by this record. I have not heard their previous releases and I may give them another try but The Crusade is very tame and watered down. With this effort Trivium appears to trying too hard to emulate the mainstream successes of their influences. There just isn't anything here that I have not already heard - I actually had some weird 1986 flashback while listening to this. The flashback was fun the CD is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing for me...","review":"BTW, not a kid, but the whole account thing was annoying. I was expecting so much more out of Triviums next album. Ascendency was the best album I ever heard, with great vocals and amazing music. The Crucade had the same musical talent as the last album, but the vocals didn't work for me. The whole Metallica thing was quite annoying and I really missed the great singing and the old singing voice. I guess Trivium was looking for new things, I don't know why, but this album just didn't cut it for me. Still, Ascendency is defenintly something to check out of you are looking for something heavier than this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal CD of the year","review":"When I first heard \\"Ascendancy\\", I was blown away by Trivium's musicianship and intricate song writing skills. However, I wasn't too fond of Matt's screaming and growling vocal style. The sections in the songs where he actually sang were much better, in my opinion. Now, with \\"The Crusade\\", Trivium has taken their musicianship to an even higher level. Matt Heafy is going to be the metal god of the 21st century, and now that he's dropped the screaming vocals, Trivium will soar into the metal stratosphere. \\"The Crusade\\" has album of the year written all over it. If you are a fan of old-school Metallica (I'm not saying they're a clone band), then \\"The Crusade\\" will ignite fires within your soul that haven't burned since the mid-to-late 80's. If each Trivim album improves this much, then Metallica may end up taking a back seat to them when it's all said and done."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge letdown","review":"If you are a big fan of Trivium's style on their first two CD's, then don't even bother with this album. Not too long before this CD came out, Trivium covered Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets.\\" In all honesty, the song rocks! But it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave Trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of Metallica. This new album is a complete letdown. Trivium has such an awesome sound on \\"Ascendancy,\\" and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dreams of playing in Metallica is, frankly, depressing.From a fan whole absolutely loves their first two efforts, I give this album two thumbs down!Please, for the love of (insert your chosen deity or spiritual force here), revert back to your original sound, Trivium!"},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"That's what comes to mind, \\"eh\\". The feeling with this is album is pretty much like this: Why listen to \\"unrepentant\\" when you can listen to \\"Through The Never\\" by Metallica? It's pretty much the same riff and you're not there thinking whether or not trivium ripped Metallica off on purpose. Why listen to \\"detonation\\" when you can listen to Sabbath's \\"Children of the Grave\\". Same feeling with the rest of the album. If you're somewhat well versed in metal, you'll find other songs like that. These guys have some serious talent. They're first album was great. There are other issues that I could've dealt with, like the singing change, etc. But as much as I try to like this album, I can't get over the fact that it sounds increadibly like a lot of my other, older metal albums. I'll just stick to Ascendancy for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"are they sending a message to Metallica?","review":"Trivium sounds exactly like Metallica when they were older. I believe they are sending a message to Metallica (stop sucking and start thrashing). I believe Trivium is a really cool find. if you like Trivium, I have more recommendations: Killswitch Engage, Norma Jean, Terror, It Dies Today, Zao, As I lay Dying, Underoath, Cataract, Himsa, Underoath, Lamb Of God, and Hedfirst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"I hope Trivium reads this. Trivium had been the cream of the crop with their previous two albums. Much as Metallica did in the 80's they revolutionized Metal by taking it to new levels. The \\"Crusude\\" by no means follows the revolutionary ladder that previous works had. This album is to Trivium what the black album was to Metallica. One that they will probably disown down the road. Please resort back to \\"Ember to Inferno\\" and \\"Ascendancy.\\" Those two albums were masterpieces. \\"Crusade\\" is a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for selling out again metlallica!!!","review":"wow i have to say i was so dissapointed with this trivium album, i really liked their debut ember to inferno for those idiots who dont know and ascendency is probably my third fav cd of all time. this cd sounds like james from metallica was like hey matt here are all the songs we did not use on kill em all, ride the lightning and master of puppets so go ahead and just use them on your new cd and what they got was a cd of pure crap other than maybe 3 or 4 songs. i dont get why you would drop the scream, other then 2 songs where it is just a small part of screaming the rest of the cd is the old metallica style trashy metal singing. i was so pissed after i bought this cd and listened i put it in my cd binder where it will remain until i get to drunk to remember it sucks then pop it in again and go awww crap what is this nonsense, dont buy it just d/l it or burn it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet, Metallica....Oh its just Trivium","review":"Yes like everyone is saying this sounds a bit like Metallica, and Trivium now sounds as gay as Matt Heafy looks. Their last CD Ascendancy was very good and help popularize Trivium. Now they are going where the money is. Matt has droped the harsh vocals to sound very much like James Hetfield. This will undeniably appeal to a much wider audience as the vocals are a lot friendlier to non metal heads.Trivium is however very talented, all members of the band are very good musicians and The Crusade does have some very good thrash riffs and memorable moments. But seriously one of those emo-fags could sing better that this. I have tried numerous times to listen and like this CD but the vocals completely ruin it for me. Ascendancy's vocals were just right, harsh but not painfull to listen to and you could make out the words without reading along. Im sure this album will sell many copies but I will not be buying their next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica are bad enough......","review":"Trivium are not remotely thrash. Seriously did anybody actually listen to this album? Well I did, Trivium are not the \\"saviors of metal\\" or anything of the sort. First off metal doesn't need to be saved, it need's you little mallcore fags to start looking in the underground for good metal. For good bands currently making music check out: Necrophagist, Ghoul, Frightmare, Anata, Vile, Agalloch, Isole, Circus Maximus, Symphony X, Iced Earth (new allbum in '07), Sodom, Napalm Death, Tankard, Diablo Swing Orchestra, Yyrkoon, Phobia, Unexpect, iron Maiden, Blind Guardian, Candlemass, Deicide, Lord Gore, Hirax, Sadus, Eternal Tears of Sorrow,etc. Go shop at hot topic you attention seeking scene pricks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic","review":"I would've given this band a 5 but not until they hand Metallica and Megadeth all their loyalties.

Their SECOND CD IS GOOD and that's it. DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS (the 3rd cd) ONE. Nothing innnovative or great about the singging. That's enough to turn me off of it. Please listen on their myspace or on amazon. It's bad. I would have listened more to hear their usually great instumentals but couldn't get past everything they sound like now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The NEW Metallica !!!","review":"You can tell straight after hearing the first few tracks they were definitely influenced by the old school metal. I love the trivium Ascendency album and they just get better. So what !!! .... If they are becoming more commercial - you have to go with the flow. Just look at all the guys in the band and their photos on the Ascendency album - they where Guns'n'Roses, Overkill and Metalica T-shirts. I was influenced by those bands and they made Metal and influenced my passion for Metal!!! Trivium is a new class and I think Metallica would love to have them support them at a festival or something.The Crusade shows pure brilliance as Trivium Mature. My bet is their next one might break them like the Black Album did for Metallica .... who knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the old stuff better....","review":"But I do like the new sound some too.

I'm just shocked that they didn't mention this album in their most recent news letter.I've been a senior member of the 6-String Snake Metallifan Club (awaiting the results on the VP election) for over 14 years now, and this cd will undoubtedly be in rotation at our next regional event -- 10x blacker than the black album!

It's bands like these that make me embarassed to call myself a fan of metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same.","review":"I wouldn't consider myself a fan of Trivium, but I have been following the metal scene for quite a while.Trivium has chosen a new direction with this album. Their touring connection to Metallica and Iron Maiden (see the album's liner notes) has probably played a major role in their pursuit of a similar sound. I speculate that Roadrunner Records also put pressure on this group to create a more mainstream album. The label has been dropping its heavier acts and signing bands like Megadeth that do not fit with their previous brand image.This album is a disappointment to old fans, especially my friend Peter. If it were released at a different time, I would not have the option of saying, \\"These guys are trying to sound like Avenged Sevenfold\\". Unfortunately, I just did."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The F*ck Happened","review":"I am a huge Trivium fan but this CD is terrible. I believe they are trying too hard to replicate Metallica and that is not possible so the result comes out horrible. Other than the self title track \\"the crusade\\" and \\"entrance of the conflagration\\" this CD is not worth a Dam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Their Best Work","review":"It does have the usual Trivium elements to it, but its not as heavy as their other albums. They still have their insane solos and the last song is a wonderful instrumental. I'd recommend it if you're a Trivium fan, but buy one of their other albums first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big names thrown together.","review":"This is a recording of the Schubert quintet played by big name musicians like Casals, and Sasha Schneider. It has gotten very good reviews too. Unfortunately I don't find the playing that golden, particularly in the ensemble of the music which is quite rough and tumble. These musicians are like a pick-up group, and they haven't played together all that much. So they are cautious, adjusting to each other as the music unfolds. I think there are much better Schubert quintets elsewhere, for example, the Hollywood quartet with Alvin Dinkin, or the Emerson quartet with Rostropovich. Just to name two.This CD deserves 3 and a half stars. But there's no such thing. So I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masons: The misunderstood fraternity","review":"The author makes some interesting points about where a Mason's true allegiance lies. Sadly, he is wrong. The Masonic belief is (in order) God, Family, Country, and Lodge. How this can be possibly construed to mean that they are at odds with christians, or catholics, is both unfounded and a misrepresentation of fact. Any reader interested in learning more about the Fraternity would be better served starting with one of the hundreds of books available on Masonry. My sense is the author has some other agenda at work here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is possibly one of the worst books on abortion I have ever encountered.Her metaphors of Artemis, etc. are lovely, but her facts are all over the place. She makes comments about religious beliefs that are so overgeneralized they are quite insulting, and her wonderful facts about the children of the world come from 1989... this edition at least was published in 2007!!!! Beyond that, she makes outrageous claims such as that overpopulation is singlehandedly to blame for war and the abuse of children, with nothing to back this up and nothing to explain this link.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a gross misunderstanding!","review":"Anyone who could say that abortion is a choice to not create a child has blindly missed that by the time abortion is being executed, a child has already been created.

Has she never heard of adoption as an alternative to killing a baby?"},{"rating":"1","title":"To Set some people straight","review":"I believe that it is the choice of women to have abortions if necessary however, I don't believe that using as a means of sacrifice is right. Modern day pagans and wiccans should have better morals than this. I am pagan myself and I find it offensive. True wiccans, if they go by the basic principals believe that you shouldn't kill. I think that it is an immoral and mis-informative book as far as the view on modern day wiccans and pagans. Personally I wouldn't use this book for firestarter. Don't Buy it.

I forked over the money for Revitalash, even though it does not contain the same formulation to stimulate long lashes like Latisse. Revitalash still yields noticeable results--lashes are longer (but not ridiculously longer like with Latisse) and they seem to stay healthy and long even after you stop using it (not so with Latisse--newly grown eyelashes will fall out!).My recommendation: save your money, or fork over a little more on another product for visible results."},{"rating":"1","title":"No instructions and no ingredients","review":"This was recommended for eyelash growth.

Although it's not a long, complicated story, the richness of the book lies in its reflection of how life progresses and changes through the years, with both love and loss. I have read it to my children again and again, and each time I feel that Ms. Connor has captured some essence of life and change that will make this a book my kids will want to have for their entire lives.

As a 16 year old girl, I am the target audience, yet this book really fell flat for me. The characters as a whole are one dimensional with no particularly interesting or shocking backgrounds or personalities, even the main character. While the title of this book promises exciting adventures full of secrets and plot twists, the novel does not live up to it. The story has an alright beginning, but ultimately disappoints. More than anything, I was most bothered by the level of the reading. With the target audience being teenagers, one would assume that the novel would e highschool reading at least. At best, this novel was advanced elementary, basic middle school level reading. I thought this lack of challenge would be a nice relief from the difficult novels I read in school, but instead I found that it made reading boring, and the book as a whole, a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!!","review":"wow! this is my #1 fav book! the characters, the plot, the settings its all so cool if you like up beat fun out going chick flick books you have to read Id Tell You I Love You But Then Id Have To Kill You!! its the bomb! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read and fun book!","review":"I'm a 16 year old girl who was struggling to find a book that I had to read for an English class at school that would be interesting and a good read.

The characters are interesting to the point where you can imagine yourself being one of them in the everyday situations they are involved in. Even though they are spies and live amazing adventures, they also are regular teenage girls with the same issues that we all encounter on a day-to-day basis.

She told me it was idiotic and wanted confirmation that she wasn't missing something. I listened to the first hour, with increasing difficulty and annoyance.The concept of a school for brilliant but airheaded teenage spy-girls is in itself thoroughly silly and I fear the author was trying to cash in on the 'boarding-school universe' ploy carried out so beautifully by J. K. Rowling. The heroine seems very much like a self-absorbed teeny-bopper, not a little girl genius, and is, in my opinion, an insult to any young adult's intelligence.The audio version features a reader whose voice is gratingly superficial in a Rodeo Drive style. Her imitation of a Southern accent is simply awful.To all Young Adult authors: please, please don't take young readers for morons. Please?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to BURN this book!","review":"There is nothing exciting about this book.

She always succumbed to boys and she couldn't even lie properly and she declares that she can kill a man 7 ways. Right.

There's spies, there's girly girls, there's love, there's comedy, there's fluff, there's action - what else could a girl ask for from a YA novel? And it's written in such a way that I believed I was actually listening to Cammie, the main character, and not Ally Carter, the author. A lot of YA authors, I find, have trouble making that happen.Anyhow, this book was just adorable.

Side Show has inspired a great deal of adulation from fans who seem to think it's the best musical in the history of western theater. It's not. The lyrics are surprisingly clumsy and at times lazy (some elements sound translated from another language!), the music has a passé bounce to it. Some of the vocal performances are very good (indeed Ripley & Skinner have a cult following) -- and I do commend all involved for trying to entertain with something different. I don't think it stands up to an earlier Off-Broadway musical that also dealt with the Hilton Sisters, 20 Fingers 20 Toes -- albeit in a darker and funnier tone, not unlike Little Shop of Horrors. This is not a \\"top drawer, must have\\" musical. It's more like, if you'll forgive the comparison, an interesting oddity to add to a larger collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cast recording","review":"The music is really good and the singing is breathtaking.

There were both positives to the CD and negatives. First the postivies: Alice Ripley and Emily Skinner have amazing voices and there are some great songs such as \\"I will Never Leave You\\". Now the negatives: the show did not live up to the potential it had. The two lead girls did not use the power in their voice that I would have like to have heard. The two lead males did not have the best voices (that is my personal opinion) as well. The lyrics were not that good and the story seemed forced. Other than a few good songs the musical was not that good and just was not the type of musical I enjoy. I would recommend musicals such as Les Miserables, Phantom of the Opera, Wicked, Avenue Q, etc. or musicals that has more than 7 songs you enjoy. There are good musicals but this just isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"forced and phony","review":"the strident lyrics and gushing music are about as false as the premise. its beyond vulgar that the lives of the hilton sisters became fodder for this so-called serious musical. this is not nobel or heroic ,but sensationalism masked as understanding. what a relief it closed. bad taste is pandemic , but this wallow gives bad taste a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP, CRAP and CRAP again","review":"God!

Unfortunately, some of the songs are a little odd, but when it comes to \\"Broadway\\" songs, along with \\"Who Will Love Me...\\", \\"I Will Never Leave You\\" is powerful and beautiful. These two women better have another theatre vehicle soon! It would be such a waste if they don't work on another show together. The other cd's which they've released are on my list for my birthday.

Too bad the show wasn't given the chance that it deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best musicals of the year","review":"Combining the talents of Emly Skinner and Alice Ripley to play Daisy and Voilet Hilton was a brilliant idea.

This show's emotions are palpable; performed with a love and sincerity that is clearly heartfelt.

I hope this show is on it's way to The City by the Bay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good, catchy score....","review":"This is a very good catchy score that almost works better on CD than it does live on stage. Often times the music seems to soar to greater heights while the lyrics are left behind. Lyrics like..\\"Who will ever call to say I love you? Send me flowers or a telegram. Who will proudly stand beside me? Who will love me as I am.\\" are almost amateur they are so maudlin...and yet the whole thing, as a pop music theatre piece, works well.Highlights include \\"The Devil You Know\\", \\"Feelings You Have Got To Hide\\" (some of the best lyric work is in this song) \\"One Plus One\\" and \\"You Should Be Loved.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"No freaks in this SIDE SHOW!","review":"I first purchased this original cast recording the first week it was released. From the very first time I listened, I fell in love with the voices of Alice Ripley and Emily Skinner as the conjoined twins, Daisy and Violet Hilton. Norm Lewis also delivers yet another powerhouse performance as Jake, the Cannibal King. Delivering a wide array of musical stylings of the vaudeville era, the score by Henry Kreiger and Bill Russell quickly grows on you...as does the beautiful lyrics. Anytime the twins open their mouths to sing, it is pure delight. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mount for the money","review":"This is the only mount I've found that offers smooth panning and strength to hold my Swarovski Birding Scope to my tripod. This isn't a cheap, plastic mount that sticks and binds while scanning or panning for wildlife. The turning handle locks the movement of the scope very good, if you turn it tightly. It holds up to the weight of the scope and the scope locks to the mount very tight. (I always have a piece of heavy string tied from the scope to the neck of the mount, just in case...) If I were to make this mount, I'd have the handle closer to parallel to the plane of the mount, which would allow the user to aim the camera or scope at a higher elevation. As it is, if I aim the scope very high, the handle sometimes interferes with the base of the tripod. It's not critical, as I just tilt the tripod if I want to view something overhead. Overall, this strong, metal, well-built mount has the smoothest operation that I've used. A good product for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for small breakouts","review":"I was a bit skeptical on this product. But after using for a month I can say it has worked very well for me. Understand that everyone is different as to which products will clear their breakouts. I am a big fan of many of the Burt's Bees products because of their lack of chemicals. This blemish stick does contain a small amount of alcohol, but doesn't seem to irritate my skin if only used a few times a day, for a few days. I've tried it on small and large breakouts. It works very well for the smaller ones, though I have yet to find a product that can help with the larger ones. I don't believe the smell is too overwhelming, but then again I wasn't using it all the time, nor in large areas.

This one by Khaled before he got too commercial sounding for his own good is another excellent disc. This is Arab party-Rock fusion at its best.

If you want to see what your mormon neighbors are so excited about, but don't want to bore yourself to the point of slitting your wrists, avoid the book and see this film.

In other words, this movie started out looking very amateurish and then it evolved into a funny episode of Family Guy. The beach scenes and the dancing girls on the boat were hilarious. Best I can say about this mess of a movie was that Nephi was handsome and the daughters of Ismael were babes. But did they have to get two gay guys to play Laban and Lemuel? Don't buy this movie. It's very bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intro to Book of Mormon","review":"I first viewed this video about 2 years ago. Although the actors aren't Academy award earners, it gives a visual to the historic events recounted in the first sections of the Book of Mormon. I use it as a missionary tool for those unfamiliar with this book and skeptical. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a big budget film but......","review":"I have read the other reviews for this film and I can't begin to see how people that claim to be LDS can say it is an embarrassment. What you have to remember is that it is a low budget movie and did not have the budget of movies like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Just remember we are not perfect. I am LDS and I enjoyed this movie. It has humor and was definately serious. I think that if more movies are made they will just get better and better. Those of us should just be thankful that movies that have anything to do with our faith are being shown in theaters (I am also aware that there was \\"poetic lisence\\" takeken in this film and it says so before the films begins) so get a grip and don't be so uptight about it being a low budget film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you give less than 1 star?","review":"This is hands down one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I think they spent their entire budget on arial views of South America. It is not even good enough to be called \\"so-bad-it's-good\\"; it's just plain bad. It is a shame because this is an awesome story, but the writer/director missed the boat on delivery. This film added to the decline of Mormon cinema. Of course shoddy acting, lack of continuity, odd scriptural interpretations and creative liberties did not help any. If I owned the rights to this film I would buy up all the copies and destroy them out of embarressment."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's entertaining","review":"Very cheap, not good acting. But if you want to laugh, it is pretty funny just by how bad it is.

Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon are believed by millions around the world to be the Word of God. Making a movie on the Book of Mormon that is at the same time cheesy, unprofessionally acted, and very low budget, does not help the cause of educating the masses to the message of the Book. The Book of Mormon, deserves much better. Years ago, in the mid 60's a movie came out called the Bible. Although not perfect, the acting was great and the photography a delight to the eye. Please, in reverence to the Word of God, DO NOT and I repeat, DO NOT even try to make a movie based on the Bible or the Book of Mormon without a proper level of quality and a good budget. It would be much, much better to just stick to the written Word rather than making a mess of it through a very bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear","review":"As a active Mormon, I am extreemly embarressed. What were they thinking? You cannot make a decent movie from the Book of Mormon with out quite a large buget, and if you don't have one, please don't try. You'll just end up looking like idiots, like the cast and crew of this flim have proved.If you wan't to watch a movie made by mormons about mormons, go rent \\"The Best Two Years\\".Much much much worse than the cheesy 50's bible films.

All the actors a bunch of white Utah Mormons who don't look anything like the people in the middle east? Language not even close to sounding archaic? Unfortunately I really thought and hopped it would be better. I love the Book of Mormon and I've read it many times, but this movie does not give it any justice. However being about the Book of Mormon, it was very spiritual. They definately could have used some help form Historians, Anthropoligist and Linguistics. Honestly I've seen better acting in High School plays. If they continue with more \\"Voumes\\" I sure hope that they can make it look a little more acurate.

For the second, you'll leave confused and bewildered."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOVIE WAS A GOOD EFFORT, BUT THE REVEIWS ARE SAD","review":"I watched this with my family, and we had a good time at the extended moments that were put into the movie. Overall a good effort, and there is nothing that should really bother anyone that knows the story. What is sad are the attempts by non-members of the church to use this movie and this forum as a excuse to just attack. Worse are the comments by so called members to discourage anyone from watching this movie, and make up their own minds as to what is trying to be told. They just become a partner in the attacks. This movie trys to tell a story, and as mentioned made a better effort than many would have done with the same. At least they did it out of love. It sad some of these reviews show the lack of the same. Watch this movie if you want to understand, and feel what was put into it, and why. It what this world needs more of."},{"rating":"1","title":"painfully bad","review":"Good golly, this is a bad film. Bad acting, bad costumes, bad idea. As an active LDS member, I knew the chance of this movie capturing the power of this wonderful book was slim, and so I tried to lower my expectations. I'm telling you, I couldn't get my expectations any lower - and it still disappointed. Wow. What an amazingly bad movie. I couldn not make it to the end, it was so bad.What we need is to leave the LDS-theme movies to Handcart and BYU studios where they belong.

How the religious will find it I cannot say; though if they share a love of Bach, they will probably get an extra measure of gratification at the vivid presentation of their commitments. For one value, frequently expressed, all of us are likely, to respond, \\"Amen\\" or our equivalent of it, the prayer for peace for all humankind.

The story is told from at least 4 character's view points with each character developed over a period of time in the book.

If you want to know about power and everyday life in the US, this is a great intro book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sunk","review":"Mr. Seal's novel, Treachery at Sharpnose Point, is best left unread. It is a waste of your time. The book takes a rather straightforward shipwreck in the mid 1800s and attempts, very hard, to make the case that something malicious was afoot. Despite a great many colorful adjectives, little proof is offered. To fancy up the story, Mr. Seal is instead forced to make up a fictional account of the events on the doomed vessel.This book never should have been written. Mr. Seal uncovers little, if any, mystery or intrigue. What he does manage to do is, however, rather atrocious. Mr. Seal spends most of the book maligning the name of RS Hawker, a long passed vicar who lived in the area of the shipwreck. He paints the vicar as a villian but on the weakest of evidence. Mr. Seal writes badly of the dead with no good cause and for that the book suffers.Avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product......but....","review":"It is everthing it says it is and does it well. Here are the con's: lightweight hose, water flow could be better and unless you write the company in the UK you can't attach any of your own nozels or devices. You need their 'Clips' to attach to their hose. Now you can go to a home improvement store and buy US scew in ends (and I know they do sell these 'fast clips' as well, but I don't know if their to the same spec's) but what a pain. And as far as I know, you can't call anyone here in the US for help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the challenge","review":"If a person is only familiar with the pop sounds of Joe Jackson, then they better open up their minds. With Jackson's classical training, he finally gets a chance to stretch his legs into a unique sound that is not quite classical, not quite jazz, and not quite rock. This work is a strong musical interpretation of the 7 deadly sins. 'Angel' and 'The Bridge' are slow and easy to listen to. 'A Bud and a Slice' is hilarious and has beautiful orchestration, as do the other songs. 'Anger' is a challenging bombastic sound of two drummers and an angry ...um...young?... man. I say listen to it 3 times, then make your decision. I think its worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"a new angle for the banging brit","review":"Jackson's album here features numerous enchanting guests and an amazing variety. The composer didn't meld his topics into unintelligeble program music, but does justice to each of the 7 deadly sins.I am not familiar with the corpus of Jackson's pop/prog music, and came to this cd as a disaffected rock kid interested in classical, but primarily what was fresh and new in classical as opossed to just what is \\"time-tested.\\" I was a little worried that Jackson's work would stay too much on the surface for me. While it is more accessible than many of my other albums, I've found that's a good thing. What I love about this album is that it is unique. I would never mistake it for anything else in my collection, and I like to hear it. In fact, I like to hear it quite a bit. 'nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Systematic Theology?","review":"I found the content well written and informative. Instead of offering a thorough text I was left with the feeling it's purpose was to argue his views with the Calvinists of the day. While it is popular to label him a Pelagianist, Finney was skillful in weaving his arguments close to the line and when about to cross he offered something that brought them a shade back to the right.While he preached of the longevity of his views the depth he goes to argue his views at such a late point in his career it seems his thoughts would not have been developed and polished as they were in his theology."},{"rating":"2","title":"dp","review":"I think this album is dope!! yes, it's kind of 311, but much more energy with tough guy lyrics...the best description i could give is, POD meets Bad Brains style reggae with just enough Janes Addiction guitar sounds to give you all the elements you need to know what So Cal is all about!!!This is a good albums for girls, and a good album for guys because we all like to get drunk sometimes...Props to the Mix Mob for making a great record!!

The vocabulary and teaching methods in the later lessons were lacking, and the book is chock full of simple editing mistakes, such as mistaking 120 for 200 (Unit 14, Key Words #1)... such mistakes can really throw you off when learning... this book might be okay for the casual language learner for travel, but overall pretty mediocre.I would recommend Penguin's \\"Russian Course\\" by Nichholas J.

There are only a few really pleasant songs here (\\"La Decadanse\\", \\"Sex Shop\\", \\"Je Suis Venu Te Dire Que Je M'En Vais\\" and perhaps \\"Vu De L'Exterieur\\"). This collection is not at all inspiring, and it would definitely be a better investment to buy Gainsbourg's earlier works, which will give you a more vibrant picture of his inimitable talent and originality.

The powers that be at Universal are milking the Ross Legend for all it's worth, caring little for the material or the accuracy thereof.

He has interviewed everybody and done all the primary source research; he knows the facts and he tells them straight.

Learning about Sandy's abusive step-father, for example, surely gives us a better idea about how Bobby & Sandy's relationship fell apart. What made Bobby so great - he wore out everything he did - is also, to a good degree, what helped take him so early. This was a Type-A personality with a deadline; he did everything as if it were his last day.

There can't be much olive oil in this product, let alone extra virgin olive oil. It is pale in color, pale yellowish, and does not taste like olive oil at all. I wasn't expecting an exquisite artisan olive oil for this price, I figured there might be a pretty astringent taste, but this is something else altogether. The only good thing about this is that oil in cans will last unopened for 15 years, so I'm going to stick this in my basement for use in case the world goes to h--l (I bought 3 cans, 2 are unopened). In the event of armageddon, I'll probably be pretty happy to have some oil, any oil. And that's about what this is good for--a last resort in case you can't get anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low on flavor oil","review":"We bought a gallon of this oil, because the market had a promotion($16.50 per gallon). My wife disliked it immediately, saying it lacked any real flavor. After a taste test, I had to agree. Olive oil has so much flavor, easily recognized by even a young tongue. The other 2 olive oils in our house were brimming with more olive flavor. So now we use the Genco only for cooking, and use it sparingly. When real flavor is called for, we use the other brands. Take your own taste test; you might be surprised. To be fair, maybe we got a batch of Genco that was \\"off\\" a bit. I imagine olive oil producers are subject to the whims of nature, and maybe our gallon was from a less than stellar harvest of olives.Larry (Italian in San Francisco)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Food poisoning","review":"Sure it was cheap, but every time we used it, my wife and I got sick within 2 hours.

You can bake a great looking bundt without having to make a whole big cake that might not get finished by smaller groups. I've only used it once, and I found out (the hard way) that my recipe fills more than 2 panfuls. One of my cakes went over the edge b/c I had over-filled it.

The book is full of great stories and insights by someone who has obviously done their homework on the topic. Alot of fact-correcting with regards to the Ruth-Gehrig squabbles, and sets the record straight on aot of issues.

There are no glossed over facts, and the last reprint in 1996 has a covering prologue from Chief Mangasuto Buthelese. Any military historian with a keen interest in this Nations short life should make this book their top archive source. This book is still availble from some of the UK outlets priced at around 15.99. This history of the Black Spartans is a must. It tells of their true courage against unsormountable odds to defend their homeland against a well equiped and disciplined army, but also shows that they themselves were just as highly disciplined, and sure footed, and were not afraid to pitch Assegia and Cowhide shield agains, field guns, boxer henry .45 martini henrys, gatling guns and the formidable British Red Coats."},{"rating":"2","title":"An in depth view of main players of S.African history","review":"The most concise depiction of the clash between the European and native African cultures.

Finding the right Bible for your kids is an exhausting task. I spent more than 2 hours reading reviews and descriptions before deciding on this one for our 4-year old. I am soooo happy I did. We have and love the Children's Beginner Bible (it's perfect for ages 1 - 6), but our 4-year old son was asking very perceptive questions and needed a Bible geared towards older children. He understands the stories in this one, all of which stand true to God's Word instead of being changed to our time, and the pictures are beautiful (though the Adventure Story Bible had incredibly gorgeous pictures that seemed more interesting and appropriate for young children...we returned that one because of MAJOR Biblical truths they distorted/omitted). We read this every night and it makes for a perfect time with my boys (ages 2 and now 5), my favorite part of each day. They are EXCITED to read it each night, even after owning it for a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pictures too graphic for toddlers","review":"Personal opinion here, but the pictures in this Bible are too graphic for my 2 year old. A naked, voluptious Eve with just the minimum covered. Abel taking a rock to Cain's head with scary rage on his face. People climbing a mountain in terror as they are about the drown in the flood. All true and very realistic depictions, but a little scary nonetheless, and more appropriate for older kids.

Eve was naked, Cain did kill Abel in a rage, and LOTS of people died in the flood. Why hide the truth from our kids?

Not to mention that the price is pretty high for what this delivers. We will be looking for something else before our next roadtrip. I would have given it 3 stars if not for the lingering frustration at having to listen to lousy commercial radio for four hours!The first company to attach a tuning dial to one of these gadgets will make a fortune.

The version of Jimi Thing is spectactular!! The part near the end where dave starts showing off his talent for scatting was amazing. The band sounded crisp and strong on every beat. Carter has some of his best work available on this album. The guest spot really added another perspective and was remarkable. Warren Haynes is someone I don't think I have ever listened to, but it was a perfect addition to the show. Cortez was fantastic and every electric riff only added to the band. Haynes was able to blend in without taking anything away from the band's chemistry. This is honestly a stellar concert.

That being said, it's a great aftermarket replacement for the stock MAF. You probably won't notice any gains with it but you will definitely feel the difference in throttle response. I'm not sure the effect it has on unmodified intakes, but if you have a cold air intake, this will help you make the best of it. I had one of these installed 7 months ago and it started acting up because it started failing. Luckily, it was covered under warranty by [...] where I bought the first one.

Then there's an on-board lap (apparently useful to some GP riders) but unlike past years, they don't even bother to inform who the rider is. They cut most of the post-race interviews and all 125cc and 250cc coverage, a feature of prior years. Finally, there's the racing.

I am an occasional photographer, who handles the equipments gently. However, on the third day, the locking mechanism for one of the legs broke. Assuming that it is a one time problem, I returned the tripod and bought another Velbon DF-60 from Amazon. This also broke after two months. Even when gently used, the cheap plastic parts break. I will never buy another Velbon product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value - all the features needed","review":"Like the other reviewer - I checked out tripods at a camera store. Hadn't heard of Velbon, but a quick Internet search showed them to be a recognized name in tripods. I needed a tripod for my Nikon D50 (especially with the 70-300mm zoom lens), and perhaps a video camera, and the DF-60 fit the bill - lightweight, quick to set up, leveling bubble, detachable baseplate, etc. Sure, it's pretty much all plastic, but if you take care of your equipment - shouldn't make that much difference for non-professional use. It's stable enough with the built-in leg brace spreader. The price at the camera store was almost $70 - Amazon beat them by a mile. Received it in a few days. So far - everything I though it would be. Highly recommended if you need a lighweight tripod. Now I need to get a bag so I can sling it over my shoulder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"Although I've only had it for a day and took it out for a spin last night, I'm satisfied with this unit. As others have mentioned, it has just the right balance of weight vs. stability. I'm confident that it can withstand fairly adverse terrain and conditions. Even though it does have various plastic parts scattered throughout, it feels solidly built, and for $50 you really cannot ask for a better tripod.The fully extended height is more than plentiful for a majority of applications and, most importantly, the head action is smooth on all axes. It holds my XSi with a Tamron 75-300mm WITH EASE. If you are to use it for D/SLR shooting this is definitely the way to go... cannot comment on how well it holds up for heavier video units."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good.","review":"I haven't use this too much, yet, but so far so good.

However, this thing is very big, bulky, & heavy compared to your average tripods. I'm sure it could be used professionally but not for the regular digital camera that most consumers have. It does have very nice features but I thought that the description was misleading in stating that it's light weight.

The book is easy to read and understand. It was a joy to read. I am new to the goat business, but I feel that it will be very helpful when I go to pick out my first meat goat later this month (June 2001). Right now I am building fence with the help of my husband. I have learned how to house them, feed them and care for them. I may be even able to get my first sets of kids sometime in November. :o) Can't wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Resource for Goat Breeders!","review":"This is the best book that I have found for goat husbandry! The advise is sound, the book is easy to read and it covers most questions about how to raise goats, from how to feed them, breed them and house them to how to raise and sell the kids. Up to date, and enjoyable. A must have for any livestock library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raising Goats","review":"The book was recieved in the time allocated by the mail system. The book arrived in great shape and is quite informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raising Meat Goats for Profit","review":"Gail Bowman's book very informative as well as entertaining. As someone who has raised and loved Boer goats for years, my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed her book and learned alot that will help us on our small goat farm. I highly recommend Gail's book to anyone who already knows and loves goats or wants to know what goat raising is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"The use of the exclamation point in my title is a gentle poke at the editor of the book. I DID enjoy it and it DOES have some really good information, however, it was a bit distracting to see the author end so many sentences with exclamation points. She used more in the first chapter than most authors use in an entire book. Anyway, that's kind of picky of me, considering the obvious effort and love of the author for the subject matter, meat goats.There are photos of the various goat breeds and good explanations of each breed's benefits and shortcomings. Being from a family that builds cattle feeders, metal buildings, corals, cattle guards, and that sort of thing, I can say that the author knows what she's talking about in the fencing section. I picked up some tips that I will use in my operation. The book is well worth the small price and I give it two thumbs up! Except for all the exclamation points!!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and Informative","review":"This book is so well written that I just took it for granted as the way all livestock books must be done. I mean, it goes into detail about all aspects of raising goats including how to feed them, kid them out and market them. I have nearly worn it out. Then that new one came out and I thought it would be as good but it was terrible. Stick with this one folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version","review":"The kindle edition is very difficult to read and the charts are useless.

It is very informative, and we really enjoy the illustrations, but I was expecting it to be more comprehensive. I should have paid more attention to the number of pages! But it is a great introduction to the many varieties of spiders and insects. It is not, however, a complete encyclopedia!

Ernestine Anderson meant nothing to me; but, the CD looked interesting and the songs, listed, made it seem to be something worth listening to. Well, I was wrong (for me that is) I didn't care for her as a singer and the arrangements of the songs seemed ordinary.

All the basics are here -- walking, feeding, preventing/correcting unwanted behavior. In many cases, it's a superior book to the Brian Killcommons' \\"Child-proofing Your Dog\\" because it's more exhaustive. I'd recommend this book, along with Killcommons' other fantastic dog-training/owner-training books, \\"Good Owners, Great Dogs\\" and \\"My Smart Puppy\\" to make any dog-owner a near-expert in interacting with their four-footed companions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Advice; Succinct, to the point, and sensible","review":"This book helped me sooo much. My dog was my first baby and when I found out I was pregnant I was both overjoyed and anxious. I worried that my dog wouldn't accept the baby. Thank God I found this book. It addressed every one of my concerns and offered effective and practical solutions. Now I have a baby and a dog and we're one big happy family.This book helped me and I'm sure it will help you as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost plagarism","review":"This book seems to be a direct knockoff of Brian Kilcommons' book on the same subject. The only differences I really noted were splashy demonstration pictures & cute illustrations that supplemented the text. It was a waste of my money & don't recommend it if you are buying the Kilcommon's book on the same topic. It may be ok for someone w/no dog training experience, but to be honest, I'd purchase a training/obedience book from Kilcommons, along with Kilcommon's \\"Childproofing your Dog\\" book, if I were a sheer novice. (And sign up for some basic obedience classes in your area) I'm not convinced that Wombacher is a trainer from the contents of this book. And I have spent an extended amount of time in advanced obedience training w/my dog, as well as agility work and basic obedience w/2 other dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dog training book, baby or not","review":"The Doggie 12-Step Program in this book is one of the most effective, easy to understand, and easy to implement, training tools I have come across. I have a rescue dog that I was too soft on at first because of his fearful nature. I am now trying to definitively establish myself as \\"alpha\\" and the 12-steps are working fabulously. It's a simple outline, yet enough theory is offered for every step so if the situation doesn't totally apply you can come up with some modified version for each step and have a variety of exercises to work with to establish your role as pack leader. I've purchased a zillion books for my messed-up dog and this is far and above the most useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU REALLY LOVE YOUR DOG, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!","review":"What a terrible approach!

Still, if you're going to pick a fantasy novel out at random, you could scarcely do better than this book, an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, incomplete...","review":"I like Lucas' work, and this book is no exception. I didn't realize though that there was a packet of drawings that came with the book, which wasn't included. So far, I haven't found a supplier of those cards/illustrations. So, slightly disappointed that I don't have the complete set, though, without seeing them, I suppose I may still be successful without them.

The kids could care less, but to them the more floating plastic the better. For fun value, this toy rates high on my scale. We love the pool and basketball. Put the two together and we just don't know what to do with all the fun. So, it's probably a good thing that this toy's life expectancy is fairly short otherwise our supply of fun would just be too much to handle. Luckily, the hoop broke right as things started getting out of control in the fun department and the shock brought us all back to a safe level.All in all, the toy is inexpensive and enjoyable for everyone around a small or probably even large pool.

I first owned it on VHS and did it at least once a week in addition to cardio and traditional strength training. I never got sick of it and it got me to love yoga, especially ujjayi breathing. This is just pure ashtanga with no fluff. David Swenson is a no-nonsense instructor who shows great modifications for beginners and gives tips for proper form. You won't hear any New Age-y talk if that turns you off from some yoga videos. The demo at the beginning of the video showcases the flexibility and strength he has gained from years of practice. There is no music during the main routine, but the 10 minute guided relaxation has soothing music.The set is outdoors, at a beautiful garden in Washington state.If you like this video, you should also try Eoin Finn's Power Yoga Vol 1 or Yoga for Happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite teachers","review":"This dvd helps tremendously if you live a busy lifestyle. You get a workout, and David's voice is very pleasant. He doesn't get in to a lot of perfectionistic details of poses, but rather, gives you the basics and lets you move into it at your level and ability. You have room for your own interpretation in a pose. The setting is beautiful, and you will feel like you've had a good workout in very little time. Great intro to more advanced ashtanga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doug IS one of the BEST Ashtanga teachers!","review":"I have been lucky enough to practice with Doug in person and he's an amazing teacher.

To my surprise I don't think I saw any vodka recipes which I figured is pretty standard in a lot of drinks?? Like I said I don't drink often so I could be wrong.I had a hard time taking off the top (silver) part in the beginning, I was starting to wonder if it was suppose to be left on, but after some TWISTING and Tugging, it finally came off.The strainer isn't that great, you kind of have to hold it all the way upside down to get all the liquid out, but it's not too bad.Well this is a good little shaker for beginners but I think more experienced cocktail makers will not be impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used once","review":"I used this once for margaritas and left it overnight without washing it.

While there are some improved gameplay features, Rise of Nations seems rushed to market, with no scenarios or great history lessons like Age of Empires and Empire Earth. I'm a history buff, and was always impressed with Age of Empires campaigns ability to teach while you were playing it. Is this game just a foundation to sell more follow-on scenario packs? If so, that's slimy.Other gameplay features missing: no ability to build walls! The advancement from age to age is also far too quick - Empire Earth does a much better job here. I do think the graphics and overall interface is nicer than EE though. Overall, a dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a usable interface","review":"Ack! So many of the RTS games have the same interface. Its horrible. The multiple city aspect of this game only makes it worse. Its nearly impossible to fight a major battle as well as keep your cities producing because you have to go and find each city, click on each building and upgrade/build with it. A simple sidebar that allows you to keep your cities running without leaving the battle would be awesome. As it is its just a frustrating experience. The addition of the researching just makes for one more thing you have to try to keep track of in this jumbled game.Obviously this game is a meld of Civilization and Age of \\"Whatever\\". It fails at both and leaves you in a click fest where you have no time to think and no time to act.I hope these games move away from the frantic clicking to a more thought out strategy game, but I dont see it happening because people play these game like they're going out of style. I for one hope they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good.......","review":"This game might be a good one.... If I could play it on my laptop.

There was nothing new about this game, it was setup exactly like Age of Mythology. You have to gather wood and goal, and your given cheesy missions to complete.

Many of the interfaces are similar to Age of Empires, so if you liked that game you will like this one.

As for the units, they are ok, but I'd still like to know how a arrow can bring down a Lancaster bomber. But if you like playing the same missions over and over for hours then this game is for you.

We say it is great as far as the genre goes. However we are now both bored, and conclude that it places too much emphasis on aggressive game play. If you get into that kind of play all well and good. But having played Star Craft etc., we are now looking for something that is closer to the reality we know. The history of the Nation State runs together with non-nation state forms of organization: The gaming community, and software-producing geeks are examples. We are looking for a simulation game that can show us how both Nation State and Non-Nation State organizations network and support and control each other. Why? Because it would help us understand how things really work rather than the simple fight, bribe, buy and dominate modes of simulation games. Fun, but the genre still needs development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Such a shame.

If you enjoy Microsoft's approach to RTS then I would recommend you buying RON.On the other hand, If your tastes are more inclined to Civilization then don't buy RON or you'll find it boring. I've honestly tried playing this game five times and I just cannot bare it. I eventually go back to civIII because I find it much more intelligent and deeper.In RTS it's not so much about the latest graphics, it's the playability and the challenge that counts.

It is, however, fun, and like others have said, combines a lot of the best aspects of older titles.The different civilizations are pretty cool, but I'd like more unique units and fewer economic and military bonuses. The campaign is awesome, but difficult at the easiest setting, as are quick battles. My friend and I are avid strategy gamers and we had trouble going co-op against the two AI opponents on the lowest setting. Its taken us between 8-11 hours to finish skirmishes. So the AI is amazing, but it leaves me with a cold feeling in my heart, like while playing a German killing GIs in Day of Defeat. Its too good.But I stick more with Age of Mythology, but thats more because I love ancient civs, despite the games inaccuracies.Oh, and I hate the idea of Wonders, of which there are lots in RoN."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game Rocks!","review":"This is an awsome game!

The next, you are waiting around to collect a resource to research or build something. Citizens needing to be told to go to work when there are open slots at your mines or woodcutting area is tedious and not fun. Having to research at seven different buildings instead on a single area is a poor idea. The AI does not need to search to find just the right building (which all look very similar) to study something, so why should the player?At the easiest, slowest setting, the player should be able to learn and crush the opposition, but even then, you are struggling to keep the AI out of your cities. Not much fun. Perhaps if you have been playing Warcraft or another real time strategy game for ten years, this is all second nature. But for a newbie, this is more like work than play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"I must say that RoN is one of the best RTS games I have ever played! The gameplay is well-paced, the units are plentiful and balanced, great music and top notch animation to boot.My chief and only complaint is that nuclear weapons dominate the late game too much, and any game ending in the modern nuclear ages suffers from an inevitable nuke-tossing fest.

Or maybe you want it to get better scores or just to beat it faster this time. It has a drawback on some games like the original Kingdom hearts for Ps2 as an example. It completley trashed my save file, but it was my own fault. It still makes for a nice item for your library. My only true complaint is that in the featured picture, it shows the memory max item.

After following their instructions on the Datel website on how to update the codes using a USB drive, it deleted my game saves on the memory card. It also corrupted the memory card, and corrupted saves on the card in slot 2. I have had nothing but trouble with it, it's slow and doesn't live up to the promises.

I've owned Game Shark stuff, Action Replay stuff, and Codebreaker stuff. Nothing has made me as mad as Action Replay Max, though. It corrupted my memory card, causing the loss of dozens of hours of saved games. To add insult to injury, the corrupted games still take up space on the card, but I can't find any way to recover them.

I own both the Gamecube and PS2 version, and with the Gamecube one I'm up and running in about 1 minute. With the PS2 version, I literally have to sit there for 5 minutes waiting for the codes to load into the code list. That might not seem like a long time, but imagine sitting there and just waiting for 5 whole minutes.. it gets really old really fast. Sometimes I don't use it just because of how irritating the wait is.The good part is being able to download codes off the internet and transferring them to the PS2 on the included memory key. Well, copying over the new codes takes quite a while too, so prepare to wait for that as well. I really don't know if the PS2 is to blame or the Action Replay.. but it really should be faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheat disk not a game","review":"This product was sent to me brand new and in excellent condition.

It gives interesting excerpts about the main characters, not just the cut and dry facts about the Revolutionary War taking place on the Pennsylvania and New York frontier. The author tries to give a fair review of the battles taking place from both sides of the war, but is perhaps a little biased in favor of the American Patriots. The book has several maps throughout that help a great deal in following the battles. My only disappointment is that the book ends when the Sullivan Campaign ends, which was not really the end of the Revolutionary War. Only a paragraph in the epilogue refers to Joseph Brant continuing the warfare, as if he alone battled on after Sullivan's campaign. Yet, what was written to that point was the best I have read, so far on the Frontier battles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilderness","review":"Another detailed chapter in Eckerts series..

However, the quizzes and tests aren't very good. The quizzes for chapters 1-8, for instance, have questions that require knowledge of chapters 9-12!

The only thing I disagree with is the closed fist punches to the head (good chance of broken knuckles), and head butting without controlling the opponent's head (good chance of cutting your scalp!).

This is definetly Metal all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Industrial Classic","review":"This is quite possibly the best Fear Factory album ever, and is definitely the best album without Dino in the group. (I'm not knocking Dino I'm just saying this beats everything else Christian has done with FF) Guitar work is good especially with the memorable tunes such as Human Shields, Archetype, and Drones. However Raymond's drums bring an unfathomable amount of impact to the bone crushing riffs. Burton's vocals impress as always; from the high octane adrenaline of Slave Labor and Cyberwaste. his original take on switching back and forth between yelling and signing in songs like with many songs on this album add to the variety you will find on the disk. The only album I could possibly rate higher than Archetype is Demanufacture, and only because Demanufacture was the album that introduced me to what is now one of my favorite bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The guitar riffs are good and the vocals stink.

IT DOESNT SOUND GOOD.There are some good moments from time to time on this cd, but overall the quality of the songs are not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Having been a Fear Factory fan for quite some time now, I was staggered to hear album. Anyone who thinks kicking Dino out was a good idea should listen closer. The riffs are not structured very well on this record, and the overall quality in the song structure is scant at best. Some people could blame Dino for the lack of quality (which like most things, is opinion based) on Digimortal, but these people need to think about the rest of the band and their contributions. The softness and the minimalistic hip-hop style was (from what I know of the band) almost completely derived from Christian and Burton. If you compare the songs on this record to those of the earlier Fear Factory records closely, you can hear a massive difference in song writing talent. And if you decide that these earlier songs are better than this album (which I feel is the final nail in the coffin for one of my favorite bands) make sure you take a peek inside at who had a hand in writing those songs. RIP Fear Factory."},{"rating":"1","title":"tired","review":"MY GOD is this band tired. Not only does every album have pretty much the same sound but the tracks are in the same composition on every CD (ending with neoballad.) Dino left the band because he was bored as hell and I don't blame him at all. I went to their concert last month and I could tell that even the band was bored with it's own music. Burton comes out and just acts like \\"ok here's another show.\\" He doesn't take it seriously at all. This band needs to stop now before the memebers kill themselves because there is nothing else to do that would spark creativity. The songs on this CD are better than digimortal but that's not saying a lot.

Christian doing the guitars, not bad, Byron Stroud on bass, cool, Burt singing, great as usual, Raymond, destructive as ever. I do have a gripe with using the B in most of the songs, but it is what Fear Factory was all about. But where are the ultra-aggressive songs like in Demanufature-Obsolete? This one has more melody than aggression.I like the album, not as good as Demanufature-Obsolete, but good nentheless. This is another start for Fear Factory, but over time, Christian will be using more than just the B in half of every song, just give him time. Remember how Dino was? Same thing with Christian.

I was in LA to see In Flames and a dude there told me that Archetype was worth picking up, and I was eager to hear it. The razor-sharp riffs and thunderous drums are perfect for getting your blood flowing, and the perpetual dark mood is enough to make a sunny day turn gloomy. I had hoped to see FF when the returned to my hometown at the same place I saw them in 2001, but I missed out. In a day and age where it seems every metal band is moving away from the elements that make up metal music (like Linkin Park), it is truly inspirational to see a band stay brutal.

Look at the resurrection video from the 98 album it was creative and cool. It seems like fear factory tried to sound like every other metal band played on tv. Lets face it their best albums are demanufacture and obsolete and it is going to be extremely hard for them to top those 2.

I thought Fear Factory was no more, that was why they released that blast from the past retrospective, CD 'Concrete' a while back; because they needed more money to hit the strip clubs and drink their liver out or something. I guess they had a little extra and found themselves sober enough to get to the studio... unfortunately not nearly enough to produce anything of quality. This band has no soul.

The only semi-original aspect of this band's sound is the over-use of the \\"machine-gun\\" sounding double bass sound they use. Unfortunately, it is a gimmick!

Act of God and the title track songs have been some of the best Fear Factory songs ever put on cd.

At the outset I was thrown by the questions, but the strategy I adapted apparently payed off.Going in, all I had to prepare me was the skimpy test booklet provided by the State of Florida certification division. But if you're really serious about getting through this exam at the first go, then this book is a must.

While there is overlap between some of the fifty items (such as the coverage of pronoun problems in Chapter 15 as well as Chapter 38) the book is well organized, easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to use.Of particular value are the numerous examples of each problem and how to resolve specific instances. When applicable she includes very useful tricks of the trade. For example, whether to use \\"who\\" or \\"whom\\" is easily resolved by a simple substitution trick. One tough problem that many people wrestle with, one easy trick, and the result is a grammatically correct sentence.The advice is very good, the writing style fun and not at all academic, and the results are tangible.

This album will fit the bill for those times when you want to put on some mellow holiday music, or background music for a holiday dinner, but the more carefully you listen, the more astounded you will be.Several years ago, I had the good fortune to see Robin perform a holiday concert with his friends Al Petteway and Amy White (the three of them put out an excellent holiday album together, b.t.w.), where Robin played his exquisite arrangement of \\"The Carol of the Bells\\", which he said was brand new.

Its more impressive for me because I like the game Halo so much, but regardless of this the music is excellent.Rock Anthem for Saving the World is excellent, brash and epic conjuring up memories of desperate battles from the game. Covenant Dance is possibly my most favourite, its really breath-taking, epic and touching with a strange alien-like synth overlaying most of the track.If you like the game, it means you like the music.

One track in particular deserves special praise...Track 6, A Walk In The Woods, is my favorite piece. It alone is worth the cost of the soundtrack.As I recall, this song appears on the Assault on the Control Room level. It's a really bass-heavy, catchy tune that comes in about half-way through the level.There's just something about this track that makes it really stand out. Most of the soundtrack evokes a feeling of adventure or dread. But this song is different. It has such a sexy, playful groove that you wonder why it ever became a part of Halo. But then, you realize, it's just one of the many little things that make this game so enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part \\"Chant\\", part techo-rock.

In my opinion, the previous album, \\"Religion\\" had a bit more to offer. But some songs on \\"La Verite\\", such as \\"Un Million D'Annee\\" are fantastic, and make this album worth it. In the early 1990s Niagara changed their sound from an edgy pop to hard rock, and this album just got a bit too hard for my tastes. Nevertheless, as usual, Niagara has intriguing and poetic lyrics, and high quality music. Even if it is not their best, it still shines compared to most French music from that period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and colorful Elmo book to teach the basics","review":"My daughter LOVES anything Elmo, and we've found that she learns so much from reading and watching this furry red monster in his day to day activities. GETTING DRESSED! presents cute and colorful pages of Elmo in various stages of dressing himself. It also shows the clothing appropriate for different seasons, i.e. snow boots in winter and bathing suit in summer. Our child loves to point to all the clothes and mention their names, colors, and where they belong on the body. The wording is very familiar if you watch ELMO'S WORLD on Sesame Street, and since there are no flaps like in some of the other Elmo's World board books, you won't have to worry about your little one ripping the doors off. Lift the flap books are not our favorite, so we were glad this one didn't have them.

It's hard for people to understand this principle at times, but the Pauley's lighthearted story-like approach will make it a fun read, keeping you interested while enlightening you on age-old principles that are read by thousands every day in the Bible.It's a quick and easy read and although I didn't learn anything new, I liked the book so much that I ordered a few more copies for friends.

If you can keep an open mind, reading \\"Rich Beyond\\" will raise your senses and inspire you like no other self help book.

She presented her personal story in a way that could help many clergy facing the same predicament. Not all clergy would choose her path of leaving parish ministry, nor does she recommend they do. This is not a condemnation of the current church at all, rather it is one poignant story of a priest that has dealt with the pressure so many experience of serving a congregation.

When I completed the book, I felt as if she had been describing a time in my own life (and I am not a priest) when I was overworked, pushing myself too hard and not having time to think. A contemplative, which I take Ms. Talyor to be, needs space and time alone. This book could be about any perons who does not seize the time for quiet in whatever occupation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Testimony to self-absorbtion.","review":"Taylor has made a name for herself in the Episcopal Church as a speaker, and I read this book as an entree into her work. What I found was a woman so wrapped up in herself that her \\"vocation\\" was at best a soliloquy from the very start rather than the dialogue implicit in a call. The present Episcopal Church is in theological disarray, and her very fuzzy explication of even her own position, let alone that of the church she claimed to represent, is a good example of why.

The lyrics are extremely catchy, and the voices of Dane, Wayne and Bobak compliment each other excellently. I am yet to figure out exactly what Mark is there for.. He doesn't sing, can't dance, which must mean he's supposed to be the 'eye candy' of the group. And surprise, surprise, he fails at that too. But, don't let him put you off.

It comes across as a figment of Graham Masterton's imagination. This seems to be his fantasy of sex. Much of this book is full of just what you would read in a Hustler mag. There is a heavy overtone of lesbianism yet the book cover gives the impression of heterosexuality. His last chapter is filled with lesbian/incest (mother, daughter, and one guy) sex ... DISGUSTING!

We thought that it would have a large opening like our old {Petmate Waterer) one does with a open & close spout for dispensing water. But it doesn't. The opening is about the size of a pop bottle, & no open & close spout which we love with our old one. Makes it so easy when changing water. Our old Petmate has a large opening, about the size of a very large pickle jar, allowing us to add ice cubes to the water, making it's nice & cool. We were very dissappointed when receiving this item, because we thought,(it looked like) the old one we have now, but had to send them back.

Hmmm... then perhaps taking the invalid description and false picture down would have been nice before I spent my money on it and shipping. It runs on a vaccuum seal and in trying to remove the clear plastic bottle off the plastic bottom, snapped it. So I can't use it now anyway. On the lighter side, the customer service agent who helped me at the company for whom I bought the product was polite and time efficient in getting back to me with the bad news.

A story within a story, it begins with an exposition of the profound influence one man, Sensei, has on a young friend (the narrator) and in particular, the devastating consequences that Sensei's cataclysmic decision has on the narrator's life. Later in the book we hear Sensei's own story in which he describes the devastating consequences had on his own life by a cataclysmic decision made by one of the people he valued most. The book is deceptively simple but floods with lyrical beauty.

It doesn't matter if they're rechargeable or not...it won't work when you come back to it more than a day after replacing or recharging the batteries. And since it holds the photos in its built-in flash memory only as long as there's battery power, any photos not already downloaded are lost.Picture quality is okay if there's enough light, considering it's a cheap camera, and although it doesn't have a flash it does have a helpful feature where it gives a long beep and doesn't take a shot when the light is too low, thereby saving you time and wasted memory. Obviously, though, I'm going to return this camera due to the battery problem, so its positive aspects will go unappreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son is very disappointed","review":"My son received this camera for Christmas and that day we lost pictures twice and the camera would not take pictures consistantly.

I am a guitarist, and I think that John petrucci is the best part of dream theater. But on this album, the piano is so amzing. The guitar is the lead, sort of, but it's like one of those albums where the lead instrument is complementary, even though I think he did a great job.So basically, these guys are geniuses, and this is really abstract stuff. This is not the kind of music where the whole song is based on a melody.

The problem with CD binders is that the metal binder is NEVER tight, so some pages will fall out eventually. When the CD Binder is full of 192 CDs/DVDs, the weight is heavy enough to bend the metal out place and makes it extremely loose.The other problem is turning the pages. With a FULL CD wallet, you can move easily between different pages but with a FULL CD Binder, it is packed so tightly that it is hard to flip the pages and IMPOSSIBLE to move from the 1st page to the last page instantly or vice versa.Also this CD Binder has a capacity of 192 CDs/DVDs, so you can't add more pages to it. I was under the impression I could add more pages.The only reason to buy a CD Binder is that it is organizeable.

However, those binders were almost full so I needed to get some more but could not find them at the last places I bought them. So I bought these, and found that they were not the same size and shape as my prior ones.

I'm trying to save the plant and not be wasteful and so bought several hose menders, metal and plastic. If you are only using the hose to carry water from point A to point B under no pressure it works fine. But when used with the sprayer or the water sprinkler they cannot take the pressure and either leak or come apart. I wrapped the hose with duct tape to try to get a better fit and it improved slightly but it still leaks. And I did order the correct size of mender for the hose. The plastic works a little better than the metal and is much lighter. Next time I'll just buy new hoses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This hose mender is heavy and strong. I'd like to give it 5 stars, but I could not get all the screws out. Apparently an electrochemical reaction occurred between dissimilar metals and froze the screws.

They could have saved most of those pages by condensing most of the item lists into concise tables instead of wasting so much space and spreading the information out so much.One more word of warning: There is at least one instance where the guide instructs you to take a certain action which causes you to skip large segments of dialog and plot (and possibly costs you experience as well), and doesn't even tell you that you're missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"A whiny fantasy, not a memoir","review":"I happen to know something of Marcia Aldrich's real life family.

This urban, very personal poetry is a product of the metropolitan noisy atmosphere, and as it is surrounded with fog of overpopulated, but yet unexplored areas.This poetry expresses more than the actual meaning of the words is telling.Spleen is created of prose and pure poetry, of the reflection of the analytical spirit and intuitive introspection.The apostle of pain and depression,Baudelaire is the one who analyzes his own and other people's sins, expresses himself as a moralist in this book as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy fenders","review":"The fenders seem durable enough and I have a feeling they could last a long time.But: Mine arrived with more than half the screws missing, and several nuts.

The gate is very hard to open with one hand, it doesn't swing open like it says it should. The side part that holds the gate closed comes unattached after a couple of trys opening the gate, you should need an allen wrench to unhook it, wrong. Also the gate will open if you pull on it, it didn't take much to yank it open. The template doesn't line up the hinges right, but that didn't seem to effect the gate working or should I say not working right. We took it back the next day our son never got near it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, very secure gate","review":"We've had this gate at the top of our stairs for almost 4 years now. It closes securely, it is easy to open with one hand once you get the hang of it (and you're tall enough). The only problem we had was that our kids thought it would be fun to swing on the gate and broke the hinges and a screw inside the at the top of the stairs. While that was a pain to repair, I'm pretty sure it was NOT designed for swinging. The gate has help up extremely well for us. Given the permanence of the gate, we took out time installing it. It was a little tricky to mount so that it fit into where it needed to be and where it would catch on the other side. But once it was up, it was up for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Bad inevery way","review":"First, the installation is horrible. The screw templates are wrong, the instructions difficult (and wrong in places). Only uses 3 screws on one side. Screws on that side have narrow heads and no washers quickly breaking the wood and being secured only part way in.It wont open all the way if it's not at the very corner of the wall. Since the entire thing swings open, it blocks the entire hallway when open,making it difficult to get passed (you have to close it, then squeeze by to open it passed you to get through)Very hard to open with 1 hand. Doesn't accommodate baseboard moldings on both sides.Loud to close, being at the top of the stairs near the kids' room this is a huge minus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We bought this gate to go across an entryway. The template does NOT line up correctly and the gate was way off when we put it up. When my husband started to take it down all the screws stripped and broke off into the wall. We attempted to install this three times (once without the template) and now I have molding full of holes and broken screws.Also, when we did get it up it was crooked and we couldn't get it to really line up correctly. When we tried to \\"unlock\\" it, the whole mechanism came off the wall.The gate went back to the store. I bought a SuperGate V. It isn't as pretty, but it was installed in minutes and it functions perfectly. And it was only half the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have expected this from a cheaper gate","review":"The internal parts of this gate are almost 100% plastic. The locking mechanism has broken twice in the 6 months that i've had it. Customer Service was easy enough to deal with, but the gate only comes with a 1 year warrenty, and for $100, you should get a gate that lasts longer than a year. I'm positive that I'll just have to keep replacing the same part over and over, and if it breaks again, I'm going to try as hard as I can to get my money back. Hey, at least it's pretty....BOTTOM LINE: If you want a top of the stairs gate in a high traffic area, don't get this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst gate ever","review":"NOT made for frequent use. Almost as soon as we installed it it became loose and started to pull out of the wall (with studs).

The other stairs has a safeway metal gate on it and it has been great."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this gate","review":"We made the mistake of buying this gate for the bottom of our stairs because 1) it caters to wider areas than the standard gates, 2) it appeared sturdy , 3) it looks nice. But its just the most awkward gate ever to open/close. You have to lift the very small lever out & up, then pull the gate out while still holding onto the lever. Impossible while holding a child and still takes multiple tries even without. Even to close it you have to push it twice to click both top & bottom pieces into place. We have a Safety One gate at the top of the stairs which is literally a 1 step handle to open/close. Definitely returning this product, especially considering the price & the fact that i am having to climb over it every time i want to get in/out which defeats the purpose of a gate. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"this gate is safety risk!","review":"After spending over an hour installing this gate because the template provided isn't accurate, I was very frustrated to find that the gate does not work properly or safely. The gate latches using spring loaded pins. It takes very little pressure to retract the pins making it possible to pull the gate open with little effort. Ironically, the gate is very difficult to open when you are using the intended method. The release latch doesn't fully eject the pins so you have to use your other hand (or a small kick) to open the gate. The clip that is supposed to attach the latch to the mounting bar is also faulty on our gate causing the entire latch unit to pull off of the mounting bracket each time we tried to open the gate.This gate looks very nice, but I took it down the very next day because it is so poorly engineered. I wouldn't even use this for a dog much less trust it to keep my child safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"Not easy to install: template for screw holes was way off and the latch plate comes off the wall easily.

It certainly was worth far below the $17.00 I paid for it!I am very disappointed with this item, but thankfully Amazon is very helpful in allowing me to return it for a refund.I also bought a Dora The Explorer microbead pillow for only $9.00, and it was filled up completely with the beads and very comfortable for my use.

The tip consists of an inner clamp that is positioned/installed and then the chrome outer shell is attached to it with two small screws. The clamp is mid-range inside the shell so you will need at least 3\\" of exhaust pipe to attach it to, in case you're trying to butt it up against your muffler. The chrome outer shell is oval so your existing pipe needs to be close to no more than 2\\" or the inner clamp will be too expanded and difficult to slide the outer chrome sleeve over. I installed two of these on my 2004 Accord V-6 with 2\\" existing exhaust and it was a close fit but looks great and I'm very happy with them. Air flow through the gap between the clamp and the chrome shell seems to be keeping the tips from discoloring also.I'd recommend them to anyone with a 2\\" exhaust system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Pillowcase","review":"Pillowcase fabric is listed as cotton/poly on its package, but manufacturer Core Products fails to specify the percentage of each.

I threw it away.I miss the original Guardian Jackson Cervipillo [registered trademark], which is no longer made by Sunrise Medical; it had a zippered cotton/poly pillowcase with a great fit and comfortable fabric that laundered beautifully.

The work sounded intriguing and I began reading it the day it arrived. But although the premise is interesting, I didn't feel the author really deleved into what he promised. The book left me with the feeling that ministers need to be aware of the dangers of burnout, without offering any real solutions or preventative skills to build. (We're already aware of this, I think.) The section on the Inneagram was sketchy and more anecdotal than helpful in describing the types in terms of ministry, their strong suits, and their weaknesses. It was a few paragraphs to a couple pages for each, pretty much listing the above. Clearly the author feels it's a time for healing. (I agree with him.)

I do a lot of other type of exercises too and my legs are quite strong already. I think it's more about the muscle strength in your legs and coordination than feet size. If you're not very coordinated then I can see why some people may be having problems but once you use it for awhile and get the muscle strength in your legs up you should be able to stay on.

It claims to work your thighs, but I honestly don't feel it doing anything for my thighs.Don't let any bad reviews put you off. Unless you have extremely bad balance, you should be able to balance on this board with little effort. Yes it's a bit small, but that is fine unless your feet are larger than say... a woman's size 9.I do wonder just how much weight this thing can hold.

It's plastic vs. the wood one I had, but the wood one was very heavy and because it was square I would constantly bang my ankles on the points. This one is extremely light weight. My sister is a pharmacy tech and she leaves it at work and twists in between customers (since she is standing all day this break of twisting gets the blood flowing ; )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Exercise Tool","review":"I think the twist board is great.

More like lasted a DAY","review":"I bought this board to help me lose weight and tone up. There is no max weight limit for using this product and I was happy to do just that... unfortunately it broke while in use the second day I had it. I was using it properly, I wasn't doing anything crazy or beyond what it's *meant* to be used for, and yet it's nothing more than an oversize paper weight now. To say that I'm disappointed would be an understatement, and I have no interest in paying more in shipping and handling to get a replacement than what I paid for the thing originally by making use of the \\"warranty\\".My advice? Skip this, and find something more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Easy","review":"Love this thing, it's actually helping me unkink my back (or it certainly feels good, anyways)and I can feel it in my core.

Fun way to get moving for such a cheap price, worth the money 11 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for working out while watching TV","review":"I had something similar to this twist board before. This is much better without the sharp teeth which were made of clear hard plastic, were easy to break off. The rounded bumps are much easier for feet.

It is easy to use and small enough to store in any drawer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Balance Problems","review":"I don't really care for this product. I feel it should have a much larger platform to stand on for the exercise it is designed to do. It is smaller than I imagined and hard to stay on it as you try twisting. I wish I had known how small it was before I bought it. I am not large, wear only a size 7 shoe in fact and although I do this barefoot, I do not feel it is comfortable enough to stand on or very safe either. It is easier if you stand by a wall or use something to hold onto as you twist as it is easy to fall off of it. Holding onto something helps you stay on it. Balance can be a big issue for this product. It is not a recommendation of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"scratched before first use ...","review":"It's Junk ... returned asap to get one made from stainless steel... don't make my mistake-buy something made of stainless steel right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"Interesting story but writer needed editing help.

I find it kind of amusing how Hellmuth could release such a DVD. It absolutly has no value if you're looking for an instructional DVD. You \\"learn\\" things like \\"LOL\\" means laugh out loud, or that the advantages of online play are that you can play whenever you want, you can multitable or listen to the radio while you're playing.And of course this wouldn't be a Hellmuth DVD if he didn't tell us how a great pokerplayer he is.The only reason I give this DVD 2 stars instead of one is, because I find it kind of entertaining. I like listening to this guy and his storys, I really have to laugh about how he is promoting himself.But if you're no big fan of Hellmuth, don't get fooled to buy this dvd.. it has no valuable information - not even for absolute beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Million Dollar Secrets!?

It is 360, but the board stands on its own because the bottom is only slightly rounded. I had to lean to make it require balancing rather than it requiring constant balancing just to stand. Nothing wrong, just not what I thought it would be. Maybe a balance rating would help. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being a disk over a ball), balance needed here is about a 2 -- probably for safety, but not very challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding bang for your buck...","review":"I was thinking of buying the Bosu Board which has a rubber ball on the bottom for more instability but costs almost 8 times as much!Instead I found this board at Walmart (sold as \\"Gold's Gym Balance Board\\") for the same thirteen bucks and have been very pleased with it. No it's not quite as demanding as the megabuck Bosu Board, but it's plenty hard for someone just starting out with this kind of training. I figure if I really stick with it and get better, maybe then I'll reward myself with the more pricey Bosu board, but if I get sick of it and it ends up collecting dust in a corner for the rest of my days then it's just the price of two six packs of beer, heh.I do have to agree with one of the other reviewers that the instructions could be much better detailed, but oh well I'm sure you can find more exercises for this thing on the Internet...God bless Google!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It has a flat bottom!","review":"This product looked promising until I tried it out. I got on and expected the kind of wobbling I get at the physical therapist office. What I got was 3 inches taller. The bottom of this wobble board has a flat about the size of a quarter! I do not have above average balance (otherwise why would I be going to physical therapy). All this requires is that you can stand relatively still, and you won't budge until the little bumps on the board hurt your feet. And yes, I like to use my wobble board barefoot. I am in my house, after all, and I feel shoes assist me by giving me more contact area with the board, lessening the value of the workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great workout item.","review":"The product isn't a good workout method at all, the one with the ball underneath is better.This is just a knock off brand, I'm returning as i text."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for balance","review":"we've been using this in the house and it is always good for balance. we also have a twister."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleadinng","review":"I ordered a wobble balance board from Everyting Fitness and it came from Karate Depot and doesn't even look like the product I ordered.

Dead bodies pile up in Rockaway NY but no cops seem to exist in this silly pulp action film with no plot other than a march to the death by an Afgahanistan vet bent on avenging his girlfriend's stabbing. He gets his eyeballs poked out with a sharp knife by one of the many bad guys, but barely bleeds, manages to walk away and then, later, to singlehandedly shoot everyone else dead while blind!

I replaced the metal band with a rubber strap to have a less formal, everyday sporty watch. I wear it in the pool a lot. One note: the face is a DARK blue, approaching black. In fact, in lower lighting it appears black. I thought it would be BLUER. Not a major issue but I have several other black-dial watches and wanted this one to set apart. It keeps great time and IMO is worth every bit of the price ($135)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch - good value","review":"Watch is very nice looking. However, one of the fixed link (not removable) came loose after a couple weeks of normal wearing. Amazon quickly processed exchange order and got new one after a few days.

However, the watch band kept falling apart. A jeweler could usually fix it, either for free or at minimal cost, but this time some parts went missing. I contacted Bulova for a replacement band, and it's eighty-five bucks plus tax and shipping. Too much money -- I'm ditching this watch, and here's why:I'm ditching it because it's too beaten and scratched up to be worth the investment. Both the glass, and the blue paint on the bezel, are seriously marred by scratches and dings. If the watch still looked great, or even good, I'd spring for the band. It looks like crap, and I'm very disappointed in how this watch has held up, after only four years of normal usage.I thought that by spending more for a watch, I was purchasing durability. I was wrong. It's just another piece of shoddy, throwaway junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money...","review":"Bulova was once the watch I always bought but after 7 months of wearing this Marine star watch the seal broke and water started seeping in.

Not much to add since most of the other reviews have it right. The blue dial is a little darker than the picture. A lot of people mentioned the bracelet being huge. This is correct and a little disappointing since you take it out of the box and can't use it right away unless you know how to remove links. I went to my local mall for this. To give you an idea, I'm a pretty big guy and they had to remove 4 links for a perfect fit. I also like its heavy feel. Setting the day and date isn't hard if you follow the instructions. I especially like the screw down crown that insures no water getting in. I've always been a Seiko customer and this is my first Bulova. I recommend this watch and would buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a quality watch.","review":"I purchased this watch several years ago. It never kept good time.

Nothing. Put the batteries in another device to make sure the batteries were okay. Put the bulb in a flashlight to make sure the bulb was okay. Everything checked out, but I could not get this thing to work. Then I went to work trying to figure out how this slide viewer got its juice. I was able to discern that a connection was not being made and I bent one of the copper connectors so the existing gap was no longer there. I got it working but, really, this is a VERY poorly made product and the electrical design looks like something out of the early days of electricity. Now that I have it working, the image of the slides is slightly distorted and not bright enough. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very flimsy! Overpriced!","review":"I also had problems with the battery connection on this product. It took my engineer father two hours of playing with the connections and finally jerryrigging it to get the light to come on. Also, the on/off button doesn't stay pressed down to keep the light on. In general, the construction of the unit is just cheap; it's lightweight plastic that I expected to be much heavier. The images look okay in the viewer, but I was surprised that so much of the viewing area is taken up by the border of the slide.

The 52 minutes go by quickly.The best part about this video is that the exercises are easy to figure out. I normally hate aerobics, but the aerobic warm up here is simple and gets the heart pumping right away.Greg Smithey is friendly and encouraging. I like the ordinary-looking people behind him who are able to keep up without grimacing in pain; that gave me hope for myself.

My butt is definitely stronger, and my inner and outer thighs even look better.This was a total miracle. I never thought this would work so fast! But it delivers results.Though the exercises get easier each day, my butt is still sore by the end.

This video is my absolute favorite. You don't have to learn dance moves or even be coordinated to do these exercises, yet you will get a great workout. I still continue to do this video once per week (in addition to walking) to stayed toned. I do believe that this video deserves most of the credit for the fact that I do not have cottage cheese puckers on the back of my legs at the age of 37.

It was hard when I was in shape and it will be hard to re-visit it. I also remember trying it with a few hockey players and they could not finish it and they use their legs and glutes all the time. It was almost hillarious. I only remember this video as the most toning of all. You do not get out of breath, your legs singe. If you are looking for pure toning video not assocaited with hype and celebrity, this is the video for you. You gotta like the price as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really? Buns of Steel?","review":"First, it is funny to see the style of the '80's. Wow! What were we thinking?I do like the instructor Greg, but the workout is an all over body workout and doesn't focus on the buns as the title claims it does.The speed at which the exercises are done, leg lifts, etc. are done at a rather fast pace and though it's okay, personally I think the pace could and should be slowed down a bit. So I played the 'floor segment' in slo-motion and found that it was much better. (I don't do the other portions.) You get the burn either way but with the slo-mo you have more control of your movements and less chance of feeling an ache or pain in your joints.I say $20 is a bit steep for the quality of this work-out. I'm sure there are better bun workout DVDs out there and so my quest continues......"},{"rating":"1","title":"yuk","review":"The tape I received was not working right. It was old and dirty. Also, I was suppose to receive a 'new' version of it and it obviously was not new. Not to mention when I pushed 'play' on the vcr the workout was on the credits. I had to send it back.

Unfortunately it got lost so I had to get a new one. When it came in the mail the outside cover was right but the tape inside wasn't at all what I ordered. Written in blue market it had \\"Scooby Doo\\" across the top and side of the tape. When I actually put it in it wasn't Buns of Steel or Scooby Doo. It was a 1995 taping of MTV (80's music videos to be exact). No one even looked at the tape before they sent it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More than just buns","review":"I thought BUNS OF STEEL would concentrate on exercises to improve your posterior. While it indeed teaches several such exercises, the video also takes you through other moves not related to your lower half. It seems as though the filmmakers shot a workout class and later decided to market it as a glutes-exercise video.Other BUNS OF STEEL reviews correctly point out the instructor's non-stop patronizing chatter. Too bad he didn't discuss basic information, such as recommending how often to exercise or injury prevention.BUNS OF STEEL lasts for about an hour with no breaks. I would have preferred if they followed the lead of the excellent Tamilee Webb video tape ABS OF STEEL, which guides you through three 10-minute routines, one routine per day.There may be better glute exercise tapes out there. But you can learn a few things from BUNS OF STEEL, despite its flaws. Bottoms up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How are we supposed to like this video?","review":"What is this video doing? Oh, the 80s music was great! NOT. The instructor was GREAT! NOT. GO to the 8 minute things cause those are waaay better, you don't get some instructor in a skimpy outfit with bad clothes.

I was there the day they shot the video..Those were my friends and I LOVED them all!!!..YES...It was 1987....THE clothes were horrible and yes...HE did have a \\"curl,\\" but who cares. If you took the SAME exercises today and did them in class, which I sometimes do, you will see that they are effective and they are hard. Now that we are all so much more educated and we have core training and sport specific training etc....sometimes getting back to the \\"basics\\" of lots and lots of reps and different angles is a REFRESHING change!They waited for years to review it and raked it over the coals and I thought it was very unfair, and yet today it's STILL a favorite....Get over the clothes and the hair and the music and get a great workout....LOL!!:)Have fun!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a really dated video, but the workout is great","review":"This workout was done way back in 1987 and it looks like it. The music is really bad and the clothing is even worse. I think that there was a guy with jheri curls in there! Anyway, even though the video is dated, the workout is excellent. Beginners probably will have a hard time completing the video, but it gets a bit easier when you do it on a consistent basis. I could not even lift my legs the first time that I did this workout.

You have to be careful with both of these or you could hurt your knees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective -- as hard as you want it to be","review":"I tried working out to this (my wife's video) a couple of times a few years ago. At the time I was in great shape doing triathlons and weight training, so I was more than a little sceptical -- however I must admit it does work, at least it can produce the good muscle burn that I normally associate with weight training. It will also work for you no matter how fit or unfit you are, since you control how hard you contract your muscles the fitter you are the harder you can contract your muscles. This is equivalent to a well focused weights session. These days, pilates or yoga is probably more fashionable ... but this works."},{"rating":"2","title":"oldy but goody","review":"this video (filled with '80s outfits!) will kick your a$$ literally!

Just average but have buns of pudding! I can absolutely feel this working. I normally give up after the first couple times on any workout, but I found myself craving that feeling of this exercise! Weird! I read a review or two about only doing the floor portion and that's what I've been doing. I don't like exercise to begin with so I didn't want to burn myself out. I'm already noticing a slight change, and for me, that's when and where I get my motivation. I am going to stick with it.

Make your fun, wage your complaints, but you'll never hear anyone who actually used the video complain that it did not produce results!Anyone who gives this video less stars because its dated or corny is doing a disservice to the women who could benefit from the workout.

I'm now 44 and still in shape thanks to the great start I got with this video. This, along with the famous Jane Fonda video, was one of my first and still one of the best. I am so happy it is now available on DVD. I used to do this video three times a week and was able to do a split up to my mid thirties when I switched to other videos. I've tried numerous programs, even Tamilee Webb's series and the various Rodney Yee yoga workouts. Nothing compares to the lower body workout from this old video. Once you learn the routine, you can turn down the sound and play music if his annoying (and weird) comments turn you off!

I actually stopped doing the tape at one point because I was afraid that I was losing too much of my buns!!! :D It is an awesome tape and I haven't found another that works quite this good or fast!

I'm an avid exerciser, and even this tape made we wince a few times when I first tried it (I do tae-bo and other advanced workouts)--it really IS fun to watch the 80ish-styled people and the instructor himself; he's very HAPPY and often humerous, which is good for workouts (boredom is not what you want during workouts)...all of the previous reviewers are right--this video may be dated, but it works, and that's what we want it to do...I certainly don't mind laughing at the tape while my buns are burning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is still Kickass!","review":"This is by far one of the hardest and most challenging workouts that anybody can ever try!

This film was very well made and the acting was quite good. The story line was superb. The story builds up in the beginning and then there is this great big ending. I liked this movie a lot, although the fighting was a bit strange because it was hard to believe that one man could fight off 10 different attackers at one time. However, with that in mind it was kind of like 300 but not really, the fighting was obviously different. all in all a good movie, check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"13 assassins","review":"This dvd is very gruesome unlike most samurai movies there is an element of sadistic behavior involved. i purchased this dvd from amazon because it was not available on netflix.

You go to the listed website but it then redirects you back to iTunes in order to enter your redemption code. The movie is then downloaded (not included on an extra disk). The download took 1hr+ since I don't have a cable connection but other than that, the download process was easy.I was a little worried when I didn't see any caption/subtitle options, however the subtitles are burned-in and the audio is Japanese.

I watched all 2 hrs. of this movie waiting for it to morph into my kinda of movie, but unfortunately for me it never happened. The Man from Nowhere morphed and I would highly recommend it (over 13 Assassins) and it was all in Korean with English subtitles. Hence, you know it had to have been a better movie.

Oh, my!","review":"I was a bit hesitant to order a samurai film made by Takashi Miike; placing razor sharp, 3 foot steel blades into the hands of a director whose previous films have turned hot grease and piano wire into the stuff nightmares are made of just didn't sound like a very good idea to me. As it turns out, I was VERY wrong...13 Assassins is without a doubt my favorite film from 2011. Miike has created a classic samurai film filled with action, great characters, and the best good-guys vs bad-guys movie vibe I've seen in a long time. Although very violent at times, the gross out factor is practically non-existant.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I will be frugal in my review.

The fighting starts at about two minutes after the halfway point and THEN DOESN'T STOP UNTIL CREDITS ROLL! I was soooooooooo happy.

(It gives a new perspective to sword swallowing.)The film is interesting, a bit of fun, with lots of ugly death shown in beautiful color, but despite having six more samurai than the great \\"Seven Samurai,\\" if you want one view of Japanese films, stay with the true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is a great movie, I recommend any movie fan to watch it.

I've seen hundreds of different Yakuza/Samurai movies and when compared to them, there are simply better movies to be found.13 Assassins does 2 things right as far as casting excellent actors for the movie and the cinematography is amazing. However the movie's downsides are blatant use of CG, why would you make such a beautiful picture only to ruin it with horrible Computer animations? Also the movie feels rushed, the character development is made unlike something like the 7 samurai where the build up each supporting character, no one really cares about their deaths which makes this movie fall short.If this is your first samurai film, yes it will be amazing and thats why this one is rated so high however there are better works to be seen like izo, Lone wolf and cub, and the 7 samurai just to start. Veterans like myself will be disappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"DISTURBING IMAGES!!!","review":"This movie could have easily been perfect, 5 Stars. The disgusting images very early on in the film should have been scrapped! I know the director wanted to convey just how evil Naritsugu really was. But, some things you can allude to without showing. The samurai plot is great, the actors are spot on, the sets are all awesome! Great action movie, but I don't know if you want the women and children to ever see this... With that said, this is easily the best and probably the most accurate portrayal of Feudal Japan on film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good atmosphere but misses depth and realism","review":"This movie is trying to be great, but is kind of ridiculous. It is a tried and true plot (read: seen it), and the reliance on violence at the end would work if a) there wasn't an endless supply of enemies that far outnumber the amount there were supposed to be, b) the one who was hacked and killed didn't spring back at the end a la Monty Python with a flesh wound, and c) the fighting didn't go on, and on, and on, with enemies pausing and waiting for the heroes to turn back to face and kill them. There is such overacting and the outcome is so predictable (minus the dead guy appearing at the end) that it's really not worth the time, and doesn't do justice to the effort with the scenery. I would have liked more subtlety in both the acting and the story, and less gratuitous, unrealistic, and unimaginative violence at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kind of Movie","review":"After Ninja Assassin, I didn't think I would find a more recent movie depicting martial arts at its finest.

The diversity of male subjects captured in the book is exceptional and all are stunningly presented. Bondi Urban is a grittier, more sexually charged work than the others Paul has produced - there appears more frontal nudity in this one, and some of the photographs depict a level of eroticism that I have not seen anywhere else. As ever, the subjects are characterised by their truthfulness; beautiful, rugged, hairy males casually undertaking a range of 'everyday' activities. There is, however, nothing everyday about their impact upon the reader - they are stunning. If this book does not make you a life-long fan of Paul Freeman, and make you rush out to buy the others in the series, than I guess nothing will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly overated and recycled crap","review":"I can't believe people(mostly kids) think this garbage is \\"great\\", these idiots are blatant rip offs of Nirvana, hell even one song i heard by this \\"band\\" sounded just like, with one tiny little difference, Nirvana's \\"Come as You Are\\", and that sad poor excuse for \\"rock\\"song or \\"nu-metal\\"song,whatever crappy ass label MTV wants to give them, called \\"fine again\\" or something like that was so freakin weak and patheticly boring, no real climax in the song what so ever, i mean damn it just goes to show you don't need much \\"talent\\" to make it in the music BUSINESS nowadays"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied Customer","review":"Naturally ordering unseen product on-line makes me a little nervous.

It's amazing how easily groups cash-in by stringing together a few power chords, looping a few sound clips, and having some producer slice-and-dice the whole mess into a formulated 'hit'. The first thing I wondered when I heard this song was whether or not these posers could actually sing a song beginning to end.This song is a prime example of why listeners should educate their ears and demand more from a tired, uninspired recording industry.

None of the characters become worthy of our empathy or even sympathy.

Her creative spirit and extraordinary lyricism shine through the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Memoir of India under the Raj","review":"Rumer Godden's fiction has been widely admired by critics and the public alike, so the opportunity to read her own personal story was a welcome one. What a life! After \\"Two under the Indian Sun,\\" the early childhood autobiography by Rumer and sister Jon Godden, this sequel did not disappoint. Anyone interested in English and/or Indian history between and during the World Wars will find this an evocative and fascinating story of a woman surviving and making her way in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rumer Godden's memoir, part one","review":"I've been reading Rumer Godden's work since I was a junior in high school so was curious about this first half of her memoir. It reads like her novels--very easy language, descriptions depicting India feel like I can see it through her eyes. A very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not care for the writing style","review":"I bought this book because I thought it would give me more insight into what it was like to live in a hill station in India as I am very interested in that part of the world.

Intelligent rap? Please, Madonna's rap in American life has a wider rang of social criticism... The \\"music\\" is really a pain for the ear. This band was propably made of drunk, miserable, pathetic, \\"jackasses\\" who think they kissed god (full on the lips) by posing \\"ghetto\\" and real like: \\"Oooh, Lindsay Lohan iss wack, we are hooligans, we are soooooooo coooool!\\" That's just not the way guys, sorry.

The new version also embraces a modern interactive technology. It's really cool! The text is fluent and consistent because a single author wrote all the chapters. However, its drawback is that the author can't know all the things. This is contrast to other reputated textbooks such as Molecular Biology of the Cell, Principles of Neural Science, etc., written by multiple authors who have expertises in each chapter. Developmental biology has expanded and now covers evolution, plants, and even behavior. I think Dr. Scott Gilbert is a genius. But I can't believe he can handle all of these stuffs. It's time to ask some people to write each chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely beyond words!","review":"This soundtrack really conveys the emotional rollercoaster that was apparent in the movie.

I was only disappointed with Kate Winslett's missing voice on The Dreame and Weep You No More Sad Fountains. Although Jane Eagle has a beautiful voice I don't feel that her version portrayed the the character as she developed from love sick young girl to the mature-melancholy woman that develops at the end of the picture. I sure wish you could have captured the true vocals of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graceful Soundtrack","review":"This soundtrack took a while to grow on me but its graceful and gentile quality are quite soothing and provide a relaxing background. Its ethereal quality is quite pleasing and I often play this on drives through the countryside on weekends. This was a good find and I am now recognizing the various tracks as I watch the film. This is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Soundtrack About Love and Loss","review":"This is a fabulous soundtrack to complement a movie with great acting. Patrick Doyle's composition is deeply moving. It taught me how therapeutic music can be.My favorite track is #19, \\"There is Nothing Lost.\\" If you have ever lost someone you truly cared about, I recommend listening to it. The music is sad and touching to the soul, when it's fragile and especially sensitive. At the same time however, it has a sense of resonance, of moving on, and of personal triumph against depression and loneliness. I give it a five-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong measurements","review":"This says 3 and 1/2 inch inlet. I took it out of the box, and much to my shagrin, the inlet is 2 and 7/8 inches. Considering my tailpipes are 3 inches, I was quite annoyed. Even the length in the description is wrong. It says 9 inches, yet, once again....take it out of the box and it's 8 and 3/4 inches. Very odd measurement system used by this manufacturer. I'm not positive they really know what an \\"inch\\" actually is. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A romance story that is as real as it can get","review":"This is my favorite; a rare, witty, believable, up-to-date romance by Candace Schuler (sorry, it wasn't Candace Bushnell, my mistake). Typical of Candace's style of writing, the main characters (Natalie the private investigator, investigating Lucas the computer security expert, on her brother's business partner murder) are so natural, extremely witty and explicitly described, giving them depth, and bringing the characters alive. But what I like best about the story is it explores a modern woman's need to feel secure about her own capabilities - careerwise or otherwise, and judgements. I cannot say this to the majority of romance books. There's no apparent logic flaw in this story. Recommended for collection. It is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Galloping Ghosts!","review":"Mark Nesbitt's series, Ghosts of Gettysburg (five volumes), consists of some of the best paranormal journalism I haveever read in years. These books actually kept me awake nights.I have never been to Gettysburg, Pa, but Mr. Nesbitt makesyou feel as if you are there, complete with all it's colorfulhistory, and it's hauntings.

When I first went as a 8 year old I didn't believe in ghosts but after taking their \\"Candelight ghost walks\\" I instantly became obsessed with ghosts. When I say this I speak of all 6 or so books, they each contain easy to read, but powerful stories that sometimes keep you up at night. (Especially when you read the books at Gettysburg!)Mark Nesbitt grew up in Lorain, Ohio so my mom knows him and he knows a lot about ghosts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I agree with all of the other reviewers, these are great books, even if you just want to learn about the battle itself. The ammount of research that went into these books is amazing, and well worth it. I am a Civil War buff, and am constantly going back to the books to look up stories. I would recommend it to everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've bought better","review":"Basically just word of mouth folk lore.

Hopefully this book will be in one of the book shops in Gettysburg when I visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Mark is a great author and this book is what gave me an interest in the paranormal. He weaves the history of Gettysburg into each story and makes you want to visit the battlefield and experience it yourself. If you are planning a visit to Gettysburg, read this book and it will enhance your experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is like a soap opera SPOOF.","review":"Assuming you've already read the book description, I won't rehash the plot, as it would just make me dizzy. So many things going on, so many coincidences, so many unlikable characters. Still, I kept reading, knowing that the author was going to have somehow make these people redeem themselves. And they do, sort of. By the end of the book everyone was happy. That is, everyone except for me.When I picked the book up, it was just for light reading. The description was cute. But the angry, vindictive main character turned me off right from the beginning. There were many times I wondered how the editor, let alone the author, could read this book and think it plausible enough to be published. Talk about twisting a plot. This book was much too contrived to be believed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing but no substance","review":"If shallowness could speak, this book would roar. Family dysfunction, selfishness, and intimate secrets have their literary places, but this book misses the boat. Full of preposterous coinicidences, underdeveloped characterers, and a foul-mouthed rather hopeless heroine, I would say a light beach read, but no more. The \\"lessons on life\\" were too trite to carry much weight. If looking for a view from heaven, check out Lovely Bones, but this one is very skippable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly entertaining","review":"I'm not even done yet and I cannot wait to find out what happens - you just know Shelby is going to find a heart.

I woke up early in the morning (before work) just to have time to read. It was a really quick read that conjured emotions from me. Some parts I liked so much I read twice. Being a Jewish girl, from the same area of the globe, who also lost a parent, and who also moved away from her family -- I could relate to several aspects of this book. The late mom's connection with her family was how I imagine my deceased dad affects my own family.

An outdoor antenna is not practical, so I did some research to learn if there were radios out there that got really good reception. This one kept coming up, as did the Boston Acoustic Recepter radio. I chose this one because quite frankly, it's just gorgeous. But it has brains as well as beauty. I am now listening to NPR with a full, clear sound free of static and noise. When I first set it up, I was still getting a little static, but when I moved the cord just a tad, it went away and has been crystal clear ever since. I never even had to attach the antenna (it comes with an antenna cord too).

Our family really liked the other safety dvd better but safe-side super chick is her super self in this internet safety dvd as well. The other dvd is much more genuine and I'd highly recommend it. This one is better for older kids due to the fact that they tried to dub characters such as Napoleon Dynamite and the Crocodile Hunter. This dvd is still \\"S-W-E-E-T\\" and gives kids practical ways to stay safe while using the computer such as never give out your personal information such as your name and address, etc. and never agree to meet anyone in person who you have chatted with online because they may not be who they say they are online and really could mean you harm. This dvd is fairly short and allows kids to hear this important stay safe information from someone other than just mom and dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information","review":"This is a great platform to start talking to your kids about internet safety.

I'm a math graduate student in pure math, and this text is used for a graduate-level probability course in the applied math department.

I hate this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor choice for any class or self study","review":"I am using this book in a graduate level probability theory class and I cannot recommend it.

Proofs are left to the reader or completed in one line without explanation, even in the solutions manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"This may be a good reference book for probability but certainly IS NOT recommended for someone who is just starting out with the topic. There is not much explanation of theories or concepts, examples are few. The exercises appear useful but without a good chapter behind the exercises, the exercises by themselves are of no use. The accompanying 1000 exercises is also written in the same manner. There is very little attempt to go down to the level of a beginner student, the authors appear to be so deeply immersed in the subject that they have forgotten what it is like when you encounter it for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably a good reference, not good for teaching","review":"This book was not much help when it came to learning probability and random processes. Many of the concepts that are explained lack sufficient examples to drive home the ideas, topics are presented and the next topic is discussed. When examples were given, key points seemed to be omitted that would have helped to illustrate the example. I won't argue that this is a good book for reference because it seems you should have a good grounding in probability and random process theory before picking up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating and confusing","review":"This is among the most confusing and frustrating books I have ever been forced to use. The examples are useless. Problems in chapter 6 require material in chapter 8 to solve.If you already know everything in the book and need a reference, you *might* have some use for it, otherwise don't bother.Come to think of it, it's probably not even a good reference. You can't find anything because definitions are hidden in the text with nothing to help you find them easily.

The OEM shocks, which were gas charged, never bottomed out on the same speed bumps.Unfortunately, Amazon's return policy states I could only return them up to April 6, so I'm out the money I spent on these incorrectly labeled (not gas) shocks, which clearly are not a quality product, else I would not bottom out over the small speed bumps as they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good detailed book on iron shirt","review":"This is a very detailed instruction book on Iron Shirt Chi Gung Part 1. Iron Shirt Chi Gung has 3 levels, and this covers level 1 which must be mastered before going to level 2 and 3. The aim of level 1 is to correct and improve your posture, strenghten your internal organs by packing 'chi' around them, strenghten tendons, muscle etc. Also, it teaches you the types of energizing breaths. Master Chia has written a very detailed book that's clear and easy to undetstand. However, to master this, you may have to get the video as well. You should read this book (which has a lot of pictures and illustrations), understand the principles, then look at the video to model his postures etc correctly.

This can be seen with the continuity of thought throughout the book.As an owner of the book, I would recommend one of Yang Jwing-ming's books on chi-kung, or \\"Qigong Empowerment\\". I am afraid that this book works too much on elaboration of very simple nei gung (mind energy direction) than giving more useful information.Just as well this book is good for beginners though, and the book if you follow it will help you to achieve.Look forward to spending at least an hour every day or kiss iron shirt goodbye.So this is neither a good or a bad book, yet after a while of trining you will realize it is all in the mind and that is what the training is all about, 'improving neural connections for strength training'.

In the 80's I had watched Stacey as the hot, hunky Mike Hammer on tv. I had fantasized about what Stacey looked like in the nude. This movie ended my wonder. Stacey bares his not only his ass, but the family jewels, too. He is stripped naked and paraded down a public street. The rest of the movie was itself okay. It's a B-movie, so expectations should be set for a B-movie.

My only complaint is that sometimes because of it frequencies it interfers with other wireless equipment that is near the same frequency.

I've watched this guy rise through the ranks and I must say that he has fallen off a little. I much prefer his older material to the jokes on this CD, but perhaps I'm being a bit to critical. This CD does have its memorable jokes and its forgettable ones. Sometimes it seemed like there was filler material on here. Those who have listened to Dane Cook are extremely polarized, they either love his delivery or hate it. I happen to like it so i think this CD is still very good. In my opinion, the comedian with the best delivery is Daniel Tosh. His non-sequeters and random remarks are extremely hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dane Cook has done it again","review":"I saw Dane Cook live about two years ago and alot of his act was not on any previous albums, until now. Retaliation is a rollercoaster of laughs through the entire cd. His blend of satire and humerous choice of words will have any comedy fan rolling in their seats. I for one am very happy for his success and would recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...but not quite great","review":"I bought this CD/DVD set based on a TIME magazine article I'd read about it, which said it was the best-selling comedy album since Steve Martin's Wild and Crazy Guy in 1978. Prior to reading that article, I had never seen or even heard of Dane Cook.That said, I have to say that I'm glad I made the purchase, but I don't think it is good enough to have earned the above distinction. Cook is funny, and his style is unique, but I can think of several comedians off the top of my head who are funnier. The first one that comes to mind is the late great Mitch Hedberg, whose CD/DVD probably has 2-3 times as many laugh-out-loud moments.This set has lots of stuff--the two CDs are funny, and the DVD is packed full of good and great bits (though the Comedy Central Roast bit was pretty bad), particularly the Crank Yankers stuff. Overall I'd say it is worth the price. The set is good...maybe even very good, but not quite great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial Garbage","review":"Dane Cook is a master at self promotion. This explains why his core audience is 12-25 year olds, a group known for being susceptible to marketing, especially when the marketing is done by a wildly gyrating, occasionally amusing stand up comic who 'speaks their language'. I'm truly astounded at all the people on Amazon and elsewhere who call Dane Cook \\"Brilliant\\" or \\"Original\\". The man has blatantly stolen from half a dozen comics over the years, a charge he repeatedly has denied. I can understand liking him if you're into myspace and don't really care about messy stuff like current events or politics, or dont really like \\"the dead guy\\" (bill hicks) or \\"the old guy\\" (george carlin) but this is low, low comedic fare for anyone who has heard GOOD comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dane Cook is Hilarious","review":"I bought this cd/dvd combo because I owned Dane Cooks \\"Harmful if Swallowed\\" and love his style. Although I was a bit disappointed that the only features on the dvd were snippets from other shows I am glad they put them on there, however I was expected a longer stage performance. I will say this though I enjoy both cd and dvd and would recommend for a Dane Cook fan or anyone who loves to laugh. I laughed so hard I cried and couldn't breathe which is my kind of comedy!!

It may not be funny from start to finish but I would have to say it is better than the last one.I think people fail to realize that Dane is a story teller when it comes to his jokes. The thing that makes it so good is that he tells them so well that you can visualize the situations he talks about because Im sure that alot of people can relate to him in some way or another!!!I listen to it maybe 3 to 4 times a week and it still has me laughing out loud!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, i also recommend \\"Harmful if Swallowed\\"","review":"There is no real way to describe dane cook. In my opinion he is one of the funniest comedians alive today. You really need to experience it for yourself. And for $13.29 with supersaver shipping (amazon price at time of review) i highly highly recommend it.If you enjoyed harmful if swallowed and his comedy central presents special, you will love this one too. This set comes with 2 full length cd's (about 50 minutes each) and a dvd. The cd's are just as good as his first, with a few more raunchy parts. The dvd is not as good as the one included in harmful if swallowed in my opinion. There is a lot less straight standup, only one short scene of it. The majority of the dvd is devoted to his crank yanker and shorties watching shorties appearances. These are also very funny, but i was hoping for more standup. There are also some excerpts from his tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny, but profane","review":"Dane is hilarious, I have to give him that. His material is funny, and then when he laughs at it himself, it makes you laugh even harder because his LAUGH is even funny. However, some of his material is rather graphic and uncalled for, and the explicit language/profanity makes me wish he could tone it down a bit. Brian Regan is my favorite comic, and it is pretty obvious that Dane is familiar with him, because he mimics him at times. The difference between the two (Dane isn't any funnier) is that Brian manages to keep it clean, yet he still \\"kills\\". Dane does good comedy, but it's definitely R-rated.In closing, I wouldn't recommend listening to this CD while driving. First of all, it could cause you to laugh so hard that you lose control, and second of all, when you reach your destination you will have deep laugh lines around your mouth. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"About 20 mins worth of funny stuff...","review":"and the rest is just filler. I think Dane's halarious, but this CD honestly had me nodding off. A lot of the jokes were so drawn out and boring that by the end, you forget how it started, and therefore don't get the punchline (upon repeated listening, it wasn't that funny anyway). It's really a shame to have so much of Dane and so little of it be funny.

His setups are too long for so-so payoffs.Listen to the audience on these discs - not a lot laughs per minute ratio. Comedy is a very subjective taste but I recommend checking out Mitch Hedberg or Dmitri Martin instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dane Cook","review":"Dane Cook's latest CD, Retaliation, took awhile to get into. I love all of his old stuff, so although I was excited for his new CD to come out, I wasn't heading out to Best Buy the day it came out or anything if you know what I mean. I listened to it the first time and I didn't think it was that great, although I did laugh most of the time. It wasn't until a heard it again that really started to enjoy it. My friends and I have, what we like to call, Dane Cook-offs where we try to out do each other with his jokes. This CD has turned out to be hilarious and I just think Dane Cook is awesome. He is so crazy and wild on stage that it's entertaining to just watch the man. He is my favorite comedian, and I can't wait to see what he comes up with next."},{"rating":"1","title":"His first CD was way better","review":"I loved Harmful if Swallowed, but this CD just sucks. I don't think I laughed at all during both of the CDs, and the extra DVD content isn't that funny either. I would pass on this one if you're not sure to spend the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The CT 2004...","review":"I love Dane Cook. He is the best comedian out there today. The subjects he talks about deal with everyday life and some you would never think about in your wildest dreams. You can usually relate to most of them. Everything is totally original.Although most of his shenanigans are absolutely hilarious, some are only for mature audiences so I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone under 13. Also, I think a few of his jokes are there just so he can get girls. Like when he says, \\"When you tell me stories, I really listen! I don't just hear you, I HEAR you.\\"The only other negative thing about this awesome comedy CD is the DVD, which has a few of Dane's Comedy Central appearences which are very disappointing, especially the Roast.If you are in a difficult time in your life, pick up a copy of this CD. It is sure to cheer you up. Because laughter is something the world needs in these times of crisis."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed it, but....","review":"This is a very funny cd. It has a lot of one-liners and is very entertaining. I would say it is funnier than Harmful if Swallowed. HOWEVER, if it was just as long as Harmful, Harmful would be better. Because there are SO MANY JOKES and the CD is over 100 minutes long, it basically has to be funnier.. This is a very funny cd tho, nonetheless. But, and this is a pretty big but, Harmful was one of those cd's you could listen and listen and listen and listen and listen to and it would never get boring, never get old, even if you've memorized it. Retaliation is different. You listen to it twice or so and it's not really funny anymore. However, this cd is very funny and I reccomend picking it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny!!!","review":"I have bought many comedy CD's and usually find at least a few bits to be funny.

His animated performance is kind of all he has, i imagine that he doesnt spend much time sitting around re writing his jokes and homing his skills, the fact is, is he has a great 'in your face' delivery for the younger generation and young college girls want to have sex with him.But once you get a little older and have been exposed to quite a few comedians that really spend time writing smart jokes, MR Cook will make you cringe with the despleasure of remembering that you once thought he was anything more than a passing fad...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this CD sucks.","review":"I've heard a lot of comedy CD's in my time, but this one takes the cake, the frosting, the ice cream, and the birthday party for being one of the worst.

I needed to cover up some cat claw prick marks on my leather barstools. They are black, so I didn't have to worry about color mixing.

The second thing to go wrong was when I cleaned off the stools several days later during my routine housework. Using a normal, soft dishcloth, wet and well wrong out, no cleaning product on it at all, just plain water, I lightly wiped off my barstools, and there went my new shiny polkadots. All the leather repair rubbed right off like thin plastic. The best thing I can say is that the claw marks are still there and I am right back where I started.

That application worked much better. Overall, the product is probably better suited for scratches than holes or rips.

It seems to hold the temperature fairly steady around 75-76F, which is slightly lower than I would prefer but better than an unheated tank in a northern winter. There aren't that many options for small tanks.My only complaint is that fitting it into such a small tank was a bit of a logistical fiasco; by the time I added the suction cup, it was nearly as tall as the tank itself (and there's not enough room for it under the gravel, either).

But the commercial was how I was introduced to this album, and for that I am glad. Jenkins says that he was inspired by Palladio the Renaissance architect. I too find Palladio's fastidious application of symmetry to be rather satisfying and sense this symmetry in Jenkins' clean work.

I have to admit that I'm still drawn to the femininity of the period but I have my dreams and you have yours and we'll leave it at that. This is a good book for the money.

The writer tried to make her seem headstrong and strong willed but she was really just rather stupid to provoke men who were much more powerful than she so openly.

Nothing outlandish here.Ms. Battle has been called the most beautiful soprano voice and I would heartily agree. The clarity, the roundness, the beauty of her sound is pure femininity and grace.

They're all in there. What's more, Norman barely tells us why the are actually on his list and the entries themselves not insightful at all and just plain dull. Sure, he says ground breaking techniques, superb acting top notch script and genius directors, a film that others have copied since its release, but rarely says anything about their entertainment value or why he personally loves them so much.

Upon further reading, I was lead to believe that it would be six pages. After spending six bucks on it, I found that it was barely three. The first to pages were simply the Harvard Review title, and the rest were half covered with pictures of Parcells. Everything Parcells says is true and informative, but it's so short of an article that I feel a little ripped off. Players and employees appreciate honesty, I've played on crappy teams and a good one, and the coaches on the good one weren't afraid to tell me if I sucked. Likewise, I've had the chance to work for a myth by modern standards, a highly sucessful small business. The owner of that taught me a valuiable lesson, better to be upfront and honest than to meddle in deception. This is a good article, but I have a sick feeling that if I just googled around, I could of found it for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be a Parcell's fan","review":"Unless you are diehard Parcell's fan this book will not give you any coaching gems other than over the top personal stories of motivation through intimidation. I was impossibly looking for a secret outside of the standard work harder approach. In Parcell's I found it. Work harder, while micromanaging, and threatening everyone around you, until success is achieved then jump ship when the boat eventually sinks, (as that kind of environment can not exist in the long term), and go on to create the same hostile environment somewhere else. While Parcell's is innovative and a sound offensive/defensive mind, his management style is similar to Brian Bosworths playing style, (i.e. Get in, get as much money/success as you can in a short amount of time, get out)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sakar Digital Camera AC Adapter","review":"I bought this adapter for my Canon PowerShot G9 to take timed exposures.

Down through the ages, it has been adapted to many uses, especially for philosophical speculation by the scholar and for forecasting the future by the layman. The scholar would more likely prefer the editions by Edward Shaughnessy or Richard John Lynn which have extensive annotations and footnotes--not meant for practical daily divination. This edition, by Palmer/Kwok/O'Brien, is a wonderful popular version for the layman, and a practical one adaptable for daily usage, in the same vein as \\"The Illustrated I Ching\\" by R. L. Wing. It has a very good introduction as background material, and a clear explanation of the three-coin and yarrow stalk methods.

I thought his remarks on the architecture of the \\"cathedrals of consumption\\" were also very important. The most unsettling aspect of the book was Ritzer's comparison of modern styles of consumption with religious institutions, and even the conformity of religious institutions to this new means of consumption (i.e., the mega-churches of today).

This book is on my all time top 5 list.Norman Maclean wrote a history of the Mann Gulch fire that unfolds like a mystery story. His love and understanding of the West and of fire fighting, combined with his ability and willingness to conduct thorough research, produced an excellent history of the fire. Because Mr Maclean was a superb storyteller, the book is a terrific read.The compassion and respect he brought to the book for the young men who died was beautiful. His desire to understand what honestly happened, rather than accuse and blame showed his humility and wisdom.My family and I have been so moved by this story that we are taking a summer trip, or perhaps, a form of pilgrimage to the site of the event."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you don't forget.","review":"I would have rated this book four stars because it was edited and published posthumously, and therefore has a few rough spots one has to push through. Otherwise, it is a magnificent book covering all aspects of the Mann Gulch fire. Others have reviewed the story elsewhere in excellent manner.However, this book earned back its fifth star. It is rare and amazing when the author, at one level writes a book of non-fiction that itself is so factual and compassionate. But the fifth star is earned for while he is doing this \\"work of nonfiction\\" at such a high level, you realize towards the end that while he is writing about this fire and the death of those 13 men, what he is really talking about is loving testament to his wife and of how she died.

Over the course of the latter years of his life, Mann -- a former Forest Service firefighter himself -- unraveled the mystery of the greatest disaster in the history of the Smokejumpers, while at the same time weaving a tale of innocence lost as touching as any you'll read.Looking a little deeper into the MacLean's brilliant prose, you will find a pervasive analysis of the decisions made by the firefighters on that fateful day. More so than any other aspect of the book, I found this element to be the most valuable. Every critical decision is broken down and examined, providing the reader with a deep understanding of just how difficult decision making can be when lives are at stake. Bound to be a modern classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting book","review":"This is a very interesting book about the tragedy of the Mann Gulch Fire. The book is full of extensive details about not only the fire, but finding out what exactly happened on that hill that day. This book is not really exciting, but it is very educational and shocking. The structure of this book has a time-jumping pattern, so you have to read it closely to understand exactly what is going on. The first half of this book is about the fire itself, and the second half is trying to solve the mystery of it. You will not regret reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"I purchased this book as a gift and have not yet had a chance to read it.

Mr. Maclean held a keen interest in the story for many reasons including his love of the outdoors and of \\"woodsmen\\". As a journalist piece the book is too long and wordy but if you take it as a story of a story things work out just fine. The first part describes the fire itself in great journalistic style. The second part, where Maclean goes into is passion to find out for himself what happened is less journalistic and more like a story. It is Maclean's story of the story of Mann Gulch.

The \\"River\\" was a monumental book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prose as Poetry","review":"The pure information about the nature of forest fires, smoke jumpers and how to try and piece together what happened over twenty years after the fact all are compelling reasons to read this book.

I found myself reading further just to see how Maclean would spin the yarn, with only tangential interest in the story at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young men and fire","review":"I found this story of one of the first and most tragic fires in the US a reality for a lot of people.

It is a good account of the history of firefighting and the improvements made in the last century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw this one in the fire...","review":"To be blunt, Young Men and Fire was an awful book. True, it did start out interesting, but after about 1/3 of the way through the book, MacLean begins repeating himself. He does this several times, though I have yet to figure out why...Anyway... I'll admit, the first run through of the Mann Gulch tragedy is pretty interesting, and so is some of the followup he does after it. However, in the end, every chapter becomes duller than the last. Suffering from severe organizational problems and a definite lack of interesting material, the book atrophies completely halfway through. It ends up sounding more like someone trying to stretch out their writing to a specific length rather than write something interesting. This was one of the few science-oriented books that I've read that I didn't like. Its sad to think that a great writer like MacLean left something like this behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible, poorly written account of a magnificent disaster","review":"It is always a bad precident to sit down to read a book that the author never finished. In this case it is fair to say that he never began. This book is a loose collection of notes and incoherant narratives which McLean intended to use to make a book.

The author rambles, gave too much details. I don't think he ever intended to publish this book. The entire book seems to be just notes on the Fire.

Maclean babbles on for paragraphs about something that could be said in a paragraph or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"an unfinished masterpiece","review":"Norman Maclean, a professor of English at the University of Chicago, was obsessed with two events: one was Custer's Last Stand, and the other was the Mann Gulch fire, the subject of this haunting book published posthumously.You can tell that Maclean hadn't finished writing--sections are repeated now and then, and as a whole the work is formless. Nevertheless, what you'll find between the covers of this volume will haunt you: it is about hubris, fate, death and tragedy. Maclean seems to feel so acutely the fear in the men's eyes as they burned to death. Making sense of this tragedy becomes a miniature study of the meaning of life and the meaning of death. The project must have been especially poignant given Maclean's own failing health as he tried to finish this work. Even in its rough form, this book is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunted by Fire","review":"I stumbled upon this book after hearing about the Mann Gulch fire last week on APM's \\"The Story.\\" I have read many books chronicling disasters of various forms. Some of my favorite writers of the genre are, of course, Jon Krakauer and Sebastian Junger. As excellent as their books may be, none can compare with this compassionate and moving account of Maclean's investigation (obsession might be closer to the truth) of the 1949 Mann Gulch Fire in Montana. Maclean may have been haunted by waters in \\"A River Runs Through It,\\" but he appears to be haunted by fire in this book. Unfinished as it might be, it's a masterpiece. Well worth the read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Men and Fire","review":"This is a book written about a fire that took place in Montana back in the 1940's during which a group of smoke jumpers lost their lives. It is so well written that I found it difficult to put down. This was the beginning of the study of \\"fire\\", and all it's elements, as a science. Fascinating. This particular book is being used as required reading in our local \\"California Department of Fire\\" CDF. I read it as an adjunct to the Search and Rescue Team to which I belong. I recommend this to anyone, especially those living in a possible fire danger area."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are there on the hillside with the Young Men","review":"A slim book carrying a powerful story. Written in Norman Maclean's unforgettable prose. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unflinching Tribute","review":"What Norman Maclean does so well is show his tenderness for the subjects about which he writes without becoming sentimental. His writing here is clean and stirring and knowledgeable as always and because of that I can forgive the passages that, for me, step off into the dry realm of fire science. I can even respect the fire science...he left no stone unturned in his quest to first find out, and then tell the whole story of the Mann Gulch fire. I hope when I am past my biblical allotment of 3 score and some that I am still able to find fresh challenges to share. Especially if sharing is a form of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic and inspiring story of modern heroism!","review":"The most important aspect of Norman Maclean's work, \\"Young Men And Fire,\\" has absolutely nothing to do with the Mann Gulch fire. At the core of this story is a perfect example of modern heroism, as well as an author's inspiring quest to not only lend these fine young men the credit they deserve, but in the process find himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written","review":"Maclean pulls you in to this tragedy right from page one. His dedication to getting to the bottom of this story is unyielding and he quickly makes you a party in the quest for the truth. Those who enjoyed 'The Perfect Storm by Sebastian Junger' will also find this book to be as informative, haunting and engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it. Seriously.","review":"This book is a masterpeice. I don't say that often and I'm going to say it again. Masterpeice. Yes he didn't finish. Yes his grammer occasionally lapses into incoherency. Yes the narrative doesn't always make sense. But pay attention to the title. If you're expecting a book solely about the Mann Gulch disaster you might be disappointed. If you're truly expecting a story about young men and fire, you won't be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid effort","review":"You can tell Young Noble takes his craft seriously from listening to this CD.

This book is unlike any other book I have text I have read for college. The chapters in this book vary greatly in lenght the chapter headings are poor. Chapter heading in my experience give the reader a clue to the subject matter, not in this book. It difficult to revisit information due to the index/glossary information. Reading this book I felt many times smarter than its authors. They may know the subject matter but they presented the material poorly at best. My college professor felt the same way about this books 5th edtion.Good luck to thoes who are stuck with this textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Impressed","review":"I had one of the authors as a professor for my speech development class, and this was the assigned book.Although the authors are clearly knowledgeable, the text fails as both a learning tool and a reference book. If you actually read the book through, the writing is awkwardly casual and filled with less than helpful examples. The chapters titles and heading make finding specific information difficult, and the index is not user-friendly. There are also several times where statistics provided seem contradictory.Although this edition contains several valuable additions, overall the previous editions are better resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I agree with the first two reviews that were written concerning this book. I've been going back and forth to Afghanistan for almost 4 years now and purchased this book because I misplaced a different one I normally use. I had my interpreters look through this book and they all agreed that it is not a proper book to use for beginner's because it is very confusing. Why would you learn to write a foreign language before you learn to speak or pronounce the alphabet or words? There is no need to go on about this, I'm not an author and do not have the skills to write a book on this topic and should just say...this is not the book for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Zero","review":"This is the worst film I've ever seen. Pretentious, stupid, pointless. Full of absurd scenes with no meaning and no relation with the plot (plot, which plot???). Full of overused (supposedly artsy) imagery trickery.Worst of all, it pretentiously tries to portrait the \\"Mexican reality\\" by showing \\"shocking images\\" and ends up showing only common places. Is mocking Mexican Catholicism, over-the-top patriotism and social inequalities something new or innovative?? Why not show a burro with a sombrero dancing la Cucaracha in a bean field too?? Is that art??It's a shame that an inept director like Raygada gets the financing, attention and screen time to produce such a full of himself pile of garbage, while truly talented and starving directors in Mexico, the US and everywhere have to work really hard to get minimal attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"QUE ES?","review":"This is one of those movies that tries too hard to be artsy and substitues content, with close ups of the lead actors face.

I'm not at all bothered, and neither is my child, by Elmo's Dad shaving off his mustache OR Prairie Dawn's Mom getting a more contemporary hairstyle... their voices and mannerisms are the same. It's just like in the real world... peoples looks vary over time. But, I was bothered by the poor sound quality of the \\"live\\" recordings between Matt and Romy. Also, their interaction wasn't as cheerful as prior parent/child segments. Matt really seems to be quizzing Romy the whole time. Not too much fun to watch. And, the songs are not as \\"catchy\\". Overall, disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"K.N.","review":"Our 13 month old daughter is a sesame street fanatic since she was 9 months old! We owned the first two \\"sesame beginnings\\" DVDS and she just loves them both. She dances and claps her hands to the music, and her smile just lites up the room. I was so excited when I had seen the new Sesame Beginning DVD, \\"Exploring Together\\", so, naturally I ordered it. VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTING!!! The music was disappointing and boring. My daughter's attention span was limited for this particular video. I hope the next video will be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Quality Poor","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. The sound quality is different. My 14 month old son loves the first two of this series. I wouldn't bother buying this one. He loses interest after 5 minutes too. The songs aren't that exciting and start to sound simliar after awhile. Maybe this one would be better for kids over 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"We watched this twice before I gave it to my cousin for her baby.It was totally annoying. All the segments of the real parents and kids interacting were totally boring and irritating to both me and my children.The songs were all repetitive and bland.Matt Laurer and his daughter's interaction seemed forced and rehearsed.There wasn't enough actual acting by the muppets and I was really turned off by most of this DVD with the real people.The concept was good, but it totally could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Beginnings","review":"It isn't that videos for kids 0-2 can't teach them anything, or entertain them a great deal - its just that doctors and researchers have noticed that it greatly impairs more subtle development during these crucial years. Sesame Street started out with a very noble purpose: reaching latchkey and inner-city youth with some of the best educational methods available.They are now on the other side of the same research - this is about getting kids hooked on their brand. I'm sure they have good intentions (such as that it'll draw the kids to their worthwhile material as they grow up) but they'd be much better off putting these funds into spreading the message: don't make a habit out of planting any kid under 2 in front of a TV set. You'd be surprised how few (4%) parents are aware that the Academy of Pediatrics has been urging this for years now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute series.","review":"My son went through and Elmo phase and so we got him all of these seasme biginning movies. He loved to sing along and dance. Great for kids to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Great","review":"I purchased this DVD for my daughter at Christmas. We already had the \\"Making Music Together\\" DVD, which she absolutely loves, so we thought that we would add to the Sesame Street Beginnings collection with this DVD and the \\"Beginning Together\\" DVD. The music is generally very good with lots of interaction with the characters and their parent/caregiver. However, the dialogue with Matt Lauer and his daughter is noisy (really bad recording quality maybe, especially compared to the other DVD's) and a little forced in some areas. But my daughter doesn't notice those things! She loves the Smell a Smell song and it is the first time that she has laughed at something she saw on the TV - and we are talking full on belly laughs. So this is a good video to add to your collection if you (as an adult) can get over the Matt Lauer part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie & Music!","review":"We have all of the Sesame Beginnings. This was our last one to purchase because of the reviews, I was skeptical. Yet this one was great too. My son enjoyed it and I didn't hear overwhelming background noise.

The latter is widely available at drug stores, food center, and so forth. The width of the two rolls is the same: two inches. The adhesive feels the same to me. Why bother to go looking for this \\"book tape?\\" Maybe the book tape is a bit more transparent. I don't think it is quite as strong as the ordinary tape.It is a fine product, like everything else that Scotch makes. I would not go out of my way to find it, because their ordinary tape is similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional grade for repairing books","review":"Just like your local librarian's use, this book tape will not crack and yellow with age when used for repairs.

Great quality item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gave up on the foldover.","review":"I used this tape to cover the spines of several different paperbacks, all of different thicknesses. While I really liked the tape, I just could not get the T-Cut and foldover to work. It tore every single time, even when I tried to go really slow. Maybe I'm just not coordinated enough. Seems like it works ok just to cut it the length of the spine, stick it on and leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Based on the reviews, I thought it was some special tape. I got it to repair pages that my daughter ripped. It works just like any other clear packaging tapes, except more expensive. Don't waste your money. I was disappointed.

This tape is WONDERFUL because it is thick, easy to cut and stays stuck. I also used this on paperback spines to keep the cover secure. Wish it was a little less expensive but other than that this is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not strong enough for repairing the bindings of books","review":"We did a big service project of repairing the broken hymnbooks in our church. There were over 100 books, and we were teaching ourselves, so we tried this book tape and then clear shipping/packaging tape. They were basically the same. We didn't like them because the clear tape made the books look cheap. But the real problem was that as we followed online instructions on how to repair the broken and torn backs, we found that although this tape is heavy, it tears easily. Many of the covers were torn in the top where the spine meets the front and back. And this tape gave no strength for this repair.We eventually found a book binding tape made of vinyl coated cloth that works perfectly. It is strong and looks great on the books. We found it here:[...]We have no agreement with Demco and they are not compensating us in any way. I would just like to save anyone else from all the trial and error we went through before we found something that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed to preserve some favorite reads","review":"In this economy some of us are forced to become frugal. I can't afford to replace some of my favorite books that have been read so much that they're practically falling apart. Like The Princess Bride. I just finished using this tape to protect my treasure. Now I can read about Buttercup and Westley's adventures a few more years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't use anything else for books!","review":"Book Tape is the only type of tape you should use to repair books. It is used in libraries because it is permanent and will not add more damage to an already damaged book. Over the years, other tapes can yellow and crack; worse, the adhesive can absorb into the paper and separate from the backing, so the tape peels off but the glop remains. If a book is worth keeping, it is worth buying Book Tape for repairs. Book Tape comes in various widths, but the two-inch width is probably the most useful to have on hand.You can also use it for other repairs, for instance, for birth certificates or licenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertsied","review":"Essentially thin packaging tape, but works very well. We have patched up 20-yr old books as well as bound piano music sheets. Once it's on, it's on, so be careful and have steady hand when applying! The tape is not forgiving, but works very well once you have it on. Of course, only time will tell, but seems like a good niche solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Small children, no matter how careful, rip pages in books. Adults rip pages in books too. Whenever this happens, standard tape might not be the best repair choice. This is a tape designed to not yellow as it ages. This can be used for repair or reinforcement adding years to the life of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Life for Old Books- Let the Repairs Begin!","review":"At first glance this tape doesn't look like it will do the job.I grabbed a book with a detached cover, applied the tape and WOW!Let the repairs begin! The tape is thick enough to hold the hardbook cover on but flexibale enough to give new life to the book.This tape is very different then slapping typical clear shippingtape on a book which is too thin. With Book tape the book isbasicly repaired to like new condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book tape","review":"I generally use store brand tape to bind my items(generally old folders and sometimes books). But the quality of this tape really has made me change that mindset. The tape itself is clear and glossy. Just by touch you can see it is quite sturdy and strong, makes the store brand tape feel frail. But its not overpowering, i.e, it doesn't inhibit the closure of the book/folder edge you apply it on. Instead it gives it a nice sturdy feel. If you need to bind and/or protect your books, look no further as this is easily one of the best if not the best book tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good brand, good product, great durability","review":"Man, this stuff is tough.I worked in book processing for an academic bookseller and I've used a number of different products that claim to reinforce and strengthen, but this stuff is the best I've seen, short of a now-discontinued Kapco item that sold for almost three times the price.If you have any old or hard-used books, do yourself a favour and buy a roll of this stuff. Whether you're planning on reselling the books or not, you want to keep them in good shape.I've also used this tape to reinforce the corners and covers of my heaviest gaming books. When you're carrying a 30-pound bag of RPG hardcovers in your trunk, they tend to get dinged no matter what you do, but there's been a marked decrease in damage since I've wrapped up my most-used tomes.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is great tape. Very thick and sturdy, much more so than regular tape, and certainly superior to the sort of thin tape used in everyday office tasks. It provides strong and transparent coverage. I used it quite successfully to repair several paperbacks with ripped covers, and I would certainly recommend it. Very reasonably priced if you need this sort of product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent to repair music books","review":"Years ago, I worked in a library, and we would re-bind paperbacks with a hessian cloth tape, and often cover books in a special contact paper. I haven't seen the paper in years, but regular clear contact paper works well, and this Scotch Book Tape protects the spine from disintegration.Music books are getting increasingly hard to find for certain composers; I have one book (Pischna exercises) that dates back to 1918 and was a gift from my piano teacher and I think it was a gift from his. It's old. It's crumbling but this tape helps repair the spine. The same goes for my Beethoven sonatas. I've had them fifty years. Why not get a new copy? Because my fingering notes and other notes on dynamics and interpretation are written on my copy. So I keep repairing these old books.This tape is very good for any book that is somewhat ephemeral that you want to keep."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit of magic in this tape!","review":"For years I've been repairing book covers and pages with regular Scotch tape, which as many know has a tendency to discolor, curl and lose its \\"stickiness\\" over time. But that was all that was available as far as I knew.As a book lover I'm delighted to have this tape made especially for books. The width is great and covers a multitude of tears (especially some jagged ones on favorite children's books.) Also like the transparency - recently repaired a dark green book jacket and the tape all but disappeared.What I don't have is a proper dispenser for this tape so I lose a little by folding over so it won't stick to itself. As far as I'm concerned that's a small price to pay for the tape my books have been waiting all their lives for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lorus Ladies","review":"Is a clock of a not very known mark, But the value price relation is good, the quality of the product is acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"The base idea for this book is to look for a \\"Core Night\\" which is the first time your baby sleeps for longer than usual. Once he does that the author says you can expect him to do it all the time by not going to him during those Core Night hours. She says the Core Night is the Secret Weapon and happens usually in the first 4 weeks. But what if you miss is? What if your baby is older than 4 weeks? And what if he cries very hard during those Core Night hours?

Every 3 or 4 weeks I disassemble it and clean it by soaking it in vinegar to get the coraline off of it and get any junk out of the teeth.It does a great job of providing changing flow in a pretty low-cost way, great for growing healthy corals in a small tank.

Without his book I would never have known what happened in Bosnia (lol). Please, give this man a candle, don't leave him in total darkness. Maybe a pair of glasses. Just today (04/12/2004), I was reading his interview to a leading Croatian newspaper and was shocked. Biased, anti-islamic, anti-serb, but pro-croatian to the last drop of his blood.

Dinoia takes the claims of the religions seriously--if a Theravada Buddhist, for example, seeks the cessation of the cycle of craving and suffering through pursuit of the blissful extinction of the ego that he calls nirvana, one does him no justice by claiming that he is really pursuing the Christian ideal of eternal life in the Beatific Vision of the Trinity.

Coming from a cold, Anglo Saxon, it sounds like a more desperate attempt to bridge some sort of unity with rich pop stars and the bereaved poor of NO. The album is mostly murky and gets absorbed in the background. Wilder sounds like another tony Londoner trying to take on more than he is capable. As far as being the soul of Depeche Mode, people forget the power of Gore's songs and Gahan's delivery. Wilder has always been a technician and not a musician.

The vocal version allows the listner to understand the scene in a more profound maner. Abbado achieves a very vivid demonic atmosphire. the voices of the demones, witches and dwarves create a chaotic blend of harmony. it also features excerpts from mussorgsky's opera \\"khovanshchina\\" a beautyfull lively prelude which paints a colorful picture of the russian landscape.

The reader of The Mist-Filled Path will be invited on a meaningful journey through a series of topics that hail from the Celtic vision of the spiritual life, but in a way that is alive and practical. One reviewer suggests that MacEwen's writing is PC (politically correct). On the contrary, I think his ideas are powerful and visionary.

Born in the USA I didn't recognize what was happening to me, but always felt drawn to certain trees. They were my safe places. In my middle age I started researching my Celtic ancestry and now I know I'm not crazy. The organized religions I've tried to participate in always leave me feeling that something is missing, but when I'm drawn to the trees it's nothing less than spiritual. Thank you for putting into words what I've been feeling all my life!! When I tried to relate my spiritual experiences to Native American spirituality I've been called a \\"Wannabe\\".

What the other reviewers were thinking I can not imagine, unless they are all his relatives!It is a shame that such an important topic, with such an appealing title is so badly abused.

I don't tend to read \\"Celtic spiritual\\" books, as most of them seem silly to me. I am more of a fan of hard facts and history, but I found myself pleasantly surprised by The Mist-Filled Path. The author talks about Celtic history and our modern society in a way that was oddly healing for me to read.

I haven't had much exposure to either celtic spirituality or shamanism, but with Franks wonderful sharing of both, i'm inclined to take a closer look at both. Though I found I already agreed with and felt a deep resonance with much of what he was writing about.

Instead, I found myself challenged by language and construction that were, at best, obscure, and at worst, barely made sense, at least to me. Some of this problem might have had to do with the fact that the book translates essays and poems from German; perhaps some of the interpretations were awkward. Much of the content is also philosophical, which is not my cup of tea. Finally, it wasn't clear whether he was a Nazi sympathizer or not, and the ambiguity was unsettling. What was clear is that he identified strongly with whatever the national character was going through at the time the material was written, and that was the one aspect of the book that was provocative and compelling.

Only an optional...","review":"Dagli anni Cinquanta, quelli della Belcanto-Renaissance (non solo Callas: Gencer, Scotto, Zeani, Sutherland, Caballè, Sills...)la riscoperta del repertorio belliniano non ha avuto soste. Si è ascoltato di tutto: l'algidità della Anderson e le asperità della Aliberti,la friabilità della Moffo ed il rigore inam idato della Devia, e adesso anche la Eaglen. Che non possiede alcuna idea del fraseggio belcantistico, risultando il suo legato sempre troppo tirato, la pronuncia italiana scolastica (ogni accento della frase è buttato via senza alcuna passionalità romantica richiesta all'interprete). Wagner è uno dei tanti possibili, pura routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory in either","review":"It's understandably that some singers wish to prove their versatility by singing a wide range of repertoire. Unfortunately, many just embarrass themselves through such ill-considered venture. I'm afraid that Jane Eaglen is just another of them.Frankly, Miss Eaglen just doesn't have the technique and style for bel canto. The florid runs are often awkwardly performed and she is as yet unable to master the idiom with any degree of conviction.Unfortunately, she's also not well suited to the Wagnerian repertoire, for her voice is not \\"heroic\\" enough and her delivery of the words are rather monotonous. She can, of course, cope with the notes, but great Wagnerian singing requires much more than that.I'm afraid that Miss Eaglen should seriously re-consider what kind of repertoire she can do best. I'm afraid that both the bel canto and the Wagnerian repertoires won't show her in a very favorable light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please sir, I want more !","review":"First of his books I'd read.

Now both shoes have to be returned so that i can be reimbursed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has problems keeping a stable temperature","review":"After a few weeks of accurate operation this heater became very flaky, first running my aquarium up to a very high temperature and then becoming inconsistent at any temperature setting.I am surprised all of the reviews of this product here on Amazon are generally favorable, a number of people have had the same problem I had, you can read about it at Marinedepot.com.Would not recommend this heater, its not worth the risk to your tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a heater","review":"Turned it on, it warmed the water, perfect :) but with all things, not every single item made can be perfect and there are bad apples in every batch, If you need a heater of this size, this one is very nice.

Then, a year later, the thermostat started to drop the temp all the way down to around 65 degrees, then up to 86 degrees the next day. I lost a 6-year-old fish because of it. It does have a 2-year warranty though. It says to return to place of purchase. I still had the receipt and pet smart took it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine broke in the tank","review":"It somehow cracked and broke in the tank (sometime at night when everyone was alseep).

I recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and consistent","review":"This heater is accurate and consistent. If you are looking for a heater then it is more important that it keeps constant, consistent temperature. Being accurate is not important as long as you have an accurate thermometer.If you are heating your tank for the first time then it is easy to get to the temperature that you want.1) Put the heater in the tank and set it 10-15 degrees higher than your temperature goal2) Watch your thermometer - either the floating or stick on3) Once your temperature goal is met, lower the setting on your heater and immediately stop when the red light goes off"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 22 months","review":"Thermostat eventually broke on my unit & unfortunately we didn't catch it in till it took a couple fish with it.

Bought this over other models in hopes it would be long lasting & dependable but it's going to the garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After buying the Hydor power heads, I figured I couldn't go wrong with this company. I was very disappointed when I installed my heater, set the temperature to 78, and came back a couple hours later to find that my water was at 84 degrees! To try and counter this, I unplugged it, let the temperature settle back down to about 74 degrees. Plugged the heater back in, set the temp to 72. Came back a couple hours later, water was at 79. I double checked to make sure that I ordered the correct size, and wattage (which it was). Stick with the power heads, avoid the heaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GOOD!","review":"After 8 months, the heater stopped working. We kept very good maintenance, too.

I didn't realize that there were only FIVE episodes in the whole thing. It seemed like this would be really amazing for my one and a half year old. Yes, she did enjoy the first episode but after I realized that it only had a couple more I decided I'm going to return it. I would never pay over $5 PER episode of anything!! Of course, yes, there is extra material on it but not like my 1 year old is really going to care about that! I suppose if you just like to collect things like this and don't just want a good compilation of sesame street than this would be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Sesame Street Old School Volume 1","review":"I was so happy to finally be able to see the old Sesame Street. I even told my grown kids to plan on a Sesame Street Night to relive the fun & introduce their kids to the beginnings of Sesame Street.When I viewed the 1st disc I was only a little disappointed to see the entire 1st episode. There were even repeats within the episode. What I expected from the discription was a montage of excerpts from the 1st season: the whole 1st season, not just one episode.Disc 2 was the same way: just 2 complete episodes; there were even repeats. And disc 3 was boring. I fast-forwarded through most of it.The best parts of the 3 discs were the cut-outs.Truthfully I was anticipating Volume 2 and also the Electric Company. However, I guess those volumes will only contain 1 or 2 episodes of each season. What a disappointment with all the possiblities of each year.S. Markel"},{"rating":"2","title":"What Editing??","review":"The reviews that I read before ordering this vid almost talked me right out of buying it. Some made it sound as though it were bits and pieces cut and pasted together, and all of the beauty of Sesame Street cut out. I'm glad I ordered it, and have enjoyed sharing some classic moments from my childhood with my own daughter. So what, if the PBS logo isn't right, or the broadcaster's tune is different? If you remember Mr. Hooper, or when Gordon had hair, or the days when Burt and Ernie were thought of as just roommates, you will love this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School Wins","review":"Old School Sesame Street is a winner of my vote for a better beginning to learning the school rules. The way to teach the chilren through fun, short and musical learning techniques is able to catch the attention and hold it.

Again Thank You."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed - only 5 shows.... Not complete ....Buyer beware","review":"The shows they have on the 3 DVDs on Vol. 1 only show a total of five programs .....not the complete series of programs from 1969 - 1974 as advertised. I was very disappointed in the selection for the money paid. Had thought Sesame Street name meant more or maybe it is A Sony business plan for profits. So read all the info before purchasing.I had also bought Volume 2 and Volume 3 .... For a total of $80.76 you get a very few shows....not the complete set of shows. Again......buyer beware this is not all shows from 1969 - 1974."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sesame Street Old School\\" is just my style","review":"This DVD set provides a wonderfully nostalgic journey back to my formative years. I very much enjoy experiencing anew the creativity and fun that Jim Henson and so many other talented folks brought to my TV screen back in the day. My children may not appreciate the select episodes and bonus materials as much as I do, but at least they can get a glimpse into what I consider a cherished part of my childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY! And, thanks for such wonderful childhood memories","review":"Sesame Street is the best program ever created for children. It should be used as a learning tool in every school throughout the country.I've been hoping and praying that they would offer a compliation of the classic Sesame Street episodes. Although I wish this DVD included more episodes on each disc.I grew up watching Sesame Street with my sisters and we've learned so much from it. I'm 39 years old, with a child of my own. My 22 month old adores Sesame Street, too. The best part of watching this DVD with my son is reliving my childhood through his eyes. My throat gets lumpy and I even shed a tear or two every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could give 100 stars, I would.","review":"Okay, this is from my era, so perhaps I am biased. I LOVE these videos, and so does the two year old in my life. I remember so many of the sketches, and they're just as great now as they were then. It brings me right back to the good old days. I'm eager for more volumes!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The wait is over!","review":"I had been looking for the Sesame Street show on DVD. Well, it's here and it's wonderful. Classic Sesame Street at it's best. Very educational and entertaining. My son is almost 4 and he loves it! If your child is going to watch t.v. it might as well be Sesame Street."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing too many episodes!!!","review":"I would pay a lot of money for a complete set of the ENTIRE series for 1970-1979. Why doesn't someone make one for each year and make it COMPLETE. Buying it this way was a disappointment and a tease. I would do ANYTHING and pay A LOT to find all the episodes for the 70s as I don't want my child to have anything to do with Elmo."},{"rating":"2","title":"old school rocks","review":"this is a great set if u wanna go down memory lane..and I mean way down memory lane - in this piticular volume the episodes included were around and airing before I even existed but I was curious how it all started and it has been interesting - though I thought I would have more episodes than I discovered - turns out its one episode 4 every year - and a few extras but never the less its sesame street so how can u go wrong right - I recommend it 4 stars cause I felt jiped on episode count but other wise I'm luvin it :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off!!","review":"I thought this was going to be a complete series. Its only 5 episodes. To top it off they made a second volume. What a waste! They could have put this all in one volume but it is obviously a Sesame Street scam. Dont buy this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FIVE episodes -- definitely NOT worth it","review":"Like other reviewers, I THOUGHT I had read the description carefully, but apparently I didn't. I thought that a few years ago I had seen complete Sesame Street seasons DVDs at my friend's house. So I went searching for them for my son. I put these on my son's Christmas wish list and he received both volumes 1 and 2 as gifts for Christmas. I wish I had read closer and not opened both of them up. I put Vol 1 Disc 1 in the DVD player and couldn't figure out how to navigate to the rest of the episodes on the menu. Oh, that's right--because you CAN'T. There is ONE episode on the whole disc. So, be forewarned, these are NOT COMPLETE SEASONS. I'm very disappointed. For this price I would expect complete seasons, not 5 measly episodes. Now I'm sorry my family wasted their money on these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School","review":"No surprise the really old stuff can sometimes be a bit rough around the edges, but really cool extras and seeing the changes, and no Elmo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good summary","review":"Good aggregation of the early Sesame Street, reminds me of my childhood. Only downer: I can only view them in black/white, must be the country code of my swiss player..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening","review":"This show is disgusting. It is filled with sexual content, racism, bestiality, necrophilia, nasty fetish scenes, heavy petting and attractive teenage girls in bikinis. In one gut-wrenching scene, Big Bird and Ernie spewed several racial slurs to a little girl and then sucked on her toes!!! THIS SHOULD NOT BE SHOWN TO LITTLE KIDS. Also, Cookie Monster is a horrible example for young children! Vegetable Monster would've been a much better idea. Avoid this piece of filth and show your kids Full House or anything with Bob Saggot instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"So excited! Now a little let down.","review":"I was SO. EXCITED. for this release when I heard about it. I ran right over and pre-purchased it and waited with bated breath for it to arrive.When I put it in to watch it, well, I was a little sad. I had somehow convinced myself that I was getting ALL the episodes for the seasons, which is silly given that it was 5x a week. But still, you can't reverse yourself once you get an idea like that in your head, so color me disappointed.TBS, what is included is great. I'm sad to say DD is unimpressed, but that's because she's jaded. I'll work on her. They note at the start that it's for adults and not \\"today's preschoolers\\" which is odd to me. It's Sesame Street! It's always been for preschoolers. Are ours somehow more advanced than we were??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast from the Past!","review":"It's been such fun returning \\"back in the day\\" with my son. He is 21 months old, although it's before Elmo's time, he still enjoys watching it! A must have for Sesame Street Fans of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"About time","review":"I was already 7 when Sesame Street started, but by the time I was a teenager Sesame Street was the show to watch for some good creative fun. It was amazing how many High School kids loved to joke about it and sing the songs. Even now when my friends and I share a toast we say \\"Cheers cheers cheers, may Bumble live 900 years\\".Big cheers for releasing this collection, now my kids can see the real Sesame Street and laugh at the things I tell them about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I thought it would be:(","review":"The product's description made it sound like there would be several episodes on each disk, but really its one to two episodes per disk. The quality of the film is pretty fuzzy & even somewhat blurry. The drawing that does the announcement is really annoying, luckily you can skip over him. I bought this for my young son, and while he likes it- I'm thinking I should have went with the newer episodes. I was really excited about buying the vintage episodes, but having seen them now I probably wouldn't buy them for a child, maybe an adult that would remember them the original time they aired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This DVD compilation was sent to my son for a birthday present, so I never read any reviews. I had expressed an interest in \\"Old School\\" Sesame Street because the ones on television now are horrible. A friend found this and sent it. I cannot believe she paid so much money for FIVE episodes! Considering the fact that these shows are over 40 years old, you'd think the Sesame Workshop would be more interested in sharing all the old shows for this price than five episodes. Instead it feels like a really big rip-off, a scam to make more money. I'm even less impressed with the makers of Sesame Street after receiving this DVD set than I was after trying to watch the new episodes. Guess Sesame Street will be off our rotation for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sesame Street - Old School, Vol. 1","review":"I was very disappointed with this DVD. I thought the DVD would be full of the original episodes, but there were only five. I thought it would contain at least a whole season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The first show (ie, disc 1) is great: inspired, creative and written for children - not their parents. My daughter and I really enjoyed it (I didn't grow up watching Sesame Street and we don't have a TV so my child hasn't seen any TV shows - old or new). Discs 2 and 3, on the other hand, are from much later shows and were very, very disappointing - for both of us; the vignettes generally showed few of the characteristics that made the first show so appealing. I wonder when SS went \\"down the tubes\\"? You might want to rent discs 2 and 3 (or get them from your library) before deciding to spend so much money for what I consider to be only one worthy DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete bummer","review":"I was under the impression (Because the back of the DVD alludes to the content) that the Pinball #12 song was on this DVD. Three hours of looking and this song is nowhere to be found; which is the reason I ordered this DVD. Additionally it comes with 3 DVD but there are only 5 complete episodes. And they actually put in the \\"Crawl Credits\\" as a special feature!!! Unbelievable! This was a complete waste of my money. Thankfully, I purchased it from AMAZON and got it for an exceptionally low price. Thanks AMAZON. To the creators of this DVD......

You know, down memory lane and all of that. Well, I guess Sesame Street has also helped speed up the world.

The right audience for these DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"slurprised","review":"I raised my child on the original Sesame Street and as a kindergarten teacher my class watched a bit of it each day.I was surprised and unhappy that the DVD was not digitally remastered.

I did not know that prior to buying it, but when my three year old daughter had no interest in watching it, I decided to see why. Once I started to watch the video with her, the narrator came on and said that this product was for adults and would not appeal to today's pre-school age children. He was right and that could be because the children of today are over stimulated and Old School Sesame Street does not stimulate them. If you have fond memories of waching the Sesame Street characters of old, and believe your children will too, let me warn you that they will not and you will be wasting your money on nostalgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's too old","review":"My 3 yr old dau rec'd this as a xmas present last year and she didnt much care for it - i guess the graphics and special effects were dated for her - she's a huge fan of the new ones we catch on tv.I definitely wouldn't recommend this for children of the 21st century - it's too dated.

I am a little dissappointed at this, so - 2 stars for quality, but minus three stars for lack of content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great llok back!","review":"Its a good DVD. Funny to look back at the first episode never knew in the first sesame street Oscar the groch was ORANGE! Yes he was ORANGE!

At 32 years I still remembered singing the \\"Ladybug Picnic\\" and the \\"Adventures of Letterman\\"!

Your kids will love it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding my way back to Sesame Street","review":"It was soooooooo wonderful revisiting my childhood with this dvd set. Sesame Street had so many creative tools to get across the basic building blocks of learning. There is absolutely nothing out there now that compares to the show that was Sesame Street in the early 1970s. My three year old watched the shows with me and fell in love with the same characters that I grew up with. I am ready to buy Volume 2. The reason why I didn't give it five stars is tat I truly believe that there should have been at least three full shows on each disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for Finally Taking Us to Sesame Street!","review":"Simply put Sesame Street is the best children's educational programming ever created. It's smart, funny, and timeless. All three of my children have benefited greatly from watching this show (as did I as a child). Other children's shows are very good and entertaining but from my own personal experience I'd have to say Sesame Street is still tops in teaching. I can't wait to share this box set with my two year old daughter. I'm sure even my two older boys will get a kick out of seeing what I used to watch when I was a child. I'm hoping this is a first in a long line of comprehensive chronilogical collections to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality peice of jewelry.","review":"I sent this to my Daughter as a gift.

This man has style that cannot be learned. It has to be in your bones or acquired at a very young age.

Thank you again Dion for proving you can sing with anyone who put on rock-n-roll shoes. Buy this CD folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked it,,,,","review":"Dion made a blues CD? Are you kidding me?I read great reveiws about this CD and it took me a while to find it. I'm glad I did. I think it's great but....I have to say if you want to hear the real deal for acoustic blues go pick up a copy of Blues Singer by Buddy Guy. Or if you want to go back further pick up Folk Singer by Muddy Waters(A young Buddy Guy plays on that one too!)I'm from the Bronx and I love the Blues so the title gets star from me alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AM radio junk","review":"I bought this based on reviews and that was a mistake. This is AM radio crap. I kept thinking a real blues guitar would kick in but that never happens.All sounds the same ,very nasal ,I mean this really stinks!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I had hoped that this album was a Dion version of some of these great classics. But, he tried to sound like a delta, bluesman, copy cat, of some truly wonderful songs. There is a limited market for these type of songs. Most delta blues singers fall into the trap of mumbling and not singing words, but sounds. Dion did the same on some songs.I live in Memphis and have heard this style of music all of my life and can truthfully say that a only a small part of the delta style blues is really great. Dion is way too good to try to copy someone's version. Dion singing and playing these songs would be awesome, in his own style of being Dion. Missed the boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dion never fades away; just gets more authentic...","review":"Bringing it all back to the Bronx! What a pleasant surprise!

Here's a guy, 67 years old, who will just not fade away. His musical recordings have delved into several genres of music. He's truly an artist, in every sense of the word. He doesn't seem to care if his music reaches the charts or not, rather he is more interested in testing his abilities and sailing into uncharted waters. His life certainly has movie written all over it and Hollywood would be remiss if they didn't do a biopic on his life. This newest album is just another link in his fabulous musical career. It's the music he grew up with, along with country. Remember, there was no rock 'n roll when Dion was growing up, he helped invent it! I like this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great blues CD","review":"This stripped down treatment by a master singer is truly a work of art.

I use it for an electric bike. It arrived with no top part of the mount. Essentially, I had to use the top bracket from my old kickstand. So it is a great product, but I cannot give it anything but a poor rating as it is not a product that came ready to put on. I was lucky and had the extra part, and it was perfect. However, one is not supposed to rely on old parts to make a new one work. It is bad business for something sold over the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"sturdy stand","review":"My bike has a child carrier in the rear, and this is sturdy enough to hold the bike straight while I deal with my little one. note: You might need bigger hex wrench.

I had to rummage on ebay to find one. If your bike is like most mainstream American bikes, it has no built-in kickstand mount, so you'll need to find a top plate to get this thing mounted.Second, it has a tendency to bang into my cranks, so I have to keep it tilted at a very special angle.Lastly, one of the rubber feet fell off. The design is clearly poor in this regard -- there's no way the designers could have expected those tiny rubber caps to stay on for very long.I recommend checking out Velo Orange's porteur kickstand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected","review":"Based on the other customer reviews, I was very confident about this purchase. Big mistake. I have had this kickstand for about 10 weeks and I am looking around for a replacement. The rubber end caps both fell off within a couple of weeks, but that was minor compared to the overall poor performance of this kickstand. It could not support the weight of my bike and was too short for both feet to make contact with the ground together. Maybe this would work on a smaller bike, but I can't say I ever thought of my bike as anything but average sized..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not work with Electric Bike with Batteries","review":"I read a review saying it worked well with electric bikes, not true, very unstable, don\`t waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but too short","review":"I love the idea of the double support stand which makes parking a heavy bike very convenient. I have a tandem bike. When installed as is the bike is only supported one one side because the legs are too short. I have 26\\" wheels. I added 3/4\\" of washers to create a spacer.

Their first concert ever & the only one available on video with Geri! Although alot of songs have been edited out, this video is still very amazing. First is a 30 minute interview with each of the girls & they explain about their lives up until that point & just everything you could ever want to know. Geri's so funny! Then follow the girls behind the scenes as they arrive at the venue & prepare for their first ever concert. They're all nervous & we get to watch them as they go up on stage. Once the show begins, you wouldn't ever have known that this was their first concert. They perform so good together & their chemistry together on stage is fabulous.

And, as much as I enjoy being a Sesame Street Kid (37, just like the show), I was tiring of the same stuff over and over.Imagine my surprise, then, when virtually all of this DVD is just the highlights of the others (Classic Ernie, Bert and the beloved Mr. Hooper from _Christmas Eve_, Hanukkah from _Happy Holidays_, and Bob singing \\"All though the Year\\" from _Elmo Saves Christmas\\" among others). The only new part is Christmas future and it is a poor cartoon instead of new muppet footage.If you don't have the other three DVDs this would probably earn 4 stars. If you do have the other DVDs this is not a necessity. Hopefully next time the budget will allow Sesame Workshop to be more creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Creativity!!!","review":"I was so disappointed by this movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!

I turned it on for my 19 month old, who loves elmo and friends, and her friend. They were excited when I told them what we were going to watch but were obviously disappointed very quickly. The story is the based on the Christmas Carol Movie, which is too old for kids who like elmo/sesame street.It was a total waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This dvd was the most boring i have ever seen.

Yes, it does cost some money but Starrett's are always accurate and built to be used for a lifetime. I don't know what the one reviewer is complaining about, I received exactly what I expected...a Starrett 13C 6 inch double square with a hardened blade.If you think that you are getting several blades with this instrument, then you really haven't done your homework. There are much cheaper squares out there. If you are a carpenter or cabinet maker, then you can go to Lowes or Walmart and get an adjustable double square for around $10. If you are a woodworker or machinist who wants precision, then you know that you have found a good price on a Starrett."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality tools","review":"I bought this item to use mostly for woodworking.

Its One very Hot performance with lots of jams, and dead onTOP music...To answer the one reviewer's questions on why TOP or other acts put out so few dvds is simply this: Most people burn them reducing the profit margin that's supposed to go back to the musicians and producers of the performances..Same with cds...Bands like TOP make their money touring and doing session work...But what a sweet ride this one is.If you are a True TOP of fan, its well worth the ride for 2hrs..!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Quality stinks","review":"I was really looking forward to this because I saw Tower of Power live once in an LA club and they were great. I can't watch this, though, because the audio is so bad. There's no left or right; everything is in the middle sounding like a radio with no bass punch. I run the sound through my stereo system, but it sound quality is like its still coming from the TV!?! Just lousy! Spend your money on a CD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is hip - well this is not hip","review":"TOP has been in business for over 40 years and had both ups and downs. This DVD is from a concert somewhere in the eighties and definately from a \\"down\\"-period. Of course they play their a.... off, but it is also clear that both Castillo and Kupka are not in their best form (whatever is the reason for that, well maybe Castillo himself had explained that in the liner notes on the greatest hit album \\"Soul with a capital S\\"?). Anyway, to top up the bad experience, the sound quality on this DVD is probably the worst I have ever heard. Volume changes up and down, and the general sound is muddy and unclear. The only reason to buy this DVD must be to have a complete collection of TOP releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"I guess I should start reading the fine print............ After seeing Tower of Power recently in concert, I was excited that they had a new DVD out, well I thought, just to find out it is the exact same TOP in concert (Ohne Filter), that was released in 2003. So folks you now have a choice to buy the same identical concert.Why is it that TOP or any other great groups for that matter do not have any NEW CONCERT FOOTAGE to promote sales? For some of us that don't have a chance to see our favrorite group's, you would think this would be great marketing for those aging bands. I don't think they would loose money, as you would still have a large fan base to take in one of their concerts. Some of them sound better today than years ago.Maybe, just maybe TOP will take the time to film a concert and you will have the chance to see that their sound is better than ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opinionated, informative and entertaining","review":"Yes, this book is biased, and in many cases my opinion differs from that of the author. (I love cozies and cat mysteries, for example.) Still, Mr. Murphy's writing style is most engaging, and I find that it's fun to mentally argue with him as I read. \\"The Oxford Companion to Crime and Mystery Writing\\" is more comprehensive and objective than \\"The Encyclopedia of Murder and Mystery,\\" but there is much to learn and enjoy here that is not in the Oxford book. I see the two books as complementary rather than as competing.

Even from before I was born but just now found out about them.This book may serve many purposes as sitting up taller at the table. But my two favorite are finding out what is out there in the either before discovering it on Turner Classics. More significant is that this book fills in the back ground for stories characters and puts them in perspective by cross-referencing to other mysteries and characters.I just recently discovered \\"Seven Keys to Baldpate\\" to find it was written by Earl Derr Biggers of Charlie Chan fame. While discussing Charlie we are introduced to favorite writer Sax Rohmer of Fu Manchu fame.

The book itself is a great step by step guide intothe Encochian Mysteries. A person new to Magick and Enochianknowledge should first receive some basic occult trainingbefore using a Tarot such as this, because once an AstralPathway is opened, it stays open, and the whisperings of angels and other astral beings that come from using such a system may disturb some people, banishings never remove the entire spectrum of astral contacts. Also-from other peoples writtings, it seems that the pyramids of the Watch-Towers are scryed with the idea of looking \\"down\\" at the top of the pyramids, it is far more powerful to, instead, look \\"up\\" at the pyramid, as if you were in the pyramid and looking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Promising Deck","review":"The deck is great and the companion book covers so much it is definately worth a look. You can create the Enochian Tablets from the cards, then see what tattvic tides are surrounding you, then go skrying into the Enochian Pyramids. So much more.My only complaint is the depiction of the Angels themselves. It looks like they used the method of each letter stands for a feature and built a picture of that entity from that, which is a great idea and fits perfectly with the Golden Dawn tradition. However, they appear very cartoonish like they cut and pasted it all together, I am sure visualization and actual working with the angels will make the image better.Other than that I love my deck fits in my hands nicely. My first readings were using the Tattva side and they were clear and to the point, the way I have come to expect guidance from above. Hope this helps in your quest for knowledge. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome deck!!!!","review":"i just got the book and deck in the mail today,any one who studys and practice's goldendawn style magic only has to glance at the deck and see the elemental colors along with the enochian and hebrew counter parts will begin to feel right at home with the deck.it is going present a great way to scry into the sprit vision along with a host of other technique's the book it comes with is over 300 pages with a wealth of information on how to use the cards,the deck to me looks flawless theres only a couple out there like it i highly recommend it.............."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cards are great but I have one question...","review":"The cards are great, a lot of information on them. I absolutely love them, and since my grandmother had a huge interest in Enochian, they help me be a little more close to her.I do have a question about the Geomancy. The book doesnt reference it, so I looked it up online. It's another way to represent the elementals, but they don't seem to correspond to the cards. For example: The Geomancy of card 60 is Earth - but the card represents The Water of Air of Air. The Geomancy of card 83 is Water - but the card represents The Air of Air of Earth.Can someone tell me what i'm doing wrong?Thanks,George..."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMNIBLANK IS THE BEST EVER!!","review":"The first time I heard Omniblank, I immediatly fell in love with their music and everything about them!

When it was released, I went to the music store to buy it, and they never heard of it! I recomend that you buy this cd off this site, or somewhere else online; because there's a better chance that it will actually be there! Omniblank immediatly went up to the top of my playlist, from the first song I heard; when someone asks me to recomend a good band or music; I ALWAYS tell them about Omniblank.

This cd is so beautiful to listen to the quartets are not overly long and just the playing by arditti quartet is brilliant. Im starting to buy more Ligeti. I would put this quartets up with Carter,Berg,Webern,Ives just to name a few"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Example of Modern Classical Repertoire","review":"What can I say. These pieces by Gyorgy Ligeti are superb. The Arditti Quartet do an amazing job of bringing these pieces across in an intelligible way. Some people find modern classical music confusing or difficult as it doesn't follow the traditional rules of rhyme and rythmn however the Arditti do an amazing job of fleshing out all of the emotion. After they are done you know you have listened to an exceptional piece of music. The playing is at times stunning.I recommend starting with the \\"andante and allegretto\\", which represent his early work, first, and then moving to String Quartet No. 1 and then No.2. This will help condition your ear (and brain) and gives you a nice sense of the evolution in Ligeti's work. It also leads your mind into the more difficult string quartets easily and gently. Very highly recommended and a must have for fans of modern repertoire or beginners looking for a way to expand their understanding of what music can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I stopped reading it while he was describing Jane's lineage, since she's related to Elizabeth Woodville, Edward IV's queen, the author says she had two children with Edward IV.

I am a very consistent size 6.5, so when that size fits so awkwardly, I have to assume it's the way the shoe is made.

The arguments he puts forth against Catholicism are the same arguments that have been put forth since the reformation, and the standard anti-Catholic rhetoric comes into play (e.g. He accuses Catholics of worshiping Mary, even when Catholics themselves deny doing anything of the sort). He frequently twists the Catechism to suit his own purposes by not providing the quotes in context, and saying a word means one thing when to Catholics it means something entirely different.If your a Catholic steer clear of this book.If your an anti-Catholic Evangelical looking for confirmation that you made the right choice, look no further for the propaganda you seek lay within."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mike Gendron is a dime a dozen","review":"Yet another \\"dime store\\" evaneglical using anti catholic rhetoric, anti protestant rhetoric to steam his personal cause.I caution all those who need to be fed the Gospel of Jesus Christ NOT to follow another \\"dime store\\" evangelical who claims to know more Christianity then every christian denomination including Catholic. And who also claims to be an authority on sacred scripture. Anti Catholic rhetoric is the steam behind Mr.Gendron's efforts unfortanetly. Very in appropriate approach and something Jesus warns us against.Personally, I'd rather not waste my time arguing over bible verses while there are murderers, slanders, and abortionists running rampant!

My boyfriend does installations for a cable company, and has to climb poles with spikes called \\"gaffs\\" attached to his shoe. You cannot attach a gaff to this shoe because of the sloped heel. So if you are looking for a work boot and you'll be gaffing poles or trees unfortunately you'll have to bypass this handsome boot. But if you want it for any other reason I highly recommend it. My boyfriend is still sulking over the fact that we had to send it back because he liked it so much.Pros-- Everything you want in a work boot, AND you'll look goodCons-- Cannot gaff in this boot, you'll die...that is literally the only reason this boot isn't getting five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're what I wanted","review":"Its been hard to find high top boots for yrs, every one must want 6\\" or lower.

The lowest lace hooks are on a piece of floating nylon strap, I guess you could remove it if you wanted but I don't get the point - it just makes lacing up slightly harder since you have a potentially moving target.I have wide toes but my heal is normal, these boots (14Wide) are great for my toes but loose for the heal; my heal tends to move around more than previous boots but that has been getting better over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The devil you say!

It does sit quite a bit straighter than some of the other seats, and we will have to have a pillow for Sofia's head when she tips forward to sleep, but I love the structured headrest; something functional as well as comfortable when so many are just cushion.

When last I checked, she still had not received the manual even though I called three different places. I think the product is good, but that was not a good mistake to make. Obviously the person I talked to was in a different country, because of the difficulty of communicating and the echo that was on the phone. I am surprised that AT&T would have such a bad phone connection for customer service. I will be going to my mother's in two weeks and can perhaps correct the problem then.

I have to press off -then phone -then off- then phone until a connection finally is made. The worst thing is you can only speak on one phone at a time. Each phone acts independently - so will not function as an extension. You can switch to speaker phone, but it requires everyone be in the same room to hear. The speaker phone quuaity is only fair. I needed a 2nd extension and it was not clear to me in the description that this phone would not work that way. The only thing I like is the answering machine.

I highly recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent sequel. Lots of different home video options.","review":"All in all I think Legacy is a better movie than the original. Better directed, sound, and acting. While I think the plot was on par with the original. Also, the film just looks great, the art direction is phenomenal. As a sequel though I think they kind of dropped the ball on it's potential. Instead of exploring a \\"Grid\\" with personified modern technology, they instead chose to go into a \\"Grid\\" only slightly more advanced than the original. Effectively bringing absolutely nothing new to the Grid other than a new special effects paint job.Legacy has 4 different blu ray options, one of which is a bad deal here on amazon. The 5 disc edition (not the identity disc set)costs $50. That means it's $5 cheaper to just buy the 4 disc combo at $25 and then buy the original Tron on blu ray for $20. You save $5 and you get the original Tron in it's own box and a 2nd disc for dvd format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, lousy collectable packaging.","review":"I had this set on pre-order as I'm a big fan of the original movie and enjoyed the sequel to some extent.After watching this unboxing video for the collectable 5 disc pack, I've decided to cancel my pre-order asthe packaging just looks cheap and tacky.

The single best thing about the movie is the leather jacket Sam Flynn was wearing early in the film. That gets the single star. I suppose the initial flash of art direction and set design get a bit of props but geez, the acting is pathetic, the direction pitiful. The script is a hodgepodge of ideas and lines from other sci-fi films of the last 35 years. This thing is an unqualified disaster. It's the 2010 version of Avatar...another empty, plotless triumph of art direction over content in 3D.

The CG Flynn was horrible and kept taking me out of the experience. Surely Disney animators could have created a better visual that that.If I had spent any time and money seeing that at the theater last December, angry would not even begin to describe how I would have felt coming out of the theater after Tron:Legacy ended.

The movies are entertaining. The sound quality of the original Tron movie was quite good on DVD but it is much better on Blu Ray. Tron Legacy has reference quality sound and a superior soundtrack. If you have a decent quality home theater, Tron Legacy has many scenes that you can use to show off your system. Both movies have great video image quality with Tron Legacy again being the better of the 2. That's hardly surprising considering it was made 20+ years later than the original Tron. My TV cannot display 3D images so I can't comment on what I've seen of the included Tron Legacy 3D blu ray but I will say that I was impressed when I saw the movie at the theater in 3D. Additionally, I will point out that I've seen many reviews that were quite positive regarding the 3D blu ray of Tron Legacy. Even if your TV is not able to display 3D images now, it's nice having the 3D blu ray disc in case you get a 3D TV in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going all out","review":"This is it!

At first, the temperature was 2 degrees higher then what I set it to. Soon, it was 4 degrees higher. Finally, it consistently kept it at over 8 degrees higher, and at this point the LED/heater never shut off. Soon it stopped heating altogether.

When I woke up, the tank was at 86 degrees and rising (the light indicator was on) and my fish was fading fast.

Over night it even went down to 74.6 degrees inside my tank with the heater on. I even turn the heater up to 80 degrees still my little 3 gallon tank temp is at 75.

It stopped working correctly after 10 months even though I treated it well and was always careful. I think the internal thermostat is broken, it turns on and off but even turned all the way up it's only heating to 65F which is not warm enough for my brew, I need it about 71F.

Finally I turned the temperature control all the way up (supposedly to over 87 degrees). Now my tank temperature is at about 73 degrees. That's pretty sad since the room temperature in my house is also between 72 and 73 degrees.

It's a kind of 'How to' manual for life.The ideas, concepts and information in this book are truly clever and insightful. There is a lot of insight and wisdom that anyone can use to improve all aspects of their life. You can't help but think \\"That is so clever.

Good examples for all the 8 rules. Marriages may be made in heaven - but miracles are made by this book. The author suggests clear guidelines on how to achieve success (in love) by \\"letting go\\" - not compromise - but letting go. Submitting yourself to the supreme power and having faith in ones own mind - he /she can create a mode which can relive one of all stress and generate long lasting love.

There are no original thoughts here, no specific or concrete advice, and no sense of logic or literary ability whatsoever.

And don't be fooled by the title. There are no male/female \\"Mars/Venus\\" pearls of wisdom here (gender issues are barely even mentioned). The only thing scarier than the way the author is trying to keep his shaky career alive with this tripe is the fact that some folks actually do seem to be taking it seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"DESIGN NOT AS BRIGHT AND VIVID AS PHOTO","review":"I have been buying Corelle for over 30 years now.

The drama was not believable, I mean how many accidents can possibly happen to one group of people over the course of a summer?It seems like every book I pick up recently is a romantic suspense and some of the authors just need to write romance stories and stop wasting their time and mine with mediocre crime drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooo Predictable","review":"I have enjoyed reading Kat Martin books for years.

It is Cat6 so it's faster than you need and the cable is flexible and that is good.

This book virtually ignores it, which I feel does a great disservice to readers. Many (most?) magazine house plans do not include braced wall requirments, which are part of the above building code. It would be nice if this book addressed this important section of the UBC. Also, it seems every time I have a building question and go to this book as a reference, it leaves me dissapointed. For example, requirements regarding grading and setbacks from slopes, etc., which can be pretty cryptic in the UBC. OK for general reading, but not a great reference book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works for me","review":"I needed a book which would give me some ideas for designing my house, this one did it.

The card may be faster but that's the max speed supported by the USB 2.0 port on my computer. I also tested WRITE speed using a 100MB data file and it took 4.5 seconds to copy which is also very fast.My previous card (which was expensive at the time) only runs at 4Mbps.According to the Transcend specs it can operate up to 266x. The x refers back to the data rate of a traditional 2 channel audio CD running at 1x speed which works out to be 150Kbps if you do the math.So if their specs are accurate it can go up to 150Kbps x 266 = 39.9Mbps.

I live in northern Maryland which gets a variety of weather. I have my unit placed beside a row of Leland Cypress trees which provides some shelter. This should be good but it isn't because the trees allow dirt, chlorophyl, and bird droppings to collect.The problem is that you can't clean it. I've tried almost every commercially available cleaner including Chlorox Cleanup and a strong detergent solution of ammonia. The soil seems to have been absorbed into the plastic. I've been working at it for a total of 4 days now and it still isn't clean. Unfortunately, there is no indication of what kind of plastic it is so there's no way to determine how to clean it.It works well; I've had an electric lawnmower, a professional edger, and other items in it for several years with no problems - except that it is an unsightly eyesore!

The only thing that got in was snails - they ate the print off the cardboard boxes. In future, I'll store the books in plastic boxes, but the cardboard boxes are fine as long as you put a piece of paper over the top so the snails don't get to the books. All three doors still work like brand new. There's a plastic bolt on one door that you can push down for securing. One door holds the other one shut. Excellent product for this kind of storage, I'm buying a second, and maybe a third.

I've had mine for around a year- and as a musician- I find it priceless. During sets, I simply switch it on- throw it in my cord bag (which is out in the audience)- and then switch it off at the end of the set. When I get home- I very easily and quickly download the contents onto my computer. This thing's been great for me; it's almost like throwing a third ear out into the audience as far as performance feedback goes (great flat response from the built-in mics).By the way- in case you're wondering- it takes me less than twenty minutes to download and burn a CD once I connect it to my Mac (I then use the CD to review and practice against while driving in my car throughout the week).I'm sorry if I seem redundant--but: It's a wonderful machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Accessory","review":"My WS-320M is absolutely wonderful.

I returned it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Other much better choices","review":"I bought this without inspecting it in any brick and mortar store based on some favorable reviews. Opening the package I was startled to see this toy. Small in electronics is usually good. But this is so undersized that using the controls is like threading a needle; it takes your full attention. Not really handy if you make personal notes on the fly or want to listen quickly. Second issue was the construction. It's made of a plastic that seems to scratch if you just look at it. I thought iPods were prone but this lowers the bar. The sound quality is ok but not spectacular. I was actually relieved when my luggage was stolen and it contained my recorder. With my compensation I'm looking at the Olympus DS-40 or DS-50. The DS-40 is priced similarly to this unit but has 512 mb and the DS-50 is about $100 more for 1 mb.

Although I always assume that a built-in mike is usually not that sensitive, this one is worse than my old Sony cassette tape recorder. This is not a proper tool for doing archival interviews, especially not over the telephone. The built in USB is good design, but it doesn't take the place of some sort of removable media. Now that Sony is getting rid of its minidisc voice recorder, there only seems to be a Philips voice recorder out there with SD memory, but it's very expensive. I'll go back to magnetic tape recorders until the real thing comes (back) along. I bought this recorder and sent it back the very next day. I'll think twice about Olympus again.

But the genuises at Olympus redesigned the location of the USB plug in relation to the plastic housing of the unit - so now it doesn't fit into my computer (a Gateway).

That's right... you have to lay it down and cover up the \\"feature\\" of having mic ability in all directions.Sound quality is mediocre, at best.Software? no. It's a no frills recorder with the price of a frills recorder. For this price, it should be bluetooth enabled, or possibly have sound editing software. Or a FF Rv option... even if the next chapter button was to go in 5, 10, or 30 minute increments.Plastic... cheap plastic. One of the worst places I've put a hundred dollars. Do not buy this.

I bought it assuming it must be a sensational improvement over the Olympus DM series, only to discover that it is inferior! Yes, it is awesome that it can record for 35 hours in high quality stereo instead of 2.25 (so you can store an entire project on it), doubles as an MP3 player and pulls apart to plug directly into the USB port without an extension. However, the background hiss, regardless of the mode you are recording in and the distance of the recording source, kills it for any serious work. (At first I thought it was my fault -- I must be using it incorrectly). I do not need it as an MP3 player, I already have an iPod. The cosmetic changes are only that. I am quite dissapointed. Back to the DM-10. Stick to what works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good features, bad plastic case","review":"A beautiful product with alot of features from Olympus however worked for only 3 months after purchase date. Why:1. Plastic case - Because of the plastic case you cannot store this device in tight places (pants pockets) or places with vibration which caused my unit to fail after only 3 months. This isn't a rugged design.2. It's very tiny - This makes the unit more fragile especially with a plastic case.3. The tiny built-in speaker magnet will attract ANY metal crumbs and is very difficult to remove them from the tiny holes, which will result in audio noise/distortion during playback by speaker.Also voice record-to-playback navigation is cumbersome - It's difficult to go from recording to seeking for playback.Overall: This unit works well under intensive care but will fail in harsh conditions because it is so fragile. It is pricey too. At $200.00 Olympus failed to replace my unit and all music, lectures, and data was lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for speech...mediocre for recording music","review":"My first impression of this little device was: \\"How in the heck can they put so much memory into something so damn small?\\" It's small! I bought this device because I am a songwriter and I like to capture lyric ideas, melody ideas and vocal basslines without having to wait until I get home to try to recall them... For this function, the device is wonderful. It's a great capture tool. However, don't expect it to be very good quality for such things. It gets the ideas, but the recorded quality is just so so. I don't know what the bit rate is, but it's pretty low. (CD quality is 16 bit...this is like 2 or 4 bit at best). So don't be fooled by the 44.1K sampling rate and thinking that this will record CD quality...not happening.

It is very light, very compact, and conveneint to carry. It works well enough on a lanyard, though there is some rushing noise picked up as the device moves across clothing.The sound is more than acceptable for a novice singer who wants to record himself and others, then listen later with a critical ear. I've recorded sessions of the chorus and end up with a sound that holds up well on a stereo. The basic controls are straightforward, though it gets more cumbersome trying to do more than simple operations.The AAA battery seems to last longer than I had feared.If I break this one or lose it, I would not hesitate to buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dharma book I've been waiting for!","review":"Not just a great Dharma book, Instinct For Freedom is a love letter, an amazing love letter.

I don't quite remember how it broke, but it had some force to it, so the chain itself is very sturdy. Also considering I never take it off. As for the pendant, I assume only the chain and the front of the pendant is sterling silver. As I stated the back of my pendant now is copper or rusted. I did try to buff it out with a sterling silver rag, only the front of the pendant gleamed. I'm incredibly attached to this necklace though and I do encourage you to buy it.

I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews as they were spot on. First, the single tank for clean and dirty water is a PAIN.

You are constantly emptying and refilling the tank.The separate compartment for the actual cleaning solution never seemed to empty, so I guess the machine was just spraying water. Next, as others stated, it does not seem to do a very good job of extracting the dirty solution. When I would go to empty the tank it was usually less than half full. The carpets felt very wet and took quite a while to dry. Finally, after only a few uses and 6 monthes the thing doesn't spray anymore. What a waste of money!

Overall, I like this machine. The tools work great and vacuumed water actually goes into the tank. It cleans the carpets really well, but leaves too much water in it so it takes forever to dry. Since the Hoover machine vacuums most of the water out of the carpet leaving it almost dry, I now use both machines (UGH, more storage space needed). I use the Bissell to do the cleaning and the Hoover to pick up the water. It sure would be great if someone would produce a machine that cleaned carpets, the tools worked, and the most of the water was removed from the carpet. Imagine, one machine that would do it all!!!!

Its influence throughout so much later cinema, such as Woody Allen, Airplane perhaps is paramount, and there are certainly classic episodes such as the mirror scene. But I found that many of the gags fell flat, wordplay that was neither very clever or very funny, and some of the parody aspect such as the music hall comedy pastiche looks rather dated and not in a immortal, timepiece type of way. For me, I prefer the slapstick of Woody Allen's earlier films, but the Marx brothers are well up there as classic comic producers of all time, so who am I to say.

Its pluses: lightweight, easy to assemble and use. Many minuses, however. First of all this model will probably cause hearing loss over time, as it is ear-piercingly loud. On bare floors, it does not pick up large crumbs very well, preferring instead to shoot them in random directions across the floor. It seems to work fine on carpets, although it is difficult to push. The air rushing through the vacuum comes up through the top of the canister and blows everything around. I vacuumed under some curtains, and the \\"wind\\" made them billow as I worked.

More than that and suds remain. Perhaps if you have pets or kids who play in the mud a lot you need the higher amounts, but my \\"normal\\" wash sure doesn't warrant it and in fact seems to work better with the lower amounts.

Well in some ways, it's just as good and in others, not so much. The sound is again pure classic metal, Saxon style, but the catchy riffs found on Killing Ground are not as prevalent here. It does have some really good tunes, but it's not as good a listen as Killing Ground was which is a little disappointing. It's still a fine listen, I just wish it was as more catchy overall as Killing Ground was.The DVD has some cool live footage of Saxon doing their thing live and gives you another perspective of what these guys are about.Overall it's a good cd, but nothing outstanding. I still they can do better, but am still happy they are indeed still around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep, Saxon will take young rockers to school","review":"With a band like Saxon it's hard to say if this album or that album is their best. With an entire generation of some of the best rock and roll ever made it's simply a matter of whether they are on top of their game or not. There is no question about this album, they are on top of their game.The production is excellent. Lyrics have the usual mystic thought provoking images as well as the brute force power of the rock and roll love affair they've been living forever. Biff delivers these lyrics with dead on talent and power. Biff's voice is a tad raspier than in the younger days but that is not a negative. He sounds excellent. Full range, tough and never better.They may look a bit Minnesota but they definatley play California"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere else to go..","review":"To my utter disappointment, Saxon worked again with producer Charlie Bauerfeind, a producer specialized in European power metal bands, the ones that use double-kick drums all the time, sing only about the Templars, dragons, magicians, whatever. The result was tragic in LIONHEART, the previous Saxon album, because basically there was no Saxon in it anymore: just pedestrian and generic European power metal.The formula repeated itself in this album. There is no spark, nothiong brilliant, not one song even close to become a classic.Anyway, any band that lasts for so long in the very difficult music business has incredible merit and should be praised, not criticized.Buy this album if you're a Saxon completist or if you're into generic European metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lemmyrules1","review":"Good effort by one of the most enduring bands.Wish the Song I got to Rock was the Lemmy and Angry version.That is the only thing keeping it from 5 Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saxon Kickin'","review":"If your a fan of Saxon add this to your cd collection.

It turns itself off every few times while you're using it, so it cools down and then you have to reheat it. That makes it almost impossible to use. I've only been able to use a handful of times because of that, and in the end resorted to a hair dryer to finish my hair. Very light weight, feels like it's made of cheap stuff. I bought it when it was more expensive, that was so really a bummer. Made me really wary of buying from any outside vendors on Amazon and even Amazon generally. Amazon, you should totally dump this product and whoever is selling it.If you want an excellent wet to dry iron, try the T3 brand one.

These are gualities that those who desire a permanent underclass are trying to eradicate. In 50 years or less, viewers will find it hard to understand a character like Havers - \\"Why didn't she just sit at home and have an easy life on the dole?\\" As someone who thankfully was born before the War on the Poor (not on Poverty as advertised) and was able to move up the socioeconomic ladder quite a few rungs, I find Havers a fascinating character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good single from the 7th deadly sin","review":"I have listened to Valuable game over and over and have come to the conclusion that Ice T can take any song sample it and make it sound hard core.

Oddly, ours came with a pillow which was not the same size as the toy box. Not sure if they are all like that. It just hangs off each side a bit. It looks better without the mismatched pillow, so I use it on another standard size toy box. A small child (30 pounds) can stand on the step between the horses. She likes to sit on top with her feet on the step, as if she is the coach driver. The lid closes with a controlled mechanism, so it is pretty safe. Not as big as some toy boxes, but very pretty.

I'm using it with a thermostat.The installation was a bit alarming, because the suction cups only stayed on for 5 minutes at first. Then I reset them 3-5 times, and they stayed on long enough to cover the cable with the sand.

They do perform the tasks they are designed to ie they measure liquid and solids. I hate that the measuring set, specifically the cups are not weighted properly. By this I mean that when they are empty or filled the cup bottoms do not remain even on the flat surface. They tend to tip or tilt toward the handle. If there is a liquid or solid in the cup, it causes it to fall out. Therefore, a carefully measured amount of food can become not so carefully measured when it falls out on the counter or floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal!","review":"I bought this set of measuring spoons and cups because it was the cheapest. I mean, who needs $20 measuring spoons? But I have found that I really like the overall design of these cups and spoons better than many of the more pricey ones available. The are comfortable to use, and good quality.Be aware, though, that the plastic is fairly easily stained."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy","review":"This measuring set is a good buy! The handles each have a nonslip rubber coating, which makes this set useful in the kitchen. Everything fits together nicely with a little plastic ring. The only thing to consider is that the set tends to be a little taller instead of wider, so when you put all the cups together they may be too tall for a smaller drawer. Overall, I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional and frugal!","review":"Several of my European friends (who use the metric system) needed cost-effective kitchen tools to measure ingredients for American and UK recipes and asked me to find them a solution. Since this set offered both cups and spoons for less than other items offering only one or the other, and they wouldn't be using them every day, I figured this was the answer.Sure, the cups tip over when nothing is in them and they're not top quality, but the handles are easy to grip and they get the job done even if you use them all the time for every recipe, all for under $7...well, now for under $9 with inflation and today's prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable set.","review":"Very affordable and functional set of measuring spoons and cups -- much cheaper than I've seen in stores (LNT, BBB, ...).The white printing on the handles looks kind of cheap -- but, as I examine it, I see that it's raised plastic surrounded by the black rubber on the handles, so I think it's probably quite durable.Quality isn't exceptional or anything, but it does the job and is quite cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy plastic measuring tools!","review":"Well, shame on me. I lost everything in a fire last year and needed all new kitchen gadgets and appliances. I liked the fact that this set had so many pieces, but within six months, the plastic lining began to peel on the interior of the cups. I have thrown them out. I am still using the measuring spoons, but will toss them too when I find a decent replacement set. I am moving on to stainless steel, as I should have in the first place. I had too many items to replace to spend a lot of time reviewing items and think clearly. Fortunately, these have been my only disappointment from my Amazon purchases.

We lean over his shoulder as he coaches such talents as Doc Gooden, David Cone, Andy Pettite and Roger Clemens. We also learn some about the funnier side of the Yankee dynasty. Players taking out their frustrations with bats on the toilets of the clubhouse, pitchers punching and braking their hands on walls; and pitchers making off the record derogatory comments about their opponents to the press which are later published. All in all this is a book all Yankee fans should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate book!","review":"This is a big book on Matchbox toys!If you love these toys you will love this book.Its colour pages of various matchbox toys will help you reminisce your childhood days with your favourite matchbox toys.This is a brilliant history of matchbox toys with superb photos and a story to impress.If you can find a copy of this book,grab it.Its worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY special album","review":"If you've been into brass for 40 years, you probably already know that this is a very unusual gathering of the top of the top!My only complaint is with the web site sound samples being MONO !This album is in STEREO and really portrays the placement of the 3 major antiphonal quintets!

Take the symphony for 100 metronomes. One hundred metronomes are wound up and then allowed to wind down until they all are silent. The 19 minutes here of that are unlistenable-it is nothing more than maddening tick-tocking with no interesting occurences either by chance or design. The pieces for barrel organ and player piano are played at incredible speeds-but to no purpose whatsoever. This sort of playfulness may have been amusing to Ligeti at the time but to the listener it is not at all entertaining.

But after reading this boring and terribly self-indulgent book, my opinion of her has lowered drastically.Quite frankly, her life growing up and all of her wonderful friends and aches and pains are not worth reading about. Now if this was more of a balanced autobiography that combined her professional and personal lives, the book would be much better. She grew up rich (she admits the Great Depression did not affect her much) and became quite successful.

Unlike many authors, Professor Mark Nathan Cohen, presents a set of premises consistent with evidence provided from a wide range of disciplines (history, anthropology, epidemiology, biology, geography). Cohen indicates that his work may not be completely correct and new data will either continue to support his ideas or may change certain parts of it.Cohen also admits that he is only an expert in one field and has had to have help to ensure he has properly understood other fields data. This makes it, in my opinion, very reliable.This would be a great starting point for anyone interested about understanding the spread of diseases and health conditions. Dr. Cohen has roughly 20 pages of external reading options for anyone interested in pursuing the subject further. It was a clearly, well written, intellectually challenging piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I discovered this artist from the \\"French Cafe\\" CD (also an excellent taste of several different French artists).

My son seemed scared by some parts, and my husband walked in the room and said, \\"this one is really weird\\" since the first song only adults could figure out.

Well, maybe the number of pixels were there, but the color saturation was not! The picture was muddy and washed out. There were no adjustments on the display whatsoever. Brightness adjustment was mentioned in the manual, but did not exist. I am now going to order a Philips frame. It does not have all the bells and whistles and the frame is a little too modern for me, but all the reviews mention a truly outstanding picture quality.

In the book, Cohen avoids reading back into the Bible itself and considers a great deal of other historical and literary evidence to determine when being a Jew changed its meaning from 'being from Judea', the geographical location, to 'being a member of the Jewish religion'. He finds the first traces of this in the Hasmonean period, expansions of it in the Roman and up through history. Along the way he is also tracing the beginnings of Rabbinic Judaism after the fall of the Jerusalem Temple, which is quite different from what constituted Judaism before that event. All of this would probably be very surprizing to those who hold anachronistic visions of Jesus as a Rabbinic Jew!. Cohen also goes into quite a bit of detail on matrilineal descent and conversion, maybe more than some would want, but interesting nonetheless. Good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A UNIQUE BOOK ON THE ISSUES OF JUDAISM","review":"Unfortunately, this book did not achieve attention and respect as it appropriately deserves.

Perhaps because of this, the sound quality was always poor.Finally, to search for music you must do it with your TV on which was a little irritating.

It is the worst piece of consumer electronics I have purchased in 20 years. The device itself is nice. It is small, connects easily, and sounds good. The PC software on the other hand is pathetic, and even worse, Linksys has essentially abandoned this device. Others have written about XP SP2 problems, but Linksys is clearly over their head in this market. This device only works with obsolete versions of Microsoft .NET. Microsoft has released at least two versions, plus fixes, beyond the version supported by this. The host software also has trouble when you rip new music and add to the managed folders. The Linksys loses track of huge portions of the music folders until you reboot the computer. Very amateurish effort by what otherwise is a decent company.

It's design and performance suggest an early prototype, 'proof of concept' rather than a polished commercial product.The on-screen user interface is fair. It's easy to use but it's not flexible. For example, to find the 400th artist, you have to 'page-down' endlessly through the artists listed alphabetically above the one you want.Worse, it occassionally issues the helpful message, \\"error\\" on startup and then fails to work. Re-installing the software fixes it but that's ridiculous.There are no on-device or even software controls, so you are 100% dependent on their flimsy remote control.Wait for version two (or three, or four...) before considering the Linksys.

Even a mapped network drive is not acceptd by the WMA's Media Folder Manager software. You simply cannot use these 2 products together.Counting these 2 pieces of hardware, plus the 300GB Maxtor drive, I have $600 invested in a non-solution. Look for a better way. Linksys support folks simply say that the 2 products are not designed to work togther. I do not understand how a company like Linksys can overlook this.

Even after I connected the device via ethernet cable, it still could not find it. Calling tech-support didn't help at all - they had no idea what to do. The installation guide was a little weak - not much information and virtually no troubleshooting tips. I was finally able to configure the device by connecting it to my TV first.However, once the installation was complete - I fell in love with it instantly (hence my 4 stars). It is definitely worth its price tag. The connection to my 802-11b network was flawless - i have it connected to my home theater receiver and i finally feel as if my huge collection of mp3's have been freed from their computer prison.

Something about killing Nazis, who represent pure evil, set against the backdrop of the Greatest Generation, makes this a great franchise. I recently got my PSP, and was looking for a new game for my trips. The price could not be beat, and, much to my surprise, neither could the gameplay.First, it was far more detailed than I imagined; almost no change in graphics from PS2. Second, the missions are alternately easy and hard, giving you a good sense of challenge and accomplishment. Finally, the use of the controls is actually good. Shortcuts, like a double tap right to bring up a grenade instead of cycling through your inventory, help a lot.Overall, I just wish there were more missions!

Fortunately, this soundly executed title fills the void well enough to be worth buying. The single player mode has some nice maps but disjointed missions and a fairly short campaign. If you have a friend with a PSP and a similar fondness for vintage weaponary, the multiplayer mode significantly adds to the replayability.

What a disappointment! I feel the translator does not have a thorough enough command of the english language to have translated such a great work of literature. The only thing more disruptive than the translation was the editing. There are typographical and editorial mistakes, not to mention simple grammatical mistakes, throughout the text. (Dare I say on almost every page?) These errors made it extremely difficult to read the book with any fluency.

The colors of the animals are much more muted and, with no pinks or purples, the rug looks drab compared to the rest of the room. As impressed as we are with the rest of what we purchased from the Malawi line, this rug is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I agree with some of the other opinions.

He is a man who is borderline of needing help, but manages to make it through life without it. He is his own worst enemy. Barney gets married to Minnie Driver, a woman who has wealth and class. She wants to be the perfect wife, but Paul won't let her. Why? Because he is in love with a different woman, Miriam (Rosamund Pike) who he met briefly at his wedding reception. While most men would get over it and move on, Barney does not. The inanity of the situation is what makes the story mildly humorous, but lacks full comedy credentials.The story might be considered a heart warming love story if not for the situation which leads one not to feel for Barney or for Miriam who agrees to the nonsense. The story kept me entertained, but only because of the antics of Barney and whatever gems he might say.F-bomb, sex, no nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH AS A GOLDEN GLOBE WINNER","review":"Based on a novel by Mordecai Richer. The film was 12 years in the making and when finally finished several Canadian actors made cameo appearances. Tales focuses on a man in the twilight of his years looking back on his life, most notably those of his three wives with a slight subplot of whether he murdered his best friend or not. The acting is high end and I can see why Giamatti got best comedy actor by the Golden Globe. Rosamund Pike plays his third soulmate wife who isn't able to forgive him (even though one could argue the husband's drunken action was related to her time spent with an associate she later ends up marrying in the tale) but still remains in his life. Dustin Hoffman plays his crass blue collar style father and Minnie Driver is the main character's overbearing second wife.CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; THEMES: B plus to A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: today."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book received in great condition","review":"a high level volume of sophisticated articles on corporate officer level strategic issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressive dust collection","review":"I couldn't wait to get this thing.

I own a business that used to repair speakers and am quite experienced in the use of glue. Nothing sticks like a good epoxy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay glue but dries up fast!","review":"This glue does an okay job at being able to stick two surfaces together and obviously it works better on some surfaces than others. However if you are trying to glue wood together I suggest you use epoxy instead of this Gorilla Glue, I have found in my experience that epoxy generally works better than any type of functionality that Gorilla Glue can ever provide you.One major problem however that I encountered in my experience in using Gorilla Glue is that only after a few uses of the glue the entire 4 oz. bottle would just dry up and harden. It became more difficult to use the glue after every use due to its constant hardening. This made me very frustrated as I had barely even used half the bottle and was forced to then throw it away, this is a big drawback of this glue to me. What use is it if there is such a limited amount of time to use it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this glue - a must have for any homeowner","review":"I have glued stuff that no other glue would come close....such as outdoor stuff...like ceramic, molded plastics etc. This tiny little bottle goes a long way as only need a little.Does not replace superglue or a general adhesive as it expands as it dries (about 3-fold)....this is handy for a lot of thinks but not for a delicate item or wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good!","review":"Dries very slow! although on the sticker it say dries 2x faster. oh, c'mon, takes forever, and then often leaves that white foam...not happy with the product.And yes, this is not the first glue I am using in my life and I know how glue should work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gorilla super glue is terrible","review":"I bouth this recently to fix a handle on an umbrella - tried twice but after holding for 30 secs per instructions I got no bond.

I glued a block of wood on a wooden gate 3 years ago and still holding strong but I wish they would fix the cap.I bought a small bottle after the first one hardened up on me.

It has some major drawbacks. It is not water soluble so you cannot wipe the excess with a wet rag (I had to use lacquer thinner). It expands quite a bit which means even if you wipe the excess initially, you are still going to have it coming out of the joint. Don't even think about using it to glue anything without using clamps, as the expansion of the glue will cause the parts to move.

Had this been some herculean task, I could see the Gorilla Glue not being effective, but for the two inch-long weatherstrip to not hold was ridiculous! However, it wasn't until the next day that I noticed the Gorilla Glue had dried under the molding (without holding it down as intended)leaving a giant, rock-hard piece of glue. Furthermore, the glue had caused the paint around it to ripple, thus not only fixing the original problem, but now creating a new one. Thanks, Gorilla Glue!

This was a fantastic storyline and the book started out great, but began to fall apart during Conner & Hope's first tryst in bed. This scene wasn't all I had hoped it would be, and all of the love scenes afterward were disappointing as well. It seemed as though Ms. Martin didn't put a lot of thought or time into them, and they all seemed the same. The chemistry and sexual tension I felt in the first part of the book was lost. The dialog started to lose its way as well and became mundane, however, I did love learning about Spanish galleons; I commend Ms. Martin for her research in this area. To sum it up, this could have been a fantastic read and started out that way, but it seemed to fall apart and started to drag. I agree with other reviewers that Hope's cowardice became annoying as well.

Anyone who bothers to post here probably loves Tool, as I do, however 10,000 DAYS has little progression in the songs, and is made up mostly droning riffs that go nowhere. None of the epic sound of past releases.Perhaps the biggest disappointment is the production; maynard's voice is way back in the muddy sound of the guitars, and never wails above when it should. And where are the great searing guitars(?), mainly boring unimaginative riffing.A few high points, but way too many boring minutes - all the ambient filler further makes me suspect of the effort. The silver lining? Tool will tour and we can hear the rest of their catalog...Lateralus was Tool's peak, with Aenima only slightly less brilliant.

Hard to beat Szell when it comes to Wagner.I very much enjoy Eugene Ormandy with most Tchaikovsky works and a few others, but his Wagner is spotty. The Philadelphia string section comes through great....sometime too great. When I am expecting the brass section to make their statement, I have to concentrate just to hear it.

Take a tour of four colleges that you might like to attend during the summer or Christmas of your senior year. Summer is best, since class will be in session, but you HAVE to visit to have any idea what the school is like. Asking older friends what the strengths and weaknesses of their colleges are will also be more productive.

Really. Goldman never met Bruce, but sure made some money off of him.Do not diservice the memory and great work of Lenny Bruce by purchasing this tome of lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ladies and Gentlemen - LENNY BRUCE!!!","review":"I once took this book to be the final word on the life of Lenny Bruce. Subsequent years have proven that the late Albert Goldman's research methods and conclusions leave much to be desired. His 1988 biography of John Lennon was written with a mean-spirited bias that is difficult to comprehend. It was also littered with errors of fact.As far as I'm concerned, a precise, comprehensive biography of Lenny Bruce has yet to be written.Tom Degan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do they have a website?","review":"I want to see them live.

The umbrella had the Adorama logo on it ... not a big deal. What was a big deal is that the umbrella appeared to be used. The rod, end of the umbrella is damaged like someone had clamped on it to tightly already and the umbrella's rod appears to have been shortened.

The book don't has market strategies, but this biography of a stockbroker can help us to understand a bit of the market's psicology and how the brokers see the trader's behaviour. Althought it had been written seventy five years ago, the people that work in the market today seems to react in the same manner that the old ones. It's a agreeable reading, but not recommended to people that look for market strategies similar to those found in Livingston's Reminiscences."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like to waste time and money","review":"This is one of..no wait, the worste 80's b movie I've ever seen, and I've seen alot.

And the sirius technical support cannot and will not do anything for you. Today I called the warranty line because my device won't even turn on now, at all, and they said the device is on backorder for at least 2 more weeks and someone will call me to tell me when I can mail my device in get it fixed!!! So I already haven't been able to use my device for 2 weeks and now who knows when I will get a new one! This device has caused me so many problems I would save yourself the stress and headache and not buy one. But if you do, BUY THE WARRANTY FROM THE STORE YOU PURCHASED IT FROM! I can't stress that enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"S 50 Headaches","review":"I've owned the S 50 for just 1 month and it has to be sent in for warranty work already.Seems the memory is shot according to one of Sirius crackpot tech team. Told it might have taken a powersurge by not turning off the S 50 before turning the car off.I find that extremely hard to believe and a major inconvenience if thats the case. I also bought the home kit which was quite over priced as well.THe main reason I purchased the unit was it's tivo like abilities which cant even be preset so if you want to tape Stern you have to sit there and record every 2 hours.Quality wise I find it not as good as standard fm radio and no where near DVD quality..Thumbs down.. Unfortunately it's the only way to catch Stern..Save your money and buy the cheapest model.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst company I have ever delt with","review":"Purchased a new S-50 in Aug 05. Never worked; repair service told me to go to hacker websites to repair myself. Returned Mar 06, repair dept, takes 3 to 4 hours on hold before answering phone. Brad in repair said S-50 isn't very good, should buy another model. The only thing worse than this radio has to be their customer service. Last week received a refurbished used S-50, but they didn't send the docking station,and some cables, they said \\"Sorry we are out of them\\". Over a year and still no radio service. Last year they were $350, now the are $129, and still overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"s50 - worst product ever","review":"The S50 is by far the worst product I've ever dealt with. It has a lot of potential but unfortunately it just doesn't work. I've already exchanged the product once because it wasn't working properly and now I am having even more problems with the functionality. I also have to say that it is not user-friendly at all. I've spent hours and hours sitting on hold trying to get through to Sirius and wrote them an e-mail with 11 issues I have with the product that I shouldn't have if I'm spending $300 on a radio. Needless to say, their response to my e-mail was short and sweet saying that would e-mail my complaints to the product support department. Thanks a lot Sirius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I don't write reviews, but this is one I think you should read. I bought this unit 12/7/05 and until 1/25/06 the unit worked fine. I then encountered numerous bugs which ultimately ended in me not being able to listen to the programming I am paying $13.00 a month for. The forums at www.siriusbackstage.com regarding the S50 have been moderately helpful but have given me virtually no hope in terms of seeing this unit to a healthy state again. Unfortunatly my return period has expired and I am left to deal with the less than perfect manufacturer warranty. Luckily I haven't subscribed to the lifetime plan with Sirius, because that only allows the subscriber to switch between receivers 3 times.As with any new technology, I guess there is a period where the bugs need to be worked out, but I STRONGLY suggest waiting until Sirius does extactly that with the S50. At a fraction of the cost, you can go with a more reliable alternative in the meantime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone else have this problem?","review":"First I think it's crap that this thing is suppose to hold 50 hours of recorded shows but not continuous hours like, say, a 4 or 5 hour show (like some of the shows on Sirius are).Anyway, my reciever will work fine for days and then one day I'll come home, turn it on and... nothing. It's like it's been wiped clean. No background graphic for the channels, no station names and best of all no sound at all. I got online and updated the software and (eventually) it worked again. Sometimes I can just take out the battery to reset it and that'll work, too. This adorable little quirk has happened enough times now that I could just as easily smash the S50 with a sledgehammer and not waste anymore time with it.But if and when it does work it sounds good."},{"rating":"2","title":"s50 Works Very Well, but not completely portable","review":"I bought the s50 when it first came out and 2 years later, I'm still in love with it. I bought it for Howard Stern and I got a good system going. I program it to record the show in 3hr chunks. Then when I get home or on the weekend I hear the shows. It would be great if it could listen to a show while I record one. However, that's really my only complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty design, faulty manufacture, faulty service","review":"Please do not buy this product it will fail as mine has making it an expensive mp3 player. Sirius tech support will finally tell you you are tol, buy a new radio.If you are a life time subscription holder you will be out the $75.00 transfer fee, new radio, new docking stations. Sirius has no interest in waiving the transfer fee or offering a discount on a comparable radio.Sirius is only out to make a huge buck off you, somebody has to pay Howard.Have an xm player thats been through it and still works fine.I'm now a firm believer in the saying \\"Sirius Sucks\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Like DVD / TiVO for you radio","review":"I am pleased with the unit. It functions well and looks great. The sound, as well as the viraity, is great, and the preformance of the unit is near flawless. You can record and rewind what you are listening to, plus you can load your own stuff. I travel a lot and it it is great to have. I haven't used it as an MP3 player yet, but so far it is a great unit. The only draw back that I see is that there are still national shows that have not signed on yet, but if you like sports, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat unit, but with problems.","review":"I bought an S50 in May 2006. I worked fine for about a month, then would not pick up the signal at all, then it wouldn't even come on or boot up. I have to say that Sirius was good about sending me a brand new unit (with the agreement that I would send the bad one back within 30 days) within a week of calling. However, the new unit hardly works at all. It turns on fine and does pick up the digital signal, but the sound quality is horrible. Tons of static. I have tried about 10 different station settings (which the Sirus customer service gave me the stations that work best for my area) and only 1 station works slightly. I will get an FM adapter (Sirius is currently, of course, sold out right now) and see if that works. If it doesn't, I will throw the S50 away and get a Sportster, which by the way, I have had in my other vehicle for a year with not one problem at all. My advice to buyers is to avoid the S50, but consider the Sportster if you want digital radio."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],B={key:0},W={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(C,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-83648a29"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/15.md","filePath":"sponsor/15.md"}'),j={name:"sponsor/15.md"},L=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{R as __pageData,L as default};
