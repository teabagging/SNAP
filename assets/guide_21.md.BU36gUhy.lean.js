I listen to podcasts as I ride a train to work everyday and was looking for headphones that were not in the ear, provided some noise reduction, and didn't irritate the top of my head. These fit the bill for being external and comfortable, but I was not able to hear much of anything while on the train. The headphones allowed pretty much all external sound to leak in, and if I turned the volume up high enough to hear the voices, I am pretty sure the sound was leaking out to my seatmates as well. If you want to listen in a quiet environment, they might be just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD SOUND STANDS UP TO SWEAT AND WATER","review":"I like these and have three pair and have used them for years. I sweat heavily, no problem. Apples earphones, the new ones with the mic for the iphone die in sweat. I have washed two pair of these Sony earphones once each in the washing machine full cycle and they survived and provided a nice clean sound afterwards. Now that is a tough earphone"},{"rating":"2","title":"my #1 phones","review":"So my favorite pair of headphones from 10 years ago had the ear cushions finally crumble off. Of course I just couldn't find new cushions to slap on, so I tracked down these: the new version of my beloved Sony headphones. When I did a general search nothing could compare. The features I like: 1) the clip-on ear is comfortable for me (convenient spring action) since I hate the earbuds (too intrusive) and over the head ones are bulky & mess with the hair. 2) the behind the neck connection. Most phones Y-up from the front, and so one phone just hangs if you only want one on to listen. This way they can sit nicely on your shoulder/s. 3) Super compact, easy for travel. I use them at work and while flying, and they're great. I'm sure this pair will hold up as great as the last, it has a nice smooth and strong cord. As for sound quality, I'm not a snob, it sounds good to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen up","review":"Ear buds are uncomfortable for me, so for years I used an old set of over-the-ear, padded headphones. When they finally conked out, with that annoying buzzing sound, I selected these Sony headphones. Having used them now for over a month, I've decided that these fit the bill. They're very comfortable to wear for a couple of hours, they're light, look decent, and sound just fine. I use them primarily for listening to audio books, so can't comment on how they function with music, but for my purposes, this model is just right. Sony makes a quality product, and the price for this one is reasonable. Well worth the small investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for running","review":"Only issue with these is that the cord is a little too long, and I cannot find replacement foam pads for them. 12 inches shorter would have been a perfect cord length. Still, these work great for me for running; they allow me to still hear what is going on around me, and do not get loose. Earbuds always fall out and are not comfortable for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not suitable for people with small ears, ok sound quality","review":"This headset is not suitable for those with smaller ears. When I jogged, the ear pieces always fell off. The sound quality is not the best, but it is ok considering that you are only using them for short-term use while working out. The material that are used to make this headset also seemed not too durable, although I only used this for 1 day so I can't speak to how durable it is in the long-term.However, if the ear pieces actually stayed on my ears, I would keep them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the negative","review":"These earphones are great. The sound is not too bass-laden and you achieve great sounds while being able to hear outside noises. I have no problem keeping them on my ears, and the reason why the cord that leads from one earphone to another then to whatever unit you're using them with is so long is because I believe Sony meant for us to have the option to run the cord behind our necks, so that it's not hanging under one's chin. Forget the naysayers, these earphones are just the right fit for my lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Not Mentioned that Cord is Asymmetrical","review":"Design is nice, but both the Amazon description and the packaging failed to mention that the cord connecting the headphones is asymmetrical. The reason I had ordered this set was because it was one of the few that wasn't listed as having an asymmetrical cord. Will be returning/reselling."},{"rating":"2","title":"great but not really comfortable on ears","review":"I bought these headphone for a long while and they still work great. I used to buy cheap earphones like 9,10 dollars and they didn't work after weeks. Eventually just through money away into the trash can. These headphones look great. The cords are longer than you need. After wearing these headphones for half an hour, my ears bones start to hurt.but over all they are great quality headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I listen to books on tape to fall asleep and have gone through so many pairs of earphones it isn't funny. These do not fit my ears very well and they flop around. Granted I do not have dumbo ears but more like hamster ones that are hard to fit. My dilema is, should I wish for bigger ears or more suitable earphones?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate these headphones, they hurt my ears.","review":"I bought these headphones for working out. The sound is pretty good, nothing exceptional or bad. My biggest problem is that they really pinch your ears after 5-10 minutes. The springy clips rotate around, but not out. They compress the upper rigid parts of my ear and it's quite uncomfortable. If you have a normal or petite ear / head you will probably be alright, but if you are a little bigger in either department these may hurt. No matter how I adjust them I have the same result. I will be switching to behind the neck headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for one purpose","review":"I have to keep my ears covered when I run, and these headphones are perfect for that purpose--they fit comfortably under a snug hat or ski headband. They also let in a bit of background noise, so I can avoid getting run over by bicycles/buses/whatever.The catch is that when they're not smooshed up against your ears, there is a *lot* of sound leakage, so I wouldn't recommend them for the morning commute or any other situation where you're trying to drown things out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother","review":"Most people who'd be looking at these headphones are probably looking for something that's stylish enough to wear in public. If that's true for you, don't bother with these. The way these clip on bend the top of your ear downwards; and believe the other reviews when they say they make their ears look foolish. Furthermore, after wearing these for only a few minutes, the tops of my ears turned red. On the plus side, they seem to stay on alright, even though they tend to feel as if they're about to fall off any second. The sound quality is also really decent for headphones this size. But if you're more concerned about quality than comfort and looks, I'd still suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll stick to my MDR-G52","review":"I have very sensitive ears and can notice distortion in sound quality so much that a bad set of headphones kills the experience for me. I have had a set of MDR-G52's for almost 6 years and they have served me well. I picked these up thinking they would be a good alternative. I was wrong...The sound quality was attrocious. It was tinny and whiney sounding. These phones make every thing sound as if it were shifted all into the high frequencies. I listen to alot of hard rock stuff where the lows are important, I couldn't listen to anything because the distortion of the headphones made my ears very fatigued after only a few minutes.They don't fit well, the ear pieces have popped off twice on me and I have been overall dissappointed by this product. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has sensitivity to sound distortion or who has sensitive ears like mine. Your experience will be just as painfull as mine was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Headphones Ever!!","review":"When my cheap Koss headphones (which I loved) stopped working after a few years, I decided it was time to upgrade to Sony. The design of these headphones looked similar to the Koss ones except these looked cooler. When I got them and tried them on I noticed immediately that they didn't fit securely. I decided to give it a try anyway and took it to the gym. Big mistake. It felt like it would fall off at any time, it didn't fit closely over the ear so the sound quality was awful, plus having a wire across your neck looks ridiculous. As soon as I got home the gym, I ordered Koss headphones like the one I had before, which is what I should have done in the first place since it's cheaper and better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"if someone knows of a better model, please let me know","review":"Great sounding, and reasonably comfortable. I've used this model for several years. I'm a fast/hard runner: they slip slightly during hard runs, and the cord gets tangled very easily while in my bag. I've purchased several other models of sports headphones in this price range trying to find one that doesn't have these relatively small problems. Alas, all were far inferior, so I've returned to using these. (One Sony sounded better, but didn't stay on; two (JVC and Panasonic) stayed on well, but sounded awful by comparison. Others were prohibitively expensive and had bad customer reviews.) If anyone discovers a better model to try, please post here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great headphones","review":"Headphones sound great, very light & comfortable. The cord is a little long. In addition the cord seems to be an attempt at a tangle free cord, but previous versions of Sony headphones like these had better tangle free cords. This one seems like a cheaper version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I have had these headphones for four years and they're just starting to fall apart. I just bought a few more because I love them that much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment is always bitter...","review":"These headphones produce great sound, but they make your ears bend in odd-looking ways. Expect to be laughed at, while wearing these in public, because I sure expect to.The peculiar design of the grips only serve to make it difficult to put on. I spent at least a minute trying to get it right, and when I did get it, it still took about 10 seconds to put them on correctly! Not only that, but they don't feel right. I don't get that oblivious feeling, while wearing them, so it's annoying.My advice? You'd have more comfort wearing the old MDR-G63LP model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Awful and Uncomfortable","review":"Looking back, I'm really not sure why I bought these. They fit horribly, don't have good sound quality, and are awkwardly designed. The cord twists up and is impossible to straighten. Definitely recommend finding a different headphones set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ones I Have Ever Owned","review":"I have owned a lot of these kinds of headphones but I gave these ones a try on a whim and two years later they sound and feel as good as they did when I bought them. The sound is great and the way the feel on your ears is amazing. They are also very durable, I have dropped them yanked on them crushed them and they continue to keep on playing and for once the ear foam doesn't rip off from every day use. Overall these are some of the best I have ever found and if they ever did break I would buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent product","review":"It's nothing to write home to mom about, but they're a good pair of headphones w/ no thing hanging on top of your head or behind your head (streetstyle) & you can let someone else wear them w/ no worries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...I expected more","review":"Looking for headphones to go with my iPod, since the earbuds that came with it hurt if I wear them for long periods of time...Not impressed with these headphones. \\"Rich bass\\" my ear -- the cheap headphones that came with my last portable cd player have better-sounding bass. These Sony headphones are tinny sounding, and I need to crank the volume to hear anything through them (or press the 'phones to my ear -- the spring clip doesn't have enough tension to put them in that place for me).On the plus side, I suppose, they are comfortable to wear - I don't find that they \\"deform\\" my ear in any way, and they don't hurt. They'll suffice for running, but I'll be sticking with the Apple earbuds for other uses (plane trips, at work, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are great!","review":"I ordered these as replacements for my iPod. They're extremely comfortable and have a good sound to them. The thing I didn't like is that they're a little bulky and stick out a ways, so you can't lean on anything wearing them. They also don't stay pressed against my ear very well.

Wide open, its performance is better at f2 than its slower 24mm f 2.8 sibling at f2.8. Optically, I believe that this lens is also better wide open than Nikon's celebrated 28mm f2 Nikkor and 35mm f1.4 Nikkor lenses. Like the 24mm f2.8 Nikkor lens, this 24mm lens has floating elements to ensure optimal performance up close. This is a splendid lens for landscape as well as indoor photography. If I still owned Nikon equipment, I would have eventually acquired this superb lens to replace my 24mm f2.8 Nikkor. Like all AI-S Nikkor lenses, the 24mm f2 Nikkor can be used on virtually every Nikon camera ever made from the original Nikon F to most of the current Nikon autofocus SLRs, but in manual focusing mode only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheryl Crow LIVE FROM LONDON","review":"Beware this dvd does not play on region code 1 even though it says all regions in the description.

But more importantly, in a crash, the metal rod of the roller will become a projectile, imbedding itself in whatever may be convienent.

However, the novel is too choppy to follow and the constant change of locations made it difficult to form any real attachment to the characters. Just when I was getting engrossed in the story line, Russell jumps to someplace else and we are on to another plot. Too many main plots all going on at once and not enough pertinent information to connect them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should have been better","review":"I listened to this book on audio since it was broadcast on XM Book radio. I thought I would really like it, since it covers a subject matter I have routinely enjoyed reading about in the past. I was surprised at how much I didn't like this book. It was very hard to follow with so many characters being introduced in rapid succession. Also, the story line moved from location to location so fast, that I found myself getting disoriented. The reader also read very fast, which only served to compound the problem. I didn't feel connected to the characters and was not moved by the story, as I would have expected to be. I wanted to like this book a whole lot more than I did, but instead, I listened to it because it was on and I have a long ride to work, but I was wishing it would end the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiring Tale of Human Courage","review":"As I have indicated in my many reviews of books from this period, I am a fan of tales of the human courage that was displayed throughout Europe in WW2 by ordinary people doing extraordinary things in the face of incredible danger. In as expert a fashion as Alan Furst inThe Polish Officer: A Noveland Douglas W Jacobson inNight of Flames: A Novel of World War II, Mary Doria Russell brings us up close and personal with compelling characters we care about. Expertly crafted are Doktor Schramm, the Nazi deserter trying to reconcile the sins he committed in the name of the Fatherland, Don Tomitz, the Italian catholic priest putting his life on the line to save Jews, and a host of others whose lives become intertwined in the earthy reality of war time in Porto Sant' Andrea. Bravo for a highly readable tale of human courage. You'll stay up at night to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Stock Figures","review":"Certain types of characters are a given in novels about WWII and resistance movements: the fiery, doubting cleric; the loner antihero who drinks to forget; the noble, self-sacrificing woman on the homefront; the oafish, seemingly dense but surprisingly heroic peasant... A Thread of Grace has these characters, but Mary Doria Russell fleshes them out superbly so that they seem fresh, and surrounds them with a bounty of unique, distinctive friends, enemies, and kin. In fact, my one criticism of the book is that there are almost too many characters to keep track of; happily there's a list of major characters in the front of the book to assist.The writing is precise and insightful without being distractingly ornate. The story moves quickly. The fates of the heroes and villains are more often than not unexpected--and as was the case in real life, too often heartbreaking. If you're looking for a haunting, thoughtful story that will resonate long after you've finished, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gracefully woven","review":"Unlike Ms. Russell's previous works, \\"Thread of Grace\\" takes place in the past, not the future. Incredibly well-researched, it begins with Italy's armistice with the Allies, which is not good news for the Jewish people living in Italian-occupied territories. Accompanied by retreating Italians, they flee for Italy, only to discover, soon after, that the Germans have mostly taken control of Italy, too.Italian Jews and foreign refugees must all go into hiding, many assisted by Italian Catholics, and a few Italian Jews who hide in plain sight. We also meet many of the German officers who control the small, fictionalized area of Italy in which the story takes place.Just like \\"The Sparrow\\" and \\"Children of God\\", however, Ms. Russell's characters are wonderfully crafted, and the story is told in a remarkably beautiful manner. Faith, philosophy, humor, warmth, despair, and humanity are all wrapped up in one moving, poignant package."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thread of Grace","review":"Absolutely breathtaking....Characters that will haunt you long after the last page of the book.Set in World War II Northern Italy, Mary Russell follows the lives of several Jewish families escaping the wrath of Nazi Germany only to find that the arms of Germany reach far into the boarders of Italy. Share their triumphs and tradgedy as Mary Russell weaves a Thread of Grace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and moving","review":"and in some respects life-changing. A bit tough going at the beginning but worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating portrayal of little-known historical events","review":"Very interesting novel based on extensive research of the northwest region of Italy after Italy capitulated during WWII and the Germans then occupied Italy. The story describes the tremendous risks the Italian people took to hide both Italian Jews as well as Jews who had escaped from other Nazi-occupied countries.Although I have read numerous Holocaust-related stories, I was unaware of these historical events. Mary Doria Russell is to be commended for taking a complex subject area and creating a tapestry of people to bring this story to life.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great historical novel","review":"Mary was able to capture many moral dilemmas inherent during wartime withiut shedding judgement. Shramms dilemmas and ensuing explanations allowed areader an understanding of how things could happen. This book wasan excellent read especially as causes one to think in a new way."},{"rating":"2","title":"After getting the characters straight, I couldn't put it down","review":"I realize some of the negative reviews were because of the switching back and forth between characters but I felt, with the story line and the period it was written, this was the only way these stories could be told. I learned so much, historically, about the Italian's part in the war and the horrors they were subjected to. I would recommend this book and don't be put off by the multiple characters....I enjoyed all of them to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Tedious","review":"I liked the setting and the story but found it overlong and hard to wade through. I gave up and didn't finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a mess","review":"Russell's third novel is as chaotic as the guerilla war of its setting. There is no clear protagonist, nor anything like a linear plot. The novel has as many major characters as any by Michener, but with only half the pages and covering a span of two years, not hundreds. Just when someone becomes interesting, Russell's onto someone, or back to someone we've forgotten, who's by the way no using an alias (make sure to refer often to the reference guide at the front of the book). With only 40 pages left in the book, a major new character literally drops from the sky. Why? And why should we care?Russell's prose is, as always, beautiful, and the themes she explores are rich and provocative. The title refers to a on old Hebrew saying: No matter how dark the tapestry God weaves, there is always a thread of grace. This is more of a patchwork quilt, but filled with grace nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"book condition","review":"Book was in nearly new condition and I felt comfortable giving it as a gift. I felt it gave a wonderful viewpoint of the role Italians played in rescuing the Jews and it also a beautiful love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nihilistic drama","review":"I realize lots of people like this book, but I want to insert a word of caution. The book is engaging and gripping, but ultimately, it is a nihilistic view of this period of history. There are no winners, not even survivors, only victims. No triumph over the Nazi evil, no future for those who fought them, no State of Israel (one character, after losing everything of course, wanders off to \\"Palestine\\" and is never heard from again.) The woman who lives past the war can never look forward, but remains in grief over the past. Religion (both Jewish and Christian) is whimsical and finally irrelevant to life and the future. I do not recommend this book to Holocaust survivors, and I hope no one would suggest making it required reading in school. It can be enjoyed as a melodrama, but it is not instructional."},{"rating":"1","title":"No depth","review":"The book jumps around and is hard to follow, but the real problem is the resulting lack of depth and lack of connection to the characters. I should have stopped after the \\"prologio\\": Page 1, incest/rape; page 2, factual inaccuracy (Jehovah's Witnesses did not exist at that time); Page 3, It's Hitler! Yikes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"I've read many books on World War II and yet somehow remained unaware of the history behind this novel. This book was haunting and beautiful and heartbreaking. The characters are rich and varied. Ms. Russell convincingly shows that the presence of doubt does not mean the absence of faith. Iacopo, the Italian rabbi, tries to address the issue of why God allows suffering and his thoughts on this subject are some of the best I've read. The horrors that the Italians and Jews suffered at the hands of the Nazis are vividly portrayed. The way two of the characters try to do penance for their wartime atrocities keeps the characters deep and three-dimensional. The only reason this review is not 5 stars is that I found the complexity daunting -- too many locations and minor characters. Regardless, I highly recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"though fiction, the human spirit comes through","review":"As you read this book, take heed of the warning given to a girl in the first pages \\"Save your tears, you may need them later.\\"It is a powerful, moving story. I learned a lot about Italy during WWII...partisans and citizens, especially.For a synopsis, read the publisher's reviews.In my opinion, you do, however, as a reader, sometimes need a character list. Fortunately, it is provided before the first pages of the novel.As I got used to bouncing between characters, I began to see the thread that bound them all together. By the time I finished this novel, all were woven together.And, when the book is finished, you will have need of the tears you saved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing but a little impersonal","review":"After loving The Sparrow so much, I wanted to read another book by this author but I have to say, this one did not measure up for me. A Thread of Grace is a historical fiction novel about about Jewish people and those who helped them in Italy during WWII. While this seems very well researched, well written and was a great story, there were so many characters and we never really got to get close to any of them to really care enough -- I mean the stuff that happens is awful but it seemed so impersonal . . . I wanted to feel the story more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Trip Into the Near Past","review":"My only complaint about this book was that I frequently got some of the characters confused. This may have been more from my not reading the book on a daily basis, than the author's fault.It is a fascinating look into a side of WWII that I had not considered and a group of people I had not thought of. The author really does a great job putting you into that time and place and with those people. The culture came alive for me.The story was easy to read. I could easily follow the plot, and was surprised by where she took some of the characters (despite my having them confused). If you are interested in WWII history, I greatly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling novel","review":"From history, Russell has taken this story and turned it into a compelling novel. Italian citizens saved more that 43,000 Jews during WWII. The story opens in 1943 and Claudette and her father flee across the Alps to Italy with other Jews seeking refuge, only to find an open battle among the Nazi allied forces, resistance fighters and ordinary Italians struggling to survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best novels I've read in the past few years.","review":"I guess I'm a fairly late-comer to Mary Doria Russell's work, but I thought this book was amazing. Yes, there were lots of characters of all ages and nationalities, lots of locations (mostly in Italy), but Russell made everything (and everybody) come alive through her writing.I'm not into science fiction, so I'll probably not read her two first books, but I've already ordered (and am looking forward to reading) her fourth book, about the Middle East in the early '20's.And, even though there were not too many characters in \\"Thread\\" left alive at the end of the book, I'd be interested if she wrote a sequel.That's the mark of a good novelist. She leaves the reader wanting to always know \\"more\\" about her story and people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must read Quickly","review":"Mary Russell's book A Thread of Greace is a very difficult book to read. Keeping track of the main characters is a challenge unless you sit down and read it all in one or two settings. I see it as just another story of how the WWII holocsust affected so many people and I don't enjoy reading about that subject anymore. I would encourage the author to return to writing science fiction novels. Her first two novels are supurb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the editors?","review":"By page 43, there were at least two grammatical errors in this book. The author deserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly evocative","review":"This is a well written and interesting read if you have ever visited Liguria its easy to imagine the difficult terrain and the warmth of the people. Not your usual war story it blends all aspects of war on the local population with the influx of Jewish refugees and their impact trying to escape. The cast of characters include Jewish locals who with their Catholic nieghbors attempt to prevent the Germans from deporting Jews fleeing from France into Italy. The local Italians risk their lives in the process and many pay the ultimate price, based on fact it is not well known that these events took place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courageous Italian Resistance","review":"The little known story of Italy's heroic resistance to Nazi occupation. When the Nazi's move to invade and occupy Italy, courageous Italians work at risk of their lives to help the Jews, who until then had found refuge in southern France, survive. This book clarifies the work of many priests and nuns who risked also their lives to shelter and hide Jewish children and families -- contrary to the apparent distance Pope Pius XII manifested toward the Nazi annihilation program. As with all great historical novels, we become intensely involved in the lives of the main characters and learn to experience the heroism and even the humor tucked within each terrifying day."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll be shocked by the intro...","review":"Based on true accounts, A Thread of Grace traces the journeys of several Jewish families excaping Nazi invasion through the Italian alps. It also chronicles the lives, loves and disappointments of an Italian Jewish operative, his childhood sweetheart and family as well as the life and inner workings of the mind of an AWOL Wehrmacht doctor. Until reading this book, I had not heard of the trek many Belgian Jews made into Italy during WWII. The characters, while many, are realistically portrayed - particularly on an emotional level. You can smell the mustiness of the Jewish rabbi's study, feel the heat and dust of the trail and tense at the threat of discovery. A brilliant saga!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Doria Russel Writes Another Great Novel","review":"It's been a few months since I've read this, but the novel is on par with all of her other books, deeply engrossing story with very engaging characters. The novel takes a glimpse of WW2 that, although has been hashed out by others, gives a view of things from yet another light. Mary Doria Russel has an amazing knack for pulling the reader suddenly into a story. I was unable to put the novel down, despite knowing what the ending would, given the subject matter, would be.

The port and plug located on one side of the cube which you add kibble is about the size of my middle finger. Impossible to clean even with a bottle brush. I soaked the kibble out and refilled it to give the toy a 2nd chance. Found that the plug shaken loose from the port and I later discovered it chewed up. This render the toy useless.

My cat is definitely less anxious and restless since getting it. I just wish that they made a version that was easier to clean, and perhaps even chew-proof (I wouldn't leave the hard plastic unattended with a hard-chewing rottweiler, for example).

Also, it can be pretty tricky for dogs to get the treats out, so I would say this is an 'advanced' toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cube is a pretty horrible dog toy","review":"I have a german shepherd puppy and even he is not interested in this toy. We tried rolling it around for him and he was not amused. he ate the treats that fell out (like 10 at a time) and then left it where it was. Buyer Beware. It would be better if it was actually soft plastic but its hard and uncomfortable to play with for him. 1/2 star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"I have used the buster cube for years with various dogs. It is by far the best interactive treat toy. Believe me, I have tried everything and always come back to this cube.

I shook it and rolled it every which way, nothing came out. It wasn't easy to load, either. I tried it with tiny treats, it made no difference.I tried a few different times, we couldn't get treats out of it, so the dogs quickly lost interest. My friend said it's her dog's favorite treat dispensing toy, so I gave her another one instead of tossing mine in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE! Dangerous to Dogs","review":"We had one of these cubes for 3 years for our English Springer Spaniel. He loved it. One day he got his canine tooth stuck in the round insert. He immediately began howling in pain. He was howling so loudly while my husband and I safely detached it. I have never heard my dog cry this way before, or since then. We immediately threw away the cube. By the way, the cube was not damaged when it caught his canine tooth. It was a freak occurrence, but one we would never chance again. We were lucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's me!","review":"I used to think of myself as She-ra when I needed to do something tough, but now I have a new super-hero! Rose is what I aspire to!

But when I first saw Vicky (the biker babe's name) I loved her from that moment on! I found out from the web site of the strip that Vicky has become a favorite character by those that read the strip. She's got that 'Wild Woman' attitude that I so enjoy. The only thing that I was disappointed in with the book is that most of the strips didn't have Vicky in them. That's basically why I didn't give the book a 5-star review. But it is good read anyway and I do highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"When I saw the cover with Rose's biker chick alter ego, I bought it thinking that ALL the strips were going to be of Vicki. I was so disappointed. Maybe I didn't read the description well enough.

These drawings were collected in an art show and a successful book resulted. Now Mark is back with a tongue in cheek guide to etiquette as it is portrayed by TV shows. Har-de-har-har. What this book lacks in humour, it certainly makes up for in the author's frequent asides to his former alcoholism, depression and various other monkeys on his back.

There are wonderful ideas in the book, but it's like sifting through a litterbox for the occasional golden nugget. I would really like to see an effort to repackage these ideas.

My problem is I didn't find it out until I'd had the part for over 2 months. I ordered a compressor, dryer and both A/C hoses at the same time. I received the compressor and dryer in a few days but the hoses went back order for months. I finally cancelled the order and paid to have the hoses custom made and that's when I found out that the dryer was the wrong part. Too late to be able to return it and no way to call and explain.

First person narration is often used and the accompanying photographs are interesting. Many of which are from personal collections of the veterans themselves and have never been published before. The book provides an interesting window that allows one to see how the \\"other side\\" lived, thought, and fought. Sometimes makes you wonder how anyone survived the indescribable horror of the Russian winter, let alone fight in it. It is the second in an exciting series of three books to date and well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sidded trash.","review":"This book is a very one sidded view of negative news paper and other articles collected that sheds only a bad light on this breed of dog.

There is no author, no opinion, no photogaphs and no real substance to this book.

Absolutely uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate - what more can I say?","review":"Well, they must not have much to do down at the Medical College of Ohio! Seems these animal researchers decided the best use of tax payers money was to gather together a bunch of news clippings (true or not) and put them in an impressive looking book so people would think they were accurate...They aren't. I found many glaring errors. For example, one \\"pit bull fatality\\" listed as happening in Seattle, Washington never even happened - at all! We've had two Briards kill a woman in Port Orchard, a Siberian husky kill and consume a child in Lacey, a rottweiler kill a young girl that climbed into their yard on the eastside and a rottweiler kill a 5 year old child in Kent - but no pit bulls killing anyone in Seattle!Many of the reports are for dogs which were later noted to NOT be pit bulls.This book is a testiment to the kind of waste of our tax payers money that goes on at Universities."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Desperate Attempt at Credibility","review":"This compendium of unverified news reports, unpublished opinion pieces purported to be 'abstracts' and other documents is a very weak attempt to provide a foundation for the banning of types of dogs.Unfortunately, it has no value as a reference work for anyone serious about the issue. While some of the self-styled experts who make unsubstiantiated claims about 'pit bulls' and other types sometimes use it as a reference, this is nothing but a desperate attempt to lend credibiltiy to what is essentially a myth.The only reason I would recommend this book is if you need it to refute one of the handful of people with credentials who turn to it as a port in a storm.This one is not for the educated. I rated it as one star because I couldn't give it zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leila Does Not Disappoint in Millennium","review":"Though not phenomenal, Millennium does comes thru as a good album that is worth listening to over and over. It will not be tossed by the wayside after a month. The album contains 77 minutes of mostly soft, jazzy music spread over 20 tracks. Although most songs are on the slow side, it does contain a handful of more groovy, upbeat tunes which won't put you to sleep. Leila's vocals can be sexy, vibrant, and at times, mysterious. Highlights of the album include the opener as well as tracks 4 and 5. She also includes a remake of the song \\"Bésame Mucho\\". There are a few boring songs, but overall it is a decent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brava","review":"This collection is great. Plenty of sentimental melodies with a torny voice that thrill you.

But with the version I got on Audible (which is a subsidiary of Amazon). The reader (can't remember his name right now). Had a way of introducing the 3 primary staff, and used the other characters secondarily. This is actually the first time that I have actually recommended the unabridged audio book over the book itself. I like any story that gets my imagination going, and this did. I'm new to Clive Cussler, and this is the first book I've read (heard) by him. I am hoping that it's not the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of best i have read!","review":"did not flow at all. had a hard time getting through the book. normally i can read it in two days or less. this took me a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money!","review":"I have read all of Cussler's books and have liked them all to various degrees. This book is a real bore. The characters have no personality (but, you know every move they make and everything that they eat). I kept thinking that it would get better so I finished it, sadly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, confusing and slapdash","review":"I should start by saying I am a big Clive Cussler fan and have read all his books. The only ones I have not enjoyed are the two Oregon Files ones.There are so many characters I could not remember who was who without having to keep looking at the cast list at the front.I reached the point of not caring anyway and just kept reading to get to the end. The whole thing reads like a Mission Impossible TV episode but nowhere near as good or exciting.The scenes in the UK were very sloppy; there are no such things as pound notes and the beefeaters actually guard the Tower of London not Buckingham Palace.I can only hope that it is Craig Dirgo that is the problem and that when the next Oregon Files book comes out written by Jack DuBrul (who I am a great fan of in his own right) that things will improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"While the underlying plot had potential, the story dies under its own weight. There are too many characters (the first hint of trouble is the multi-page listing of characters at the front of the book). This leads to too little time devoted to character development and too much bouncing around as we follow the many characters around the globe. The dialog, is terse, contrived, choppy and generally devoid of emotion. Having loved the Dirk Pitt and Brad Austin line of books from Cussler, I had wanted to like the Oregon Files as well. Unfortunately, I found Sacred Stone and Golden Buddha to both be underwhelming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Clive Cussler even READ this book??","review":"Mr. Cussler, please don't lend your revered name to such poorly written stuff as \\"The Oregon File\\" series. Your name on the cover, and your pic on the back may sell books to your loyal fans, but will quickly destroy our faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a rejected movie script","review":"Without the Clive Cussler name this book would never have been printed, except by a vanity press. The character development is shallow, with references to known movie stars used as a descriptive crutch in some cases. The \\"Cast of Characters\\" carried in the front of the book is fortunate, allowing the reader to keep track of the very forgettable characters. The book reads like a rejected movie script turned novel.Cussler again affronts his loyal fans whom he seems to take for granted these days. His writing has become careless, arrogant, and sloppy, beginning with the insertion of himself as a character in stories like Sahara and Valhalla Rising, where he rips the reader out of the adventure and back to reality. He has lost the right to a loyal following.Cussler's annual \\"Just In Time For Christmas\\" novels are off my gift list. I'll take pleasure in the search and discovery of other worthy adventure novelists who, I'm sure, are out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters and plots","review":"Ok, I bought the audio edition of this to listen to on my drive to work and back. This story almost made me fall asleep at the wheel. Too many characters or similar depths made it difficult to keep track -- in fact, I still dont know who half the characters were. Did Cussler write this book? Save your money and your sanity and get a different cussler book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged on and on","review":"I am a huge fan of Cussler. I thought I was buying a Cussler book. I was wrong. The writing style is entirely different and incredibly boring. As one reader mentioned, almost every chapter ends with sentences like: \\"His plan was to make the delivery, then locate a doctor. He had no way of knowing the next doctor he'd see would be a coroner,\\" or \\"The meeting broke up...he would grab a few hours sleep. He had no way of knowing that this sleep would be his last until the big one.\\" Ugh... they were so irritating that I found myself getting actually angry at this book. Halfway through it I put it down to go read the new paperbacks by Lincoln Child and Matthew Reilly, and then I came back to finish it. I have NEVER put down a Cussler before. I'm fine with the break from tradition (Dirk Pitt, ships, fun cars), but not from Clive's traditional break-neck action, drama and detail. I'm dreading reading any more Oregon Files."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can write this","review":"I started this book 4 weeks ago and today I just gave up. Very weak. No fun and I think this was just written to make money.

Have them all and love them....just not this one.PS Golden Budda rocked"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exit Craig Dirgo enter Jack DeBrul","review":"Not a very interesting read at all, Dirgo frankly does not get Cusslers style of writing and plot devices.

Hadn't been able to stop turning the pages of any of his previous efforts (and I've read them all), but this one was just too scattered/disjointed and had too little character development. Sadly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER AGAIN!!!! This is not even close to Cussler!!!","review":"I have read most of the *real* Cussler novels and am a huge fan. I read one previous Dirgo book (and hated it): I thought I would try again, but I couldn't even finish Sacred Stone!!! The characters have NO depth, the plot has huge holes, and the writing style is amateur. Sorry Craig, but with Cussler's name on the book the bar is set pretty high - and at this point in your career you're no Clive.It appears that Clive maybe consults on the storyboard of these new \\"co-authored\\" books, but then steps away. It is a shame, but these books will never satisfy a Cussler fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm really working hard to finish it but its a stuggle!","review":"I'm about 1/2 way there and its a struggle to finish - not Cussler's usual - maybe because there is another author and its not his? Way too many characters - I'm no dummy, but I have to keep referring to the front of the book to remind myself which one of the \\"cast of characters\\" he is talking about because he switches every other paragraph to a totally different scene with totally different characters. The story isn't bad - but beside the confusion of figuring out who he is talking about and where they are, there is so much extra non essential filler in it that it is hard to get involved in it. I hope it gets better as it goes along, but I doubt it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters have not one drop of personality","review":"I am a huge fan of Clive Cussler. His books draw readers into both the plot and the characters. Yes, this book is action packed so it took me awhile to figure out what was missing - personality. There is no chemistry between the characters nor any attempt to create any. Not one description of thought or feeling or sign of life out side the mission. These could have been robots - the Terminator showed more emotion. And did I need to be told at the end of so many chapters that the person was about to die? \\"He had no way of knowing that this sleep would be his last until the big one.\\" If you have to explain it to me that clearly then the story is not doing its job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!","review":"This can't be Cussler.

I am currently reading it (two-thirds of the way through the book). I am having such a difficult time getting through it that I thought I would check out some customer reviews to see if anyone else felt the same way. Well, lo' and behold... I'm not the only one! This book has way too many characters, too many subplots, is very difficult to follow, and it is boring. It tries to be thrilling and exciting, but it is NOT. Having read the other readers' reviews, I have decided not to waste any more of my time finishing the book. I may skim through the last 50 pages just to see how it ends, but I'm not going to spend any more hours \\"drudging\\" through one disappointing chapter after another."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU LOVE CLIVE CUSSLER, PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!","review":"When you walk into your local book store, and you walk past the B-C-D's in the fiction section, that stench that you smell is this book.The premise sounded great, but the story of this book would have been much more impactful had it been told in 100 pages instead of the bloated 500 that it took Craig Dirgo to tell it in. It seemed as though the only association that Clive Cussler had with this book was his name emblazoned upon the cover of it.This book was long, boring, almost completely without action, and a complete waste of time.So the next time you look for books, hold your nose as you pass this one bye. This one stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Don't waste your money on this one. Maybe it would be a good movie, but it isn't a good read. The characters are flat and the adventure is not believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cussler's first stinker","review":"Sacred Stone is the seventh Clive Cussler novel I've read and the third in his Oregon Files series and I can say without qualification, it's a stinker!Though based on an interesting premise, the author cheats often and shamelessly, asking the reader to ignore obvious plot holes and suspend belief in even the most basic of assumptions.I found myself preferring a quick game of FreeCell to finishing this snoozer. Too bad. I've had such a great time reading Cussler so far.Between managing 3 fiction series, his non-fiction works, movies, and NUMA, Cussler has spread himself too thin. At least Sacred Stone is forgettable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely gets 1 star","review":"I have read every Cussler novel before and after this. This is the only one that's taken me more than two days to read. Every new book, I look forward to sitting down on a quiet weekend and reading my way through the book. It was horrible. In fact, it gave horrible a bad name. I was crushed. Thank goodness this novel was an anomoly."},{"rating":"1","title":"First two thirds was okay, but last part was terrible","review":"I actually found the early part of the book dealing with the nuclear weapon okay -- not great like Cussler's books. Just okay. But there appeared to be a major change in style, going from a poor Cussler writing style to completely boring and pathetic. But I also had some sympathy for the American tycoon whose son had been killed by terrorists -- and he was the \\"bad guy\\" -- so I lost interest in finishing the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Oregon Files Bomb","review":"I have read every book Clive Cussler has written on his own (the Dirk Pitt series)and pounced on this new series. It is really awful. I didn't like the first one but thought I would give the Oregon crew another chance. WRONG. Not only was it wordy, wordy, wordy, and laced with so many characters that I couldn't keep them straight, but the narrator should be banned from the booth! He does really bad accents (especially British) and is so melodramatic that I hear a player piano going in the background. I will avoid HIM especially in the future.And the Oregon Files need to be put back in the cabinet. I hate to see Mr.Cussler ruin his great rep by putting his name on this trash.Where's Dirk and Al when you need them??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Characters","review":"I can't finish this book. Though the plot is interesting I can't keep track of the 54 characters the author threw into this book. I've haven't even been introduced to half of them yet and I can't remember who's who. The character names, occupations and purposes become a blur. I struggle to remember who are the good guys verses the bad. There is a list of characters in the front of the book, but having to refer to it breaks my concentration as well as the flow of the storyline. It's an irritation I can do without.The plot is good. I like the writing style too, but 54 characters in one novel is 50 characters too many. I don't read mystery novels because of the long list of characters. Maybe mystery readers can appreciate this Cussler novel, but it's too mind boggling to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather watch paint dry","review":"I couldn't finish the book it was so poorly written. The plot was haphazard in its construction, dialogue was confusing and I lost the will to live reading it. It's rare for me to have abandon a book as normally I still want to read what happens at the end. For this book frankly I didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"This short book is too long!","review":"Here it is .. short and sweet. The end of all the main story lines come to an end aprox. 35 pages before the book does! If you're around long enough to follow the myriad of plot points and countless main characters through to the end you'll just be more frustrated then satisfied. Would someone get Mr. Cussler out of his classic car garage and back in the saddle again? It's too obvious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks typical Cussler action.","review":"Cussler is a great writer. However, he missed the mark with Sacred Stone. Unlike other Cussler books, it failed to hold my attention. It lacked the typical action and suspense found in his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - Boring -","review":"I found this audiobook to be very dull and boring. The only highlight was the change in \\"tone\\" when there was a telephone call. The story was predictable and the reader was flat and monotone, I couldn't tell the difference between the male and female characters and the accents were dreadful. I will not be listening to, or reading any others in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair, very fair","review":"This is only my second book from Cussler - the first one I enjoyed \\"Golden Buddha\\" but this novel was tough to get through. Spoilers: Everything goes right. Is there ever a single scene where the Corporation has a problem/issue/event that fails. Not in this book!I will definitely read the next one in the series \\"Dark Watch\\" and hope for the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I have read most of Clive Cussler's novels, but I did not think this was one of his better ones. It is different from his other novels, as it is not a one man show like Dirk Pitt or Kurt Austin, but a group known as the 'Corporation', who have to save the world from the bad guys. I guess this makes the story a bit more believable.In this case there are two sets of bad guys. Islamic fundamentalists, who wish to blow up London, and a businessman, who wants to destroy Mecca. Both are trying to get their hands on an ancient piece of Meteorite, that will help with their plans.I found the book a bit monotonous in places, something that rarely happens in this author's other books, and a bit of a struggle at times. I felt there was way too many characters involved. I would not say the book was awful, but it is definitely not as good as the author's earlier works.If you are new to Clive Cussler, I would recommend, Sahara, Treasure or Dragon as good reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I hated this book. I forced my way through it and want my time back. The book was boring, hard to follow, and over complicated. There were far too many characters and I had a hard time following the plot and remembering who was doing what. The cast of characters in the beginning (6 pages worth) actually revealed the plot of the book. Do Not Recommend. This trend of ghost writing using other authors is not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious Prokofiev","review":"I have many recordings of the Prokofiev 1st and 5th symphonies yet I have never heard such serious, sober, and stern interpretations. It magnifies their power into something bigger than life. This is for better or worse Yoel Levi's doing. I think it is for the better since the music seems to make such a big impression on me. The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra shows that they are a major U.S. symphony orchestra near if not at the caliber of LAPO, NYPO, or the CSO. The Telarc recording is the weak link being only very good and not excellent or outstanding.In Telarc's own line-up I prefer this recording of the 5th to Paavo Jarvi's effort with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. This version with Levi is more sweeping and has more drama. In fact I probably endorse this Prokofiev 1st and 5th almost over anyone else's including Neeme Jarvi and Mstislav Rostropovich. It is that good.Highly recommended. Five Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-labelled 1960's Marketing. New only to the dumb young.","review":"This and the author's other book \\"In The Tornado,\\" are benign in that they say nothing that hasn't been said for 40 years by others.

But the very fact that Moore has managed to make this a bestseller shows that he knows how to exploit the mainstream ignorance on the subject by dressing it up in a \\"Silicon Valley\\" costume. The biggest fallacy -- which he acknowledges in the very beginning -- is that none of his hypotheses are actually supported by any data. And without data, these hypotheses can be called, at best, weak. For instance, in a current corporate buying environment where decisions are made by a multitude of people (and hence personalities and buying \\"profiles\\"), the classification of the buyer under a single model (like pragmatist, etc.) just doesn't hold. If you like to read a novel, Chrossing the Chasm may appeal to you. If you like good, solid, cutting edge marketing information, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Content, Horrible Proofreading","review":"This is an excellent book in terms of content. I work in the high tech industry on a product in the process of \\"crossing the chasm\\". Although I work on the technology side, I found this book to be a great crash course in marketing directly applicable to the situation we currently face. The concepts were so clearly presented that I passed the information on to a high school teacher who does a marketing lesson as his final unit of the school year.However, it is clear that the sole proofreading consisted of using spellcheck. For example, on page 182 of the text, one sentence reads \\"All that being said, what can the Internet due for a fledgling enterprise seeking to crossing the chasm\\".

This book gives us all practical knowledge about how to take our businesses from that small, little known phase of early adopters and get on the mainstream engine by crossing the chasm between those of us who are destined to remain a small business to one in which we really grow and proper and make our dream a reality in the mainstream"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful strategies for the next step.","review":"I don't want to suggest that this book will \\"revolutionise\\" the way you do business, because that would consign it to the trash can with all those other \\"revolutionary books\\" in my mind. This is a clear and concise workaday book that will help you to develop sales strategies that will deliver on your targets.We all know about the early adopter strategies, but few people concentrate on what happens next. Crossing the Chasm identifies solutions for chopping up the majority markets into bitesize pieces that you can hand out to your sales force and expect them to hit.This book gives you control over the targeting of your market and the realistic strategies that will capture market sales.

Even though it is getting old, since getting old in the computer industry is just a matter of few months, it is very, very good. Comparing what the author wrote and though what would happen in the near future to certain products and what really happened is also interesting.

Very well written, useful, clearly informed by ground-level experience.And then just when you assume that the *rest* of the book will be filled with variations on this single idea (like many business books) it goes into second and third gear, with real meat on market segmentation, 'whole products' and vertical vs horizontal market approaches. All of it analytically sound, practical, without the hubris that so often disfigures similar books.I'm a techie by training, but marketing has been my destiny for the last couple of years.

Thomas Dewey put mobsters in jail. He didn't take money from them and no evidence exists that he did. Hoodlum is a complete fabrication. I can't understand attacking the reputation of a good man.

Decent movie but absolutely rotten history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoodlum: Disapointing From Start to Finish","review":"If the title of the article doesn't give away my sentiments towards this movie, than allow me to elaborate. Hoodlum, judging by it's cast and theatrical trailer had potential galore. All that changes when you realize that by deciding to watch Hoodlum,you have done yourself a great disfavor. Without going into too many details (consider that a favor!)the movie depicts the gangster world of Chicago in the 30's and the infamous 'lottery' system that those gangsters helped finance. The movie is not only over acted but it's epic length may induce commas or nausea for those with weak stomachs. Stars Lawrence Fichburn and Venessa Williams only lend so much credibility to this otherwhise cliched mess. An 'end of the world' story line was all that was missing to make this the ULTIMATE disasater movie of the 90's."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFULL","review":"I love crime movies and this is a disgrace to the genere. It is one of the most un-original, poorly written, and boringly directed movies I have ever seen. I am SHOCKED Tim Roth would ever be a part of this horrible excuse for a gangster movie. Obviously the director was watching the Untouchables and said to himself \\"This movie is cool, I want to rip it off.\\" Honestly, it shocks me that anyone can say the title of this movie with a straight face.

Watching Tim Roth potray the legendary evil Dutch Schultz is amazing. Larry Fishburn is also good as gangster Bumpy Johnson, one of Dutch's biggest rival's in the era in which this film takes place. And although Andy Garcia has a reletively small part, his performance as Lucky Luciano is probably the best offered of that character (at least from what I've seen). Other than that, this is probably the most boring gangster movie i've ever seen. Had it been at least half and hour shorter, it MIGHT have come out lookin' better, but alas, i did not. I wish I could give it Two and a half stars, I think that would be a little more fair, but I had to be fair to anyone curious about this movie, and give it \\"2\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Let The Devil In","review":"Great stuff.

I have just finished reading this novel and have come to conclude that all of Trevor's novels should not be missed. Setting against the historical Anglo-Irish complex relationships, the novel tells a sorrowful and poignant love story that spans three generations. Trevor's use of language is subtle, delicate, and controlled and is a first-rate writing. The fact that I'm unfamiliar with the Anglo-Irish history might have undermined my appreciation and comprehension (in a certain way) of this novel, nonetheless, this is a great book and should be recommended to those who love reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fools of Fortune","review":"This is a lesson on how construct a novel, how to lead the reader through it, and touch the reader with its story and its people.

It worked alright on the fine, wavy hair of a friend of mine, but it did nothing for me. I would just give it to her, but she got a ceramic one for her birthday, so now I'm stuck with it. It takes forever to heat up. The steam just makes my hair weaker, and the plates catch it, and it breaks, and I end up with more frizz than I had before I tried to fix it with the iron. The wave plate did absolutely nothing, and the crimper, while working for the afore mentioned friend with fine hair, just made my hair look poofy and snarly. Don't buy this iron just because it looks like fun, with all it's little attachments, and it's low price tag.

I use it every day, and the buttons are just like 10 other hair dryers I've owned, I have no problem with them.

The design is different they use the pins that have the pin heads on it insead of the original straight pins. I don't like this type of brush since the ends are what get tangled and pull the hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent guitar for an outstanding price","review":"Bought this in February of 2010. The finish is beautiful. Mid-profile fretboard. Great Dean sound. Dean acoustics aren't known for their amplification qualities, and this one is marginal at best. The built-in tuner is awesome and the battery compartment is the easiest on the market to get into. The one complaint I have about the guitar is that it came with a minor imperfection - a dent in the side that looks like it was from the factory as the finish was not disturbed.As a side note, I should warn you about Amazon's shipping: The guitar arrived at my doorstep in a single box with no padding. What kind of way is that to ship a fragile musical instrument? There were five tears in the box where you could see daylight. How the guitar wasn't damaged in shipment I do not know. I realize these are drop-shipped, but come on Amazon! Make your drop-shippers pack correctly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Coins in the Fountain","review":"I have loved this movie since I first saw it as a small girl. Showcases beautiful Rome. The opening song, Three Coins in the Fountain, sung by Frank Sinatra is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Stand","review":"I truly loved this end to the Circle Trilogy, the characters were awsome, of course Nora Roberts writing is wonderful as always. I really felt as if I was In Gaeall with the Six, her descriptions are wonderful, I could all but hear the dragons in the sky. The way she gave Lilith such human emotions was very unique and weird at the same time. I loved this book, as I did the other two, the only thing that truely bothered me was the way the relationship between Lilith and Davey was portrayed...I really thout it was disturbing...and sad at the same time....."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this trilogy......","review":"I absolutely LOVED this trilogy. While I have read many of Nora Roberts books, I wasn't jumping to start reading this one immediately. I really didn't think I would like the whole premise of the stories, but a friend gave them to me, so I figure I would start book 1 and see if I liked it. I agree you kinda have to be \\"in the mood\\" to read this type of story, the fantasy etc, BUT I thought it was great. Loved Book 1 as it started the whole story, Loved Book 2 as you really got into alot of the details of the story behind the whole trilogy, BUT Book 3 I thought was FABULOUS. I too cried a few times and I don't think I ever have for a book, and I truly did not know how this was going to end........ Can't wait for more like it !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one little line...","review":"I've read fantasy works by several others... Raymond Feist, Melanie Rawn, even Anne Rice ...and never did one simple sentence stop me in my tracks with the thought \\"what in the world was he/she thinking?\\". I refer to young boy vampire's thoughtful reference of riding his mother. Did that mean what I took it to mean? Alrighty-we're all of age, I assume, and could read between the lines that something was not healthy about that relationship. One might argue that we're talking vampires here -- what's healthy got to do with anything? That being said, I say--too much information.I too have read many of NR's works-way back to Montana Sky (?) and have much enjoyed many of those many, much. Yes there's predictability after, what-- 75 (?) books. But still at times a great plot or character or line pops up. I am disappointed and will probably let some time pass before puchasing another of her works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora Robert Circle Trilogy Book 3","review":"Valley of Silence (The Circle Trilogy, Book 3). It arrived in excellent condition- I like the fast delivery.I'm a big fan of Nora Roberts' work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed to spend more time on this one...","review":"I am a big fan or Nora Roberts, but I think she needed to spend a little more time on this series. The plot was muddled, the dialogue uneven, and the characters spent WAY too much time talking. Talking about strategy, talking about feelings, talking about each other, talking talking talking. Usually, a story like this has more action, but I was bored. There really was no character development either. Normally, you can get a really good picture of each character, but they all felt 1-dimensional. AND, does it seem odd that each character just said \\"Oh, okay\\" about time travel and the like? This could have been a really great trilogy- on par with the Three Sisters, but it felt rushed and slapped together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect ending","review":"Nora Roberts closed her trilogy with a winner. This book was a bit more emotional than the other two but for good reason. The cost of battle on both fronts the one against evil and fate naturally bring rise to more powerful emotions yet they don't distract from the storyline only enhance it. If you like fantasy this trilogy is worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valley of Silence (The Circle Trilogy book #3)","review":"I read the first two of this trilogy and just had to fallow it to the end. I'm not normally much into Vampire stories, but these stories have been great fun to read. I just had to see what would happen to that nasty Vampire Queen, the love stories involved and where each person ended up. Did they stay in the now or the past?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I asked that they combine the shipping for the 2 books but still I was charged 3.50 2X on ship.

I asked to combine the order for the reduced rate and nothing there could give me real customer service.Everthing was auto generated.Forget this; I'm no longer your customer. I went over to Swap tree. Shipping was just 2.50 a book, and great trades. No gouging the purse string here! YOU control the ship rate. I can ship low ball for less than $1.99 with lighter books. You guys do a real disservice on your advertising. The 1 cent a book was great! but the $7.00 ship for a double combination order was just wrong. You lost a possible long term customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting, bloodthirsty series--\\"0\\" stars","review":"I have been a Robert's fan for 2 decades--own just about everything she has ever written--and this trilogy is the most disgusting, bloodthirsty, violent, grotesque piece of trash I have ever read. She just can't have written these. If the rating allowed \\"O\\" stars that would be my rating. Unfortunately, since so many millions of us buy on faith, the trilogy will most undeservedly end up a best-seller unit. I read #1 and threw it out, something I have never ever done with a Robert's book. Got 1/3 of the way threw #2 and into the garbage along with the untouched #3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Exciting","review":"This is the last book of a three part story, which I hated to end. I loved this book and hope it becomes a movie one day. When I first started reading the Trilogy, Book 1, I wasn't sure I liked it but I stuck it out and then started thirsting for more and now its over and I just have such fond memories of the characters. Excellent reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative Trilogy","review":"NR obviously is a big fan of \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" & \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" This trilogy has elements of all, especially the last two. From the first, she seems to have borrowed Glenna the Good Witch of the East. However, from the last two, she cribbed unmercifully. It may not have been strictly plaigiarism, but close. Unfortunately, with all the \\"borrowed\\" ideas, she wrote a not very good series. It has been done better.I agree with many others who think these books were published because of the power of Nora Roberts name and past successes. Perhaps she should take some time off and have a nice vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valley of Silence - what a thrill!","review":"I have read the whole trilogy about 4 times now and I enjoy it every time. The plot is just amazing and it kept me on the edge the whole entire time. Even though you knew which character ends up with each other in the beginning it is still fun watching the events unfold. This is a must read for anyone who enjoys fantasy and historical reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Audio CD","review":"For those of us who listen to the Audio version, all three books in this Trilogy are read by the same narrator, which makes for good continuity. That said, I find fault with deep-voiced men who try to 'lighten up' to do the women's voices; it's very annoying. It makes the women seem shallow and childish. But Dick Hill did a great job with the general narrating and the men's voices, and overall I found the story to be engaging. An earlier reviewer stated that the major battle isn't until the third installment, but isn't that what we expect with a trilogy?I do recommend this series to fans of Nora Roberts and those who enjoy the paranormal. I especially liked the progression of the romance between Moira & Cian, and I absolutely LOVED the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Implausible, But Fun","review":"As dearly as I love the compelling romance, Nora is no tactician! I kept wanting the Good Guys to fight intelligently; but to no avail, they kept wandering in and out of encounters with an aggressive dangerous enemy as naively as school children. With that complaint aside, the characters are entertaining and well drawn. The resolution of our protagonist's romantic dillema was a bit of a stretch, as well. Still, it was a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Book Store","review":"I was interested in purchasing the kindle. Until I realized not all book titles are available in Canada! For example, The Circle Trilogy by Nora Roberts. I can get the first two but not the third and final book? The first two are kind of pointless without the final book, don't you think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely loved the ending","review":"Roberts has absolutely outdone herself with the Circle Triology. The Valley of Silence is full of vamp fighting, magic, friendship, romance, and forbidden love. When I was reading the book, I couldn't put it down. If I had to stop reading the book to go do something, I couldn't wait to pick up the book again and read more. I especially loved the ending because it poignant and heartfelt. I loved the ending so much, I even read it again. Valley of Silence is defintely a book to buy and read. Don't forget to read Morrigan's Cross and Dance of the Gods before you read Valley of Silence, or you'll be truly be lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"She saved the best for last!","review":"The last book in the circle trilogy, this one did not disappoint. We finally get to read Cian and Moira's story!In this book we got a glimpse of the day that Cian was changed into a vampire. You get to see Moira and Cians relationship build. And we finally get the circle of six fighting the vampires in the Valley of Silence.I agree with the other reviewers that there are a few disturbing and graphic things revealed about Lilith and Davey. I too could have done without those images, but for me it didn't warrant a deduction in stars.I thought this book was very touching and It brought tears to my eyes many times. While there is some predictability, it didn't spoil the story for me. I thought it was well written and enjoyed it tremendously. Cian and Moira were wonderful to read about. A great finale to the trilogy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CIRCLE TRILOGY","review":"QUITE A DIFFERENT NORA ROBERTS...FULL OF VAMPIRES, DRAGONS, WITCHES, AND WIZARDS.

Faster than I thought it would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Nora Roberts is an excellent writer with realistic dialog and characters. But action novels are not her forte. This book is the climatic battle that was being set up in Morrigan's Cross and Dance of the Gods. We have waited over 800 pages for the battle between Lilith's forces and Morrigan's six heroes. And it falls flat. There is no suspence in the battle. No doubt who will win.There are better books available to read. Worth checking out from a library or borrowing from a friend but not worth shelf space in your house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best..","review":"I usually love Nora Roberts Trilogys but this one left me cold.

Had I known this I would not have ordered them, and will not order from this place again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Except for a Few Problems.","review":"I used this book because of the success I had with another Exam Cram publication, NDS Design & Implementation. I thought I was very well prepared for the 4-5 Update Exam that I took today. However, I believe there are some inaccuracies in this book that left me quite puzzled. For instance, in server requirements for Zenworks, why do they give 205 MB HD space and 70 MB memory in the book when Novell itself states 175 MB and 40 MB, respectively? Also, it would be nice if the authors discussed Compatibility Mode in greater detail so the reader could have something else to fall back on besides the Supplemental Notes provided by Novell's Website. Be sure to read this book if you have to take the 50-638, but don't rely on it exclusively."},{"rating":"1","title":"good if you're an expert","review":"This book is pretty concise and straight to the point. That's alright if you're already a Novell expert. For the person studying to get certified without a heck of a lot of experience, this ain't the answer ! Reading the Novell manuals is probably a better recourse for such a person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful book.....worked for me.","review":"Another strong book in the exam cram series. Remember that the only purpose of these books is to assist you in passing the tests, and this book works well in that area. I don't think you can pass the test based only on this book though. I used it in conjunction with two other books and some practice tests. Passed the test first try.As usual the information in the Exam Cram is useful and well organized. The Cram Sheet at the beginning is to the point. That is what you need to learn. If you don't know it, find the information in the book. The book is well worth the cost, and is quite useful in helping you keep your certification. The only real drawback to the Exam Cram series is that once you have passed the test the books are pretty much worthless. They really aren't good volumes to keep for reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your standard debut fare...","review":"This collection of stories is driven not so much by characters and plot as by voices. Which is okay, since this approach seems intentional on the part of the author. These are slightly obsessive voices, pre-occupied by reminiscence, reverie and rant. A black humor runs throughout, especially in the more farcical stories on Global Warming and the Second Coming. An attention to language keeps the stories readable. Overall, a reasonably strong debut effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST DOESN'T FLOW","review":"Jesus, this is a HARD book to read because it is so badly structured, it reads like a 12-year old school work or something, very HARD to read, boring, does not have any rhythm, it just DOES NOT FLOW.Besides, as the other reviewers pointed, this looks a lot like a joke because the authors keep telling \\"we searched this, we searched that\\" and they don't really offer any real and substantive evidence on nothing. There is a lot of \\"some studies claim this\\"... \\"some studies claim that\\" etc, just BAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Blood Holy Grail","review":"A ming opening presentation of ideas of what might be true, not what we have been led to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Tragic...","review":"How tragic that this book can pass for \\"historical research\\". Let me just point you to a clearly unbiased source - The University of California at Berkeley - where this book (along with \\"Chariots of the Gods\\") is the focus of a course called Rhetoric 24, Bad Books and How to Spot Them (LG) taught by Professor Daniel F. Melia. If you like fantasy then have at this book but if you think it is remotely grounded in reality you are, I am afraid, simply foolish."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way!","review":"In my opinion this book is clap-trap, & pretentious clap-trap at that! Worse, it is dreadfully dreary & dull to read. Masses of dates, places, details that are brought together from numerous dubious sources & then presented as having some (usually preposterous) bearing on their peculier \\"Jesus\\" theory. It's totally unconvincing & an awesomely boring read. In fact, if this review saves one person from repeating the experience, then that will be my only reward for the excrutiating time I spent reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"very worthlss and plain boring","review":"Your reading this book because of the d-Code.

Maybe if I had read the book high on acid it would have made some sort of sense, as it was I read it sober and found it at the least boring and at most highly offensive on a religious level as well as insulting on an intelectual level. Perhaps the authors should consider as their next work a study of how the nursery rhyme \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" is in reality proof that Einstien was really an alien offspring of E.T.s who crashed on Earth after they flew through the Bermuda Triangle, accidentally sank the Titanic before eventually crashing in Roswell, New Mexico."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many liberties with religious history...","review":"Theories based on weak deductions...for a religious thriller based on biblical theory of the Holy Grail, I would suggest a new novel titled THE GOAT WITHOUT HORNS.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Terrible","review":"Like many others, I read the Da Vinci Code and this notion sparked my curiosity. I researched online and found that Holy Blood, Holy Grail was the book that fully illustrated this theory.I read it and wanted to burn it. The three people who wrote it are not historians. They enjoy molding conclusions out of evidence that is completely bogus. It is almost as if their theory was the dragon created by seeing the shape in the clouds. They mold the \\"evidence\\" to fit their desired beliefs.It was a terrible book. The research was poorly done and poorly presented. I discussed it with an history professor at a private university and he described the authors as \\"hacks.\\" I do not want to pass judgment on the authors personally, but this material they published is pure garbage.I am not a Christian and am quite unbiased as far as the teachings of the Church are concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"GodAlmighty-Holy Gosh","review":"Long,involved,convoluted,somewhat reduntant,informa- tive.immaginative read.

Plain and simple. Baigent and Co. have a seemingly entertaining read that quickly turns dissapointingly absurd in view of their completely unscientific approach and more importantly their lack of any sort of real, documented proof.

Not one single solid conclusion in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book fell apart.","review":"Took book on vacation. Around half way through book. The entire thing fell apart.

Do not recommend buying in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wallowing in ignorance","review":"I truly pity anyone who trusts this book as a work of scholarly research, as I also pity anyone who reads comic books (especially those by Jack Chick) as a reliable source for history and theology.The authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail, as well as Jack Chick, have each anchored themselves to theses on opposite ends of the delusional spectrum, and have careful interpreted all evidence or lack thereof in a manner that wouldn't disturb their fanciful dreams.Such people never allow themselves to be confused by the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not readable","review":"This book from this publisher concretly is very unreadable and i would not recomed anyone to buy it.

So because an event that took place over 2000 years ago was described two different ways you decide that it is basis enough to discount the whole book and all the proposed theories and messages. If that is the case then let me ask you, how did Judas die? One account in the bible has him hanging himself from a tree, however in antother section of the new testament Judas lives and buys a farm until one days his innards explode on the land. If your narrow minded and moronic theory of discount holds true then you have just voided the Bible. Nice going, Schmuck. Lets all try and remember the bible was written by MEN well after the death of Jesus and that it consisted mainly of oral history. there are therefore many ways to intrpret the stories and there may, just may be other versions of the story just as plausable as the one we all beleive."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best kind of mystery-possibly true!","review":"An extraordinary piece of detective work. The authors track down mysteries that have been semi-secret for centuries.

If you have any interest at all in European/French early history the book is money well spent. As for whether Jesus's crucifixion was a farce created by overzealous religious fanaticals, well, anything is possible. There are too many missing pieces from the bible regarding Christ's life to swallow everything that is written. Belief in Jesus Christ is 100% blind - You don't know for sure and I don't either and the bible may well the best piece of supernatural fiction ever written. HBHG fills in the blanks for you and allows you to make an intelligent decision about Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have made a great novel....","review":"Foucault's Pendulum is a fantastic book, a great novel, and where this book falls down is that it was written as non-fiction. The story in this book is fascinating, but its claims as non-fiction open the authors to ridicule, whereas if they had told their story as the fiction that it is it might have made for a much more intriguing book with the opportunity to develop some of the 'what-ifs' of their story. A missed opportunity, as it predates Foucault's Pendulum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Scholarship","review":"I have to agree that this is based on poor scholarship. Where is the second edition that acknowledges that most of the information they based their theories on was admitted to be fabricated by Pierre Plantard? He admitted it in the 1990s, under oath. Find out more at http://priory-of-sion.com/.It's a shame Dan Brown didn't acknowledge the spurious scholarship Holy Blood, Holy Grail was based on when he wrote The Da Vinci Code, but I guess it would have undercut his plotline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the Da Vinci Code","review":"The authors have pretty much lost any credibility and any claim to scholarship by suing Dan Brown for writing a work of FICTION containing some of the authors' concepts. In essence the authors are admitting that they wrote a work of fiction and don't appreciate the competition. Had they seriously believed that their work had any merit as a scholarly historical work it seems unlikley they would be suing Brown for popularizing their research in a work of FICTION.Since the authors now seem to see themselves as competitors of Dan Brown, their work should be judged as a work of fiction. In that respect they have presented us with a book that is markedly inferior to The Da Vinci Code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-historical tripe.","review":"Anyone who is well-educated or well-informed, especially in history, will see through the amateur attempt by the authors to appear to be impartial and logical in their hypothetical reasoning. Anyone who has a sound understanding of the Bible will, at the very least, be annoyed by their mis-quotes, quotes out of context, non-sequiturs, inaccurate translations of Greek and Hebrew, and general ignorance of Judaism and Christianity, both of which are disparaged by this inept conspiratorial concept. It is a long, tiresome maze leading nowhere. Far better for children to stick to fairy tales than to meddle in adult themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read for those in the know!","review":"For those who read up on this topic frequently, it is an entertaining read. The authors are knowledgable of the topic, and provide copious amounts of information. If you are just now being turned on to the topic of the conspiracy theories behind Christ, his divinity, and things of the nature, then this is NOT the book for you. You should read up on other material to become more familiar with the topic first. For those who have read other books on the topic, this is a must-read!!! Enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing.....","review":"I have been educated in catholic schools, am a Roman Catholic for the past 27 years of my life. I have been discouraged by my friends to read this book but let's just say that am a question mark person. I want to explore, to question especially things that matters to me as a person. Am not saying that we should fully believe in this book but it poses more of a challenge to us christians to know more about our religion. I know my faith but it doesn't hurt, I guess to wonder at times. I remember one of my religion teacher in high shool when she told us that it is better to at times doubt how your faith is than be so overly confident of its existence...this book is one of the must read material for those who are searching but don't blame the subject of the book, remember that the translation and the tradition then was through oral traditions and they are just human to commit error."},{"rating":"2","title":"Started me on my journey","review":"This book sent me on a journey which still has more questions than answers. Congratulations to the authors and publishers for an earthshattering book. Perhaps I am like many others who at the end of the book could not shake off the question \\"what would it matter if Jesus' bloodline could return to \\"a\\" throne. which throne would it be? What would it matter in America anyway where we seem to be as indifferent to Royalty as we are to \\"pardon the simplicity\\" soccer. This question aside, the Biblical ramifications and my faith were jolted awake and I want to thank the authors for a well researched book. I read the follow up to this as well as many others on the topic and it seems to be one theme ringing true. Shame on the Roman Catholic Church! Just as the Bible says. The truth shall set you free. Et en Arcadia Ego!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The grandaddy of all bloodline books","review":"Hard to believe this book was first published over 25 years ago--it is still the granddaddy of all books in the Jesus bloodline genre.

This should be the first read for anyone looking to delve into the bloodline question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly Thought-Provoking","review":"While it was certainly thought provoking, HBHG almost requires the reader to have a knowledge of French history and geography that, unfortunately, I don't have. While it is certainly conceivable that Jesus married the Magdalen and sired children, you have to wonder if that bloodline is still around, and what good would it do to maintain this secret all of these centuries? Between wars, plagues, the French Revolution, etc., this bloodline is probably lost. Even if it's not, what's the big deal? I don't think that there's any call for a \\"priest-king\\" over all Christians. I have to wonder, what's the point to keeping this big secret?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Read everything, believe nothing until you prove it to you\\"","review":"I've read the reviews of this book, and mine will not be much different. I give it 5 stars not only because I loved it, but because I wouldn't want to discourage anyone's interest in this subject. Yes, I can find things in it that are impugnable or at least argued by other historians,but it's still a fascinating book. \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" solved the mystery of \\"Friday the Thirteenth\\",(at least for me)and through further reseaech have found that many authors concurr to that event, masons and non-masons alike.

They base their evidence on documents from a secret society with suspicious credibility. As an undergraduate history major, even I noticed two huge glaring errors with their statements. Even though they sometimes can't make a conclusion with the evidence they have, they do so anyway, and then base other conclusions on it. It is a good book, if you'd like to learn about the the bible in a historical manner, but there are other better resources to learn about that, if that's what you're looking for.

The main premise of the book is not even discussed until page 313 in the paper back edition. Presented as a 450 page research paper it has little entertainment value and is not an easy read. There is no conclusion or proof offered to any of the theories the authors present. Holy Blood, Holy Grail may provoke thought but it is not worth the effort that it takes to read. You can make your own judgment on the content, if you can force yourself to finish reading the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for light reading!","review":"This book was a real struggle to read. For about 3/4 the author takes us through a morass of genealogies and accounts of old historical figures without really an end in sight. Just when I think I understand what he is trying to present, he jumps to a different subject, making me start all over. I was impressed by the amount of footnotes indicating thorough research, but it came across more as a college thesis with little effort to present the information in a readable fashion.It was not until the author presents The Hypothesis that the reading becomes compelling, then it ends too soon. Whether the facts the author presents lend credence to the hypothesis is up to the individual reader. Perhaps this is one of the works that began the phenomenon leading to the DaVinci Code, but I see that that there are other books on the market addressing the same subject, and I plan to read more of them. I would not really recommend this one as a starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Investigative, though speculative","review":"This book provides a creative spur on Christianity and its historical context--in both parts logical theology and empiricism. The main problem of this book, however, is that it is mostly based on speculation. Yet, it has to be; significant historical records that could have definitively proven or refuted most of this book's hypotheses sadly do not exist.If anything, this book shouldn't be regarded a totally heretical or meaningless work; it should be a small part of a focused devotion to learning and understanding one's faith.

Far from having a \\"history (that) spanned more than a millennium,\\" the Priory was a hoax created by a pretender to the throne of France, Pierre Plantard, a convicted con-man, in 1953. As part of his hoax, Plantard had planted numerous bogus documents in the French National Library, as well as in the 1967 book Le Trésor Maudit de Rennes-le-Chateau. (For more details, see The Priory of Sion, Rennes-le-Chateau, and Pierre Plantard). The authors' hypothesis in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail was significantly premised on the veracity of these documents. As a result, the revelation that the Priory documents were indeed fabricated serves to detract from much of the book's impact and plausibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting journey that leads nowhere","review":"I started this book with the hope of learning something interesting and worthwhile.

In Holy Blood, Holy Grail, Bagent and Co explore the theories touched on in Dan Brown's book. And, since they don't have to wasted ink and pages to a thriller plotline, the authors can and do dive into the subject in full detail. Personally, I don't believe this theory, and I don't consider it important anyway. What Christ brought to the world--the light he sought to uncover in every soul--can only be diminished by focusing on the possibility of his progeny.

In 1998 the BBC did a documentary about \\"The Tomb of God\\", an attempt to solve the Rennes-le-Chateau mystery. In it they showed Pierre de Plantard-Sinclair to be a proven fraudster who has served prison time for it and interviewed the French journalist with whom he concocted this hoax. The journalist gave the solution to the \\"blue apples\\" cryptic messages and expressed his amusement at the havoc this joke has caused. Sorry folks, it ain't true, it's made up. As made up as Pierre's lineage. However don't let it stop you reading it, it's a cracking good read. And the sources the authors used on the biblical bits are still valid.

If you are into conspiracy theories at all, this book will take you for a great ride. After all, what better conspiracy theory to pursue than the idea that Jesus' ancestors are alive and influential today and that these reasearchers know who they might be? Sadly, if you are interested in scholarship, this book is a huge letdown.The theories presented are often very interesting and persuasive in the possibilities they hold. The research behind those theories is weak, though represented as more than it is. The writers themselves admit often that they don't have the information they need to make te conclusions they jump at, but right after making a caveat will make 20-30 pahes of statements presented as fact (even though it rarely is). Their research also rests primarily on one set of documents, the validity of which they cannot verify.

The authors have great penmanship and diction with coherent and logical execution of ideas, explanations, and proof. Much better written than books by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince; their books are such a pain to read and hard to understand, since the writing style is so chaotic and prone with erratic grammar.

For a long time this was assumed to have some sort of facts until the man who supplied most of the evidence was found in a French Court to have made the whole thing, including the Priory of Sion, which is a secret society only in the imagination of a French political activist.Its a very good story nonetheless, some facts mixed in with the fiction, but as for claiming to be \\"factual\\" in a general sense, this book is deceiving in that regard. The man responsible for this deception was an individual known as Pierre Plantard. The BBC debunked the supposed \\"facts\\" behind this story shortly after Plantard admitted forgery of documents to create \\"evidence\\" of a non-existent Priory of Sion.Like I said, if you expect to find something factual in this tome, you're going to be disappointed, if you like research Monsieur Plantard further and all the truth shall be known to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I don't understand how anyone could read this book.

But, I give it one star because I believe the authors did a lot of research and deserve something for their effort.

If you like truthful history then this book is not for you.The authors of this book have been deceived like anyone else who does not do a bit more research about this subject. By making BIG, speculative leaps to conclusions is the reason for the deception. Anyone who does a little background research will soon discover that Pierre Plantard was a pathological liar with an imagination that would lead some to believe he was on an acid trip.Contrary to what one might think, the Holy Grail is not some French 'Bloodline' of Jesus Christ that was to be protected at all costs. It never was. It was a story concocted by Plantard.All in all it's nothing but bovine scatacism. But hey, if you like a good yarn then buy the book. I used mine to start a camp fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazing story, until you find out it is a hoax","review":"a woefull piece of scholarship with a complete disregard for facts-the authors exploited a theme which had been gathering momentum in france since the 60's and foisted it on the english speaking world.

Later when I read similar findings from different researchers using separate sources (Born in Blood, by Johnson), I re-read the book. Now with Goddess of the Gospels, the picture is becoming more complete. This book is a must-read for free thinkers and seekers. The Merovingians and the Cathars may just have been correct, had they not been put to the sword."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely amazing!","review":"This book I found excellent and it changed my whole point of view in Christianty.

I thought it was very well researched, it had a lot of evidence to back their hypothesis up. I think they are geniuses! I loved it! it was better than a mistery novel. I couldn't stop reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucrative fantasy","review":"This is a novel that pretends to be history. The authors evidently did not believe in examining contemporary source material, but instead depended on a 1950s hoax - the Priory of Sion - which was perpetrated by a French con-artist. The damage done to historical scholarship is vast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far-fethched but intriguing","review":"Although I found the book to be quite intriguing, I could not make the leaps in logic and reasoning which the authors seem to make with but a grain of salt. Throughout the book, I could not help but wonder whether the authors are freemasons, since every conclusion fits in rather well with freemason belief. Jesus is portrayed not as God, but as a fraud. The Bible and the Gospels are all misquoted and incorrectly analyzed. To think that Jesus had children is preposterous. Some other presumptions in the book seem to be given with no background information or substantiation. There is a period of about 500 years which the authors completely skip. This book is the best example I have encountered of trying to discredit the Christian Saviour. God have mercy on the authors' souls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinated-with my tongue in cheek","review":"I admit I am fascinated by the grail theory that it was really either Mary Magdalene or the child she might have carried. The authors don't claim to have the answers but they offer some interesting explanations for their theories. I downloaded the Audible unabriged version first, then bought the book as a backup. It has some photos. I deducted a star because the photos are not very good copies. Normally black and white photos show great detail, but not the ones used in the book. Still, it's a good read if you keep an open mind. Now, when will someone write a book about Jesus's siblings and their descendents?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Book Just Like Another One I Just Read","review":"The book Holy Blood Holy Grail offers great insight into the past. Not only does it lay out good framework for other authors of the same subject, but it also lays out its evidence clearly. Timelines, genealogy, and historical documents are the backbone of this book. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the Knights Templar, their secrets.If you like alternate view of history and/or religion, and how it may have been purposely kept from the general public, then this book is for you. I also recommend reading the shocking and amazing new book by Daniel Aber and Gabreael called \\"The Book of Thomas\\". In their book The Christ Consciousness, Universal Laws, The Genetic Code, The Different Levels of Hell and Heaven, Soul Charting, Reincarnation, and much more is discussed in detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Entertaining Read","review":"I read this book after reading the Da Vinci Code and I must confess I had a pretty good time with it. The authors take you on a fascinating, very interesting and sometimes thrilling ride through early Christian history/myth/legend, whatever you want to call it. Whether you beleive the authors or not, this book is great entertainment. It's very difficult to prove or disprove fantastical claims when you have very little evidence/facts. Maybe I'm a bit biased because I enjoy these kinds of historical myth and legend stories that border on fantasy (and in this case many would say that the book is outright fantasy). But it's still nice to contemplate what if whatever the authors claim is true. Of course in today's modern world I'm sure most of us don't care if someone claims that they descend directly from Jesus. A nice book to take along with you while travelling I would say."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"In me, it inspired an intuitive feeling of authenticity..\\"","review":"This book, having come to my attention through another title that you'd probably call trash literature, surprised me with its plausible, well presented documentation. From page 1 the authors drew a distinct line between what was proven & what hypothesized. Suffice to say I was impressed; after reading the book I have narrowed my scope on 'more serious' titles like \\"Massacre at Montsegur\\" by Zoe Oldenbourg.I'd like to stress out, much like the authors, that the book is not anti-Christian or atheistic; it does, however, point out that even Popes are not so infallible as they would have us believe - bear in mind quotations like 'Kill them all; God will look after His own.' (Yes, the words were those of a mere Papal Legate.) To a non-Catholic Christian like me, such a picture of Catholicism hardly seems blasphemous.

I purchased it and read it with much anticipation. Unfortunately, the book's title does not deliver within its covers. It fails in the area of research based analysis....no serious research was provided. It suffered from vague research references that the author claimed were done by the Gallup Organization but were not presented in a thorough manner.

This book is NOT for the linear/literal minded. James Joyceian, fluid, associate language alternates with standard sentence format, and the combination brings alive the passions and personalities of Nureyev's life. In this book he appears as the larger-than-life character he really was. I have recommended this book to SO many people, and haven't had a disappointment yet. Please ignore the reviews of those who are judging this book by their own fixed expectations of what a book about a dancer should be.

Another cot has lost its leg, and we had to use a plastic crate to keep it from tipping over. We have used 2 of the cots 3 times and one of them twice, and already 2 of them need to be replaced.

The ideas developed in this first-rate work are lucidly and extensively developed and contain such subtle gems of thought that one could not possibly discover all of them with a single reading. Anyone with even but a passing interest in the history and philosophy of science should add this book to his library. A true classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book; awful edition.","review":"This is a fantastic book; unfortunately, this version is almost unreadable. There is no indentation or italicization, and quotation marks are often misplaced. This makes it awfully difficult to tell the lengthy quoted passages apart from the author's own text. Definitely read this book--just buy it from a different publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"the european colloquy for all time and space","review":"Readers of this book beware, its themes are huge! It contains lucid narrative of the competition from Cartesians to Newtonians for the best model of the universe and the nature of time and space. There are scarcely any baggy corners into which the reader will turn unwillingly. However, there is not terribly much about the science or the methods of discovery employed by these thinkers in their shared pursuit of important results. Koyre has written a classic study of intellectual history. Discussion of divinity and its aspects is abundant because this presence was one that the scientists were working diligently to situate without offending the authorities and employers of the age. The universe is a source whose study has profoundly metaphysical and ontological implications. Koyre brings these alive for the reader and shares the tumult of ideas that produced much of what we consider now to be a satisfactory vision of the universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a Different edition!","review":"While the book itself is very good and very important in the history and philosophy of science, this edition is the absolute worst. I am convinced this \\"publisher\\" is breaking some sort of copyright law, as there is none of the standard information on the inside cover, and the layout is so bad that I was half convinced that I received the wrong book. I'm still not convinced I got the right one, and will be purchasing a different copy as soon as I can.The text is almost devoid of formatting, up to and including a lack of indentation, improper spacing on block quotes, improperly sized illustrations, misplaced quotation marks, etc. It's like they had someone just retype the book into a Word document, then republished and resold it on the assumption that grad students like myself will see the cost reduction and take the bait."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worth-while introduction","review":"War and Christian Ethics is a compilation of texts in the Christian tradition, spanning the time from Augustine to the current day. There are some background texts on justifications for war from Plato and Cicero. On the whole the book is a valuable collection of classic excerpts on the reasons and justifications for going - or not going - to war. There are some excerpts from pacifists and philosophers critical of war as well to give the book some added dimension and balance. Although I am hardly a just war theorist, there were some engaging sections by Augustine, Luther, Reinhold Niebuhr, and a modern and outspoken essay by George Weigel (and a critic) who update Just War Theory past the 9/11 attacks. For those seeking an introduction to Just War Theory, this is a good book. Parts are certainly tedious and painful to get through, but there are other gems that make it worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sound","review":"I would not recommend this CD because the music sounds awful!!!

It begins with the Xia dynasty (2100-1600 B.C.) and ends with the Qing (1636-1911). It is, thus, an exposition of classical chinese art. The author discusses poetry, painting, calligraphy, and music as they changed and progressed through the ages. There is an emphasis on the development of Chinese society and the effects that it had on the arts. It is as if the arts act as a mirror that reflects the trends of society, whether they be progress, prosperity, war and bloodshed, etc. As an example, Dr. Li discusses the influence that religion had on the arts including Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. I enjoyed this work, however it appears that the author is well-versed specifically in the developments of Chinese poetry, for greater attention is paid to this art, the result being a glossing over of the other arts."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad design leads to serious burns and poor performance","review":"Really, curling irons are not newfangled inventions - they've been around for centuries. So to put one on the market with such a wretched design is truly irresponsible. Both the on-off switch and the temperature setting are right where you grab the thing to use it, which means that by using it you constantly bump the temperature off setting or turn it off inadvertently. The temperature wheel is so loose - and not a click wheel - that it is impossible to set a temperature and insure that it stays there, which can lead to serious burns on the skin or hair. What a craptastic demonstration of shoddy design and manufacturing straight from China.

First off, the CORD! It's so twisted up now that I'm constantly yanking it while using it, and the constant twisted state means the iron is always flipping onto its side when I set it down.

When I got my second iron (thinking this couldn't possibly happen again), within 2 weeks, and mind you, I only use the curling iron 2-3 times a week, the off button felt loose and I had to wiggle it to turn it off.

It is very poorly designed- does not stand on its \\"safety stand.\\" The barrel is much heavier than its base and ends up tipping forward touching the surface that it's supposed to safely rest on. I was so afraid to put it down on my sink top in fear that it would leave a scorch mark, so I ended up holding it the whole time. It also seemed to scorch my hair. If I could give it a zero I would! Will be taking back tomorrow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this curling iron","review":"I bought this several months ago. The heat dial always turns freely and does not stay set on the heat setting you turn it to. I had to turn the dial and tape it place. I have thick, coarse, hair and even at the top heat setting I don't get results. This curling iron does nothing to prevent frizz either. The handle is so light that the point of the curling iron always tips down and touches the counter (which caused me to create a burn mark on the counter). If I were reading this I would wonder if the person was not careful, but I am a very careful person and always unplug the curling iron when I am finished. I liked my Conair curling iron much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"May Catch You On Fire","review":"I have had this curling iron for almost six months, and while the heat setting is a little frustrating, I had relatively no problems. Then, today, as I was getting ready to curl a section a hair, I heard a loud pop and saw a pretty big spark fly from the handle. I am relieved that I didn't actually have the thing in my hair when this happened. I would not recommend anyone to purchase this iron, regardless of the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail","review":"I would agree that it is poorly designed, I keep bumping the temperature selection.

One month later... you guessed it. Same defect. Save yourself the trouble buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed","review":"This is a very poorly designed curling iron. The temperature selection dial is right underneath where your hand goes when opening and closing the iron. A very light touch of the palm causes the temperature dial to spin freely from right to left as you curl and uncurl it around your hair. I never know what temperature setting it's on by the time I'm done. No wonder other reviewers are burning their hair. Also, the cord bends downward from the base of the curling iron, causing it to hit the counter when resting and tipping off it's tiny and useless stand. Revlon clearly didn't put much thought into this product. It's very annoying considering you really don't know these drawbacks because it's sold shrink wrapped in hard plastic. Don't get this. You'll just be annoyed with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!!

Reading the other reviews I concur - I have had issues with the temp as well as the tangled cord that is a mess! However, I have thick hair and I was glad to have an iron that would actually give me curls. But - this morning -as I was lifting the iron to my head I heard a LOUD POP FOLLOWED BY A BIG YELLOW FLASH. THE CORD CAME DETACHED FROM THE IRON AND I WAS LEFT WITH A CORD DANGLING FROM THE WALL and a iron with no cord in my hands! I have little guys so this was sooo scary for me. Plus - I wasn't fond of having something EXPLODE IN MY FACE. Please don't buy this for your own safety!!!

The little stand prongs are useless and the temperature setting dial spins so easily you must constantly monitor the setting.Second: This product is a dangerous safety hazard! I had just unwrapped my hair from it when a large orange fireball came out from the spring area above the on/off switch accompanied by a loud electric pop! After that, the curling iron kept working so you could electrocute yourself at a later date. (or set your hair on fire!)

Simply put: don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Curling Iron!","review":"Let me just say I have been using this curling iron for years. Occasionally like now I purchase another one only because after a while there is buildup from hair products on mine. This curling iron heats up in less then a minute and does the job it is made to do. It has a dial with 20 heat settings and automatic shutoff.

I do wish I had checked the reviews on Amazon before I purchased this instead of purchasing it when in a Target store. I used this twice. The third time I wanted to use it I found the buttons which control on and off were sunken into the handle and no longer would work. Now I see this is a common problem. What a waste of money! And what an inconvenience. Perhaps this defect is how made it past the Underwriters Laboratory. They knew it would not work and that one has to be able to turn it on for there to be danger of fire.

The first one was a little different model and ended with pop and super heating-frying my hair. When I went to purchase a new one I had not really paid attention to brand name and made the mistake of a second purchase, only realizing my mistake after bringing it home. I would agree with those who dislike the temp setting, it needs to be reset each use because during use it gets moved. Otherwise it was functional enough, during its short life. I had no problem giving it a second chance, but after 2 months it lights up, but simply does not heat up. No more Revlon products for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Price, but LOW Quality - Pointless to Buy","review":"I have fine, thick, untreated hair.I was looking for a decent priced 1.5\\" curling iron and I found this one. I was extremely excited because it had \\"different heat settings\\" and automatic shut off for such a good price. However, it was not what I expected AT ALL. First I started out with a lower setting and my hair did not curl. I slowly kept adjusting the \\"heat setting\\" testing frequently and there was practically no curl. This means that even at the highest setting (which seemed just as hot as the first) my hair did not hold a curl. I had to eventually go back to my straightener which had a much better curl.

Prince of Pleasure is probably the best romance I've read in two years. But be warned, it is definitely not sweet or fluffy. It's hot and witty and past-paced and suspenseful. Couldn't put it down.

I've read other of Jordan's books and this was, by far, the least interesting of the ones I've read. The plot is treadworn and the relationship between the heroine and hero was very confusing. One moment they're vowing to revenge themselves/punish one another and the very next they're engaged in hot sex (which wasn't, in my view, very erotically described.) I felt Jordan was trying to have her cake and eat it too. The two protagonists were resisting/misunderstanding/punishing each other while simultaneously enjoying each other sexually. Yuck!!

Royko succeeds in taking a verbal still-life of Chicago during the Boss's tenure.This is right up there with Caro's \\"The Power Broker\\" What's really wild is that I read this book right after I read \\"The Godfather\\" and both of the titular characters operated in much the same way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better books I've read","review":"One of the better books I've read.

Published in 1971, obviously it could not discuss the end of Mayor Richard J. Daley's reign. Yet, it hauntingly alludes to Daley's final day in office, through foreshadowing.Royko's sarcasm, while biting, is understandable.

He views MS's success as a matter of brains, speed and talent- and pays little attention to how the software behemoth simply was up to its old tricks: force companies to carry your product, the same way it forces, for example, Compaq to load its operating system onto every computer it sells. Writing as though describing the activities of a hard-pressed, plucky, band of computer savants, the author misses the mark.

It contains enough crazy scenes to satisfy the die hard Jodorowsky fan, such as an elephant ejaculating blood out of it's trunk for no aparent reason, but unlike his other films like THe Holy Mountain, the wierdness takes a back seat to the story which flows at a perfectly timed beautiful rhythm. I would recommend this film to any arthouse fan.

The construction is very high quality. The brackets are flexible enough that they can be located virtually anywhere along the length of the shelf so you have a good bit of flexibility with where you put the shelf in relation to the wall studs. You do absolutely have to bolt the brackets into a stud since these shelves are designed to hold some substantial weight. I put up 8 of these around my garage along with some of the accessory hooks for ladder storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Shelves are AWESOME!","review":"These shelves are great! It was exhausting to install them because each shelf has 6 lag bolts, so you have to ratchet in 12 lag bolts in all. Your arms will get tired. I eventually figured out I had a drill attachment that allowed me to drive in the last 3 bolts without all the arm fatigue. I would recommend you spend the money and get this attachment for installation.The shelves are great quality and are not going anywhere! I would also recommend a laser level for installation so your shelves line up properly. I used the level to mark the top hole of each shelf and then drilled those holes. I then went down the line and used the bracket to mark and drill the other holes. It took about 2 hours to install. You also need a stud finder to make sure you install these on the actual studs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid, easy to install shelf","review":"The shelf is deceptively strong. The rated load is 400 pounds per shelf (distributed evenly). Basically, you could fill this shelf with pieces of steel until it was falling off and probably never reach the 400 pounds. There are 3 lag screws per shelf support. Installation instructions advised drilling a 3/16\\" pilot hold into a stud to attach the bracket. Incredibly strong and over-built. If there is a weak point, it would be in lateral stability, but the brackets are quite thick steel, formed from one piece. Installation took me about an hour. The instructions say to use a 7/16\\" driver for the screws, but mine needed a 1/2\\" driver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very solid","review":"These are very heavy duty shelves.

There are very few children's books which are age-appropriate on the subject of Vietnam and wars. Eve Bunting works her magic as an author to convey a very touching story (I had to grab the Kleenex box!). Her book will help teach the upcoming generations about the sacrifices that all military veterans made by serving America and the impacts on their families. The story explains the significance of the Vietnam Memorial Wall and the different expressions of tributes left by family members.The illustrator's (Ronald Himler) pictures are soft but powerful in their visual impact. The illustrations compliment Eve Bunting emotional writing. This book should be in every public school and public library! As an elementary school teacher, I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Wall\\" is a Patriotic Book","review":"\\"The Wall\\" is a patriotic book.

When the father reads the names on the wall, the boy imagines each name as a real person, standing next to him and talking to him.If you are interested in the Vietnam War and how people sacrificed their lives fore us, then \\"The Wall\\" would be a good book for you to read.I gave this four stars out of five because I found the book to be very moving. If you like books about wars, then you'll like \\"The Wall.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a few words...","review":"As a 4th grade teacher, I am always on the look out for new books to spark interest.

I hope that this book willgive my students a feel for the mood at The Wall. A very moving book, a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read aloud for Veterans' Day","review":"I first chose this book because of the author, Eve Bunting. She writes in a way that my third grade students can understand. Then I chose it because it was about the Vietnam War Memorial, a lesser known war/memorial.I previewed the book while I was at Morning Duty. I had tears in my eyes as I read it! So touching.

She does so through a process of internal critique of some commonly held Christian beliefs. She begins by affirming the transcendence of God and God as creator. She then argues that on the grounds of these beliefs, a fixed hierarchy of people is unjustifiable. Oppression and injustice must be opposed as all are children of God. Therefore, all people must be given respect. Further, differences must be respected, since the transcendence of God implies that we will never be able to judge fully. Activism is advocated, provided that it remains humble in light of human sinfulness.This is a wonderful book for those who are seeking a way to understand justice in light of Christian beliefs. If you are interested in the practical application of theology, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible !!","review":"I just heard the Tancredi overture from this disk on the radio.

With HP black ink cartridge #21, it is very convient, and easy to setup into your HP deskjet 3930 series printer. This cartridge is very inexpensive, and affordable for HP printers. I think of it as a must for your HP printers. While there are cartridges that are difficult to open, and install into your printers, this one installs in a snap.

This ink cartridge works mainly on the HP Deskjet 3900 series, and prints great copies of files from your printer.

The b&w print quality is amazing... much better than my old Epson, which I though was superior. It's almost as good as laser quality.

He knew ALL of his colors by the time he was 1 1/2 years old! He really likes the front of it the most-he likes to \\"pop\\" the balloons every night at bedtime. If your child is learning/struggling with his/her colors I highly recommend this book. Even if they already know their colors it's great for counting as well. My son also knows how to count to almost 20 and I think he got to 10 from playing with this book.

The ballons are attached to the book with ribbon which is long enough to tangle easily, but is not long enough for little hands to manuever the balloons into place.

When you kneel down to do something, it pops open, which allows the zipper to come undone. Not cool.3.)

I know very little of WWI apart from something about an assassination at Sarajevo and mustard gas, so I hoped a budget label DVD [Eagle Media] would give me an idea of what the war was about and if I wanted to add more prestigious DVD releases to my collection.What I got was a potted, disjointed, blandly read narration over a lot of very poor quality stock footage (which is never referenced and rarely had anything to do with the narration) all accompanied by an endlessly repeating snippet of music from Elgar.The DVD cover promises \\"Gripping Drama,\\" \\"Complex Characters\\" and \\"True Stories.\\" This DVD delivers on none them.I give this item one star only for presenting historical footage I've never seen before; otherwise, I would advise viewers to avoid this poorly produced waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary and Often Disturbing!","review":"This is an excellent blend of sounds and background for a truly terrifying haunted house. The individual tracks follow a theme, but they blend well together. Many of the segments can get almost disturbing!

But as far as a \\"serious\\" and non-comedic haunted house CD, this is the best I have found."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated and Corny!","review":"Being a fan of haunted houses and horror films this sound effects album had me curious.

Some of the voice acting is overkill and embarassing. I got this for about $4.00 and felt ripped off.

However, a France/Belgium are grossly overrepresented (yes, I am not enthusiastic about the popular belief of Gallic culinary superiority), while smaller nations got the boot...some pan-european foods seem to have simply been tucked into the first convenient section...the section on Russia is somewhat lacking and the dishes are misspelled. Still, a very lovely and useful set."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"There are good pictures showing each entry in the book. The recipes are for very exotic foods.

In my many years of watching I've never found a documentary as well done as this. It's entertaining and disturbing at the same time. The use of photographs and voices in this production are put together quite well and by far surpass any other production I've ever seen. I would definately recommend this to even new students of the war, although this is done well enough to impress even historians who have spent many years in study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't this out on DVD?","review":"I've seen all 4 WWI documentaries available but this is the only one not available on DVD which is frustrating because it is the best in my view. Grim alla the Civil War series from Ken Burns as some have said, but it covers the whole terrible war in such different ways it's worth it. When you realize that 3 of the principle countries that started up the war Germany, England, Russia, were led by leaders who were all 1st cousins of each other your compelled to watch the rest of the series. The narration; the human details; the social ramifications it reveals about the war which are all done so well, make it the best documentary not available on DVD. 50kmwalk"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't worry about DVD version","review":"This is the finest documentary on the first world war that I have ever seen. It is essential learning for an understanding of the events that are unfolding before us today. When I first purchased this series on VHS it cost me + $80.00.

It's comfortable and the velcro seems to hold just fine. It's adjustable and I'd definitely buy this iten again. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the cover!","review":"I'm guessing they were trying to appeal to a male crowd with this cover. It has nothing to do with the movie. It is a nice romantic comedy with some fun stuff for British football fans. Let me clarify: No random toppless woman. This is not Bachleor Party. My boyfriend follows British Football and it was fun for him to see some of his teams and be a part of the fan culture there. I follow Colin Firth, and it was fun for me to see him in another cute romantic comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better with each viewing","review":"The first time I watched this film, I was less than impressed. Not being personally involved with a sports fanatic, I could not understand \\"Paul's\\" obsession with English football (or Soccor, as we Americans would call it), or \\"Sarah's\\" finally coming to accept his addiction. But after several subsequent viewings, my opinion improved. When I approached it not as a love story, which I had expected it to be, but more of a tale of personal growth, I enjoyed it much more. In fact, I would have to rate it right behind \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" to be my 3rd favorite Colin Firth film (\\"Pride & Prejudice\\" is, of course, first). All of the actors are very good, and watching the sequences of his adolescence makes the viewer aware of life's many passages. All in all, an excellent film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute but rumpled","review":"Took a few viewings to warm up to this movie. Very similar to High fidelity. I suspect it would be a lot more meaningful if I was Bristish. Not used to seeing Colin Firth looking so rumpled, but got used to it after a while. Didn't really feel any chemistry between these two people. Some logistics bothered me...ie: when she hails a cab with no purse.....hmmm, how does she pay?? Minor point, but bothersome just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fever Pitch - Enamored with Arsenal FC","review":"First of all, I have to say up front that I am both a football (aka soccer) fan and an ardent Arsenal supporter, so this film was almost a must see, at least for me. That said, I will state that the film has its share of poignant moments, almost all of them revolving around the central character's obsession with all things Arsenal, and the level to which this frustrates his girlfriend as she attempts to build a meaningful relationship (with Arsenal always in the way). If you have more than a passing interest in football, and you want to get an English perspective on the subject, this is a good film. I would also recommend \\"Green Street Hooligans\\", a film that chronicles the adventures of a US college student (Elijah Wood) who moves to London and falls in with a group of football fanatics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Original Film","review":"Fever Pitch is a story about a teacher who is an obsessed soccer fan. He falls into a relationship with a fellow teacher, who totally cannot relate to his soccer enthusiasm. I enjoyed this film, especially Colin Firth's performance, he is such a versatile actor! No Mr. Darcy here. This flick made me wonder how many other men are such fans of sport that their lives are immersed in it to the inclusion of everything. If you are a football, golf, (name your sport) \\"widow\\" this film may help you understand the obsession of it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something you can relate to","review":"I have read Nick Hornby's novel and finally got this movie to watch. Without a dobut, it's great as I thought it would be. Being a soccer fan for some years, I really appreciate that someone can tell my feeling about this sport that truely. And I was kind of envy Paul that his friends and families all turn out to be so supportive. What a lucky guy! Anyway, to answer one of the poster's question why that Arsenal wears yellow shirts sometimes. It's because their away shirt is yellow and black, and their home jersey is red and white. Since the last match is Liverpool versus Arsenal, and Liverpool's home jersey is red as well, in order to avoid confusions, Arsenal used their away colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"fantasy","review":"A cleverly directed film can inspire audiences to share the characters' affection for each other, but just as often, films fetishize obnoxious, childish, or selfish behavior, and watching two people mysteriously bond over actions that should drive them apart is generally more baffling than affirming...Such is the case with Sarah and the unbearable Paul.No self respecting woman (or man for that matter) would find such behaviour in any way endearing. The status of their relationship at the end of the film makes me think Fever Pitch belongs in the fantasy/science fiction category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reply to writer from San Marco, CA","review":"Arsenal's home jersey's are red, but their away jersey's are yellow. Travelling fans will often wear their home jersey's when following their team on the road, but the team will naturally be wearing their away jerseys. This is consistent for all teams across Europe - different colour home and away kits."},{"rating":"1","title":"No TITLE","review":"I did not enjoy this movie on the grounds that the characters were unsympathetic and boring. At the end of this film I walked away not caring about the movie or the people in it. The cover of the box said \\"Romantic Comedy\\" but the film was neither romantic or funny. Colin Firth plays an emotional ... soccer geek who hooks up with a desperate ... retentive co-worker. No passion. Nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a B movie","review":"I'm sorry, but Colin Firth or not, this movie was awful. I couldn't continue to watch it and never saw the end. A definite B movie in picture quality and poor story development. The story was missing continuity, you'll be wondering if you missed something. I'm sure Colin had no control over the final edit. A true waste of talent. If you are looking for eye candy, stick with Pride and Prejudice, Bridget Jones Diary and Importance of Being Earnest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"I really enjoyed this film and I know nothing about soccer. I liked the acting and as a teacher I found the relationshop between CF and his students very heart warming. Unlike others though I did not like the hair. It put me in mind of something large and furry having crawled onto CF's head and died. Never mind though, he looked great otherwise and the performance was surprisingly complex and moving. I liked the ending unlike a previous reviewer. Were you looking for more detail? Did you miss the point that he could \\"move on\\" from his passion to a new one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Experimental Science Fiction at it's best.","review":"When I first came across 'Stone' in the bookstore I was intrigued by the although a little unsure once I realized it was written in the form of 'letters'. However my doubts were misplaced - I was immediately engrossed in the book after page one and could not put it down. 'Stone' is a brilliant science fiction filled with such incredibly creative ideas, and a happy departure from the more conventional science fiction books. Some of the ideas presented made my head spin, but in a good way, and I'll be sure to purchase more of Adam Robert's books. A brilliant science fiction book I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"A good example of using a reading list. I have read this one before, a few years ago, and hadn't remembered, even when talking about it. Whacky. Anyway, a man is hired because he has no nanotech in his body, and is willing to kill.The novel takes it base theme from quantum probability.Such a combination doesn't really exist anywhere else. He is in prison, being 'executed' - that is, they have removed all his beneficial nanotech and left him baseline.He wanders around for decades deciding if he should fulfil his contract: namely, killing all 60 million people on a particular planet.He eventually discovers, after some adventures, who is behind all this, and it is not who he expected. A large quantum motivated manipulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it away after 160 pages","review":"The plot is \\"one thing after another\\" -- Conan the Barbarian plotting (I read one of those once, must have been desparate). Inventive, well-written.But, the character is pathological, and there is a lot of re-thinking and re-living the murder by knife which is described so well. Not someone you would like to know, not particularly interesting in his pathology.Possibly there is some brilliant plot yet to come. Possibly there is some deep connection to quantuum physics. But, they sure aren't revealed by page 160.I pass along almost all of the books I buy. This one, I threw away.I read tons of SciFi, prefer 'hard', where there are serious constraints because of scientific laws. There isn't much discussion of such, and is nearer fantasy than 'hard' SciFi. At least for the first 160 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitler's War is very well-made","review":"Hitler's War is a very informative documentary. I had seen some of these clips before, but not as good in picture quality as you will see here. You see footage of Hitler giving speeches with English subtitles, which is always interesting to see. Although I disagree with his actions, his bravery and dedication to improving Germany held good intentions (unfortunately, he chose a path of slaughter to reach his goals). Great archival footage of soldiers fighting, planes dropping bombs, Hitler leading his followers, buildings burning, and hostages being shipped away (never to be seen again)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best.","review":"Needing only a few bucks more to complete a free shipping order, I tacked this on. Normally I read some reviews of a product before I decide to get it, but I skipped it this time. It came back to bite me in the butt. After watching the first of 2 parts I started to get the impression that this was a little different than the war I had had an interest about for 40 some years. Lo and behold the credits revealed it written by a revisionist named David Irving. Had I read a few of the reviews by some of the other very observant participants who purchased this item, I would have skipped it.There may be some good footage as well as a general overview of the course of the war, but it interjects some subtle \\"poor Germany\\" and \\"vicious Allies\\". into the narrative. I won't go into much more other than to say save your money and put it towards something like BBC's \\"The World At War\\" or Millcreek Entertainment's \\"War In Europe\\". Don't let this one come back and bite you in the butt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent World War II Documentary","review":"This is probably one of the best WWII documentaries I've seen. Great footage of a very high quality, some of which I hadn't seen before.The only caveat is that the entire war is covered in a short two hours. But for students of WWII, this DVD should be used as a good overview, prompting further inquiry into the specifics."},{"rating":"2","title":"when Hitler started his march to the failure?","review":"This documentary is good, but incomplete. This incompleteness implicitly shifts the date when Hitler started his march to the failure. It was not 1944, or 1942, or even 1941, when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. It was September 1, 1939, when Hitler invaded Poland. Stalin badly tricked Hitler. Hitler invaded Poland and got the declaration of war from the Poland's allies. From that moment on Stalin's own military efforts were always considered fair and positive, including the occupation of the rest of Poland according to the secret paragraphs of Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. War on 2 sides is very dangerous, in most cases disastrous. And Hitler fell into this trap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross","review":"So, I ordered this a while back when I was trying to get on a health kick.

I checked the web and many others are reporting this same skin reaction to acai berry - so beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect to learn physics","review":"The makers of this series are particularly good at exploiting your fears about the AP test. No matter what they say, reading this book will not automatically guarantee a 5 on the AP exam. Whatever you would have received before getting this book will be the score you get after reading it. But, it's utility lies in the fact that, after taking the practice tests, you will know what sort of a score to expect. I consider myself to be one of those rare people in high school who actually understands and appreciates physics, and looking back at this book, I thought the attempt at teaching physics was horrible. Buy this book only for the practice tests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice kitchen and good company","review":"This kitchen is very nice and also high quality. It has everything the little one needs and keeps him busy for hours. It is difficult to put together and took about two hours. In my opinion it was well worth it.

A part arrived damaged and they sent a replacement with no hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this kitchen set!","review":"Ditto to EVERYTHING the previous reviewer said. This is an amazing, high quality kitchen set. We love it!

It offers useful and cogent advice to all writers. \\"The African American Guide to Writing and Publishing NonFiction,\\" is a wonderful addition and follow-up to her equally dynamic book a year or so ago, \\"Free Within Ourselves.\\" Perhaps the reason why the reader in Alexandria, Va. was unable to understand or appreciate Ms. Parker-Rhodes new book is because the reviewer is simply confused and moronic about all of the elements that are needed in order to create a masterful piece of writing.Careless errors such as misspellings and unintelligible ramblings as vividly noted in the hapless reviewers jumbled critique of the book, are the sure signs of a bumbling amateur and not a serious author.

The first few chapters are relatively interesting, covering some of the early internal development that's not widely covered elsewhere, but as soon as he gets near the antitrust stuff, Andrews is so pro-Microsoft that it's tough to believe what he's saying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing and Informative","review":"You've all heard of Billionaire Bill Gates and the Merry Men of Microsoft. The story, in light of the recent antitrust ruling, is a good bit of modern history. Although a little too heavy on the biographies of the players, the narraive is well paced and seemingly objective. This book is for all who are using Windows, those who hate it, and wonder all about the Redmond, Washington company and what goes on behind its walls. The story is basically that of Microsoft and how it was about to write off the Internet until it was forced to work with it- and did it so well that the Feds came in (and other companies) want to put a stop to it. Really, this book is well written and entertaining for all those who, like me, want to keep up with the history of this seemingly overnight phenomenon known as the Internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rarity!","review":"I actually saw this text being transcribed from the handwritten diary.

The text is annotated with well-researched information about the various locations described in Wilson's diary. This book is of interest not only to lovers of Victorian era travelogues but also to people who like to compare what places look like today with what they looked like in the 1800s."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUD! and broken from the beginning","review":"We bought this dishwasher because supposedly it had \\"Quiet Wash sound package\\".

Added into the mix is the cop's mediator buddy (Chow Yun-Fat) whose trying to broker a peace between the two while simultaneously romancing the drug lord's girlfriend. What this film lacks is a certain pizazz. There's a certain workmanlike quality to the direction of the film, competent but nothing special. The action scenes even have a humdrum quality to them. You find yourself imagining what if John Woo had directed this film. Or would he have passed on the material? Nevertheless, the two leads give excellent performances which elevate the film from the merely mundane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tempos are far too fast","review":"The sound and playing are fine, but the tempos are so fast that it sounds as if the conductor's on speed.

I am very grateful to their foresight and knowledge. They both had grown up during the depression and had seen the decline of old time skills first hand, as modern technolgy skyrocketed through the 20th century.

This book is not only treasured by me but I plan to pass it on to my children aswell. I have picked up a extra copy so each has his own.

The author, who apparently knew Greene, seemingly was so proud of this that she spends multitudinous pages telling us, in dry and unreadable form, how important she was in his life (not very). She fails to draw us in with what this story could and should be: a celebration of two unique beauties. I'm returning the book, and I never do that. I won't finish the story, and I usually read even the driest of books voraciously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Greene nor Capri...","review":"Shirley and Francis must have lived a more interesting life than the one depicted in this book. The book is about a literary couple who interacts with Graham Greene once a year on Capri for a short time over a number of years. Or at least Francis was literary -- Greene certainly did not see Ms. Hazzard as a peer. Close friends they were not.The book is barely about Capri and much less about Greene. However, the book is about Ms. Hazzard's pretentiousness.What little valuable information is found in the book, is hidden among difficult prose and incomplete thoughts. Ms. Hazzard goes from one topic about herself and F. to another. Every so often Greene is introduced as an after thought.Her book is sad, not because Greene was always difficult in personal situations, but due to her own frustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I got this for my granddaughter, who has just started guitar lessons.

They hold a setting firmly and yet are fast and easy to adjust. So these are easy to praise, as are all of my Starrett tools.

I was sceptical because most curlies use some type of gel or curl activating product. Most kinky curlies use a lot more then that. I shampooed with the rusk shampoo, applied this conditioner, raked it thru, rinse some of it out, smoothed it through and let it air dry. I had a better curl pattern then if I had used gel of curl activator like miss jessie, or deva, or curlisto, or eco, or jessecurl or any of the other 9000 products I have. IN addition I have a problem with frizz on one side and a kinkier pattern in the back. I had no frizzs (which is unheard of) and the curls in the back were defined.I'm writing this review because all of us curlies spend tons of money on product and here's a simple solution...a real wash and go.I did have shrinkage but will try to find a solution.

My bunny ate it, but picked out the softer bits and left the majority of the hay untouched. The way he dug in it with his face made me concerned that he would jab himself with a pointy piece and hurt himself. This stuff is not amazing quality like they lead you to believe.

I made sure after each use to clean the filters completely so as to not give this 'fragile' machine anything to choke on. Anyway, about a month and a half after I bought it, it lost 90% of its suction power. I grabbed it, and like another reviewer on here, sent it slamming into a dumpster.

Anyway, someone complained about it loosing sucking power after a while......I assumed their filters were clogged, etc.....so after each time I used, I cleaned the vacuum filters GOOD.

I quickly found that it doesn't really pick up much of anything except carpet fuzz and hair, which quickly clog it. It's extremely top heavy and falls over all the time. The hose is almost completely useless because it's so short. You'll end up crawling on the floor and essentially dragging the vacuum (which obviously will fall over on you) to actually use the hose. It spits stuff on my legs all the time and leaves a nice little pile of dirt when you turn off the power. I feel like every time I get this vacuum out to clean, I end up doing very little cleaning at all! Most of the time, I'm sitting on the kitchen floor using a coat hanger to unclog it or washing the stupid filter. I'm glad to know it wasn't just me that was having these problems -- and I'm definitely glad I didn't actually pay for this. I'm going to look for a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good and the bad","review":"I already own a kirby, but bought this just over a year ago for something a little easier to use and not quite as heavy.It does pick up very well and the filter is easy to clean.

The suction is routed through the hose at all times, whether you're using the hose attachment or using the vacuum as an upright. No matter how diligent you are about keeping the filter clean and the canister emptied, the hose clogs constantly. Once it does, the brush just creates dust bunnies that it then deposits all over the carpet. I've had to take it apart a half dozen times to clean the dust and carpet fiber out of the hose. I plan to toss this thing in the trash. I sincerely hope that no one else in the world buys this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves a Zero","review":"This product is such a waste of money.

I wouldn't even donate this one to charity, that is how bad it really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"I thought it worked great, too, until about 5 days into owning it. Then it started kicking dirt out the back when on bare floors, like one of the other reviewers said. If you vacuum in shorts you'll feel it spitting stuff onto your legs - it's a very unpleasant and rediculous thing to have happen. I bought the Hoover Savvy - we'll see how that one works. If not, I'll have to pony up for one of the serious ones.I will NEVER buy Eureka again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleans great but....","review":"I bought this today from Costco for 99.00 and easily assembled it with the instructions in about 10 minutes. I started to vacuum my house and was absolutley amazed at how much it was picking up, and how much my old one left behind. About 5 minutes after I started the hepa filter & cover came flying off the front of the vacuum. I put it back on double checking it, and emptied the dirt and cleaned the foam filter. I started again and the hepa filter flew off within 30 seconds. It just won't stay on any longer. I also found that the tube extension for the hose fell of alot, so I turned it over thinking I had it on upside down, but only to find it came off again very easily.Bottom line, I love the way it cleans, but with parts falling off the first 10 minutes I am going to return it to Costco tomorrow to try another model or brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't handle dog hair - waste of money","review":"The other reviews are obviously from employees of Eureka. This vacuum can't handle dog hair at all and whoever engineered the thing should be fired. We have 3 dogs, plenty of dog hair and the only rugs we have to vacuum are throw rugs. We just bought ours at Costco and the third time I used it I noticed a major problem. As I was emptying the canister, I noticed some hair lodged where the dirt and hair flow into the canister. As I reached up and around to pull it out (the area behind the filter is only about a fingers width deep which is the problem), I literally pulled out another canister full of dog hair that was lodged. Note: I did turn on the vacuum first to see if the lodged hair would blow out and it didn't.Can't return it to Costco fast enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST....VACUUM....EVER","review":"This vacuum absolutely SUCKS! I received this as a housewarming gift from my in-laws and I swear that they are trying to punish me. It shoots dirt and kitty litter out the back side and impales in into my legs. Then when you turn it off, it dumps all the rest out on to the floor. Then you have to use a dust-buster to clean up what you just vacuumed up. If I could rate this as zero stars I would. Save your money, unless you enjoy a dirty carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a vacuum? Could have fooled me.","review":"I feel so dumb for not researching this product before purchasing it. We had it for 2 years, and it pretty much stopped being a vacuum after about 6 months. Now it just moves stuff around on the carpet, and sucks up the dust and cat hair a bit. I never use the attachments or the duster because they are stupid and fall off if you bump into anything. I spend most of my time pulling my hair off the roller brush so I don't burn out the motor. Honestly, I think I would get more stuff up by sweeping my carpet with a broom. Please don't make the mistake of buying this poorly-designed machine that Eureka dares call a \\"vacuum cleaner\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please skip this product","review":"I bought this to replace my old Hoover Elite. Well, I am glad I did not throw the Hoover out. I hope this bagless craz ends soon.Pros, shinney fairly quiet.Cons. Short hose, few attachments, clogs esily in bothe the intake and the inner filter. Cannot handle any hair or fiber without clogging. Not much pickup power. Brush attachement spins)is useless. Note: of you catch the corner of a rug, it will burn the belt in two before you can turn it off. Easy to replace, I guess it has to be.All in all a poorly designed product.If you are in need of a new vacuum, save your money and search yard sales and thrift store for a older bag one. You will be glad you did. If yours has broken down, spend the money to have it repaired."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for the price","review":"I have had this now for 2 years. It picks up ok, we have a dog so it gets a ot of dog hair. The hose doesn't work well, there is very little suction. You always have to clean the filters just about everytime you use it so you will have full power. I tried a Dyson after I used this very good on my carpet and the Dyson picked up a little bit that the Eureka didn't but for the price I'm not going to run out and get an Dyson.I would stay away from this vacuum, I would not buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out great, but didn't last 9 months","review":"I bought this vacuum thinking that at the price I would be happy if it lasted a year. It didn't even last 9 months. It started out great. It did a better job than any expensive vacuum I've owned and the dirt cup is super easy to empty. The suction was phenomenal and my carpets looked and felt great after using it. It was effortless to use. It pretty much propelled itself. After about 6 months the vacuum stopped moving by itself, taking more effort to push it, and the suction was not as good. Even though I had always kept the filter clean and made sure there were no blockages, the problems persisted. I kept using it because it still picked up dirt and I really, really loved the vacuum since it was so easy to empty and even picked up dirt from the side edges. I had to finally give it up, after using it about 7 months, because it started smoking. The motor just burned up. It was a real disappointment because it worked so well in the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This thing has been spewing dust and dirt out behind it every time I run it.

I even wrote in to them to express how poor of a product they have produced and I never do things like that - but this vacuum is just plain terrible.The belt breaks like it's its job, and any time you stop moving or turn it off, it leaves a large pile of dirt, dust and debris at that spot.It has also broken twice, and now the motor smokes when it runs.

I do not use it frequently as we have hard surfaces in most of our rooms; however, I've cleaned the filters and dump the dirt cup frequently, to no avail. We do not even have pet hair in our home to clog it up. This is by far the worst vacuum I've ever owned (Hoover & Dirt Devil being the other brands). I'm now looking into an Oreck instead! I wish I'd have saved my $100 or so and put it toward the Oreck in the first place!! I would NOT recommend this product at all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say NO to Eureka","review":"What an AWFUL vacuum. Well, you get what you pay for I guess. We put up with it for 2 years because money was tight. What a joke!We have two basset hounds who shed all year, this \\"vacuum\\" would merely flatten the dog hair into the carpet and pick up only a fraction of it. The \\"filter\\" would need to be cleaned after each use otherwise there was little to no suction. The cup was gross, we will never use bagless again, dust everywhere!

Well written and I found the book filled with interesting pieces that relate to the present.

It's like Smedvig is praying with his trumpet. The voicings are terrific, too. If I'm not mistaken, the final phrase is played by a French horn, not a trumpet. It is more muffled, distant, with a mellower tone. Almost like God is answering the prayer from far away (ie heaven). This piece of music really lends itself to the listener's imagination with regard to the topic of the prayer, the identity of the person praying, and the outcome of the prayer.

When Philip finally succeeds in getting Sabrina to marry him for he compromises her by taking care of her the five days in the hunting cabin. He later becomes so insensitive to her feelings almost one step from being just like her brother-in-law when he physically hits her. I thought she went why off character then. The story redeems itself towards the end. I love her bride series and the Calypso Series, but this book left me lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"typical, but I am left wondering...","review":"I liked the story, but it seems like characters appear out of nowhere, (like Richard Clarendon, and Charles) that leave me wondering if the book is part of a trilogy or series. There is a feeling like walking into a movie part way through. I do like the fact that Catherine Coulter does not summarize the other stories in a series like so many other author's do, ruining the story if you did not start at the beginning. By accident I bought the Wild Baron, and it appears to be a paralel of The Offer, connected through Phillips friend Rohan Carrington. I wish that the trilogy's or series were identified more clearly. I like to read a whole group at once, but can't if I don't know what the other books are called. The Offer had no reference to the Wild Baron on its cover.

Coulter had a good idea, I will have to give her that much. But she just didn't do anything with it. At least, not anything that would make for a good book. The hero is everything that a girl shouldn't want in a man: He keeps a mistress (I have no problem with rakes being the heroes in a book, but not when they have a mistress after marriage) and he actually hits the heroine. And aside from that, I can't see at all why the heroine supposedly loves him. His only saving grace is his looks and the fact that he saved her--not enough for this odd couple. And the ending left me totally confused. Whatever you do, DO NOT read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was hideous! Thin characters, lame plot.","review":"Gimme a break.

It started well enough, but by the time Charles (Phillip's friend and some friend at that) discoverd them alone at the cottage I had lost all the interest that had felt in the beginning.

Their Pastelbord is designed to have a unique sandy clay coating over a strong wooden board. Its unique, fine grain tooth holds pastels and other dry media like no other pastel surface. I really preferred this to the pastel papers I've tried.The fine \\"tooth\\" of the surface makes it is to blend colors, layer, and experiment with pastel techniques.Some people also use Pastelbords for water media, since they are so extremely absorbent. I haven't tried that, but I have used the \\"untoothed\\" Claybord 11\\"x14\\" Smooth and Claybord 11\\"x14\\" Textured for water media, with good results.These are available in lots of sizes and colors, so be careful to pick the right boards before you check out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rips Off the Fans","review":"I'm sorry, but the strategy of releasing compilations consisting of old material plus one or two new tracks automatically earns a \\"no Good\\" rating from me.The fans are the reason artists can release these compilations in the first place. For newcomers, adding a couple of new tracks makes no difference: to them, all the tracks are new. No, they do this for one reason only -- to get fans to pony up full CD price for the two tracks they don't already own.This is the kind of marketing that has earned such contempt from the public, and this is the why file-sharing services thrive. I've been a Cockburn fan for a long, long time and I own every one of his albums. It's a real slap in the face to release two new songs and not make them available, except at exorbitant prices, to the people who have supported him throughout his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce is amazing","review":"This is a nice compilation of tunes, old and new. My Beat is great, and so is Tokyo. They are all terrific, really. I highly recommend this album!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Singles -- Not his best stuff","review":"I've bought every Bruce Cockburn album since his 1969 debut. His best stuff is his ballads. When he sticks to acoustic guitar and spritual moods, he is the most awesome singer-songwriter of our time. When he waxes thick on his communist politics, I wretch, big time. Apparently, I'm not the only one. The late, great Michael Hedges (Windham Hill Music) said the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the Good Stuff on One Disc","review":"Anything Anytime Anywhere: Singles 1979-2002 puts some of the best Bruce Cockburn songs all in one place. From early favorites like \\"Wondering Where the Lions Are\\" to more recent gems like \\"Pacing the Cage\\" and \\"Last Night of the World,\\" this album features a great mix of songs that are fairly well-known. The only song that I miss in this collection is \\"One of the Best Ones.\\" Bruce's beautifully crafted lyrics and melodies make him an inspiration for burgeoning singer/songwriters like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"Buyer beware. The condition of the CD was described as \\"very good,\\" so I was disappointed when it arrived with a plain, slim-line cover and no liner notes, no song titles...nothing.

Live and learn, as they say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Herzog of pop","review":"I actually give this zero stars!!He is an example of the problem with heavy un-enlightened politics/ethics over riding music & art! With so much great music and brilliant inspired lyrics out there this can easily be avoided. Sometimes however people give you \\"their\\" music for your enlightenment. Thats how I ended up with some Bruce Cockburn and a few other musicians.

Apart from Bob Burns' incomparable passion for these icons of science fiction culture, what really emerges for me is a very accurate portrayal of Mr. Burns' big heart and generosity. Bob's intention was never to make money from his collection but rather to be a museum director and caretaker of priceless relics that millions of people have seen in many of the world's greatest films.

The reasons are:1. Recipes move back and forth between standard cup, tsp, tbsp measurements and oz for both dry goods and dairy products.2. Many of the recipes require prior knowledge of skill sets when things go wrong. Example, when the recipe for chocolate ganache required extra melting, you would have had to know about double boiling to make the recipe work.These are just a few of the issues I had with the book.

The story is very readable and comfortable, language is easy for young kids, the story develops a pattern that is recognizable and funny. This book teaches the concepts of causation, that is, one thing leads to another, and connectivity between events.

Too many times authors will rush to fill a need and forget the parameters of accurate reporting and authorship. I will not recommend this book to anyone unless you are prepared for a mountain of frustration especially when using the CD.Since Macromedia bought Elemental Software, the creators of Drumbeat, I have been monitoring the Drumbeat forums. It seems that Macromedia has their hands full in supporting this product. There is no doubt that Drumbeat can be a killer application once the bugs are worked out and the product matures.

In fact, if your looking for a book for a beginner, or looking to try different make-ups for the first time-this is your buy.

Of course, it's a bit dated, but I still expected some good tips, and I was not impressed at all.

For instance, there was a freckled red head who clearly would look good in warm colors such as gold, warm green etc, but the author chose to apply a yucky pastel blue on her.Honestly, there was nothing in this book that I didn't already know.

As this movie follows on from the first Major League movie, expect laughs and a couple of new faces. It continues with the same players who end up coming back to play for another season.

The team morale is down and they end up on a losing streak and then the witch comes back and buys the team back again.

I knew how much they would be missing if their father continued to be out of their lives for extended periods.My mother spotted this book while shopping and glanced through it. She thought that it would really be beneficial for me to present it to my daughters' Dad. We gave it it to him as a birthday gift in January. He was visibly touched the first time he read the book and he has since begun to play a much more active role as a parent.

The product itself is another story, but this is Rubbermaid's issue. I have an old (really old) dish drainer and drain tray, and they are large, much larger than the offered \\"large\\" tray and drainer, and constructed of heavy guage metal coated with - vynal?, rubber? Anyway, it has held up incredibly well and this new one is thin, weak, and unimpressive in comparison. The silverware dish does not hold much silverware and tends to come off. Ah, Rubbermiad - I would rather pay more for a quality product, than deal with these cheap, irritating products!

After a couple of years, several rows of vinyl started to split and rust developed on the bottom left. This is the opposite end where we put the long knives - ironically this side is still good. There are wide gaps in front and back where cups and small items will fall through. You will learn where to put them when the first one falls over and breaks.

Those days are gone, now they're made in China. The metal used is much lighter gauge which makes for a flimsy product. My drainer arrived dirty, it looked in used condition. The silverware basket (which did not match the drainer) was attached with clear tape. Under the tape was a lot of dirt and a short black hair..yuk! I still haven't found a sturdy replacement drainer. I know it won't be a Rubbermaid product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delighted with this book","review":"It's funny how some books end up getting used more than others.

I'm an ambitious baker, but when it comes to those night-before moments when I need to bake a batch of cookies for somewhere or someone, I'm more often than not a bit too tired. This is simply a very handy book and I've had lots of success with the recipes (although, looking back, almost 100% of my choices have been citrus-type cookies. I think the addition of bright flavors is what makes the dough taste like homemade). The lemon poppyseed tart is also quite good, very pretty and people were impressed (I put fresh blackberries on top--gorgeous).Thanks for a lovely, useful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend","review":"This book has such yummy and easy recipes.

The \\"genuine leather\\" is a cheap plastic shiny faux-alligator. It looks brown, not burgundy, but that is not the problem. It's the cheap materials it is made of. The stitching is fine, the main zipper works, the zipper compartment and front pouch are a good size and design for pens, markers, keys, and papers. The \\"leather look\\" trim is downright embarassing...the kind used on cheap Chinese-made toys sold at dollar stores.This one is by \\"Embassy\\" and it's too much trouble to mail back, but I won't give them as gifts.

The color of the trim on the item I received was black, in sharp contrast to the burgundy/brown color of the book cover. This emphasizes that the material the trim is made of is actually a different material than the rest of the book cover, in a bad way, looks like flat plastic/vinyl, as opposed to the leather/croc look of the rest of it. I would not have purchased this had I known this, but it's not worth returning.In terms of quality of it otherwise, it's large enough to hold a large book/bible, and also supple enough to bend easily.

Unfortunately, although the software worked fine for me, the quality of the scans is so hideously bad that I gave up in disgust after a few scans. Here are some of the problems: 1) strong pink tint to every scan. Although this can be corrected to some extent in software, there is a significant loss of color spectrum that cannot be restored. 2) Poor dynamic range: rendering of shadow detail is nonexistent.

The suspicious \\"ninja attack\\" which supposedly occurred right before an Olympia, thus forcing him to withdraw, is not even mentioned here, though surely it ought to be discussed--if it were real, because that would be a major event in his career; if it were invented, because only by 'fessing up would he really be honest. I think that in this book Wheeler is working really hard to convince the reader that he, Flex, is a good guy. He might be, but methinks this book doth protest too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flex Ability","review":"This book really lets you see the real Flex Wheeler from the inside out.

This stuff is extremely hard and stick like; I can even tell that my guinea pigs are not crazy about this stuff. They like it for the fact that it's hay, but it is not something they would prefer to eat regularly. Even the fluffy treats on the top of the stocks are hard and brittle and not as fun for them to eat.

I'll let you know if they love the next kind though.*****So I just picked up some new hay,Peter's Nature Hay, Meadow Mix 13.5Lb (12 x 18oz)and I was amazed at what a difference there was in the feel and texture.

I also use this on my underarms and bikini and it works great.2. Make sure you exfoliate!!!!I had a big problem again on my legs pretty much only with red bumps and ingrown hairs. After speaking to my mom (who is an esthitician) she recomended using a product call Tend Skin. There is also another one called Solution 2 that I found that works well also. If you exfoliate and use either one of those products and can stand some pain initially it is definately worth it to have such smooth skin with no stubble and save your time and money from having to wax.

It hardly picked up any hair.. I would go over it 5 times, and I would be lucky if it plucked one. Bottom line--don't buy this product, you won't be happy.

I figured since they were highlighting it and most reviews were pretty good that it must be a great product. I was very, very wrong. I followed all the directins to a T. It was painful, but I'm okay with that if it works, but it does NOT! I would say it removed about 50% of the hair and that was after about 1 1/2hrs of painful leg shaving. Plus it makes a huge mess wherever you are using it. All the hair just falls to the floor, if you do buy this I recommend placing a towel under the area you are shaving. It did NOT work on my underarms at all and I was too scared to try my bikini area since it didn't work any where else.

I used to have an Emjoi which I bought from the Sharper Image which was better and used to catch more short hairs, but this is pretty good too. The only reason that I bought this one is that I accidentally broke the other one (by plugging it into a 220V outlet). I had my first Emjoi for about 4 years so they last a good while. I don't know if this one is worth the expense though as I bought a Braun overseas and it worked about the same and was about $30. It didn't have a battery though.The main reason I posted this was to say that this DOES NOT WORK WHILE PLUGGED IN, which was surprising to me. Other than that, it's a pretty good epilator and while the extra guard and loufa-type pad are of no use to me, I bought this anyway because of my previous Emjoi which was very similar to this one.EDIT: I checked again about a week ago and it started to work while plugged in!

Unlike In Motion which is pretty upbeat, Eat Sleep Repeat is definitely a huge turn-around for Copeland. It reminds me of Beneath Medicine Tree but it's much more polished and experimental. Eat, Sleep, Repeat has a very msytical, moodier sound than anything Copeland has recorded previously. I absolutely love this cd. At first I was skeptical and then I heard Love Affair and Safer On An Airplane and everything seemed to come together for me. The Last Time He Saw Dorie is gorgeous as well. The lyrics on this album are so well written. They're so jam-packed with emotion, love, and desperation it's beautiful and poetic as ever. I love this band ... they have yet to disappoint me. I'm really glad they chose to experiment as they have because it showcases how much talent they've really got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"This album is surprisingly different than Copeland's past albums.

But with every listen, my love for it grew. \\" The Last Time he Saw Dorie\\" especially caught my attention with the gorgeously haunting female voice accompanying Aaron Marsh.

Along with those familiar flicks, the band also adds in some things never before experienced by Copeland fans such as intricate piano as well as a backround female vocal part on one song--a very haunting and beautiful melody. As for me, I just got the cd the other day but I dont' expect it to leave my cd player for weeks, and when it does, I'll still be humming the melodies and mumbling the choruses under my breath.

Love them! My only gripe was that the ones I ordered had tiny variations in the glaze. Not in the overall color from cup to cup, but there were a few small dark spots and I wondered if the particular seller that I had bought them from was selling higher quality seconds, since I hadn't noticed these variations in the in-store cups I had seen. At anyrate, I like idiosyncracies, so I was fine with that, but if that would irritate, you might want to consult with the seller first."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't tell you how to make ammo.","review":"It tells you how to make improvized gunpowder (like you didn't already know), but no instructions on how to make brass cases, without which, there is nothing to reload or cache and there is no point owning anything other than musket...I bet the gun/ammo grabbers are quaking in their boots !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Duncan Long Trash","review":"Yet again we are confronted with a book that is Long on BS and short of useful info, much like every other Duncan Long book.

With no much money, Mister Lo makes a nice reflection about the lost, first love, family and dreams. Mister Lo show us a honest and intimist story whith no pretentions and I'll wait with no doubt his next films...

Justin Lo (star, writer, director) does not convince in the lead role of Charlie. His acting is remarkably bad. The script he wrote has barely plausible plot elements and is generally weak story telling. The one star I have given this film is based solely on the fact that Mr. Lo at the age of 24, wrote, directed, edited, produced and acted in his own first film. That in itself is a feat to be reckoned with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be a friend","review":"I grew up with Anthony (The Author) I don't want to bash him, but his book was pure fiction.

I just have to remind him (if he reads this) of the time when Chris S. took Anthony's car over some coke and I had to go and retrive it because Anthony was too afraid.

Won't have to look up any of the words in a dictionary. I knew Anthony growing up, and it doesn't surprise me he became a snitch. I remeber asking some of my friends hung out with him. I never understood why. This book should be taken with a few grains of salt. He makes himself out as being such a goodfella. I wasn't surprised that he betrayed, and lied about, some of the people who were his friends, especially those he played music with. I'm sure that it wasn't hard for him to stretch the truth about his experiences.

I've even hung fly traps but they are in mass quantities, it's frustrating. So I wanted to give my poor pup some respite and got this to spray on him and his bedding (that is washed and changed daily) but I can spray this directly on a fly and they come right back and land on his bed. I soaked his bed with it right after a washing, still flies. I've sprayed my dog thoroughly and taken minutes to brush him thoroughly to make sure its on every strand of his fur, still flies come as soon as I stop brushing him. I used the bottle up just so as not to waste it but it did not work even a tiny little bit.

I saw it the whole way through, however, and I found the whole idea to be just average and nothing quite special. I liked a few of the characters, such as Louisa, however I really didn't like most of them, especially Glo. The overal way that these characters thought and acted wasen't very belivable to me, and I was displeased with the ending. Plus, the flashbacks of Louisa were quite long and boring to me.At the same time, I commend the plot and the theme, which I actually did like- the mercury poisoning, the defeat of being second best to your best friend- that is what I enjoyed and found more realistic.So I will say that I mixed feelings for the book, and I say to at least give it a try.

The format was not the problem.The play, at least for me, was neither moving nor meaningful. The story was lost in strangeness and confusion, and I read through entire scenes several times over, trying to figure out how the arc of the play was served.

The argument of this book is very interesting because, if many authors have a negative idea about this possibility, Ostrom is sure with a certain competence of this fact. The author supposes that the social action must born as collective. Next the problem is related to the possibility to talking about several situations.

I took a chance on it (as if I really had a choice) and I have to admit this thing is really put together well. The pieces are still connected in many places by the 'ball and socket' method, but its been manufactured very well. I would say that four years old is probably the cut-off age for playing with this unit (of course that always varies).

It came in the Robot form. Just getting it out of the box was a chalenge because it was wired in a manner that made removing the twist ties without a wire cutter very difficult. Transforming it into the truck was very complicated and it took a while for my son and I to do it with the cartoon picture instructions provided. (I am an engineer and my son is a computer genius.) Once transformed into a truck, my grandson played with it for a while and tried to change it back to a robot with no sucess. I found it difficult to transform it even after I had done it myself once.

It is a large toy with quite complicated transformations that took me a while to teach him (after another while learning them myself). He eventually mastered it and had a ton of fun with it. The individually moveable fingers and arms were a hit, as were the sound (sonic) features and the different ways to set up the feet. He also got Bumble Bee, which he found a way to fit in Optimus Prime's rear wheel rack. This toy proved very good at challenging his mind with the series of moves required for the transformations.

If you know what your microwave looks like, you're much better off with Desperation Dinners, which is excellent, and it doesn't insult your intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me guessing from first page to the last","review":"This is the first in the Wexford series and, I understand, Rendell's first novel. From the first page, the reader is dying to know who Doon and Minna are and how they relate to the murder of a reportedly plain and uninteresting woman. It wasn't until I neared the end that I was able to guess at any part of the solution. The tension and pace of this novel is just right -- amazing, especially for a first novel. One of the things I like best is that it hasn't been padded with the filler to which most writers resort in order to produce a 300-page book. In this shorter novel, every word counts and is worth reading. Now how often can you say that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"From Doon: Well written but predictable","review":"For well over thirty years I have been reading novels by Ruth Rendell and her nom de plume. Spotting FROM DOON WITH DEATH on the bookshelves, I was thrilled to come across one of her early works. Excitement and anticipation, however, soon led to a perfunctory interest. Rendell is an excellent writer, skilled at her craft, but early on it wasn't difficult to identify who Doon was. The suspense was therefore muted and the denouement all too predictable. Had her characters been more complex, this aspect would have at the very least sustained my interest. As it is, they all seemed rather superficially developed, and finally uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wexford's First, Not His Best","review":"Actually this is not Inspector Wexford's first case, but the first that Rendell wrote with him as the main character. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, this was her first mystery, period. And it's surprisingly dull, as far as I'm concerned. The \\"shocking\\" conclusion to me was obvious from the first few chapters -- I can't tell you why without giving it away -- and now, 30 years later, not so shocking. In fact, by today's standards, it's pretty tame, even quaint. The caliber of Rendell's work soars with her next mystery \\"Wolf to the Slaughter\\" and from there she just gets better and better. But this first effort didn't do it for me. Don't base your opinion of Rendell on this book -- unless you love it, of course! -- but do check out the rest of the Wexford mysteries, which are sublimely written and -- yes, truly -- shocking in their conclusions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME READ","review":"I read this book a long time ago and was surprised to see that more people had not read this one. This was my first Rendell book and I have been hooked ever since. It was done simply and masterfully. The author does an magnificent job of keeping the reader guessing along with the Inspectors. Wrapping your brain around this one should be fun. If this is your first mystery/thriller or a book you are just discovering, you shouldn't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quaint Beginning","review":"This is a quaint beginning to a powerful mystery series. I found the early characterization of Wexford to be fun, and the mystery he solves to be both puzzling and engaging. I'm amazed to see how Rendell's early creation has evolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Chief Inspector Wexford","review":"This is Ruth Rendell's first novel and first in the Inspector Wexford series. It is my first time reading any of her Inspector Wexford books which I purchased in the hardcover Black Dagger Crime series. Considering it's her first, it is an excellent read and I was clueless as to who the murderer was. Anxious to read more in the Wexford series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless Modem","review":"Works like a charm. It was so easy to setup and has been no hassle to use. Good product.

It is high quality, the perfect size, and cleans very easily. It's attractive too. Worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"spectacular","review":"I saw this movie once, went back to see it again the next week and then I saw it again on DVD. Everytime I see the movie I find new meanings to simple dialogs and scenes. Osment sees dead people. I saw a new meaning to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"Great movie. This should have won for best picture, and not Shakespeare in Love. And the ending is a jolt, completely unexpected. This is one movie everyone should see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie for people who don't know anything about movies","review":"This was the fourth best film of the 5 Oscar nominees, but it wasn't even that good. You realize the \\"trick ending\\" about 10 minutes into the film, and how it plays out after that is enough to make you giggle. In terms of Bruce Willis films, this is above average -- better than Armageddon and Mercury Rising, but not as good as The Last Boy Scout and Color of Night. The kid was good, but was given very little to work with, and thank God they cut out those lame scenes with the old man. The fact that the director fought to keep those scenes and hated to lose them proves that he is a cornball who will have a bright future making Spielberg-type films that lack edge. There are at least 56 X-Files episodes that blow this film away."},{"rating":"1","title":"I see dead marketing directors!","review":"The \\"movie\\" is great, but they RUINED the DVD with endless previews/trailers that you CANNOT skip over! For that, the \\"DVD\\" gets zero stars if I could. If you are to jam a DVD with worthless previews that you do not have at least the decent respect of the option of skipping, then I expect a 75% deduction off the list price. Or I will never buy another DVD from this production company again. They have joined the moronic ranks of DISNEY in the DVD dept. You are hated in every sixth sense of the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have won Best Picture of the Year!","review":"After seeing this movie I left the theater stunned! It was that good! Certain scenes still give me goose pimples! But unlike most horror films, this one had a REASON as to why this little kid was being \\"haunted\\" that made it all the more intriguing. Just an excellent, excellent video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Think for a moment...","review":"This film has many, many levels one could discuss. I will choose this to talk about. When I saw the preview of the film on TV, the \\"I see dead people\\" with Cole in bed, it was enough for me to know what was going on and when I actually saw the film--first off, the beginning tells you exactly what happened to the good doctor--I kept seeing the hints throughout the film that let me know for sure that the film's startling revelation was so...here's the thought. To me the story was, indeed, a wonderfully told one, but didn't you see what was happening long, long, long before the denoument, weren't the clues crystal clear way before the ending or were YOU \\"seeing what you want to see\\"?..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"When I first viewed the movie I was thinking it was going to be a horror flick but I was wrong. It is creepy at times but not scary. The acting was wonderful and it is even more interesting when you view it the second or third time. The only bad part was the previews on the DVD but it only took me a few seconds to fast forward through them ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Previews ruin a collector's edition...","review":"I am very, very disappointed in this DVD. It says right on the front cover that it is a \\"collector's edition\\" DVD -- however, when playing the DVD the first thing one sees is a preview for Mission to Mars, followed by previews for 4 other movies. A film this good should not be tainted by movie previews. Those belong in the VHS version.However, I must still give 5 stars to the movie because of the interesting extras on the DVD. The deleted scenes are great, and the director says a few words about each extra feature on the DVD (including the deleted scenes) which is a nice feature.No director's commentary, which I thought would have been a nice extra, but he talks about a lot of the interesting aspects of the film in the other extras (ie, the use of the color red).Still a good buy, but very sad that the producers of the DVD decided to put those previews in. They ruin what could have been the best movie in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater. However, the DVD was a big disappointment. Not only were the previews in the beginning not needed, there were vital scenes that were missing from the DVD that were in the original movie. These scenes are needed for the impact that the movie should give the viewer. If I had known that the movie was not the original version, I would not have purchased it. When they say \\"deleted scenes\\" on the back of the case, they don't mean previously deleted scenes have been added, they mean they have deleted scenes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Once-In-A-Lifetime Scary Mystery!","review":"If I had actually wrote a review, I would of gave away the whole film. Every little refrence to the film is a clue because people talk about the big parts. the big parts are the pieces to the puzzle. This film is a must see! And whatever you do:DON\\"T GIVE AWAY THE SECRET ENDING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Two Cents on the Sixth Sense","review":"The only word that can describe this film is AWESOME! I've actually seen this movie four times with various friends and relatives. Believe me, you'll get a kick out of watching others watch it for the first time! The Sixth Sense contains a beautiful balance of action, horror, and surprise! All of this is supported by outstanding cast performances. The ending will knock you off your feet! I can't wait to get my copy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-skipable previews unforgivable","review":"This WOULD BE one of the best DVDs on the market, except that the manufacturer added EIGHT MINUTES worth of previews to the beginning which cannot be skipped. For this reason I will never buy a DVD from this company again. EVER.I suggest you avoid this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and contrived, with little substance or depth","review":"The dialogue was contrived, wordy and not believable at all--as was the story. I never really got into this movie until the end--which I thought was the best part because it was such a freaky surprise. Apparently, I'm the only one who was genuinely surprised by the ending (or the only one honest enough to admit it); or perhaps I was so bored throughout it that I just didn't pay attention to the clues others picked up on. Anyway, if you do figure out the ending early on, there's really no reason to sit through the rest of it--as there's really nothing else of substance in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for the MOVIE","review":"The movie totally rocked when I first went to see it - it kept me at the edge of my seat, it had me jumping in surprise when something jumped out of nowhere, and Haley Joel Osment was absolutely amazing in it - HE deserved to be nominated for Best Lead Actor, because Bruce Willis, in my opinion, was just feeding off of Haley's superb, natural talent. BUT, the video on the other hand, is not worth buying, in my opinion. Once you know the secret ending, the movie becomes boring and tiring. All of a sudden, it seems like it's dragged on too long and you just want to fall asleep. So enjoy the movie the first time you see it, but don't watch it again cause it's a waste of your time after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"So overated and boring it's pathetic!","review":"The ending is a surprise but not a revelation if that makes any sense. The only thing good about the film is the performance of the little boy. The rest is just plain boring. I would've walked out if I had been by myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like fine wine, it gets better with age","review":"I liked this movie when I first saw it in theaters, but it was so hyped that I thought it was \\"OK, an average 3-star movie\\". By the time the Oscars rolled around I couldn't figure out why people thought Haley Joel Osment should win the trophy over Michael Clarke Duncan from \\"The Green Mile\\". When I saw \\"The Sixth Sense\\" again on DVD ... I remembered! His performance seemed more impressive the second time around, and it was fun to watch and search for \\"clues\\" after knowing the ending. This doesn't mean it's a movie for everybody! While I didn't find it scary at all, some people just don't like being creeped out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing scum at it worse.","review":"I will nt review the movie here, just the DVD lay-out. I payed over 700 dollars for my DVD player, and thousands for the DVD's I own. And most of that money was spent to get more control over my home video experince. Mainly the useless previews on almost all VHS tapes sold anymore is what I hated. I paid for this, I don't want anymore of your ads. Now that I have this DVD (not for long, it goes back in the morning) I am yet again forced to deal with these previews. 5 or so of them. And for bad movies too. Dusk til Dawn 3? WTF?!?! If this is what is to be expected of BHVE, then I'll steer clear of them in the future. It is sad to see such a good movie go down because of such low production on the DVD, and so clear a lack of taste from our friendly niebor hood marketing scum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappest Movie","review":"Like everyone I wanted to see this movie. It looked awesome. But It wasn't. It had to be the most boring movies I've ever seen. I though a lot would happen but nothing did. I can't believe people thought this movie was scary. I sure hope they don't make a part 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie was horrible! I cannot believe it was nominated for Best Picture. That nomination should have gone to a much better movie like \\"Being John Malkovich\\" or \\"Boys Don't Cry.\\" This movie was very predictible and the kid was really annoying. The line \\"I see dead people.\\" just gets stupider every time you hear it. And this movie was so DULL! Don't waste your money. Grade: F"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent at best","review":"The fifth element, the sixth sense, what is next? the seventh donnut? The movie is incoherent at best. A patchwork and imitation of other people's ideas, which only makes one feel a little scared here and there. Definitely not worth buying or seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is horrible. What's wrong with you people?","review":"The Sixth Sense was certainly the WORST movie of 1999. There was no part that was scary. Since when does whispering EVERY line of dialog constitute good acting? And as far as the \\"twist\\", didn't anyone see the commercials? That annoying kid says \\"I see dead people.\\" Bruce gets shot in the first scene and never shares any dialog with anyone except the kid. Didn't anyone think that a gunshot wound would maybe cause him to get killed? Is everyone so immune to violence that they didn't think that? Come on!This is the type of movie where the more you think about it, the worse it gets. Not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shyamalan's supernatural shocker!","review":"M. Night Shyamalan's spooky supernatural thriller is one of most chilling and unpredictable films i've seen for a long time. Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment both give great performances, especially Osment, who has the gift of seeing dead people.Director Shyamalan's taut direction makes this one an amazing and thrilling film with that now-famous shocker ending. Add a creepy musical score, some inventive camerawork and a sharp script and you have one of the best psychological thrillers of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DVD to wear thin...","review":"You will have to watch this more than once so be sure to have two copys because the first copy with be watched so much it will wear thin! :) I love movies that lead you in one direct then do a complete 180 at the end. I wouldnt really call this a spooky movie although there were parts that were kind of freaky. Bruce Willis was great in this! Cole, Haley J. Osment, was great playing the role of the young kid with the talent to see \\"dead people\\". He provides the viewer a window into his life of terror and confusion that will make anyones heart bleed with compassion.All the main characters make this movie worth seeing. The ending will make you stop and think about what just happened and why. It was great! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sixth Sense Is A Master Piece!","review":"This movie has absolutely everything! A great writer/director, great actors, a great plot, and a brilliance not found in many movies. This movie, and its actors, have won and been nominated for numerous awards (including Oscar's), and they deserved to win every one of them.Mystery, suspense, thrill, drama, excitement, intrigue, horror... this movie is FILLED with all of them! Explore the paranormal as you learn that gifts are not always pleasant from actor Haley Joel Osment, who delivered a performance that can only be described as stunning.Watch this movie again and again, every time you watch you'll learn something new (especially between the first and second time)... This is an enjoyable movie, that truly has seeped into culture. A must see for everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong format","review":"This was not the format I anticipated... I understand it is a European format, and does not work with US DVD players and therefore it will not work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"While the actual movie is pretty good, the DVD put out by Disney leaves much to be desired. It starts with six long previews of other Disney movies. And if that's not annoying enough, while the previews are playing, you can't access the main menu. You must use the chapter skip button and skip each one individually. ....The extra features are mostly interviews with the director and producers congratulating themselves on what a great movie and \\"cultural phenomenon\\" they created. Uh guys, while this movie is definitely better the normal Hollywood ..., it is still just an above-average Bruce Willis movie that borrows heavily from The Exorcist. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Contrived and not very convincing. Bruce Willis was never effective as a psychologist, and characters are two dimensional at best. A poor attempt at a supernatural thriller which relies on cheap scares and loud sound effects. Osment is not a subtle actor, this is not a subtle movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unviewable with mandatory previews","review":"This is the first DVD that I've purchased with Disney's (Buena Vista) dreaded mandatory previews on it and I am unable to view it.

While I was able to figure out the twist about 20 minutes into the movie (for a far superior twist ending, watch Jacob's Ladder) I still enjoyed the movie because of the great preformances by Willis and Osmett (sp?. I give the movie its self 4 1/2 stars.That said, I'd like to get my hands on the thoughtless jerks who put 8 minutes of non skippable previews at the begining of this movie.

I find this movie to be a real disillusionment to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it!","review":"I went to see this movie the day it came out, and man I was so disappointed. I , personally , thought that the plot of the movie was terrible, and I didn't think that the kids performance was anything that the movie critics said it was. When I found out that this movie was up for best picture I was amazed that something like that could get nominated before movies like The Matrix which has revolutionized sci-fi movies. If you really feel you have to see a ghost movie with a good plot go and rent Stir of Echoes which is a much better movie. I thought that the whole movie was predictable and felt that the end could have been a little more imaginative. When I left the theater I felt it was one of the worst movies I had seen in years. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. There are so many other great movies out there. If you want to see a really good movie get The Green Mile. You will be impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to pull the hairs on the back of my neck out!","review":"What kind of horror movie includes the line, \\"You know when the little hairs on the back of your neck stand up? That's them.\\" Ooh, so spooky. (this is sarcasm, kids). I love horror movies, and was very excited about seeing this one, early in its run, only to be profoundly disappointed. I admit there are some quite good things about this movie; the beginning and the twist ending, to name two. Sure, the kid is good, but quite overrated. If you are inexperienced with horror movies, you might find this scary. I just found the special effects to be gross. They could have told the little girl's story without having her throw up all over poor little Haley Joel Osment, for example. Furthermore, I didn't find their explanation believable about ghosts only seeing what they want to see. Overall, the acting is good throughout the movie, particularly Toni Collette, but the plot and explanations are lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and under-created","review":"I don't know what everyone was thinking when they said this movie was great. It's not even good! The atmosphere was not the least bit spooky or emotional. The \\"big\\" plot twist was visible a mile away. And once the film was over, I was left feeling unsatisfied. A miserable movie if I've ever seen one. Not worth any intelligent viewer's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST I've seen in years...","review":"There is definitely something wrong with all the reviewers who raved about how great this movie is. For one thing, the ending makes absolutely no sense when you go back and think about it. And I really don't think it's necessary to show a kid with the back of his head blown off. My advice: do not buy or rent this movie, because you will be sadly disappointed! I was. I really wish they'd redo the ratings system so I could give this flick 0 stars, because that is what it really deserves. For a great watch, get a REAL Bruce Willis movie. They are worth their weight in gold. You could not PAY me to take this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a hit?","review":"Hard to believe people actually flocked to see this \\"horror\\" film. It's NOT scarry!

This flick stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced Advertising","review":"To be honest, I really liked the movie. What I didn't like is the advertising for coming attractions at the beginning, which cannot be fast forwarded through. They have taken advantage of technology to control what you can see.

The acting is superb throughout and the production is excellent.So why only one star, well, I couldn't give it zero... the idiots that made the DVD seemed to think that every time you use the disc, you want to watch 4 other movie trailers. Using the features of DVD they have disabled all the buttons until you have watched the trailers - this is possibly the most irritating thing they could have done. I can accept that the FBI warning message is unskippable, but the trailers too! come on guys!Take my advice and buy the VHS version... they haven't found a way to disable the fast forward button yet!VHS 5/5...

Your menu button is locked out, so you can't opt out. I don't mind watching trailers in a movie theater where the cost of the ticket is $8 and I will see the movie once or twice at most, but I do mind them on a DVD that I will repeatedly watch and that lists for nearly $30! I won't own any DVD that forces me to sit through material other than the movie every single time I watch it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!","review":"There are enough clues throughout the movie to dramatically reduce your surprise at the ending. Although I have to admit that I was caught off guard but not necessarily surprised. But even with the 'surprise' ending, was it worth sitting through the seemingly interminable 2 1/2 hours or whatever it was just for that. Definitely not.Are parts of the film scary... occasionally yes. But by and large the film is incredibly painful to watch. I couldn't wait for it to be over because it moved so slow and I was so bored and not sufficiently frightened.And forget about Bruce Willis' performance being so great. Ben Stein could have done it just as well. Granted Bruce Willis, the man, is extremely cool. Bruce Willis the actor, excepting Die Hard, is mediocre at best.I personally would have walked out if I had seen the movie alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie - BUT GO BUY THE VISTA SERIES SPECIAL EDITION","review":"While The Sixth Sense is a really good film and should definitely be in your collection, you need to avoid this earlier release and go get the Vista Series Special Edition. It has everything on this disc as well as several other cool additions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expected much -- better than expected","review":"Yes, this film was well-acted, eerily filmed, creepily scored, and very well special-effected, but I love a movie that pulls the rug out from under you. You've experience the growing intrigue and horror as the truth of this boy's life unfolds, and feel the satisfaction of having it finally believed and resolved, and then: SLAM, BANG, WOW... The wind is knocked out of you and you have to go back and watch it all over again to see how beautifully it all hangs together. And then you have to think about it for a few days, to realize the implications of everything you've seen. A very, very worthwhile film on so many levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"the movie was so great that I was sitting on the edge of my seat for the whole movie.

It really has no plot. The kid sees dead people and Bruce Willis is supposed to help him and he does by telling the kid to ask the ghosts what they want. The plot is weak to me. But I did like this movie for its creativity and intelligence. The cold, the red were neat clues. I loved the Rules and Clues bonus on the tape. It really adds a lot to the overall understanding of the movie.If you liked this movie, rent Stir of Echoes an equally effective thriller based on a novel from Twilight Zone writer Richard Matheson. This is a more of a horror picture but has an innate morality tale in its story.What makes The Sixth Sense so appealing, ultimatley, is its mood, atmosphere, aura and the acting of both Willis and Osment. That all makes up for lack of a great story - well almost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie great but could do without excess DVD previews","review":"This is a great movie, no doubt.

This one is to be rented for one showing only."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie","review":"This is a movie I recomend you watch. After you watch the movie watch the behind the scenes;which comes on after the movie. Most people like to watch it a second time so they can look for the clues. For the people that say the ending was odviouse in a way are right,but let me piont out just one thing. The part where Crowe is sitting with Cole's mother waiting for Cole. When Cole's mother ask Cole how his day was, and she was going to cook dinner which will be ready in a hour makes you wonder if she hired Crowe. There are other examples too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie, with great DVD extras","review":"Outside of the movie itself (which is in fact an excellent story, well produced) the DVD offers a number of extras that make it a worthy purchase. The deleted scenes are interesting to watch, after the first, if not second time you've seen released cut of the movie. The rules and clues featurette also make a nice insight into the movie's production.As good as the DVD is, after viewing nearly all the material on the disc, it's not been in my player since. I suspect it will have another viewing soon however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary Film, Osmet is astonishing","review":"The Sixth Sense is an incredible film: well directed, well filmed, with an intense score, wonderful settings, and of course, brilliant acting on the part of Haley Joel Osmet. It passes over the blood and guts thriller style of 'scary movies' and is instead a deeply dramatic psychological thriller that gives the viewer a most unsettled feeling. Willis delivers one of his best performances to date. The supporting cast is fantastic and of course, Osmet simply amazed me. This young actor portrayed Cole Sear with depth and range far beyond his years and experience. The basic story premise may not be the most original or complex but it is handled with superb skil, creating an emotional tour de force film. It's gripping, chilling, and of course, unsettling and best of all, it only gets better with multiple viewings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"This is one of those movie that I will want to watch over and over again. I can't say much about it as I dont want to spoil if for those that havent seen it. What I can say is that you get an incredible performance from Haley Joel Osment (I see dead people) and a very convincing performance from Bruce Willis as well. Definately buy this one, its a great movie. The DVD is the only way to go on this film! It will blow you away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A DVD review","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said? A great DVD to watch again and again, although it losses it's impact somewhat on repeated viewing. The deleted scenes weren't that interesting and I can see why they were cut. You don't really lose much. The director explains why he cut scenes which was nice. I think the film would have lost its edge if they were included. The interviews with the director was very interesting watch out for this guy I think he's up and coming. This is one DVD I'm not sure if I'll add it to my collection. The preview trailers are quite annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy Sixth Sense to its Maximum Potential","review":"Although is a thriller movie is Good though. If you haven't seen it, It would be a good idea to stop reading any more reviews. Since the movie is unveiling mysteries as it develops, you should not know any of these ahead of time by reading reviews. It has good acting and decent effects. Perhaps the best part of the movie is the way it finishes. Have a good day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO TO THE DIRECTOR!","review":"I now see why this movie was the talk of the year! I did not see it in the movies, but pre-ordered the DVD and just watched it with my husband. With the ending, we both just looked at each other! After talking about the scenes and analyzing....the bottom line is, DIRECTION, DIRECTION, DIRECTION. Mr. Shaylaman's unraveling of one of a future masterpiece will surely be copied. And thank you Mr. Willis for giving the movie to Haley Joel Osment, even though he did not win an oscar, this kid will surely be one to watch in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Entertainment","review":"NO SPOILERS HEREThe Sixth Sense is a solid entertaining film. It is a must for my DVD collection (and yours). We start with the casting. Bruce Willis has proven himself as a serious character actor (He's not all Diehard and Blind Date). Haley Joel Osmond proves that he is worthy of Adult-sized respect in Hollywood. (He alone made me see it a third time in theaters). Even the supporting cast, like the boy's mother and teacher have strong performances, although I can't remember their names. This film [without spoilers] has apparently set the Standard for which other thrillers are to be judged. Any movies that come out in 2000 will undoubtedly be compared to this gem. None will live up to its subtle way of grabbing you and then shocking you. The Ending alone was enough to make me see it a second time. Trust me. There are a lot of mediocre films with big hype. This film earned its hype through audience and critical response alone. This is the one to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, overhyped","review":"Perhaps it's the fact that the horror genre is not exactly known for quality that this movie did so well, I'm not sure. Sure, the dark lighting inhances the creep effect and the little boy who \\"sees dead people\\" (Haley Joel Osment) is very good - But so what? This hardly saves this predictable and, dare I say, dull, movie. Hats off to the overrated M. Night Shyamalan for hoodwinking tons of people into thinking this film is great - That alone is a talent (I think)."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"this movie is just way overrated and i mean WAY overrated. nothing happens until near the end. most of the movie is just dull. is this movie scary?

You can't even go into the menu and skip through it, you have to either agonize through it or fast forward!...I sincerely hope Disney does not create a trend by doing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sixth Sense","review":"As a Bruce Willis avoider I would recommend this video because there appears to be a shift in Mr. Willis' character deliverance. Up until now Mr. W. appeared to be a bone headed tough guy with an affinity for delivering the same character over and over in most of his craft. I made the decision to see this movie because I had seen an interview with Mr. W and he made sense for the first time. He appeared to have some insight into his own life and the role he has at this time. Perhaps he needed to get away from Demi!"},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP-OFF","review":"I WAS WATCHIN THIS MOVIE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY GOOD TIL I REALIZED IT WAS JUST A RIP-OFF OF RL STINE'S CLASSIC NOVEL, WELCOME TO DEAD HOUSE.

I am glad to see it nominated for best picture but hope A.B. ends up with the Oscar. Regardless, Sixth Sense is a solid, enchanting movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"An abuse of DVD technology","review":"The studio forces viewers to watch 8 minutes of trailers before we can do anything with the disk! This annoying, 8-minute commercial is forced on us *every* time we run the disk. This is an abuse of DVD's abilities and should not be tolerated by the movie-buying public."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I was the only one","review":"SPOILER (sort of) AHEAD. I was so glad to see that I wasn't the only one who figured this movie out from the beginning. It was driving me crazy that this kid was on a bus by himself and then wandering around a stranger's home during a funeral and no one said anything. The DVD has the director talking about all the little clues you weren't supposed to notice. Unfortunately, I felt they were all obvious. I gave it 2 stars since the look of the film is good and the relationship between the kid and Bruce Willis is charming. The most disappointing thing about this movie is that it could not stand up to repeated viewings. Great movies provide new things every time you watch them; like great books that you discover more with each reading. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"Talk about over hyping a movie. GEEEZ! What was the big deal, you people act like this is a state of the art movie that has never been done. The twist ending was obvious and the acting was poor.An obvious rip off of 2 or 3 movies (poltergeist, and excorsist) only it was a bad rip off. Thank god for American Beauty and Magnolia or this year would have been a total cinematic waste.ciaop.s. The \\"twist ending\\" is only a twist if you are of utterly low intelligence and adapt to Steven Seagul movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as people make it sound","review":"Do you wish to see a movie were someone is barfing all over? How about has their face smashed in, or simply the back of their head ripped off and bleeding? Well, if you do thats ok. But for most people seeing things like that make their stomach turn. I do admit that sometimes the story grabbed you in. But the suspenceful parts didn't last long. So, if you wish to see this movie because of all the hype. Take it from me, it's not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated and hyped for nothing","review":"Don't get me wrong, it was a fairly good movie, but in no way did it deserve the hype it received. It was rather slow moving and the surprise ending does not really justify the many scenes preceeding it. If you want a good action suspense/horror, check out Stigmata."},{"rating":"1","title":"I see bored people.....","review":"OK..the greatest thriller of all time like the advertising says...NOT! All in All its a big letdown, no real story to speak of except for the \\"trick\\" ending - of course i was tempted to see it from the beginning at that point - but didnt want to sit through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boooorrrrrrring!","review":"Jeez man, I can't tell, was I supposed to feel uncomfortable during this movie or was it just because I was so bored? The story is stupid, Bruce Willis is miscast and the supporting actors as well as the sub-plots were nonexistant. I cannot believe this movie was held in such high regard by the Academy. The 2 stars I give this movie is only because of that kid, playing Cole. He is an acting prodigy and completely stole the show, especially when considering that the script was so weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD - almost perfect","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, so I picked up the DVD version as soon as it came out. The disc is pack with bonus material and for the most part the quality is great, but I was disappointed by the movie previews they placed on the disc before the menu pops up. While you can skip them by hitting next, I felt that placing the previews on the begining cheapened the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well I never....","review":"I consider myself to be an *ace* plot detector. I pride myself on picking up on the clues and never being blind-sided by the usually hokey Hollywood plot twists. I even knew there *was* a twist in this movie and I still never saw it coming.Wow. Even without the ending this is still an absorbing movie. Willis gives a superb and selfless performance - as does everyone in the movie.Glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kid should have gotten an Oscar","review":"Not much I can say except WOW! Exceptionally intelligent, exciting, touching film marked by wonderful acting by Osment. Utterly covincing, and even for a jaded movie-goer like me (I pride myself on smelling a \\"twist\\" in a story from a mile away), the ending of this movie had my jaw flapping in the wind. Thoroughly entertaining, masterful story-telling by Shyamalan. I recommend all to watch this film, even if you're deathly afraid of thrillers and ghost-stories like I am. Well worth the chills!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"This is an outstanding movie definitely worth seeing many times, M.

I didn't think it was that speacial, I had figured it out about 30 minutes into the movie, the fact that the first scene appeared to have no signifigance (it does later) tipped me off. With that said it was still a good movie. The dead people were done convincingly and it was still very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great acting by Willis","review":"This is a great movie, to see. One of the best psychological dramas-thrillers ever made. Not only is the acting solid, but the script is awesome. And the ending(when I first saw it) was so surprising, I was shocked. I was pleased when it went for best pictures in the Academy Awards, but when the result came out, well...(that's another subject)The DVD, had great features. The cuts, and other info were very entertaining. Seeing from other reviews, I'm glad my DVD player skipped the previews, but I didn't notice that(i bet my grade would have been different)I recommend this movie, to everybody. U won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie with a Brilliant Screenplay!","review":"The Sixth Sense is one of the best films of the decade! Of course, this would not have been true if it were not for the excellent performance put on by Haley Joal Osmond. Haley deserved Best Supporting Actor over all the others there! Also, the screenplay was brilliant! Next to The Usual Suspects, it had the best ending of any movie I've seen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not THAT Scary","review":"I wanted to see this flick, thinking that it would be a very scary movie (since it's about ghosts and all). To my surprise, it wasn't really scary -- only in some parts. Even though it wasn't very scary and it was highly overrated, I still think it's a great entertaining film. Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis both equally did a great job in the acting part. Very dramatic and realistic. This is the type of horror movie where you won't find bloody killers, tons of special effects, etc. The gross parts of this film is probably some of the gruesome ghosts. The overall concept of this film was believable -- how spirits linger on. There were some flaws in this film, which was why I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5. This is an entertaining film, but don't expect too much horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This is an excellent movie and I highly suggest. My wife got the ending too soon, and kink of ruined it for me though. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance.","review":"Newcomer Haley Joel Osment plays Cole Sear, a 9 year-old kid who has a deep, dark secret. He can see dead people. Cole keeps this fact very secretive and well-hidden, but when Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) comes along, Cole believes that he can help him. Can Crowe help him? Or is Cole stuck with this horrible trauma?The Sixth Sense is a pure, fresh breath of air for horror movies. It is directed and written brilliantly by M. Night Shamalyn. Bruce Willis plays the main character, Dr. Malcolm Crowe, and his performance was rudely underrated. But, it is Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette who manage to shine the most. Osment is brilliant as the confused kiddo Cole, he deserved an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Toni Collette shone like a superstar, her performance as the terrified mother was a very effective turn for her career. Go and see this now. Don't wait one more goddamned minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Your Money","review":"You no doubt have heard the buzz on this movie by now so i don't have to convince you what a masterpiece it is but what makes this dvd so special is the wealth of special features. The deleted scenes and commentary are great and add more insight into this movie. The making-of special is great and gives you more things to look for as you watch the movie again. Another great feature is the inclusion of a short film done by the director when he first got into film-making."},{"rating":"1","title":"8 minutes of previews","review":"Every time you watch this DVD you are forced to sit through 8 minutes of movie previews.

The (alleged) ability of some people to see the dead is well-known enough that there are numberous scientific, new-age-y, theological, psychological, and even layman's books devoted to the subject--but this film acts like none of that exists. I know movies aren't reality, etc., but it wouldn't have taken more than a few minutes for the Bruce Willis character to stop at the library and pick up a book or two on the subject (and no, I'm not a lobbyist for the National Library Association :)."},{"rating":"2","title":"S U R P R I S I N G!","review":"Haley Joel Osment (the little boy) deserves a BIG OSCAR for his convincing role, amazing emotions and facial expressions!Bruce Willis as always is a great actor and he managed BRILLIANTLY to act with Haley Joel Osment in making this wonderful drama. The film might seem boring in the middle but manages to pick the events up and surprise everybody.I recommend this movie to all audiences of all ages, to the young it is a thriller and to adults it is an emotional drama.

Haley Joel Osment gives a great peformance as Cole Sear, a young boy who can see ghosts. He is better than most adult actors, despite his age, and delivers a phenomenal performance in this movie. Bruce Willis, though not at his strongest, was also good. One thing that really caught the eye was the screenplay: It was imaginative and eventful, and had many interesting twists to it. M. Night Shyamalan really pulls something off with this movie, and, though it was worthy of it's Best Picture nomination, was not something which, I repeat, lived up to the hype given it."},{"rating":"1","title":"no excitement","review":"This movie was not what I expected after all the hype.

He has studied the masters well, and has a humanity sorely needed in cinema. SENSE is compelling and spooky, but it's Osment that makes the film fly. The film leaves one with a haunting poignancy, thanks to M. Night's restrained direction, the ensemble's acting, and Newton Howard's score. Films such as SIESTA (1987), AN OCCURRENCE AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE (1959?) and JACOB'S LADDER (1986) have explored this territory with different results, and more than a smidgen has been borrowed from Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW (1973)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sixth Sense","review":"This was an excellent movie and it should have won the academy award for best picture.

The plot was without flaw, the cinematography excellent, and the acting (especially by Haley Joel Osment) was outstanding. This film is a must see, twice!

I just saw it for the first time last night on DVD (got it for my birthday). However, the stupid DVD forces you to watch, or at least skip, through 5 to 7 trailers before you can select the menu. Anyone remember all the stuff with the Tarzan DVD from Disney? Same thing here. I want to complain, but I don't know who to complain to. Common sense should tell anyone, even brain-dead marketing execs, that putting trailers on the DVD is okay...making me watch them in the beginning, bad.

Well, sorry, what he conceives of as being profound and clever, I see as lumbering and predictable.There are people whose films I like, those whose films I admire, those whose work I admire more than I like, and those whose work I like more than I admire. At the ends of the spectrum are those whose work I both admire and like and those whose work I neither admire nor like.

As Dr. Crowe tries to uncover the ominous truth about Cole's supernatural abilities, the consequences for client and therapist are a jolt that awakens them both to something harrowing--and unexplainable.

I remember it all, the ghost passing by the bathroom door at night, pukey girl in the tent, and the twist ending that had us on the edge of our seat. I had the tape of this and would watch it every day in the summer. I am very glad this is out on Blu-Ray, but as soon as I began watching it, about 30 minutes in, I already had a bad feeling. The picture is terribly grainy in a few bits, most notably the scene where Cole goes to calm his mother down at night. Cole's mom's nose has a bleed on it (slight red ghosting effect) during the \\"Picture scene\\" and Malcom's hair bleeds a bit too in some scenes. And the special features were disappointing too, they were just the special features on the Vista Series DVD. Sound quality is OK, but other than that, you're better off buying the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and thought-provoking, but flawed.","review":"The Sixth Sense is one movie that draws you into its web, and won't let you out until you've devoted a lot of mental time and energy to it. I'm not, however, sure all the work is richly rewarded. Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette give powerful performances, but Bruce Willis's central performance is lacking, and drags most of his scenes down with it. The movie feels like it truly needed a much stronger actor and a more compelling presence at its core, and it would really have given the movie much more emotional weight. The DVD version includes some great extras, and is a must-have for every movie enthusiast. The VHS version, missing the additional enhancements, is still worthwhile, but not essential. Regardless, The Sixth Sense is still entertaining, and worth sitting through once or twice, but probably not much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MOVIE ROCKS!","review":"I am 12,13 next month,and I love this movie!

Adding insult to injury, you can't even use the STOP button on the player! How rude! And the person who said these films will be forgotten in three years is correct...maybe three months is more like it.I sat through the previews in the theater, I should NOT have to sit through them in my own home!Four stars for the movie (I did like it) but negative 10 for the DVD.

The acting is also very good especially Haley Joel Osmet.There are scenes in this film that are unforgettable and will haunt you long after you have watched it.The beginning scene with the patient in the bathroomThe little girl (now on the O.C.) whose is mysteriously illand my favorite the car ride at the end of the movie when the little boy tells his mother that he has spoken to his dead grandmother.The movie almost seems has the feeling of a Swedish or German film. It also seems like the writer was an outsider who really captures American nuances.I cannot say enough good things about this film. One of my favorites. Pay attention to the plot! And enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sixth Sense is Amazing!","review":"I recently saw The Sixth Sense and I would have to say I was amazed by the edge of your seat type thriller.

Never suspected the ending for those ho like a great twist! Sound quality was excellent, video quality was excellent, and even though you can fast forward the trailers, they should have been an option, not a requirement."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved This Unique Thriller!","review":"I saw this movie at the theatre and fell in love with it. I bought the DVD the day it came out and watched it right away (a rarity for me). The movie itself was good as well as the cast. However, I was knocked over when I discovered who played the boy's mother-Toni Collette. I fell in love with an earlier movie she stars in - \\"Muriel's Wedding\\". Granted, she gained weight for the role of Muriel and lost it since then, but I didn't recognize her at all.I was very pleased with her nomination as well as the boy's. I feel this movie should have won at least one Oscar. But, we know how that goes.It is a good movie with neat \\"special features.\\" Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic thriller/horror with a twist","review":"This is definitely the best of Director Shyamalan's films.The story is about psychiatrist Dr. Crowe's (Bruce Willis) interest in a child-patient. The child claims to see dead people, and mysterious incidents indicate that the child is telling the truth.The movie proceeds at a slow pace, yet is very absorbing. There are several suspense-filled moments, silent but disquieting. Just when all the answers seem to be revealed, the final twist just blows the mind away."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"This is such a good movie. The ending is extremely shocking. Because of that watching the movie a second time, the movie is totally a different movie. Unfortunately because of that, it's not much fun watching it the third or fourth time because you know what's going to happen. If you haven't seen it though, it is a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated. And How.","review":"Unbelievably over-hyped and carelessly fashioned ghost story, critically adored mainly due to a stand out performance from Osment. Unfortunately his adeptness in handling the material cannot save a film which as a whole is unsatisfying and incoherent. The central premise intrigues, but the twist ending is inadequately set up, contextually makes no sense (so bruce Willis never changed clothes, or opened a door, or spoke to anyone other than this child and never figured out anything was wrong? Wonderful psychologist) and is utterly plagiarised from Herk Harvey's 1962 film 'Carnival of Souls'; a laconic Willis seems content for the most part to sit back and look as bored as I was by about 45 minutes in. Trite Hollywood fodder unfortunatly described by some as a Masterwork; there are numerous directors with greater talent who could do with this kind of recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a awesome movie","review":"This is seriously the greatest movie I have ever seen. I recommend it to anyone. You gotta see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genius of a story!","review":"This movie should have won the Oscar for best movie and best screenplay. The movie has a surprise ending and is worth purchasing for your movie collection. Fine performances by the main actors of the movie. If Alfred Hitchcock were alive he would have killed to direct this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Movie","review":"All through the movie, I felt that I was missing something... I realized in the end what was that. In The Sixth Sense, the director gently probes and implies.. There is no violence or special effects. The film is moving, from the loneliness of the wife, the sense of duty of the doctor, to the uncanny behaviour of the boy. This film may not appeal to the masses,but it is immensely thought provoking, and must deserve special mention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie Lousy DVD","review":"I would of given this DVD 5 stars if not for the previews. Right before the menu comes on there are five previews which spoiled the whole disc. You cannot fastforward through them either so you are forced to watch them everytime you put the DVD in the player. Let's hope more studios do not pick up this pratice like they did with VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"We've lost count how many times we've watched this movie - it's ropes us in - we try to find more depth to the story, the charactors, the scenes, the dialogue - This is one very interesting, gripping movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"There\`s Something About Bruce Willis","review":"Enough about the ending already, sure it was a clever move, but there\`s so much more to find here...right? Well, that\`s the problem, this movie works nicely on the first viewing, but I don\`t really feel the need to watch it again. It\`s not very engaging, moves too slowly and if it wasn\`t for the final twist it would be quickly forgotten. Ok, the cinematography is alright, the acting good and the mood adequate, but there are a couple of plot inconsistencies and during the most part I was just waiting for something to happen. The ghost element is well done, though, but Shyamalan can do better (\\"Unbreakable\\"). A promising debut anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Avergae","review":"Aside from the Boy there's nothing original at all about this film.while I Have dug Bruce Willis's Work from the past this is not one of his Best.I Have seen this kind of film so many times already.if you combined elements of this Film&The Matrix then you would have had a Classic.only Haley Joel Osment saved this Film.but his Performance was Great more than i can say about the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"first of all, i loved this movie it was truly different from any other horror suspense movie i've seen in the last few years. One thing did bother me though, and if anyone can explain this to me, please e-mail me at nuffsed@yahoo.com , but how did bruce willis get into the cole's house if he was already dead? After all, cole's mother couldn't have let him in the house, and i'm sure the door was locked. a point to ponder....otherwise, i especially loved the scene where cole tells his mom about grandma being proud of her everyday....a must see and get on dvd or vhs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll tell you what your missing","review":"whoever wrote the review asking why people didn't just fast forward through the trailers it's because my DVD player for some reason won't let you fast forward unless it's in the actual movie get a DVD player and you'll see"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Psychological thriller...","review":"In one word: BORING. Sorry. As I watched this film for the first hour and saw it was going nowhere, I had to pick up the jacket box the film came in and saw the words \\"The Most Psychological Thriller in a Long Time...\\", and I began to laugh hysterically. I was really hyped up over watching this, and after reading ALL of the reviews on this site, I was really prepared for a real scary thriller. NOPE. NOT HERE.

And I can not recommend it for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie/stop complaining about the dvd movie trailers","review":"After reading a few reviews about the excess movie trailers, I wanted to alert those who wish to skip them to hit the track skip button on their remote.

However, my involvement with the characters grew and the end is nicely done. Unfortunately, so many people told me that there was a twist at the end that I couldn't help trying to figure out what it was. I guessed about twenty minutes in.

A must see twice movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Thriller I've Seen in a Long Time","review":"The Sixth Sense is a movie that will grab you and pull you in, keeping you on the edge of your seat until the surprise ending that will leave you stunned and speechless. Not since the movie \\"Seven\\" has a surprise ending completely shocked and moved me. I had to see this movie twice; once when I was entirely unaware what was going to happen and a second time to see how the pieces truly fit. Bruce Willis, who does have a tendency to pick typecast roles, gives an excellent performance as a child psychiatrist fighting his own demons, and Haley Joel Osment is one of the best child actors I have ever seen. He played perfectly a kid who was extremely frightened by what he saw, but who tried to remain strong for the sake of his mother. This movie is thrilling and frightening, and at the same time very moving, especially with the relationship between Osment and his mother. This is definitely a movie to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie has everything","review":"This movie is a suspense movie with some mild horror. The Sixth Sense is about a boy who sees dead people and gets help from a psychologist. When this movie came out, it was a surprise hit and was on the top 10 list of highest grossing American films of all time. Recently, other movies have come on the list and Sixth Sense is no longer on it. However, even if someone sees this movie for the first time, I think they will be pleasantly surprised by how good it is.This movie has all the elements of a perfect movie: great character development, suspense, great acting, and an excellent story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy fun in Philly!","review":"If any other child actor had been cast in this movie it would be a three star flick (Haley Joel Osment is THAT good). Had this movie been filmed in any other city than Philly it would be a two star flick (Bruce Willis seems to enjoy playing guys named Cole who live in Philly). If the script had been dumbed-down to appeal to a wider audience - one star. What we have here, folks, is one of the rare movies where just about everything was done right (forget about the \\"surprise\\" ending - you'll figure that out a half-hour into the film). M. Night Shyamalan has learned the most important word in horror filmmaking - ATMOSPHERE. Makes one hopeful for the future of scary flicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Scary Movies Ever.","review":"The stroy is complicated and scary, the performances are deep and emotional, the drama is heart wrenching, it suffers from one thing, being kind of short. Although its very good it could have been like 15 mins longer, with more ghosts, the ending is a doozy. M. Night is the best scary movie director ever, can't wait for the village, i would recomend unbreakable over signs for the M.

You mean, you knew before?\\" I knew Willis' therapist had died when the subtitle read, \\"One year later.\\" If I had any doubts, they were erased as Willis, sitting at a table with Toni Collette who played the mother, got up when her son came home from school.

But hey, he knows all they want is help! The scene with the poisoned girl is underdeveloped and rushed...compared to the slow, slow pace of other stuff. The \\"rules-clues\\" section talks about red...sure, red is used a lot. That's about it. It's a film with lots of red. Nothing very creative or special there. There's a blooper when the wife's boss leaves her apartment and is heard saying \\"See you two later\\"...clearly a blooper.

Night Shyamalan presents us the story of little Cole Sear (beautifully played by Haley Joel Osment), a child with an unusual -and definitely scary -ability of seeing dead people that refuse to accept they are not along the living anymore. As psychologist Malcolm Crowe, Bruce Willis portrays someone who goes beyond his \\"Die Hard\\" character. The relation between these two is the strength of this film.And I say that Hitchcock would have been proud of this movie because the twist at the end of the movie is something he would have probably made. Bravo for Mr. Shyamalan. But watch it! Don't let anybody tell you how this film ends. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies i ever saw The First Time","review":"This movie mainly for the twist at the end was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my young 19 years. Now the thing that made it great for me was on DVD was the first time i ever saw it. Noone eevr told me the ending and I am happy about that, But however if you have seen the movie then the DVD is not really worth it as there is nothing else to see. They have an alternate ending, but it is essentially the same just done differently. What I did like was the superior performance of Bruce WIllis as he as usual stole the movie. So as it goes for the movie- 5 stars. Watching the movie a second time and trying to pick up \\"the clues\\"-3 stars, after that its just not worth it to see it again as the ending changes the whole complection of it. For those of you who didnt see it then get it for those of you who did only get it if you collect dvds.Your Friend and MineThe Coach"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie of 1999","review":"In my opinion, this was the best horror film I have ever seen. I have been watching horror films since the age of 2 years old, so I have seen many. I mainly like this movie because it was so unpredictable. There have been so many movies out there that are good, but too predictable. This one is the best by far. Another thing that I must note is that I orginally didn't want to see this movie because it had Bruce Willis in it. I cannot stand that actor's previous movies.

Waxing nostalgic about the bygone days of Frisbee, dogs, grass and free love in the park, the book's plot climaxes at a world-championship boomerang tournament on the frozen tundra of Alaska. Enjoyment of this tasty piece of Zen-flavored American Pie is limited only by the reader's willingness to suspend reality. No more Grateful Dead or Phish concerts to attend? Reading BOOGA may get you by until the next Big Love-In."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"This book is so fun to read. If you live in Illinois, you will love finding out the very strange things that exist in the Land of Lincoln. I live in Chicago, and there is a VERY large section of this book that deals with Chicago and it's wierdness. From cemeteries to strange house decorations to wild birds living in a local park.........Illinois is so much more than I ever imagined....and I've lived here for over 25 years.

It will ruin it for you, the same way that it ruined it for me at the \\"end\\" of this series...trust me!I loved the original Deathstalker series and had a hard time reading this series, as it feels like a regurgitated cast and story to the original series, but without the connection to the cast that the original had. Could the cast be anymore cookie cutter to the original cast? It's utterly disappointing in comparison to the original series. If you haven't read the original series, then this might not be too bad, but if you haven't read the original series, then do yourself a favor and go read it.I wish I had never read this novel or this series because of the dark taint that it put on the original series, but I can't erase it from my mind unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Simon R.

I have the Peugeot Fidji 8-1/4-Inch Pepper Mill and for cooking it's a little tiring turning the top for a tablespoon of ground pepper. A friend of mine has the Pepper Mill Imports, Atlas 8\\" Brass Pepper mill, and I like that mill better than the Chef's Mate because it's handle is about twice as long, it produces more ground pepper per turn and it is about $8.00 less expensive.If you don't have room for an eight-inch mill the Chef's Mate will fit just about anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever tried to complete","review":"I read til page 65,then my brain short circuited.I thought the whole idea of goblins being responsible for President Kennedy's assassination,ridiculous beyond belief.Let the man rest in peace.Don't drag him into cheap storylines.I like folklore,but this book was definitely too weird for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"this book was fantastic and very informative,it goes behind the man we all know and into his life and his desire to be financially free and have a family to live with,it has funny moments also and misquoted jokes but all in all are great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddie's Many Sides","review":"One of the most gifted actors around, and always a bit unstable.

The incident in West Hollywood's redlight district, on the morning of May 2, 1997 just won't go away. And after seeing recent photographs of Eddie with another well known male celebrity, causes one to question whether Eddie actually favors a certain lifestyle.

I wish that I would have listened to them sooner because it is really a great book about God and all His majesty and splendor.

For Pagan women to be abusive toward their brothers is to continue the abuse and what victory have you WON if you do not deal with your own demons. None. The book gives me the impression that men need to be subservent to women. But is that not what the Monotheitic relgion religons do to women? Is not Bonewits asking men to do the same thing?

It is more likely than not that die-off (Herxheimer's) is occurring where with microbial death there is an off-gassing that is nothing short of painful, and sometimes toxic to the point of causing diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.

I also got bad cramps and went to the bathroom a few times times. I drank about two bottles of water to try and rinse it through my system, after a short nap and about 4 hours later I feel the effects seem to be mostly gone..

For the objective section it's very much like the SAT I verbal critical reading sections. The essays are just analyzing, and one of them is an open ended question based on a novel you should have read sometime in your life.

The Civil War action was written in a manner that draws the reader in.The author weaves a tight story with characters that are well fleshed out and not two dimensional. The storyline is a good, gripping tale set against the backdrop of the War in the West.The Western theater of the Civil War usually takes a back seat to the East among Historians and novelists alike. There are volume upon volume of books about Gettysburg, Bull Run, and Antietam. The heros of the East as well usually take center stage.

The only true \\"foot-tapper\\" is Sixteen Fisherman Raving written by Wally Page, which in itself is worth the purchase of this disc, but the ballads Christy's selected from some of his favorite songwriters (such as Bob Dylan, Natalie Merchant Richard Thompson and Morrissey) are better than the originals in my opinion. Highlights include Beeswing, The Lonsesome Death of Hattie Carrol, Mercy, Magdalene Laundries and Morrissey's acerbic \\"America, I Love You\\". Declan's brooding slide guitar on Mercy is also well worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Short Course in Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT/350D Photography (Book & eBook)","review":"Don't buy this book!

I've also noticed that Kodak paper, while thinner, dries much quicker and doesn't smear as easily. However, again, there is a catch. The Kodak paper doesn't have as great quality.

The theme of sibling jealousy grew tiresome; it would have made a fine subplot rather than the focus of the novel. Writing children's literature is difficult because the author must avoid dumbing down the content, and Paterson did a decent job of this. But she skews the perspective of the book towards that of a child not as Harper Lee did, with a different outlook on the facts, but rather everything is vague and unclear. Thoughts are jumbled and when Sara grows up and finds herself at the end, you don't care. Why? The picture of Sarah isn't there admist the author's blurring of emotion.Kids, even if they are mistaken, know exactly what they are feeling. There is no confusion. Sarah is as confused as the reader, and the plot remains weak with no writing to boost it up.There are better children's literature, such as The Giver."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was depressing and unrealistic","review":"Whoah, what a horrible novel.

Yet once she goes out to conquer her dreams of being a doctor, she finds there was more love for her both in her home and out than she could imagine. She learns that there was always more love for her than for Caroline. Her life becomes what it would have been had Caroline not been born except that she still had Caroline for a sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Classic","review":"I had read snippets of this book as a child, had seen many others read it, but finally read the whole book as an adult.I loved this book. I did understand the point of \\"Caroline was sickly as a baby so she got more attention\\", and I liked the fact that even though Louise resented Caroline for it, she understood how beautiful her voice was and was indignant when she did not get the biggest solo in the play.That Grandmother was some piece of work though. What a horrid old woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redemption","review":"The book covers probably about a decade of time and is from the POV of an older twin sister. The thick teenage angst of this book detracts from the more interesting stories of Captain Hiram, Auntie Braxton, the dementia of the protagonist's grandmother, Call and Caroline. Until I read the last two chapters, I was going to rate this book lower but these chapters, the last one especially, give the protagonist a chance to mature and redeem herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly riveting novel","review":"I highly recommend this novel. It deals with difficult, but very real and raw emotions between siblings. The author Katerine Paterson is one of the best story tellers that young people of this generation can read and understand. The story has everything! A tale of family relationships, and rivalry between twins, set in the 1940's era in the Chesapeake Bay. I enjoyed this book for it's dramatic intensity, fullness of the characterizations, believability, and honest dealing with many teen issues. Also, it took place in a locale that we don't usually read about. I will never forget these characters. Paterson is a wonderful writer. I read this book to catch up on children's lit for the age group I will be teaching this coming school year. Fifth graders on up should really read this book. They will certainly come away enriched. I discovered Paterson after reading her riveting \\"Bridge to Terabithia\\", another must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"MoLiZ rEvIeW!!!","review":"This book was ok but nothing great. I found myself bored at many parts and probably would never have read it if it wasn't for school!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"The most depressing book I have ever read and the end isn't even satisfying,it greatly affected my mood and after reading I felt like I had nothing to live for.

The description of the fishing village was informational, and the setting was charming, but what ruined the book for me was the bitterness of the main character. What happens in life is often unfair, but learn to forgive and move forward. The main character's conflict is only partially resolved by her decision to never neglect a child in the way in which she was neglected. I ended up disliking the two sisters for different reasons. For a milder example of sibling rivalry read The Little House on the Prairie Series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book isn't just for children...","review":"I was actually an adult when I came across this book. This is one of those books anyone who has ever felt alone in this world, or who grew up (is growing up, too) feeling like an outsider or the \\"black sheep\\" of the family as a female, you will not only love this book because you can relate to it, but also because the characters are so real & the feelings & things the main character is experiencing are so real & identifiable w/anyone who's ever felt alone, or like an outsider as a child/young adult. The time period that this book is written in also helps add to the dramatic feel of what's taking place in this character's life.I would recommend this book to anyone, adult or teens. This is also an excellent book for those to read who have ever resented someone or a sibling because they were different; the book gives them an insight of what it's like to walk in the other person's shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a GREAT author!","review":"This is a fantastic book, not only in the plot, but in the language that the author uses. I found myself underlining sentences that were beyond compare. Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a girl struggles but succeds to escape her twin's shadow","review":"This book was amazing. It was nice to watch a young good progress into a successful woman, and at the same time face the struggle of having a talented twin always getting the attention. You could feel the jealously and fury that Loiuse felt towards Caroline, and the how she began to step out of her twins shadow and become an individual, whom she and everyone else was proud of. It was also nice to read about the friends that supported Louise through her teeneage years, sych as Captain Hiram Wallace and her best friend and future brother-in-law, Cal. They were the only ones who made Louise feel as though she was important. Loiuse grows up to be a mid~wife in the mountains(she always did want to see the mountains) and that experience changes her life dramatically. She becomes someone who has an effect on other people's lives. She no longer fels hated in the eyes of God, but loved just as much as Caroline ever was."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Battle of the Twins","review":"This story takes place on an island called Ross Island in the early 1900s. It's important because the main character Sarah always wants to run away to the city.This book is mostly about a twin sister named Sarah who feels she is neglected because her twin sister Caroline is good at mostly everything. Sarah's best friend's name is Mc call and later a man she calls Captain.In my opinion this is a great book because in some way it relates to me and my sister. But to me the most important was that it was funny at the same time. I would recommend this book because it was a book that was hard for me to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"Jacob have I loved was one of the best books I have read so far. Jacob have I loved is a book that talks about Sara Louise Bradshaw, a teenage girl, always having to live in the shadow of her twin sister, Caroline. Caroline is loved by many and given all the attention while Louise is often left out and forgotten. This book has a somewhat odd plot, yet it is interesting. This book is great for 7th graders as well as 8th graders because it has to do with natural things kids at that age feel and it doesnt feel odd to read about it. Katherine Paterson is an amazing, as well as descriptive writer and she introduces each character so well, that at the end of the book, you feel as though you actually know them. I also reccommend Bridge to Terebithia by Katherine Paterson as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not appropriate for ten year olds....","review":"Our family bought this book on the strength of the Newbery Medal. After reading the first twelve chapters, we stopped abruptly because the story was not appropriate for our ten and eleven year olds. The combination of a fourteen year old girl, having a crush on a seventy year old man and an evil, evil, grandmother accusing her granddaughter of murder was too much. This book may be appropriate older teens, but the story line is contrived and does not ring true. Why the book received a Newbery Medal is a mystery to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"It was beautifully written and touching. A bit sad though I enjoyed it very much.

(yawn)","review":"An amazingly boring book. I read half of the book before putting it down. There is absolutly no action whatsoever"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time is money!!","review":"I am impressed by how this author can explain people's feelings very well. However, those techniques made me depressed. This book, \\"Jacob Have I Loved,\\" makes me confused and very sad! The main heroine, Wheeze, is a pessimist because her twin sister, Caroline, who is nice and beautiful, took everything from Wheeze's life (she thinks this way). For example, Wheeze's best friend proposed to her twin sister Caroline. Also one of their friends wanted to give a scholarship to Caroline not Wheeze. So, I had to read about her inferiority complex and weakness. This is a waste of time for me! If Wheeze changes her negative thoughts, she will be able to be thankful for her life, family, and good friends. Maybe Wheeze could marry her best friend too. I didn't want to read this book; however, my English class had to read it. If I could have stopped reading, I would have done it!!! If you are not American, I don't want to recommend that you buy this book. I promise it is a waste of money for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Depressing","review":"I read this book and was greatly disappointed throughout. It was depressing and extremely annoying. This book is inappropriate for young teenagers, especially when the main character, Sara Louise, lusts for a 70 year old man. Disgusting.The ending did not make up for the long, long, drawn-out torture of enduring the main character's pain and hatred. The supposed happy ending made no sense considering what a messed-up teenager she was. The last 2 chapters tried to tie things up nicely to make the reader feel relieved that the main character grew up and made a good life for herself. However, those chapters have little relationship to the rest of the book. How did she magically get over her hatred of her sister and herself? Just by yelling at her mother, she is suddenly cured?I do not recommend this book. I'm still wondering why it received a Newbery Medal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother reading this book","review":"THis book is full of hatred. I couldn't shake the feeling of anger for several days after reading this book. She never askes her sisters forgiveness. Nothing is really resolved. it is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jacob Have I Loved","review":"I personally do not see how this book could have won a Newbery medal. While the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively, that is about the only positive aspect of this book. The fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable. Sara's family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes. Her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family. Sara's twin sister gets all the attention and love, leaving Sara starving for parental care. Finally, Christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental. This book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and I would not recommend it to anyone. I wasted my time with this book: please don't waste yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Please!I maen this book is the pits!It's so boring!

Wheezie looks at herself as Eseau, and her younger twin sister Caroline as Jacob. Caroline was born a couple of minutes after Wheezie, and has taken everything from her. Caroline gets special treatment from her parents and Grandma, everyone worries about her, she gets the chance of the schooling that Wheezie has always dreamed of, and makes Wheezie feal inferior. However, lfe on Rass Island for Sara Louise is still bearable; she has a very special frind (even though the 2 are complete opposites), Call. But when Caroline steals even that from Wheezie, she feals it's time to move on...

It made me afraid to grow up, and I felt continuelly depressed about the blant favoritism shown by the girls parents.If I was their parents I would not have kept that crazy and wicked grandmother around I don't care who she is. She went out of her way to hurt Louise. That's just plain wicked.I also found Louise's sudden interest in being a doctor quite unbelieveable. She had never mentioned anything like that before and I just found it innane.I also found it disturbing that they had her falling in love with someone so much older then herself. Children can't look at that and make any sense of it. It was so embrassing to me that i didn't tell my parents till years later how uncomfortable I felt about it.I would never recommond this book to anyone ever! Certainly never for children and certainly not for anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people like this?","review":"I still fail to understand why this is such a popular book. I hated it the first time I read it and read it again because I thought I must be missing something. If I was, I guess I'm still missing it. The entire book is a girl whining about how her life stinks. I can understand that she isn't happy, but it is her own fault. She doesn't do anything and then expects to have equal attention with her twin who does. She is ready to take offense at anything even when it isn't really unfair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jacob Have I Loved","review":"I read this book several years ago, and recently reread it. It is a very enjoyable read, a coming of age story of a young girl in the Chesapeake Bay area. It explores the concept of sibling rivalry/jealousy, with references to the Biblical twins, Jacob and Esau. The fascination I had with this story has to do with the learning that accompanies the reading. Included in this are the biblical references, the articulate descriptions of the life of working the water to make a living, and the wonderful development of various relationships.The only dissapointment to this book was the rather abrupt and unexpected ending. There were no clues to the end of the book throughout the story. The content of the last chapter could have been alluded to throughout the book, and actually could have been developed as a sequel. However, reading this book was time well spent, and would be enjoyed by older and young adult readers alike"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jacob Have I Loved; like a never ending poem","review":"At first glance, you may think this book is about a girl falling in love with \\"Jacob.\\" The title is nothing but a biblical reference to \\"Jacob have I loved, but Esau I have hated,\\" a story about a fathyer favoring his sons. Most of the story is quite boring, about two sisters, Caroline and Louise, who are subject to favoritism within their family. I disliked this book manily because every other word needs to be analyzed to get any real meaning from the story. I read this in school but I wouldn't recommend for pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jacob have I loved","review":"An interesting read following the trials of a young girl and her struggle to find herself and her place in the world.

If you like to read books with a boatload of teen thoughts, then go ahead and enjoy this book! It's full of sadness and humble happiness.My other thoughts are: For school I had to read and 'examine' this book. Unfortunately I didn't find much to examine and what i mean is: It's a story about a girl stuck on an island and she has nothing to do, no one to love and all the good things happen to her sister. It's the story of deaths and marriages that happen on her small island. Not very exciting. Plus it's all the \\"inner\\" thinking of a rather plain girl.I don't know.

I read it as an adult. Other than it being about twins and one perceives she is less loved than the other (which isn't really true), it has no parallels to the Biblical account of Jacob and Essau.It explores jealousy, regret, resentment, family relationships, and community life. It has a really good ending. My only wish is that the ending part of the book which covers several years, would have been expanded and told in more detail. It left me wishing for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decide for yourself","review":"This is a beautiful book, excellently written, and draws emotions from you forcefully.

Maybe I'm crazy.I know this book is a splendid one. I know it will probably go on to be a classic. But it seemed to be spiraling down, instead of up, and it took me with it.Who knows?

Louise finds something that she wanted to do with the help of the Captain, an old man that was Louise's friend...My favorite part of the book is when Louise starts to communicate with her mother instead of shutting out of her life like before.

This is because the plastic shell of the \\"Moving Men\\" sliders is too soft and deforms, causing the slider to dig-in rather than spread the load evenly, the way they are supposed to. Sliders are an excellent idea, and work very well when properly designed, but the \\"Moving Men\\" sliders are poorly designed.

But it was incredibly easy with the moving men. The hardest part was getting them underneath the entertainment center; that involved him lifting each corner and me wedging a moving man into place. Once that was done, we (he) moved it easily- and keep in mind the entire entertainment center is at least 300 pounds. We have carpet, and I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with tile or hardwood floor.We keep two of the moving men permanently underneath the entertainment center (in the back where they can't be seen) so that the next time I want to move furniture around will be easy. That still leaves me with two of the large moving men and four smaller ones to move other furniture around.

I've crushed peppercorns using very slight pressure; mashed shelled walnuts and almonds into pastes; turned large turbinado sugar crystals into fine grains; same with salt crystals.

Cleans up nicely with a quick hand wash; some spices can leave a faint stain, but vinegar or baking soda helps with that. This piece is also attractive enough to leave out, and actually looks very decorative on the counter when not in use--mine lives right next to my knife block and looks very nice in the kitchen.

Fortunately, she has run into (literally) tall, sexy Detective Chuck Jackson. Will she be lucky in love or win the election?Five O'Clock Shadow is an amusing tale of small town politics and love. I enjoyed reading it, but I did find that the story dragged in places mainly due to the main character's habit of over describing her quirks and life in general. These descriptions could be funny, but they did drag the book down a bit.

While I'm not a practicing Jew, I have tremendous pride in my family heritage and thought to give it a read. After reading about 4 pages I started to realize this book had an intention beyond its basic and adolescent writing style. The title in itself suggests an idea of practicing and believing Jews don't \\"think for themselves\\" as it tells the story of Jews converting to Christianity or at least faith in Jesus. While that idea in itself is by no means offensive, the fact that this book is mailed to Americans (and quite possibly around the world) solely because of their last names only conjures a small sense of fear to think this lunatics keep a list of Jewish names and addresses in their database.

The News media, are experts at it.Great book.

It comes with a \\"kind\\" message from Sid Roth about how G-d instructed him to write this book to inspire other Jews about our people. It doesn't mention Christianity, Jesus or anything religious at all. Just an inspirational book about other Jewish people. However, the book itself, is not a story of Jews. It is a story of conversion away from Judaism. It is an attempt to convert Jews masked as an inspirational book. It is no different from someone ringing your doorbell attempting to save you. While everyone has the right to their own opinion, it cannot be reviewed on it's literary merits."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a sham scam","review":"You get what you pay for. When a book comes in the mail for free, be suspicious. When it boldly proclaims on the cover that over 1 million copies in print, understand that it probably means that no one is stupid enough to pay for it. Sid Roth ought to be prosecuted for sham efforts to turn Jews into Christians. And for producing so much trash by wasting so many trees, meaning what he is harming the environment. The only good thing to say is that at least he is supporting the US Postal Service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a #@$%^*& break!","review":"This book is a complete joke.

Fortunately, I found a level-headed reviewer with whom I agree.As a Jew, this book is completely insulting to my way of life and my religion. Mr. Roth is no Jew. He is a Christian. I'm sure that his god would be disappointed in him that he's lying to the public by putting a Jewish face on a book that is about those who really follow Jesus. Tsk, tsk, Mr. Roth.

The striking thing about it is that the people who tell their various stories of finding Yeshua have such different stories to tell. Each one comes at it from a different background, a different angle, yet they all are in complete harmony.There's a bit of Bible prophecy, there's some lingual/textual analysis of Scripture, but by far the most moving of the stories are those of just plain folk living their lives, some searching for God and some not, but all finding Him gloriously, often after a period of great struggle.Sid finishes off each chapter with some of his own reflections, and most of these add a deeper dimension to the testimonies.I read this thing in one sitting, and was very moved by it.

Basically, these guides are what you would expect from a Pantone guide. If you're not familiar with Pantone's guide, they are basically swatch samples of Pantone's color books, which help you achieve an exact color match when it comes time to send a design to print.While I'm sure plenty of people will scoff at the price, these guides are basically a must-have if you're going to be doing any print design for clients. Relatively speaking, the Amazon price for these is a great deal.

It is about a family of black pioneers. I was sad in the beginning when I read that the Muldie boys' Mom had died on their way west. When they made their first friend out west, and learned to make a dugout, the story began to get exciting. My favorite part was when they made friends with a group of Native Americans. Later, the three Muldie boys traveled over a hundred miles on their own to find their father on his new homestead. I was thrilled to read on the back page that my first reading adventure was based on a true story. I would recommend this adventure to any new reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wagon Wheels by Maria C.","review":"I think wagon wheels by Barbara Brenners is historical fiction.Everybody who loves historical fiction this is a book for you!It is about the Muldie boys and their father. When they were going to Nicodemus, the boys' mother died. Another important thing that happened was when the Muldie boys stayed by themselves because their father went to find free land. I think it was a good book because it made me feel nervous. For example, when there was a prairie fire, I thought the Muldie boys might burn up. I learned that sometimes you don't need an adult to help you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and informative read","review":"Readable account of the Orange County financial blow-up. Particularly interesting is the description of Robert Citron, the hapless college dropout who controlled billions of dollars of public money. Also fascinating are the prescient comments of the obscure accountant who ran against unbeatable Citron in the election prior to the disaster. Jorion manages to educate the reader, in a very painless way, about the institutions of the bond market (such as repos).On the minus side, the book is not particularly well documented (in terms of, for example, the graphs and the sources of the data) and some chapters seem suspiciously like lecture notes, hastily adapted to a book format. Still, an enjoyable trip to the dark side of financial market."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising by Manufacturer","review":"Hermell Knee Rest Wedge CushionIt was important to know what the height of this knee rest was, (as that is the most essential dimention for this type of product).

I was shocked when I found Mr. Tulli's work - since I had read Mr. Johari's book & studied it for a few years, thinking it quite extraordinary - and then recognized the unmistakable phrases & sentences which I had believed to be Mr. Johari's. Mr. Tulli's information is quite thought provoking and well worth seeking out; Mr. Johari's presentation - lamentable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a spiritual investment","review":"Buy this book- enough said, but if that didn't get across allow me to tell you why. Numerology with Tantra, Ayurveda, and Astrology delivers a powerful message. Unlike books from Western academics, Johari's work is replete with spiritual significance and it is so simplistically well-written that even the typical uneducated bum babbling on the corner can take something out of this work. Spiritual insights are supposed to be simplistic while bearing profundity. Too many times I have come across books using long words and tawdry sentences to explain simple truths, yet I was relieved to find a book such as this one for such a low price. But, aside from the bargain, it is definitely a great step to make in any and all spiritual endeavors.

Unfortunately, it has been largely lost in the West, but is still practiced in India. If one has the number that is clearly seen on one's date of birth showing up in one's life, this book can explain it. It even has a different letter/number system for adding up the letters in your name, one that is reminicent of \\"Cheiro's Book of Numbers\\". If you can find a copy of the Cheiro book, I recommend it, as well as the late Mr. Johari's book.

I think carefresh smells like your grandma's spare (dusty, lol) bedroom while aspen smells like the forest. Aspen is a lot cheaper and if you use wood shavings, always use aspen on gerbils/ hamsters/ guinea pigs because pine and cedar can cause a reaction and respitory infections. If you have already bought or gotten for free (like I recently have) cedar or pine, at least mix it with aspen as to lessen the affects of the other shavings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Few Complaints","review":"Purchased for $21.

Thanks to this, I don't have to spend $21 for a 4 cubic foot bag at my local pet store, and when working with 50+ rats at any given time, that's a big relief.------------UPDATE, 7/19/12 I have lowered my review to 2 stars, mainly because of a $6 price jump. I have to buy 3 of these at a time, so $18 more every time I buy is ridiculous.

There was one small hole in the package, but a little tape and it was fixed.

This bedding is a MUCH better value. I do find I have to change the bedding more often because the aspen bedding doesn't absorb as much, BUT the price for volume is so much better that I don't mind. My guinea pigs love it. When I first used it they trilled and hopped up and down all around their cage. It is not as soft, but it is soft enough and they seem comfy and happy.A note on the packaging, I purchased the 8 cubic foot bag in September 2012 and it arrived in plastic packaging NOT paper. This may explain the price increase people are talking about. It arrived completely intact with no spillage. I think a few dollars more is worth it to avoid the mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just reading...","review":"The book is more than just theoretical concepts related to mind, thoughts and discrimination.

And, rather curiously, the film ages a lot better than 95 % of the industrial american production of the 40's and the 50's. How's that ? Maybe simply because the film has also been written by its director who was able to put in THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG a piece of himself.Even if the Fox Lorber DVD is not perfect, as often with this company, the colors of the movie sets will explode on your screen and amaze you in the same manner they have enchanted the 1964 audience. Catherine Deneuve's tears, Michel Legrand's music and a perfect cinematography are sufficient reasons to buy this DVD, to show it your friends and your children and, then, to place it on a special shelf of your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"sound and scene cannot leave you!","review":"I have watched this more than ten times. Each time I am moved by the color and music in this movie. Each color metaphors each actor's feeling and enhances scene's atomosphere. There is one theme colour for each scene is you can enjoy it just by watching it. It goes without saying that the music is awsome. The theme song was pretty popular here in Japan also and it is composed pretty well. Refering to the topic, it is not only a sort of romantic love story but also we can see how one young woman lives. How the sociey went. Happily the army system was changed now!

The soundtrack is a masterpiece and will affect you to the point of wanting to run out the the nearest language school and sign up for French lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Five Cry Classic","review":"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a classic of world cinema which shows the bold style of film maker Jacques Demy. Demy has all the dialogue sung to the pounding emotional score of Michel Legrand. Catherine Deneuve is etherial in one of her first leading roles and the role which really brought her to international attention.As a different twist on the French New Wave movement, Umbrellas will tear your heart out as any man or woman who has known the bitter twists of unhappy love can attest.The restoration of the film ranks up their with the work done to restore Vertigo or Lawrence of Arabia. The only fault on this DVD is a somewhat flaky menu system. Otherwise, it is a job well done.Get out your hanky and watch this film !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong region.","review":"I wish this would have said the region instead of (U).

First, I bought a russian edition of \\"Les Parapluies\\" on DVD. I just could not play that disc at all, it had physical damage. I sent it for refund and ordered one from Amazon meanwhile. I was sure there can be no problems with it. But surprisingly, when I put the disc into the player it would display the root menu and get stuck.

This is a better stress-reducer than a glass of wine and Chopin on the stereo. The plot is almost non-existent, but you won't care. The technicolor is gorgeous! I couldn't get over how pretty her clothes were and how feminine everybody was. Very politically incorrect now, of course. Watch this before the PC police find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Jewelbox of a Movie","review":"Gorgeous music by composer Michel Legrand, a timeless star (19 year-old Catherine Deneuve in a rosebud performance), 1960's France complete with moody rain-drenched cobblestone streets and acid-bright interiors. A love story edged with a trace of sadness--can anything be better than that? Mais non, mes amis. Mais non."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly romantic","review":"This French film from the early 1960s is essentially an opera about two young people, their declarations of undying love, and then subsequently, the peace they make with life. It is very, very beautiful, both visually and musically. Really, the film could have been about anything, as long as those lovely sets and songs were in place! I recommend this movie without reservation to any serious student of the history of film. It is also the perfect romantic movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Excellent!

This film, which I stumbled across at a showing in my high school in Scottsdale, Arizona, the month I graduated, held a lot of nostalgia for me. I wondered would it hold up years later. It does and seems to have affected a great many people as deeply as it did me. The surreal colors are funky and rather in tune with the 60s. Some of the tunes are a bit hard to take, while others are nearly classics. But if you sort of come to it openly I can't help but think it will charm you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit","review":"This fits perfectly in my 2002 Ford Escape.

Speeth's parents were involved in the Gurdjieff Work. She wasn't. She met Gurdjieff as a child, but this book only indicates the shallow surface of the ideas and practices he expressed. This set of ideas is not called \\"the work\\" lightly. Speeth seems to have no clue what that means.

It just barely fits my 14 year-old, lightly-built son. It's almost ok for him with the bottom three straps expanded out, but the top (non-adjustable) strap is tight. Having a non-adjustable strap on top is a design flaw. The thing is, I actually bought this for me. I consider myself an average build 5'8\\" man. It does not even come close, top strap or expanded bottom three.The construction quality and looks are fine. The two star rating is not for either of those items. The two star rating is for a size description which does not remotely resemble reality and a non-adjustable top strap which limits the poorly described size range even more.

None at all. Just two people acting very childish and stupid. If that was supposed to be the point,well it was totally lost on me. There was no real growth in the characters.

They really didn't deserve to get together in the end, I was totally bored and unmoved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the movie, buy the soundtrack!","review":"Although the movie was shot beautifully, it was too simplistic and dull. It contained a plot with nothing more than just two childish people playing games with each other in a very uninteresting relationship. The supporting actors, who seemed more interesting than Nia and Larenz characters, were wasted and might as well have been cast as extras since thier appearences were so brief. Not that it would help this picture much, but as much as I love Larenz Tate, that role was crying for someone who can carry on as a romantic leading man such as Mikhal Phiffer *I hope I spelled that name right* Like my caption says, skip this video and PICK UP THAT SOUNDTRACK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is O-Dog doin in a loved up movie?","review":"What is O-Dog doin in a loved up smoochy chick flick?

First, the poetry used to tell part of the story was GREAT. As a writer, I could appreciate the use of words to convey a secret message. Out of this kind of artistic expression have come artists like india.arie, Jill Scott and Floetry AND the proliferation of open-mics and spoken word poetry e.g. HBO's Def Poetry Jam. Second the soundtrak used new artists and old artist such as the under-appreciated Billy Eckstine (Jelly). It showed young,educated, professional characters navagating thru life just like I was when this movie came out. I love it everytime it comes on cable and jam to the soundtrak always... and it doesn't hurt to watch Larenz Tate be DAMN sexy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmm...Mmm...Mmm......","review":"what more can I say!

I'm a typical guy who doesn't like to get caught up in the \\"mushy\\" movies, but this boy-meets-girl story is pretty cool. The scene at the end is the bomb.

His constant chastizing of the Bush administration as simpletons toward their policy on Terror is quite comical since his grand idea is appeasement/containment.

It contains very entertaining illustrations, good detail on obscure topics and based on excellent research. The authors brought to light many of the obscure ideas and overall feeling of the martial arts. This book is not full of legend but appears to stand on verifiable, historical facts. On the downside, it was too wordy. I spent extra time rereading the text to get the idea when a simple and direct way to get the point across would work. Critical ideas were not upfront and some chapters went on and on and in the end, said very little. In popular and in martial art writing, it is usually better to stay away from words like phantasmagoria, oscillate, and integrative. Recommended reading for the mature martial artist and for those cross-training into other branches of self-defense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I'm not very familiar with Japanese culture or the Samurai. My area is the Roman Empire, but this book is impressive. I've always had a mild interest in the Martial Arts and Feudal Japan and this book delivers. The writing is concise and easy to follow. The book is lavishly illustrated and the illustrations are fantastic. Instead of leaving it to the reader to try to figure out what the author's are describing the illustrations are there to demonstrate. It's a great book and a wonderful read for the beginner. As far as the historical errors referred to by earlier reviewers, I can't comment on. But this book is worth the money. It will make a nice addition to any military history collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book!","review":"After reading AIKIDO AND THE DYNAMIC SPHERE, by the same authors, I heard about this book.

It has a small red light on it that lights when the sensor is tripped, which the person tripping it might see. I put a piece of duct tape over it, which solved the problem.The pros: Mainly that it works really well. There has never been a time so far that it hasn't gone off when someone parked in my driveway.

Now when something sets off the front driveway, the back receiver goes off too, and vice versa, so I have no idea which side of the house someone is approaching. I checked,(by taking the unit apart) and there is no way to change frequencies on the the units.Anybody know a work around for this situation?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Driveway Patrol Motion Detectors","review":"I bought two of these from Amazon to use at the front door and at one of the back doors. My intention was to provide advanced warning at night if someone approached the house. We have a full alarm system but the internal motion detectors are purposely turned when we are in the house and these units were intended to augment that protection.Both motion detectors work well and ring in on both receivers. The volume is such that only one receiver is necessary. During the day, I do get some false alarms from the back unit due to where I have it located. Occasionally I have to turn off the receiver to keep the number of false alarms to a minimum.My units are not directly susceptible to the elements. They are under cover.Good, solid product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I ordered two units - they were inexpensive enough and other reviews gave me the gut call that it might just take two to result in one functional set.

Humorously, the \\"Q.C. Passed\\" inspection sticker is stuck right where the contacts should be! Blind inspector, maybe?? So - I now have one receiver and two sensors, which I can get by with -- 'cause at $13 a pop, it's not worth the time to return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"This driveway motion sensor works great. Almost too sensitive since it covers up to 400 feet. Just be careful where you aim it. LOL If you aim it toward the street, it will go off any time someone walks by or drives by.

Snowing, that will make it go off.Literally, one slightly breezy day it was going off every 5 seconds until I turned it off.So, I don't use them anymore.Though they might be useful indoors maybe in the garage or something where there's no movement, to let me know if there's an intruder or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor signal","review":"this alarm system does not preform very. in other wards very poor. its less than one hundred feet.the sigal is very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"Don't waste your time on this.

It does work however the sensor seems a bit too sensitive. It is either picking up on the small trees blowing in the wind in my neighbors yards or it is picking up on the cars that drive by, because the bell goes off every 15 minutes during the day until about 6 PM. After that it works whenever someone walks through the driveway or drives up.Not sure if there is a way to adjust the sensor I'll continue to try and move it around until whatever is causing it to go off so often is no longer in the sight of the sensor but until then I'll have to stick with the 3 star review because frankly I can't turn it on until after 6 and expect it to work right.Update: Can't get it the sensor to work properly. So it is useless. Don't waste your money on this product. It goes off even in a room where nothing is moving. This needs to be pulled off of amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty product","review":"Product ceased working after 1 week.

It took up the better part of an afternoon and sill I have to go to the Post Office to mail it back.The unit I got did not match the picture, the one sent was tan with \\"driveway patrol\\" on the chime unit, You do need a drill and screw driver to install.

These guys also advertise on eBay a lot, and they make up their prices by charging outrageous shipping costs. When you purchase from them, you think that you are getting a good deal due to the cost. But when you see your shipping charges, most of the time it is double if not tripled the cost of the product. The Driveway Patrol unit itself is ok if it stays in dry environment.

I think bugs must have been to blame, after a lot of testing and lost sleep - I ended up purchasing motion sensor surveillance cameras. I sleep much better now.

This is a handy product and worked well for the first 2 months. (changed batteries then 2x). I did not use it during the Winter months much due concern for moisture. Then when I started using it again recently, it required constant battery changes (weekly) or it would beep loudly (you can hear it outside) continully. With the price of batteries, I found it prohibitive. I asked for an exchange for another one that worked, and the seller would not comply (according to policies). However, I did feel that it is under 1 year and they could have replaced it. Due to this I will not buy from this particular seller again. This is the first product I have had this experience with and I order frequently from amazon. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for!","review":"Our garage is always open. And even though we keep our kids bikes chained up, I've been concerned about how someone could easily sneak in there and vandalize our vehicles.This device works PERFECT!It's VERY sensitive, the 1st night I used it, I kept flinging the door open, each time it sounded, just to find out that a car passing by on the street had set it off, or some people were going by on the sidewalk.After moving it around a bit, I found that facing the motion detector more towards my house and away from the street, was ideal. It could still alert me if anyone was in my garage, without sounding the alarm everytime someone drove by.So yes, I'm very happy with it, and felt it was very reasonably priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"It didn't work for me, constant false alarms.

Well, I was exactly right with this one. I made it as far as opening the package and going to put in the batteries when I realized there was half the metal battery connection plate things missing on one side, so the batteries would not be making a circuit. I happen to be an electrical engineer but you don't need to be to realize that batteries in a plastic bin with no conductors connecting to each other isn't going to do anything...

After placing it on a post at the end of our drive I quickly found out it was too far from the receiver. I moved it about 60 ft closer on a tree at the bend of the drive. Still it wouldn't pick up anything, finally I moved the receiver into the front bedroom in the window sill. That put the two components about 50 ft apart. Then it picked up almost everything including the wind but several times it didn't \\"see\\" cars that came into the driveway. My husband travels for business and is gone a lot, we live way out in the woods and our house faces the lake with the back facing the road, we have no neighbors and I thought this would be great to warn me when the rare visitor comes to call.

Used the \\"patch\\" included with the unit (intended to reduce the range of motion detection) in both cases, both attempts failed to elimate the problem. Alarm was loud - as often stated in other reviews - but not a problem as the unit was tucked away in a room that often has a closed door.Our time is too valuable to waste playing with resistors and building unsightly shields.

The outtakes are hilarious, and the cast evaluation bit on the first disc is great as well. There's also commentary on every episode, and based on said commentary, the actors and the entire crew have a real passion for bringing us this great show. Support this show by picking up this set as well as Season 2, and by watching it when it airs. #sixseasonsandamovie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Clever","review":"I skipped the premier of \\"Community\\" last fall. The promos didn't make the show seem very interesting. However, I happened to spot it on Hulu a few weeks later and decided to give it a try. Needless to say, I burned through all the back episode in no time and couldn't wait for more. The show is funny, touching and intelligent. \\"Community\\" struggled a bit to find its voice during this first season, but by the time they got to the \\"epic\\" paintball episode, all the pieces were solidly in place.Don't miss the beginning of this journey! Get the DVD. It's the next best thing to enrolling in Greendale Community College yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you aren't already a Community fan I highly recommend watching it!","review":"Community is a great TV show. I recommend this DVD to fans and new comers alike. You will not be disappointed. It's hilarious, heartwarming, and has great themed episodes. You will fall in love with these characters! Not to mention the actual packaging of the DVD set is amazing. It makes it even more worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent show, very fine DVD","review":"I'll keep it short and to the point:COMMUNITY is a great show. It has a talented cast; the writers have a solid idea of who the characters are and why they're funny, and they're not afraid to spotlight that or to push the boundaries of the typical sitcom format.The DVD set has commentaries on every episode, all of which are both entertaining and enlightening. The physical material of the set isn't extensive but the packaging shows the same attention to detail and marriage to the storylines of the series that the show's set designers and prop makers exhibit (a fact which is pointed out on the commentaries)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good price beats best buys price","review":"i love this show one favorites nbc has on besides 30 rock i was at best buy in target it was 36 dollars here on amazon has much better buy save alot of money good show ive enjoyed shipping was good good prices"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it get funny?","review":"I am writing this review having only seen about eight episodes of season one and I am still waiting for it to get funny and I honestly doubt I will watch much more. I got the first season for a great price so that is why I gave it a chance.Joel McHale is fine on The Soup. Here, he seems completely wrong and there is no chemistry with any of the cast. There are some funny moments, mostly with secondary characters, but few and far between. When does it get funny?By comparison, The Middle was immediately hilarious with great characters and writing.Now, there are a ton of extras on these dvds so that is a bonus for fans but as far as the show itself? Not funny at all. So far, anyways. I will revise if/when I watch any more of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless humor","review":"My wife teaches at a community college and my son also attends. I was hoping for some clever, relatable, and warm humor from this series but found none. The characters are comic book fabrications. The alleged wit and cleverness of this show seems to consist of the ability of the characters to rattle off pop culture memes and references as rapidly as possible. I have tried to let this show grow on me but the characters are too inhuman. I wouldn't wish to know any people remotely like this. If you live in the real world all day long, have actual principles and values, and do genuine productive things and your idea of chilling out is to watch a bunch of nihilistic, parasitic, clueless, post modern knuckleheads grope their way through life than you should absolutely buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the minority - I did not like this Series.","review":"I have tried several times to watch this series and don't like it. I don't like the storylines or most of the characters. I will try again because all of the people that gave this a positive rating must be seeing something in it that I don't. I have quite an eclectic taste in DVD's and it is seldom that I don't find something in a show that I like but I couldn't with this one. Sorry but I would not purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"hollywood's funny stuff","review":"This episode was funny. It is clearly written by hollywood about hollywood, with alot of references to movies, and tv. Particularly from the 80's. I think it has the potential for being a great series. Or falling flat by beating the same jokes and themes to death.It has a Bill Murray, John Candy, Chevy Chase Movie from the 80's feeling. It does this with deliberate self mocking by labeling various moments with Movies reference.I liked it. The cast is large so hopefully they will expand in possibilities of the various characters and situations and not let it become old in 3 episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful exploration of metatheatrics","review":"Community is a writers show. It almost feels like an exercise for professional TV watchers. They deftly explore tropes and modern conventions that most viewers take for example. I cannot recommend this show enough. Definitely one of the smartest shows on television today."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazingly funny show","review":"I do not watch TV. I hate commercials and much of the programming is dreck.That said someone pointed out that this TV show had done an episode where the characters had played Dungeons and Dragons and I HAD to see it!So I watched the episode online and laughed out loud. I showed it to my family and laughed as I watched it with them. Then sight unseen I bought the first season. T Here were many moments when we were laughing so hard we had to pause or rewind so we could hear dialogue.I don't imagine the humor is for everyone. Much of it is rather sophisticated puns and cultural references, or movie parodies. Then there is plain old slapstick by Chevy Chase who is not too old to fall over stuff (still)I eagerly await season 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show!","review":"This show is amazing! I was a bit wary when it first came out, but I got over it quickly. As community college graduate, I found a lot of silly little things in the show which perfectly summed up my goofy community college experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest show in years!","review":"Last night's episode about pottery and sailing classes made me laugh so hysterically, I almost burst my gall bladder. No TV show has done that to me in years! Just too smart, too funny! Get it, you'll thank me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show!","review":"This is a great season to start a great show.

Give it a shot, it is well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Within the first three episodes of this show there are references to Bill Murray, John Hughes and they play an Aimee Mann song, I was sold on this show right then and there. This is one of the strongest first seasons of a show I've seen in a long time. This show is a classic like Family Guy or It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, the kind of show where you can watch the same episodes over and over again and see things you didn't notice before and laugh like you did the first time you watched it. This show is cast so well, this is one of those shows that just works. I'm really glad it's not shot on a crappy half set with a laugh track, I hate that s#@%. They need to put this out on Blu-Ray already, so for now this is as good as it gets. I bought this for my sister and my Dad, and I'll probably buy it again for someone else. I think everyone should watch this show at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Community DVD","review":"This is a warmly funny comedy. It draws you in as it continues and is easy to relate to the characters.really enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Community","review":"Simply an awesome DVD for an awesome show. Instead of just having a commentaries for a couple of episodes, the DVD has one for every episode. The other extra items work fine as well. Definately buy, not just for the quality, but also because renewal of the show may come down to merchandise sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with misfits","review":"Community: The Complete First SeasonI just received and finished watching the first season of Community. I was running out of ideas for where to look for good comedy,so based on the reviews here I took a chance and am not sorry. This first season took several episodes to gel, but I was soon engagedin the series and premise- basically that a community college will draw all types, ethnicities and age groups for various reasons andit becomes a stew for forming odd clicks. There are thick cultural references that you have to watch for as part of the fun. The male leadcharacter forms a Spanish language study group to woo a standoffish blond, but finds uninvited others have decided to attend, and thesebecome the main cast. There are so many side plots it is a little hard to give an account of but it all adds up to viewing fun. I am lookingforward to the second season being released on DVD, but in the mean time, this is one of those rare shows I will watch over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SHOWS OF ALL FRACKING TIME !!!!!","review":"To keep it simple , this show is simply perfect , why talk when every aspect of this show screams PERRRRRRRFECT ?!?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Show!!!","review":"This show is awesome. I have not laughed out loud at a new TV show in quite some time, and I did with \\"Community\\". I started watching it because I love \\"The Soup\\", and Chevy Chase is always funny. But it's the strong ensemble as a whole that keep me hooked each episode. The special features are great; they really add to the depth of the characters. Buy it-you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series","review":"Some of the story lines are 'tried and true', but the series itself has an excellent and varied cast, exploits/plays with stereotypes, and builds in a believable way both with plot and character development.

Awesome cast awesome show overall #sixseasonsandamovie hell ten seasons!!!!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"another devoted fan posting a five star review everywhere possible","review":"We really need Community to make it through six seasons. This show is the funniest thing on television right now. It has the most diverse range of actors/characters and the most creative plots. Nothing on tv gets my head spinning like this show. That being said, I also feel that this kind of cast and writing is needed in order to compete with tv atrocities like Glee and the Big Bang Theory. Community breaks boundaries and blows away all the other shows that reuse old ideas and try to follow the rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great distraction","review":"I thought this was well written and very funny. I look forward to the release of season 2.

The show is funny and addictive. If you saw the episodes on tv, you'll enjoy watching them again here. If you missed them the first time, you will enjoy watching this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"amusing","review":"I had no idea what this show was about but decided to watch it and see. I found it amusing. The characters are somewhat stereotypical but the acting is good. I would watch another episode, although my college days are long over and normally do not reminisce about the times. I was an older studious student type with an agenda and did minimal socializing. I found the sororities too demanding for the amount of support and friendship they offer. This is the other side of college life where the students learn more about themselves and life from each other than the courses offered at the institution can teach them. The writers clearly have a sense of humor and that's something everyone needs to get through life easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even waste your time!","review":"This movie has the worst sound and picturequality on anything I have ever seen (except for the movie Thug Life with Napoleon)The picturequality is really awful, filmed with an old VHS-camera I believe...And the videos are cut short, basicly this is a mess of bad-quality stuff.Skip this one and put on a Mystikal record instead, you will not be dissapointed!And oh... The cover of the video has women with very little clothes on it, however they do not appear in the film so don't kid yourself thinking that: -Hey even if I don't like the movie I can always look at the girls!Becouse the girls isn't even in it, except in the censored musicvideoclips"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Barbara Eden film A must for fans.","review":"A very entertaining drama starring Barbara Eden.

The companion piece is Visions Of Murder co-starring James Brolin, alsohighly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun TV adventure","review":"As a fan of Barbara Eden over the years I did enjoy her TV movie adventure. Some of the mystery plot is a bit dated and transparent. It is not Sherlock Holmes, and definitely not a CSI but still worthy of a nice bowl of popcorn with the family. If you enjoy the TV mystery of this period you will enjoy this one. Barbara does a fine job."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst TV Movie Of All Time","review":"This movie was a sequel of the 1993 TV Movie Barbara Eden starred in.She usually does good acting though the script they gave her was not good.She should have said No.The script was written poorly.The first movie for TV was good.Though this movie is awful.Her character's daughter was 16 in this movie when in the previous movie a year earlier she was only 12.They never should have done this movie.This was the last TV movie she did for NBC TV and it is because this movie is so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]","review":"An absolutely awesome movie!

It doesn't hold up to simple dropping and handling. Also, the button didn't seem to work correctly for us. Wish it were more sturdy or we'd buy more, as it is super fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, sucks up batteries","review":"This takes one AA battery. We keep the screwdriver and a pack of batteries out. My almost 3 year old loves this toy and plays with it constantly, and it literally goes through one AA battery per day. Salty, with three wheels in a row, tends to stay on the track well - just do not make sharp curves in your track. My kid LOVES this toy, so it is well worth it -- just be prepared to go through LOTS of batteries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love it","review":"Has held up to the abuse of my three year old and keeps right on going, will be getting him more of his favorite charactors"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does fine with straightaways, but derails easily on curves.","review":"I bought this in part because other reviews lauded the six wheels and their superior ability to stay on track. It's nonsense: the middle wheels float, so they don't help at all, and the wheels hug the outside of the tracks, so minor misalignments (which are very hard to avoid) send Salty off the tracks. I had such high hopes. Sigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"Battery powered Salty made my grandson very happy. If only it had solar power instead of batteries. Ha. Ha. Ha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off track","review":"I'd ordered this for my 2 y.o train nut of a grandson to run on the Brio and Melissa & Doug wooden tracks I own, but something about the consruction of Salty the engine is off just enough that it gets stuck every few inches. It's been a disappointment. I'd return it, but the plastic packaging was so impervious I had to cut it open to get the train out so can't. A waste of money in my book. If you want a battery-operated toy train to run on your wooden train tracks, I'd try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a few days","review":"This really is a nice looking little engine with a hefty die-cast metal feel to it. Unfortunately, the one I got stopped working after a few days. I could tell it was a loose connection in the button because, for a while, we could get it to work by jiggling the button. But after a while, even jiggling didn't make it work.Note, I have since switched to Tomica plastic tracks and trains. They are really a much better solution for self propelled toy trains for 4+ year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salty died and won't move after a few months","review":"Our Salty died after a few month, just wouldn't move even with a fresh battery. Is there a repair center for that? Seems like there are a lot them with the same problem. My son loved it while it was working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I had read the other reviews stating some didn't work, the battery wasn't long enough to meet the prongs but hoped they were dud products. Nope, after my 2 year old was beyond excited to get the train, we put a battery in and... nothing. We tried another battery brand, as suggested in the reviews I had read.. and still nothing. My husband finagled a metal piece to extend the battery to make a connection, and for a brief time, Salty worked! And he was soooo fast! But, we had to package him back up and send him back after the piece disconnected. Why continue to sell a product that is non-functional? Returns are so well done and easy thru Amazon might I add!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow and steady","review":"We've had battery-operated Salty for almost 2 years, and he's still on the original batteries. He's pretty durable--very limited paint chipping, even though my son went through a stage where Salty was allowed to drive off the table onto the hardwood floor with some frequency! He can pull long trains (20+ cars) without the magnets coming apart. While Salty moves slowly (much more so than, say, Jet Engine Thomas), and he sometimes gets stuck while pulling long trains up hills or around corners, he always manages to get up the hill or around the corner after a moment or two. I suggest buying two battery-operated engines so you can have them race."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose your company wisely","review":"This may or may not be a good product, I can't say. I ordered from MY TOYBOX and the product that they sent me doesn't work AT ALL. I contacted them and they didn't do nothing to remedy the situation (credit, refund, exchange, etc). So if you buy this product DON'T buy from My TOXBOX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy with toy","review":"We purchased this trian for a Christmas present. Once opened on Christmas morning we found out it did not work, my son was very disappointed. When we called the company they said that they have not made this train in about a year- due to problems. The company was great to work with and offered a different item if we return the Salty. Amazon on the other hand was not so easy to work with- the customer service was terrible and they could only offer a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid! They do not stay on the track","review":"I would not purchase the battery operated Thomas engines. We bought two of them and they will not stay on the tracks. Something about the wheels on the engines no being made correctly so both engines (One Thomas and one Percy) keep going off the track. Not a very good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've read reviews","review":"We have the battery operated Percy and LOVE it so I didn't even bother to read the reviews. Unfortunately the bottom of the train isn't staying tight to the top and causes it to come loose and it stops working. Obviously I'm not the only one who has been receiving a defective product. If you are looking for a great battery operated train, Percy is awesome and has been running strong for 6 months (and can withstand a lot of abuse)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - Battery Doesn't Seat Properly","review":"We purchased this Salty Battery Powered Train and a Thomas Battery Powered Train at the same time. The battery fits perfectly into the Thomas, but does not seat properly in the Salty train (the positive end of the battery doesn't reach the terminal). Because we gave it to our kids for Easter, we didn't open it and try it within the 30 day window so Amazon wouldn't exchange it (I should note that Amazon is very good at exchanging or replacing things usually).So I called the company and they admitted that they've had problems with particular brands of batteries, but I'm still responsible to pay return shipping for the train to get a replacement (they'll pay the shipping for the replacement but not the return).Very disappointed. Will likely be our last Learning Curve purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money. Buy the non-powered version","review":"This was a Christmas present for my 2 year old boy. It has a strong motor will push and pull well, go up hills etc. However the middle set of wheels tends to bind in short curves and switches and this derails the engine (or it gets stuck). It can run unaided only on the simplest of tracks. My 3-4 year old couldn't keep his hands off it though. The motor lasted less than 3 months. Not for the child that likes to take things apart as well. I chose to return it when my son started picking the rubber grips off the wheels. I had high hopes for this product but it wasn't a good fit for my son. Better for a gentler, less inquisitive child. So consider your kids temperment and maybe save your money and buy the non-powered version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like it should","review":"This did what it is supposed to do.

Granted, I didn't do the things Lucy did at that age, she shows a maturity and fragility at the same time that most teen girls have. I really liked this book, and was surprised when I found I could not put it down.Lucy's voice is so clear, and when she finally decides what she wants to do, the reader just knows it'll turn out well for her.What really surprised me was that the author is a man, and I wondered how he could capture what it was like to grow up as a young woman.

In effect, the \\"loud\\" and \\"quiet\\" parts of the song get compressed together into a nasty mess.

His early 80s views of future events were of the most likely probability in the 90s, so we can see that the earth changes have been delayed, not eliminated.

With this particular one the readings were always different, even within a matter of seconds, and depending on which ear was used. A difference of a few tenths of a point would be normal but differences of a point or more is not acceptable. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is for the ease of use of ear thermometers in general, but in hindsight, this one is not even a tradeoff for ease since I had to buy yet a different brand, which, by the way, I am extremely pleased with. Check out my other reviews to find it.One other comment, this model of Lumiscope is a 2215, and there is one that seems to be exactly the same model for a very different price. I don't have time to check it out but you might want to read the info on both before buying one."},{"rating":"1","title":"AT&T 954","review":"I bought 3 of these for my home solely for the intercom feature.

I have only three lines, but bought a 4 line so that I can expand. The headset would not allow me to access the Centrex special dial tone to transfer calls out of the system. AT&T's customer service reps were TOTALLY USELESS and uninformed. After an enormous waste of time, I returned the phones. It is amazing to me that AT&T would create a phone that cannot be easily used with the Centrex system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phone Man","review":"This phone is Lucent quality through and through. Good features, sound quality and reliabilty. If this unit had caller ID and a dot matrix display, I would give it 5 stars! However, you may have trouble with the intercom feature. This is not a Lucent problem, just a quirk of all multiline, stand-alone phones that have intercom. Intercom works by sending a high frequency signal on the same wires as line one and line one MUST be connected to all phones in your system. There must be less than 600 feet of phone wire between the sets and it is best to disconnect all other equipment (fax, modems, dsl, radio interference filters)from line one. Poor phone wiring can also cause a problem, but not usually. I highly recommend the Lucent Z800A isolation filter to improve intercom operation. You will have to call Lucent to buy it(see your instruction manual). Overall, this phone is professional quality and a great value for the buck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Phone, Bad Receiver","review":"In our office we use four of these phones. We have only been in business less than a year and have already returned two phones. The only reason was buzzing in the earpiece. We have determined it is from where the phone plugs into the reciever. I had hoped it was just one bad phone, but after already returning two I have two more that are buzzing when you answer them and during conversations. If you pull or push on the cord you can sometimes get it to clear up. In a business it just doesn't sound very professional when you have to make excuses for your messed up phones. I'm now looking for a new system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intercom problem","review":"Bought 4 phones 2 years ago but now one phone's intercom rings automatically and when that phone is unplugged, other phone intercoms dont work.

I called AT&T's troubleshooting line and they suggested I try the phone in other jacks, in other configurations, etc., but the handset quality was still poor.

This is not a great book and doesn't do justice to Mr. Clemens or Ulysses \\"Sam\\" Grant. This book reads like a Readers Digest article or Weekly Reader abridgement, there's little meat and too much padding. Actually the majority of the book is padded unmercifully. The segment on James Garfield's assassination is a bizarre and unnecessary inclusion, there are other bird walks which don't add up to a hill of beans. It's interesting that the author, Mark Perry, is quite evidently the author of the two positive reviews here, why this wasn't caught by a editor here is a trifle mystifying. My advice is to read Grant's own \\"Memoirs\\" and Twain's \\"Autobiography\\" and nother bother with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and unbalanced","review":"I'm a great admirer of Mark Twain but I didn't find much of him in this book at all. The book is basically about US Grant and his book, but I was more interested in reading about Twain. The mistakes the author puts in about Twain are almost laughable, anyone just starting out with the subject might make them but for a published author to make them is quite embarrassing. The portions about Grant were slightly better, but I expect much more from a book purporting to be about history and two great figures, an historical and a literary one. Very disappointing, frustrating reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"As parlor jokes go this one has its moments.","review":"There are precious few really good scenes in this first entry of the Murphy mystery series. These scenes are enjoyable in their own right. But, in themselves, they don't make this book worth reading, let alone buying. And this book certainly doesn't inspire me to go out and read any of Rita's other, non Murphy mystery, books.Given the fact that being a sheriff here in the Commonwealth of Virginia means running for office every four years, one has to wonder how Rick Shaw got into office in the first place, let alone staying in office for twelve years. And what, pray tell, is he doing issuing Harry a gun on page 219? At no point in this book are we told she knows how to use one, let alone having a permit to carry one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No fun at all!","review":"I took this book out of the library, thank goodness, and really couldn't stand it. The author apparently feels that gratuitous profanity, in excess, makes for a good read. Not in my book! I was trying to find an author whose books might fill the void left by the end of LJB's \\"The Cat Who\\" series, as the ghost writers of that series are just painfully bad. Unfortunately, RMB comes off as a rather crude individual and her characters are the same. The \\"talking\\" animals were not cute, but rather disgusting. I could not feel any warmth from them or towards them. I know RMB has her fans who read every book she puts out, so I'm sure they all love her. That's fine. I will move on and keep looking for another author who loves cats and a good mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Small-Town Read","review":"This is a wonderful book for everyone. The mystery is intriguing and so are the characters. They all add their special brand of humor and vitality to the book. The animals are always a step ahead of the humans in finding out who the murderer is although they don't have time to figure it out themselves. The murderer slips near the end and you'll know who it is if you pay attention. Of course, if you read the other books before this one, you'll know who it is from the start. So, my advice, read this one first and watch the characters develop as you press further into the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun te read","review":"This one is situated more at the beginning of the Mrs Murpy mysteries timeline.

It was a well-thought out book, entertaining, and suspensful, but not gruesome. The best part was the animals, who really are so much more clever and sharp-witted (or at least sharp-nosed) than the humans. I also greatly appreciated hearing their viewpoints on humans in general, and not surprisingly found it the same as mine.

I started off reading with quite an attitude - felt it was going to be way to cutesy to continue reading. But finally the book settled in and clipped along.The characters were crisp, once I got them lined up in my head.I was trying to tell in many places in the book if the author was trying to use the book as a way to push some of her thoughts out on paper, in particular she writes very strong ideas about organized religion (Catholicism in particular), the culling of the weak/sick from the pack. Having been to the Charlottesville area before it was interesting to imagine this area in the story's setting.I loved the language and odd turns of phrase/choices of words the author would throw into the book.

This series should've ended after CHILDREN OF DUNE (4 stars) -- if U read this book, U'll wish it HAD...."},{"rating":"2","title":"More serious, but not up to the name in depth.","review":"God Emperor of Dune is a thought-provoking book. It is certainly the most philosphical so far, and portrays an implausible though fascinating picture of humanity in which deliberate oppression manipulates society. It is about the use of power, the danger of seeking absolute truth, and the importance of rulers retaining compassion for humanity and individuals. I went through the book quickly and could not put it down, mostly because I was fascinated by Leto II--an extremely complex character which I have come to think of as Herbert's idea of the mind of evolution itself, though with some traces of humanity. The dialogue is also fascinating. When I finished it, I felt like I had read a study of power in all its forms, with a plot thrown in as an afterthought, so I could't rate it very highly as a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosophical ranting disguised as novel","review":"After the incredibly entertaining and thought-provoking first three novels, Herbert put together this philosophical treatise (Yeah, we get it. We got it after Dune.) and draped a lot of dialogue around it. The problem with the novel is that nothing particularly interesting happens. If you really liked the three Dune novels, you probably need to read this to see what happens to Leto, but skim it quickly. The ending is significant to the trilogy, but little else before that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Having loved \\"Dune,\\" having enjoyed \\"Dune Messiah,\\" and having found \\"Children of Dune\\" interesting, I could barely finish this installment of the saga. Boredom permeates the book, covering the plot (and reader) with a patina of pointlessness."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest link","review":"This book is mostly dialogue with very little action. There is an exciting beginning, then things slow down and don't pick back up again until the very end. While many fans rave about this book, I just couldn't take the idea of Leto as a hybrid human-sandworm seriously enough to enjoy the book. If you're able to do this, I'm sure it's a much better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A test in patience","review":"I enjoyed the first three books, but this one disappointed me. I stuck with it hoping for it to get better, but it just didn't. While I agree Frank Herbert is a creative genius which can still be seen in this book, this book was just dull all the way through. It's full of repetitive dialog and the climax was pretty obvious early on. If you want to continue with the series, though, I'd recommend drudging through this one or you'll be somewhat lost in Heretics, which I'm currently reading and is already much more interesting. Who knows? Maybe you'll enjoy what I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Of All DUNE Books.","review":"God Emperor of DUNE is by far the best of all the DUNE books. The Plot, the character development and the sheer scope of Herbert's imagination. I found myself hating Leto all through the book until the end when he finally explains everything. At that point I understood why he did the things he did. All other DUNE books fails to compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best but still good","review":"A great book in its own right, God Emperor of Dune palls in comparison with the first book in the Chronicles.

The series encompasses thousands of years and thousands of light years and this book makes up the largest part of the story.

Reading them almost \\"in one sitting\\" is intoxicating in that you realize the breadth and scope of the Dune novels as they cover millenia yet connect time and space through familiar themes. As a child of the Radical Reformation in Christianity, the theme of overthrowing religious tyrants only to have new ones attempt to arise from within the reformation is all too familiar. The temptation to abandon personal responsibility to a \\"superman\\" (or \\"superworm\\")is one of the central struggles of the 20th century. Frank Herbert's genius is to remove us from our familiar surroundings to show us the dynamics of the abandonment of freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow, but great","review":"This book is not a page turner like some of the others in this series, it took me probably twice as long per page as its immediate successor, heretics of Dune. It's kind of hard to read, with it's immense amount of concepts, many that you aren't supposed to understand. Even from the view of Leto himself, you are still just a human reading his words.However, give this book a little time when you think you've had enough, let it sink in. Keep reading, by the end you are in to it. I tingled through the ending.When I was reading the bulk of the book I didn't enjoy it as much as the others a lot of the time, but now loooking at it in retrospect I see the greatness of the thought, and the story as well.After all, Herbert is only a mediocre action writer anyway, his strengths are in plotting and concepts, which this book is filled with.Sorry if I didn't communicate as effectively as some of the others the quality of this book, but it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A primer on the uses of power, politics and propaganda.","review":"Herbert continues the saga of the Atreides with Paul's sonLeto II who has paid the ultimate price for becominghumanity's savior at the sacrifice of his own.

So how could this book be so bad?There is almost NO action and an immense amount of dialogue. At times I believe Herbert was just talking to himself, amazing himself at how clever he could be.It's everybody against the 'God Emperor' but how do you defeat someone that knows the future? Obviously Herbert couldn't figure it out either because he had to make Leto II purposely dense and uncaring so that everyone would have a chance.I loved the first 3 and still plan on reading the last 2 but they HAVE to get better.

You'd have to have the boredom threshold of a slug on valium to make it all the way through this pretentious, verbose bit of authorial self indulgence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not the best in the series","review":"I really didn't like this book. Not much happened and it just consisted of Leto II preaching to EVERYONE. The 3 books before this one were MUCH better and I've mostly through the 5th and it is also better.

Be prepared for lots and lots of empty dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Words, Not Enough Content","review":"This novel was extremely disappointing. Leto II is one of the most tiresome characters I have ever seen. While talking to his close friends like Moneo and Duncan, he rambles on and on without actually saying anything. What a normal person can accomplish in a mere sentence takes Leto an entire paragraph. Midway through the book, I lost all incentive for finishing it.Most of the other characters in the book aren't much better. Hwi Noree continually breaks into tears whenever Leto talks about his \\"awesome sacrifice\\", and Moneo always seems to be encouraging Leto in his never-ending speeches by asking dumb questions like \\"How, Lord?\\". The only characters I can actually stand are Duncan Idaho and Siona. They are the only ones with enough common sense not to blindly follow Leto in his \\"Golden Path\\".Reading this book is a waste of time.

It contains certain key events, described from the God emperors point-of-view, which is the only way to know how stuff really happened. In the sequels, which happen several mellenia later, the people have a quite wrong image of the God Emperor, because history is written by the victors.. This book is unfortunately the most awful book I've'ever read, and trust me, I've read plenty. The storyline is downright pessimistic, none of the main characters, excluding the Idaho invoke any sympathy, while The Fremen have continued to degenerate. Hell, Duncan even meets one with BROWN EYES! Fortunately, the sequels to this book make up for this debacle.

There are some big names in it: Ann Margaret, for example. Story is set in the small town in Iowa. Two young people, who have known each other since childhood, work together in a small accounting firm. They have known each other forever. Both in some way are social misfits: he still lives in a same home with his mother; she is an orphan who likes to talk to her pet bird.Their circumstances change when he wins lottery. Except that the lottery ticket in question is not really his... Before long, the two are married, only to realize that each one of them has a secret that may destroy their marriage.

This product looked like it would be similar. Wrong. The Kristal scrub has a delicate, natural scent and is a soft gel that really foams up when you rub it on. The grains are small and well concentrated and dispersed throughout so you get great coverage and good exfoliation without irritation. The Neutrogena scrub has a cloyingly sweet scent and is really concentrated -- it goes on in a big glop and if you use it in the tub it leaves everything slimy, even after a good washing up. The grains are on the large side but not well concentrated, so they are really rough but don't cover your skin well. And at more per ounce than my favorite scrub, I'm going to pass on this product in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skin so smooth","review":"I love this stuff, have been using it for years.

She never sang a Mozart opera on stage. She sang these arias in concerts and recitals. On this album we are treated to her take on Mozart. With her huge, dramatic voice, she was fully capable of singing Dona Ana in Don Giovanni, but for some reason she never sang the role on stage. Mozart was not her specialty and it was not something she was trained to sing. In those days, German singers specialized in Mozart, not Italian singers like Callas. But she sings the heck out of \\"Ah Perfido\\" by Beethoven, \\"Or Sai Che L'Onore\\" Dona Ana's aria from Don Giovanni as well as the more subdued \\"Non Mi Dir\\". No one can imagine Callas as the Countess in Figaro but her \\"Porgi Amor\\" is really quite haunting and moving. If you're curious to hear Callas singing Mozart, check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Bruce remains in high authority on OBEs!","review":"This book is probably the most informative one you're going to find in relation to out of body experiences. Since he was a child, Robert Bruce has been having OBEs, though at first they were spontaneous. In his adult life he began to develop methods that he could use to consciously trigger the projection reflex to cause an OBE to happen purposefully. Included in this invaluable book is the NEW (New Energy Ways) system. With the groundbreaking techniques employed in the NEW system, Bruce teaches you how to move energy throughout the energy body and develop your energy centers or, chakras as they are known in eastern traditions, to help give you a fully charged, fully remembered out of body experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding wealth of knowledge!","review":"This book leaves nothing to chance,it guides you from the first steps of training on astral projection to the actual mastering of the technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!","review":"When I bought this book, I knew close to nothing about OBE's, but since I've read it, I can actually have an intelligent discussion about them! This book is THE resource on astral projection and OBE's, and although I haven't had and OBE yet, I recommend that you purchase this book if you are even the least bit interested and want to know more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had A Very Lucid Flying Dream After Reading This","review":"This is a great book for anyone interested in Astral Projection. It is complex, but gives simple practices to help increase your awareness while dreaming. I attended one of the author's day seminars, which was extremely interesting. And after doing some of the practices in this book and attending his seminar I was able to have some very lucid dreams. One dream in particular was exhilarating. I felt as though I was truly flying and visiting friends all over town. When I woke up I was surprised it hadn't actually happened.While I am no longer interested in astral projection because I find meditation more more enjoyable and expansive, I still think the idea is fascinating and this book is worth a read for anyone interested in the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Original","review":"This book is completely different from all other books I have read on Astral Projection(which is a lot). Thus, for the metaphysical researcher this is an absolute must. Robert goes over preparing yourself for projection with seemingly unrelated energy excercises, ignoring your fears and distractions, Astral street smarts, what destinations you may have to choose from, how to defend yourself if necessary, how to remember your frequent Astral experiences, and much more. Robert's personal stories of his projections are fascinating as well, which will inspire you to have your own projections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spent a week with Robert in Montana","review":"His techniques work if you practice them daily, and the energy generation that can be produced is useful during meditation and for developing good concentration skills. Will you become the next great energy healer? That's up to you I suppose. I prefer Robert Monroe for OBE work personally, but Bruce's techniques can be used hand in hand with Hemi-Sync technology.He tours and does weekend seminars and is very open to the \\"public\\" regarding information. Give his techniques a try, you'll be surprised with the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start and stop with this book.","review":"This is a great book for anyone interested in astral projection. On top of that it also dives into some other interesting topics. I would suggest anyone starting out to try this book first. It is easy to understand and even goes into some more detailed aspects that most vets would not even know about.Bottom line, get this book before any other. Robert Bruce is \\"the man\\" when it comes down to it- this book is proof. It is a manual and also a handbook. For the money you can't get a better abundance of info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do You Really Want To Know & Understand OBE's?","review":"This is the most powerfully exhaustive book on OBE's that I have ever read.

Thank you Robert Bruce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Informative How To Book","review":"Though I have not read the entire book, it is a complete informative book.

OBE's are easiest when it is given food for travel.Janice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book On Astral Projection & OBE There IS!!","review":"I don't have time to write out a long review detailing all the great things in this book. Let me just say that this is the best book on astral projection hands down. I bought at least 10 books on astral projection before I got this one. And this one is now the only one I use. It is a complete manual of astral projection that provides practically all the information you need for pursuing astral projection. Robert Bruce has been helping people astral project for years and the contents of this book reflect his immense knowlege of the subject. This is a must have if you are interested in astral projection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most comprehensive well-written book on OBE.","review":"After hearing Robert Bruce on Art Bell's Coast-to-Coast AM radio show, I bought this book to help me discover how to control the spontaneous OBE's that I have had in the past and the book has provided me with much much more.Mr. Bruce teaches NEW (New Energy Ways) as a direct way to stimulate your energy centers and the exercises to get you have a successful OBE. Within a week, I had my first successful episode. It is so different from dreaming or imagination, it is indeed a real phenomenon (something I had doubted many times). The book is written in a very conversational and personable manner by this 25-year \\"mystic\\" and astral traveller. The terms are purposefully non-esoteric and mystifying and the techniques given do indeed work. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just a mish mash and nothing really new in it","review":"Reading the other reviews you'd think this book was the best thing since sliced bread. But I found it boring. Nothing really new in it. Just the same old stuff you can read about on the Internet. The author appears to be relying on the fact that to many people this topic is very new. So they don't actually know how out-dated Robert Bruce's ideas are. Monroe was streets ahead, in my opinion. Bruce is still floundering in the real-time zone claiming he's \\"advanced\\". He really has little idea about the wider reality. In my view he is just one-eye in the land of the blind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it, worst book ever read.","review":"This is the far more the worst book I have ever read, author mumble around and not able to get to the point, 100 % wrong information about astral projection.

It is both educational and stupidly funny - that's why my kids (4 and 6) have watched it dozen's of times.

There is some great footage of volcanos, as one would expect, and I did learn some things about different kinds of volcanos that I didn't know. However, the dumb cast and story of them landing in an alien spaceship on volcanos leaves a lot to be desired. Typical of the rubbish remarks in this video are: \\"No, you pinhead.\\";\\"'No, it's not.' ' Snot?'\\"; \\"The volcano barfs its guts out.\\" And it goes on and on. We have a collection of informative videos, which my boys enjoy every bit as much as this one, that don't use this sort of language. Do kids really need this kind of crudeness to get them interested in volcanos? I think not. In the future I shall borrow National Geographic titles from the library to preview them before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what you'd expect","review":"This book isn't bad if you have no access to the documentation or online tutorials already available for SDL. The book is really short and doesn't go into depth in any one area. There is only a brief mention of using SDL with OpenGL and nothing more. Save your money, there's enough tutorials out there online that you can get more from, than in this book. Instead of calling it \\"Focus on SDL\\" the title should be \\"A Glance at SDL\\" because that's all that you are getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...but nothing you can't easily find online!","review":"In conversation and on GDNet I have been condescending of this book and for that I must apologize - It is a great book for learning the Simple Direct-Media Library.I would definitely recommend this book if it makes you feel better to own a hard copy guide to SDL. However, I learned more through trial-and-error using only the online documentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginner's book, but brief.","review":"On the positive side, this book is an excellent entry-level programmer's guide to the SDL library. Anybody with basic coding skills should be able to easily follow the examples (which, by the way, are not duplicated in print... something to keep in mind if you are reading this on the train). Surely you could learn all you need to from SDL's own web site and other online documentation. But if you prefer to sit down and read a book cover to cover, like I do, this book might be a better fit.My biggest disappointment is that there is no coverage of OpenGL at all. My attraction to SDL is to use as a base platform for OpenGL coding. A chapter on OpenGL integration would have won a fifth star from me.I would like to have seen more advanced and in-depth coverage. Maybe another chapter or so on implementing an example game using the framework given to us in the final section."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess the rest might be good, but...","review":"The first few pages completely destroys this author's (and his editors') credibility. The passionate pre-game speech Tressel purportedly gave before the Fiesta Bowl was actually written by a FAN and posted to an internet message board. It certainly was stirring and passionate, but Tressel probably never even heard it (or of it) until some misinformed journalist mentioned it to him some time after the game, I'm guessing. He wasn't shouting, by all ACTUAL accounts, he didn't pause for dramatic effect. I'm sure it could have been a good book, but why start it off with a lie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest","review":"This author is using information in the this book, specifically the \\"Pre-Game Speech\\", without the permisson of the original author and without crediting the author of this material.

I am a pretty big guy, so the weight does not bother me, but a smaller person might want to consider the weight of taking this full pan out of an oven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great heavy lasagna pan","review":"This is a great looking 9x13 pan with good proportions. It is really deep and makes a great tall lasagna. It is extremely heavy when fully loaded with a lasagna. Its bulk gives it even cooking in the oven, but can be difficult to get out of the oven after your lasagna is done. I have made many other things in this pan with great results. It is fairly non-stick and has not stained even after several lasagnas. The enamel is fairly bulletproof.Overall I really like this pan, with its only weakness being heft. However, that heft is put to good use in very even cooking and keeping the lasagna warm at the table.You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batali Lasagna Pan is Best","review":"The Mario Batali lasagna pan is the best pan I've used. It is extra deep so it holds really thick layers of all the good stuff I make my lasagnas with. It weighs a ton since it is enameled cast iron, but that is why it cooks so evenly. I recommend adding about 15+ minutes of extra cooking time to your recipes because the oven does have to heat the heavy mass of the pan. Cleaning was easy. Just soak it in hot sudsy water for a while then all the baked on cheese and sauce will wipe off with a kitchen scrub pad. The only surprises were that the rim of the pan has no enamel. It is bare iron. But it cleaned without a problem and did not rust when soaked overnight. This is a great pan, but it is very heavy when empty and even heavier when filled with a lasagna so make sure you've got some stong helpers around to put it in the oven if necessary. :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deep Dish Lasagna!!!","review":"Yes, this is heavy, 10 lbs 3 ozs to be exact; but that is what you should be wanting for a quality piece of cast iron. This is a great piece of cookware for deep dish lasagna as it measures a full 13\\" x 9\\" x 3\\" deep. This is a very good quality product even tho' it is made in China; I would buy American made but could find no other product with the heft and size of this one, and the bake pans offered by Le Cruset are shallow in comparison. I purchased the Chiati color and am very pleaed and impressed with the quality of the finish. I just made a lasagna with double the recipe of Ragu Bolonese and handmade pasta ([...]) this past weekend and it all fit wonderfully into this pan, and baked up beautifully in the stipulated bake time. I'm sure it would work equally well for mac & cheese or other casseroles! Also, the cleanup was easy with just a short soak in soapy water, and the pan looks like new again.Believe me; you will not be dissappointed in this purchase!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed for school","review":"I purchased this book on Amazon because I needed it for class but this book has some of the most interesting short stories in literature, it really should be a must have for those who lve literature"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - English Audio!","review":"I just opened my box, and was terribly disappointed -- although the information for this DVD set claims that it includes both English and Japanese language, it is in fact just the English version.That being said, the quality is good, the extras are nice, and it looks like it'll be good watching.

Whom is it trying to reach? It's labeled to be specifically useful to HP printer owners, so if you're not in that group, you can keep on shopping. But if you do have an HP printer, one of the things you'll immediately notice is how great they are, by-and-large, at the job of reproducing color. So good have been the models released in the last two years, in fact, that it's actually quite difficult for the average layperson to see the difference between work completed on this and similarly high-contrast paper made by Xerox or other, more traditional paper manufacturers. So then the question becomes, why would you spend so much money for 200 sheets of this paper, when you could elsewhere get equally bright paper at higher quantities for a lower price?I'm still not sure of the answer to that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small","review":"Its suppose to be 36C but it is not a 36.

The keyboardist,Mark Sherkus, who plays a myriad of sounds is icing on the cake-sweetly & perfectly in and out. appropriatly.

I give it two stars for the idea behind it but only two stars because of the severe design flaw. As other reviewers have stated weight on top of the unit will keep the mouse from \\"running\\". Upon further tweaking it is next to impossible to get the center sufficiently pulled away to allow unrestricted movement without a heat source to allow for greater flexibility in the pulling of the center. Save your money or take it back and buy a sturdier unit whether for more money or a smaller one for the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moves too fast","review":"The mouse moves about 90mph and confused my cat as to how to see it much less catch it. Then he put his paw in there and it stopped easily, then when he let go it was just a blur again. He likes it better with no battery and swats it around from time to time. He doesn't use the top for clawing either even with catnip sprinkled on it - so I don't know; I wish someone would invent a motorized mouse that he could chase around the house - That's something he would love! He needs a real challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most effective trap in the market! Must buy if you have mice.","review":"I tried six other kinds of traps including the basic traps, victory traps, glue traps, etc. I think this is by and far the best engineered and most effective trap out there. Easy to set, it's actually reusable with the setting bar on top so you never have to touch trapping bar, very low risk of snapping yourself, and the bait area is the only sensitive area which is what you want! After 6 months of using other traps and watching glue traps get knocked around but not catching anything in them and watching peanut butter bait consistently disappear, I nearly gave up. But after my first day using these traps I caught one (so I had to immediately jump on Amazon to review the trap!) and am happy my place might be rodent free in a few days. Very, very happy with this trap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does Not Miss","review":"Amazon, excellent service as usual. Snap-E mouse trap is the easiest and most reliable trap i have ever used.

Elizabeth doesn't think so!","review":"Guy Sanford has three kids, one smelly dog and horrible taste in clothes. He also has eyes for Elizabeth Louden, a woman he'd be crazy to chase. She seems cold and aloof until he begins to thaw her icy exterior. Beneath it he finds a warm woman who's heart is her most beautiful feature.Templeton does a great job of portraying a relationship that includes a pre-made family. The kids act like kids. They fight, they whine and they wormed their way into Elizabeth's heart, as well as mine. Guy is a man trying to do everything and frequently falling short. But he picks himself up and just keeps on trying. The love and tenderness he has with his children and with Elizabeth is the mark of a true hero in my book. Watching the relationship between Guy and Elizabeth overcome the odds and flourish was a true reading pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth $2.00","review":"This product works except that with the volume turned all the way up,I could barely hear even when I tried it on 2 different AT&T cordless phones and a Panasonic cordless phone.

Great service is not going to work if you sell the customer junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"feature packed but inconsistant","review":"I bought this product right when it came out. I took the risk because it had every feature I was looking for and more. The Skyfi3 is easy to use in the home and on the road, and up to snuff as a portable device with the added accessories. The problem is...well there are many. The device often freezes when trying to boot up. The internal memory that stores your recorded XM content becomes corrupted on a regular basis. Sometimes the device doesn't know how to recognize the car dock and freezes up. Sometimes the screen doesn't even display any information even though sound is being pumped to your speakers. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"Do not buy this product! This unit will constantly lockup, then you have to wait for hours for the battery to drain as there is no way to reset it.

I bought it because I was impressed by the specs, namely the MicroSD slot and the ability to record songs for later playback. It felt to me like the ideal mix.Out of the box, it felt flimsy, and my hunch was right -- the unit died on me completely (won't turn on) about 18 hours after receiving it (only 2-3 hours of use). Two hours of troubleshooting with technical support has only confirmed it being busted. XM Radio has been unpleasant, to be polite, dealing with the matter (I bought it directly from them).

After two years it too has failed. Won't retain preset channels, reboots for no reason and then loses all presets. User interface menus are clunky, murky and non intuitive. Whoever programmed this should find another career. Am going to another vendor as Delphi has clearly dropped the ball on this and the myfi units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great unit when it works...","review":"If you don't mind a unit that works when it wants to, and not when you want it to, this might be the one for you. I have never had a piece of electronic equipment that was so quirky. Trouble is, I can never reach the point that I will toss it, because tomorrow it might decide to work. It is the kind of equipment you mght give to someone you don't really like. It will drive them up the wall. I can't believe that they let this one stay on the market. It really gives Delphi a bad image and I would never select their gear again even over an unknown competitor.

When I answer the phone or leave my desk Ill pause the unit. Sometimes Ill build up to an hour of delay. Ill be listening and all of a sudden it jumps 40 minutes forward to the middle of a commercial and the worst part is IT WONT LET ME REWIND BACK!!The one and only good thing ill say is the screen is very bright and easy to read at night in my car.Overall this is a cheap unit.

The 2nd one was a good deal and we had accessories already in place in the truck and MC so I didn't want to buy all new accessories again. Bad idea - this one is just under 2yrs old and is starting to freeze up now. Reception/sound is great but I think the model itself has issues that the company knows about but won't address.

And it appears to do so by using cheap feeling components.However there are certainly no complaints about functionality. I've only had the unit a few days and it has done everything I wanted. I use it in the car to listen on my drive to and from work. After spending some time to find a station where I get the best reception I can say that this is as good, if not better, than my Skyfi2.The sound will never be as good as one that plugs directly into an aux port on your radio, even with the SureConnect. If you have the option to plug in directly, do it.(Update: I've had the unit a couple months now. The buttons on the car adapter and remote are quite finicky. All too often I try to select a station but it moves to somewhere else in the menu. The system is also quite slow to start when I've got a lot of mp3 on the SD card. The lowest volume is also too loud for me -- I had to use earphones with an embedded volume control.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as advertised","review":"After 3 years of enjoying Delphi's MyFi, I had to replace it. The SkyFi3 was my gamble and it did not pay off. The reviews were mixed but, I chose to try this model. Within the first hour after activation, I realized that the FM transmitter did not work then it locked up. Exactly as reported by other reviewers. It did work with the hard antenna connection but, this is impractical for home stereo units or with other vehicles. The following morning it locked up again after just a few minutes of use. Without a reset button or removable battery, you must wait for the battery to die before you can get it to work again. Don't waste your time or $$ on this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to review when frozen","review":"So far I've got it to turn on just long enough to find out the FM transmittor is completely worthless.

Worthless device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design and quality","review":"I have bought the unit t use in my car. Delphi claims being an expert in automobile electronic.however, the device is classical example how not to design car electronic. A lot bill and whistles but lucking of basic functionality:1. Works only when plugged in. Battery is for... actually, I did not get what for. To use it as a MP3 player? So, if you need you plag in hte car for somehting else - you cannot use radio.2. Complex and fancy interface. Absolutely not designed to work by sense. Sorry, but I have to look at road, not at the monitor.3. A lot of other small inconveniences.4. And finally, simply poor quality. From the beginning it was very noise when connected via AUX 3 mm plug and after a year it simply died on me. It is a software problem - it went in a strange state and I cannot even reset it. Turning off power would help - but it has battery I cannot remove.

Overall, the drum machine sounds reserved, not hammering enough, but most boots from the period have a different sound mix to them, depending on the source, venue, etc.Definitely recommended to hear these songs removed from the studio, even though the band never advocated any boots (didn't think they were special)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I used to appreciate Taylor's work because of those almost inert portraits, until I read that the only thing she does is buying old portraits on ebay or flea markets to scan them and add color and other stuff to create their \\"surreal\\" images, so I think today's critics really don't care much and celebrate almost everything even when is not an original work.Besides that, the first half of the book is dedicated to interviewing a dozen of taylor's fans -including her husband- who leaves clear statement of how a great artist she is, and the second part features her work with maybe 3 examples of how she did them, in a very superficial way.If you get this book based on the title, you will be very very disappointed, even more if you really think in what some people call 'art\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Digital Art Book of the Year","review":"Maggie Taylor is one of the most interesting artists working digitally today.

You need to remember what a Master Class is. It is not a technique class. There are other classes/books for this.A Photoshop Master Class, like a concert piano master class, is not intended to help you learn where to put your fingers (or click your mouse). It's intended to communicate the art, attitude, personality, motivation, approach, emotion, intent... of the artist. Yes, it is specific to the intrument, Photoshop or Piano, but it's not about the instrument.If you approach this and other Master Class books with this in mind, you won't be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a bargain!","review":"These work great for watching movies without disturbing anybody at odd hours.

This is one of those books that takes your breath away because of the quality of the writing, the unusual premise, the well-plotted story, and the marvelous characters.Carroll's writing is one of the finest in any genre; it is bold, insightful, and arresting, with exactly the right blend of humor, passion, angst, hope, and danger. The author has created what may be the most unique family in all romance literature, and readers are introduced to the magical St. Legers in a way that can only be described as perfect.The characters, the setting, indeed the entire story, will stay with you long after you have read it.

The reader will not be disappointed in the end. Anatole is all that one would wish in a leading character. Readers will be delighted to find that the herione Madeline has a brain, as well as beauty.

I kept hoping . . . and hoping . . . but finally I realized that there is a lot of froth here, but not much substance. Even Cornwall didn't feel like Cornwall, sorry to say.

It unveils the nuances that enabled Arnie to be the man who hoisted TV golf on his shoulders and elevated the game to the status it enjoys today. The book is well-balanced in that it reveals Arnie's roots, both golf-wise and developmental, growing-up in Latrobe PA and his conflicted relationship w/his father, Deacon Palmer. Arnold's love of life, fierce competitiveness,and his charsimatic personality are all thoroughly revealed in this terrific book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book by the foremost gentleman of golf","review":"Arnold candidly describes his life-long love affair with golf and its great traditions. Even a non-golfer will enjoy his lessons about sportsmanship and life in general. I especially savored the stories about his friendships with the U.S. presidents since Ike.

The cast includes such characters as The Princess, Necktie Ninja, pantsless Samurai, unloved lady ninja, Elvis Samurai, The Evil Queen, the old lady who tears her own face off, and a bevy of poisonous women.

The plot of the movie was based on a character that starts things, but never follows through. The romance of the movie did not have a foundation and the intimacy felt forced and unnatural. Things just sort of happened out of no where and the plot never had a true meaning or resolution to the events. A series of events took place and the events never led to anything. I don't want to give the story away, so I won't go into too much detail. It felt like I watched someone go to the grocery store, meet a cashier, they talked and got to know each other, and then they went on with their lives as they were before they met.

If you're in doubt, please read \\"Lovecraft At Last\\" by Willis Conover. In that book, Lovecraft admits to one of his correspondents that the Necronomicon was a made-up book. Still, Lovecraft's fiction was so powerful that they were able to conjure a non-existent book into existence! The seals and sigils and spells in the book are rather comical to anyone who knows much of the history of magic in the west, but the essay at the beginning of the book is rather interesting, though unconvincing. the author tries to relate ancient Sumer with Aleister Crowley with H.P. Lovecraft. I think it is this introductory essay which has given the book so much of it's appeal.

Far too many people have wasted valuable time and energy that could be better spent empowering their lives and bringing blessings to themselves rather than wasting their time by attempting the practices in this book.

I've read Lovecraftian books before and been quite amused, but this book plainly states in the introduction that Lovecraft himself denied the existence of the Necronomicon. He just made it all up to sell books, and I dare say that's what happened here, too. I should say that I believe in magic and power and such as that, but I tried several of the invocations listed in the Necronomicon with no results whatsoever. In a sense, the book does provide some insight into Sumerian and Chaldean (Babylonian) mythological background, but surely there are far more reliable sources for this information.

Shame on him for making such romantic and melodramatic drool. Even Heston and Gardner are not on the top of their games.

And then there's bad toupe-wearing Charlton Heston, cast as Gardner's husband, who has little time for his wife but plenty of time for his French-accented lover (whose name I don't even want to attempt to spell right now; just look at the credits). Right-wing nut Heston isn't exactly Moses in this, is he? Evangelist Marjoe Gortner (remember him? You don't? It's just as well) plays a wacko (how fitting) who tends to get on people's nerves (especially the audience's).

The six children have many exciting adventures.I love the unique characters and Cornelia Funke's choice of setting and her style. She's descriptive, imaginative, and keeps readers guessing.

The author starts the story at a strange place, and uses back story to explain the origin of the thief lord. the titular character gets lost because of this. the story lacks the element of realism that strong fantasy has.also, the book is very predictable. i guessed who the thief lord was very early on.the whole story switched in the middle from being a book about a bunch of runaways and their stuggle to escape capture to being about a magical merry-go-round. this really comes out of left field and is very unappealing.

Thief Lord does none of that.The story, set in Venice, is simplistic, predictable and emphasizes free will on the part of orphans who exercise their free will to the detriment of others (although this is glossed over). It seems to glorify pick-pocketing, sees nothing wrong with spending counterfeit money, and finally settles on the charity of a couple of open-hearted adults to solve all the kids' problems.I see little of redeeming value in this work and I will not give it to my granddaughter.Bob GouldWellesley, MA"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all hype--this is NOT the next Harry Potter","review":"Pickpocketing, spending counterfeit money, and running away to live in an abandoned movie theater seem to be acceptable behavior for a child according to Cornelia Funke. I got so excited when I heard \\"The Thief Lord\\" was the next Harry Potter but, unfortunately, I found that it was all hype. This book runs on longer than a marathon with lots of unnecessary, stupid plot changes. Cornelia Funke introduces some pretty far-fetched ideas in a merry-go-round that can change a person's age, and two sensible adults who take in five juvenile deliquents. This book was, over all, a waste of five hours of my life and next time I hear that a book is the quality of Harry Potter, I hope I won't be so disappointed.

The story was just boring beond reason. There was not romance, no real action, and no major plot twists. It just seemed a complete, blah.

Mean while Prosper and Bo's aunt and uncle come to a detective who has never searched for human beings only important things that were lost by the tourists. The kids start to steal stuff and sell it for money in which they can by their food. One day the kids run across a deal with The Count in which they must steal something that will not only change the kids but even more people among them.

He accepts and eventally finds them, and begins to like them yada yada yada....You know what happens...They escape with the help of their friends...Everything turns out for the better...Typical Pre-Teen book...A review by artemis11"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good story","review":"I read this to see what all the clatter was about on this book. I had heard good things about it, and after reading it and falling asleep in the middle of several chapters, and forcing myself to finish, I found out that I did not really care for the story or the style it was written in. I found it hard to read and keep up with the different characters. It would get started on a fairly good part, and then the bottom would fall out, and I was left wondering where the stuff of the story actually was. The really good parts are few, and the rest drag on way too long. Now I know why my son did not finish. If it can't keep a 41 year old even mildly entertained, how can it keep a nine year old boy interested?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"This book starts out believable, but then ends improbably in a weird merry go round chase. It was too easy of an ending and not very interesting. Plus, side characters like Hornet deserved more attention. And, the main characters didn't really seem to act like kids...how many kids REALLY would run away to Venice? If magic was going to be involved, (and it's also weird to have it thrown in at the end in a world with out any other magic) they should have been sent there somehow by magic. That at least would make it more interesting. If you want to read a GOOD Italian fantasy, read Stravaganza, The city of Masks. While not strictly set in Venice, it's just as good and way more engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thief Lord review","review":"i enjoyed reading this book and hearing tales of fantastic thefts, and dramatic lies. i liked the realistic deep gun blowing feel of the characters in some of the most devastating events, from being caught by police to being forced out of your home.At first i disliked the fact that the author brought magic into this epic tale, but that slowly carved itself into the story making it better than first expected. The detail and description of most things in this book seem to bring you away from reading the story and send you in to see life from the characters point of view until you realize it and you continue reading the book. All together I'd rap this up as a pretty good book and reccomend it to anyone who enjoys reading sneaky fantasy books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drew btownballer goin to Duke to be like JJ Reddick","review":"I think this book is actually a very good mystery book. I think there is no way you will like this book if you dont enjoy some mystery. I also believe you will find this book amusing by the language that these kids are using in this book.This book is based off of two kids who ran away from their home. They ran away because their mother had just died and their aunt wanted to take the younger one Bo with her. Which made the older one Prosper very upset so he influenced his 5 year old brother to run away to Venice, Italy; and they did so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a good book for a younger audience. The characters are engaging and engage in activities that the younger set would find interesting. For those of us who have read Ray Bradbury, however, it is very disappointing that a big part of the plot relies on something he has already done much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent story, poor execution","review":"I picked up the Thief Lord after hearing so many comparisons to it and to Harry Potter. After finishing it though, I realized that the two books/series could not be further apart. Harry Potter books are successful because the characters and relationships are so well thought out and, while the magic may be fantasy, the relationships seem real. In this book, the story almost never strays from real life into fantasy, except in the development of the actual characters. The main character, Victor, is almost a characature of a dumb detective, and is never even believable as that. His relationship with the kids who are the focus of the book borders on the rediculous and later development of a \\"relationship\\" between him and a female characer comes from nowhere, with no build up. No one is really believable as a real life character.I give it 2 stars though because the most central character, the city of Venice, was described and included so well in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairy Tale Under the Guise of Fantasy","review":"I have been a long time lover of epic fantasy and suspense novels and I must say that this was a bit of a disappointment. It started out good, with two young runnaways, a gang of child theives (modern Robin Hoods, as I see them) but as you neared the end my attention started to slack away as the novel started to feel an awul lot like a volume of Fairy Tales. I kept expecting pixies to jump out any minute!I will admitt that this book had its good parts. It was clear that it had been well planned and it was written well, the charecters were great (and the secret of Spicio came as a huge suprise, hint, hint) but if you are looking for an epic fantasy/adventure novel, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"snoozer","review":"This books was SLOW.

The only reason I finished this book was so I wouldn't feel so bad for spending the money I did on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thief Lord","review":"I loved this book, it was very exciting and the characters were very well thought up. One of the main ideas of the book is how kids always want to be grown up and adults always want to be kids, Prosper wants to be old enough to take care of Bo and the Thief Lord wants to be treated like an adult. This book was written very well, it's been my favorite for a long time (a long with Harry Potter). I think that Cornelia Funke is a very good writer."},{"rating":"2","title":":)","review":"...THE THIEF LORD by Cornelia Funke is a very nice story that stands on its own...it was a fast read, although I am a bit above the target age, so that might have been why. The descriptions of Venice were great. Most of the characters were likeable without being perfect, something that is very hard for most authors to pull off. My only problem was that the \\"secret\\" of the merry-go-round was not that original--just read SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES by Ray Bradbury after you read THE THIEF LORD, and you'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE the story. Add it to your library!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this story. I listened to it on audio cds in the car and found myself taking the \\"long way\\" to hear more of the story. I'm completely impressed with the writing and creativity of the author. I like that it was completely unpredictable. I felt all emotions... It's a great mixture of adventure and it's pretty scary in some parts. Definately kept me interested from beginning to end. I also really enjoyed the narrator. In fact, I loved the story because of the narrator! Great character voices, etc. I give it 2 thumbs up!! A must have for your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good begining but near end it got boring","review":"that is all I have to say. I never even finished the book it was too boring.

I could just here the Dora the Explorer theme song in my head as I was reading it....do do do do do dora do do do do do dora dora dora dora the explorer......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Great","review":"I thought this book was too slow paced and the characters never were faced with a big challenge. They hardly got in trouble, they would get close, but they always escaped, so there wasn't a thrilling moment where you just HAD to know what happened next. Though the story is slow, the things that happen are pretty interesting, even if the author doesn't make it quite that exciting. The Thief lord(character not book)reminded me a bit of Artemis Fowl come to think of it(except not as good)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Captivating","review":"I found the beginning of the book to be interesting, but it got really terrible in the middle. The story was not engaging, the characters not especially interesting, and the translation was rough in places. Yes, Venice is beautiful, and the scenery was used well, but the magic was very contrived, unlike the ubiquitous magic in the Harry Potter series, or the underworldly magic in Artemis Fowl.Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Bland...","review":"I began reading the book with great expectations, but was quickly let down. For whatever reason (don't know if it's the translation or the author's overall storytelling), the book never catches fire. What should be a grand adventure just falls flat. For all that goes on, Funke just can't seem to generate any real sense of excitement or danger necessary for an adventure story, nor does she manage to envoke any real sense of wonder necessary for a fantasy story. It's a sweet story, but so bland in it's execution that it fails to satisfy. The only thing the book really did for me was spark an interest in Venice. Young readers less jaded than I may find the book entertaining, but for me it was, more often than not, a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read a million books like this one","review":"Everyone was saying that this was a really good books and that I just HAVE to read it or I'll die, but personally, I think it wasn't that great. I mean, it's your basic story about two orphans who run away and join a gang when their parents die. They have to steal something or else they will be turned into the police, blah, blah... Its only unique element is the magical merry-go-round. I won't say anything about that except: weird, but a little funny. You won't be missing out if you don't read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey that changes their course of destiny","review":"In the magical underworld of Venice, Italy, there are hidden canals and crumbling rooftops. This is a novel about Prosper and Bo, two little boys escaping their awful guardians. They meet a mysterious \\"Thief Lord\\" who has a dark secret, that will soon embark them on a journey that changes their course of destiny.My favorite part is when the Thief Lord's dark secret is revealed, and trust is being weighed between him and his group of friends. This is an adventurous fantasy book but at the same time teaches about friendship, loyalty, and trust. Without one adventure or the other, it won't make such of a good book.I think 5-7th graders should read this book mostly because it teaches about friendship and who or when to trust. Especially when growing up, you would still need some adventure in you but at the same time know what's happening in life. -- Chou-Chou"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I ever read!","review":"I really like this book because it always wants to make you read on.

The kids who lived there were abandoned by their parents or ran away. This book takes place in Venice where Scipio steals merchandise for money to make a living for the children. They try their hardest not to get caught by a private detective named Victor, but they do. Although Bo and Prosper are trying to protect themselves from any harm at all,Prosper and Bo are still getting tracked down by their Aunt Esther and their Uncle Max. Our favorite part in this book is when Skipio,Prosper,Bo,Hornet,and Riccio were all going to the island were Barbosa was and find something mysterious and extraordinary and touching in alot of ways.

Not having to go to school? Imagine you and your friends having a hideout with a bathroom with running water!! What else could you ask for?Some homeless boys find shelter in a movie theater. It's more like a hideout actually. They're not desperate and unfortunate, they're more like street urchins. A \\"Thief Lord\\" brings them items that 'he steals' and the kids bring them to a pawn shop to exchange for money. That's how they buy their food (and books).Some of the kids want to become like the Thief Lord, until they get tangled up with some adults and the Thief Lord's identity is broken.Villanous adults are actually kids at heart. This is a playful, uplifting story. No heartache, no issues. A little bit of fantasy.Some of my 6th graders had enjoyed the book, I had to check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of The Thief Lord","review":"This was a wonderful book. It had well-developed characters who changed constantly throughout the story as a result of significant life events. The plot was well-structured and contained sufficient conflict and suspense to hold my interest. There were quite a few surprises that I was impressed with. The time and place is also suitable to the storyline.This story is about a group of orphans in beautiful Venice that seem to be forgotten and all alone yet they find strength in one another. You feel as if you know each of the children and can feel all of the emotions that they are experiencing. You can see how they overcome their problems. The story is believable and touching to me as a mother and a teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thief Lord disappoints","review":"The book starts out strong, with engaging characters who made me want to learn more about them, and a dramatic but well-motivated conflict. The momentum carries on almost throughout the book. Yet though the characters are strong and diverse enough to come to grip with these challenges, the author solves all of their problems -- literally by magic -- at the last moment, robbing the reader of the chance to fully enjoy the book. Some other books by the same author - including Dragonrider - are much more consistent, but I advise that you shy away from The Thief Lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't compare...disappointing!","review":"Thief Lord doesn't compare well to similar books.

I don't recommend this game if you expect to get to the end of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the three bucks I spent on it.","review":"This game is not fun at all. It is tedious, boring, and has no replay at all. The commercials make it look like a paper doll type game, but in truth, it's a puzzle of sorts. You've given goals and you have to fulfill them, but sometimes what they want is counter-intuative. One level has you making a pale-eyed Scandanavian model dressed in warm winter clothing. But they want green eyes. Most people would assume blue or brown, but if my Aunt hadn't suggested green on a lark, I would have been stuck until I tried all color combinations.To be fair there is one nice thing about it. Mainly, when you scrwe up, the game tells you where you screwed up and why. You get a list of goals; model, makeup, eyes, cloth, ect., and it tell you which one is wrong. But you still have to go through the entire stage again. All in all, when the best thing about the game is when it tells you how you failed, that's the sign of a bad design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"First there is no story line.

I used the book to help me decide on our highchair, crib, crib mattress, monitor, even the baby food! They recommend where to spend for quality (i.e., the crib and car seat) and where you can save. Also, the ratings are a type of \\"consumer reports\\" for baby items, with feedback gathered from actual parents as well as the authors.

I would still suggest that you use common sense and shop around....you can find good deals if you are a good shopper....and the authors should come up with a better title rather than suggesting that everyone is a dumb shopper and needs their help.

This book is for the \\"posh\\" baby, not for the real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Anyone","review":"I bought this book because my knowledge of cars is very limited, and I needed the subject matter to be explained with a whole lot of pictures. That's exactly what I got, a very good introductory book with great graphics. Even though the book is pretty old (early 80's), the maintenance instruction part is still very useful. Overall, very pleased with the purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommand","review":"I got this card few days before, the memory comes with -4ns DDR(250MHz), but it can hardly overclock. I could only OC this memory to 260MHz. What's more, the card is very unstable. My windows crushed few times during 2 days working. Finally, i decided to return it to Amazon. Won't buy this brand anymore, it looks so cheap"},{"rating":"2","title":"Devoted Helprin fan","review":"I enjoyed this collection of Helprin's stories although I am a bigger fan of his novels, with the exception of the newest one which I found a big too predictable. I love the way Helprin writes. I don't usually read short story collections because I find that I cannot invest in the characters too much which is why I have given \\"A Dove of the East\\" four stars instead of five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delicate material, install with caution","review":"This material is soft and will not take much torque before the square drive head becomes twisted through by its driver. Do not use without pre-drilling the wood, and lubricating the shank of the screw with soap or another lubricant. I would not be surprised to find that this stainless screw will rust. Almost useless. Find another stainless wood screw source.Lucky Reader"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough for the exam","review":"It helps summarize the course, but that's about it. The practice tests were a lot easier in the book than on the actual exam, and the summaries were a bit too broad, only about 75% of the actual test was covered on the summaries. I recommend taking a lot of practice tests for review on the objective part, and then reading a broad summary of the course for the essay questions to get a good overview for what they are trying to ask."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good review book.","review":"PR has done a fairly good job with Cracking the AP U.S. History. The review chapters are good summaries to go along with the lengthy textbook readings. The practice exam contains questions that are very similar to real AP questions. However, there is only one practice test. The AP European History book from PR has two tests, so why doesn't the APUSH book? Also, do not rely solely on the PR review chapters to prepare for the test. Our school sold us the AMSCO APUSH text. It is a detailed, easy-to-read review of APUSH with lots of realistic practice APUSH questions. That is the best book to have for APUSH."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],W={key:0},M={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(i(!0),a(y,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(i(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(i(),a("span",M,"Loading...")):(i(),a("span",W,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(N,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-127902ea"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/21.md","filePath":"guide/21.md"}'),B={name:"guide/21.md"},P=Object.assign(B,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(i(),a("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
