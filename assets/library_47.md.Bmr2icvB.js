My wife loves reading more than I do. Not only will I buy 2, but I will probably end up spending an additional $300 on content per year.It's good business. It's good marketing.

Amazon should not have this power in the first place. Until they give it up they will be tempted to use it, or they could be forced to by governments or narrow private interests.

The kindle works great and the experimental features are awesome! Bought another for my mother on Mothers day just because of all the things you can do. I highly recommend this product. The only down side is that when reading a book, there are no page numbers and so sometimes it is hard to know what \\"page\\" you are on. You only know what percentage of the book you read. But the bookmarking, the \\"last page read\\" feature, and adding margin notes are awesome. It may not be the item if you need to look at detailed pictures as you can only blow up the picture x1 magnification. The images are crisp thou (in b/w).

I am hoping that future improvements will allow lighting, color and an easier way to scroll back to earlier pages. Some sort of touch screen would be great. After using an I Phone, buttons other than for typing seem outdated.

Without the books that I want to read, what good is the kindle? I would pay more than $9.99 just to be able to get the books that I want to read.

For the most part it is wonderful, very easy to order and download books, navigating within the device is simple, it is very portable and has a long battery life. The only problem I have is with maps or sometimes photographs they are very light and difficult to see. The page breaks can also be annoying. Particulary at the start of a page, you will sometimes have the first letter appear alone on one page and the rest of the paragraph and/or page on another. The word hyphenation is often oddly placed also.

I bought a leather cover to protect mine and it also adds bulk so that it feels like you are reading a much heavier book. I have taken my kindle everywhere and it is very easy to put in suitcases and briefcases. The battery lasts much longer than I expected. I have used the basic web, and it is ok where I live, but the Kindle is a reader not a computer, so to me it doesn't matter. Would I by another Kindle? YES.

One improvement item I could suggest is to show the actual page number. Often the author of the book I'm reading now refers to certain page number. I don't seem to be able to see that anywhere on the screen. Another improvement is to provide a greater magnification function. Some tables have such small fonts, and one level magnification does not help me. One last item is on the ruggedness of the buttons. The right-hand Next Page thumb button is already uneven. I do not abuse any electronic product, so I suspect other people might have reported similar problem already.I'm happy with my Kindle 2.

The wireless download of a book in about 60 seconds ready to read is brilliant. The text is easy to read and choice of larger texts very good (especially if I forget my glasses!!!!).

Once the purchase of a book is completed, the book appears on the Kindle in seconds. I am not in a metropolitan area and yet the Kindle had no trouble downloading the ebooks. One negative was the conversion process for pdf files. There is a small fee to have the documents formatted to the Kindle and the resulting images were barely readable on the Kindle. Also, there is no way to organize the books on the Kindle, you must scroll through all the books to find the one you want to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"FAST! EASY TO READ.

Finished my first book on it, and now, started a second one. The only negative comment I would have, is that for us Canadian residents, there are some books that are not available to us, which is a bit disappointing.

I called customer service, and they agreed to replace my Kindle. Kindle #2 was defective from the beginning. The screen saver would not work, and there was major screen burn-in. It was obviously a refurbished product. I again called customer service, and they agreed to replace Kindle #2. I now have Kindle #3, but with a 30 day warranty. It is most likely another refurbished product, which worries me because that means it already had problems and was sent back by someone else.If I thought that this was an isolated problem, I wouldn't be so worried, but my mother is on Kindle #2, and my sister is on Kindle #3. I paid $359 for this item. 5 months later, they dropped the price by $100.00, which wouldn't be so bad, if they were of superior quality. But they aren't. I am very worried that in the near future, I will have a $359 paperweight on my desk.

The only problems I have encountered was the screen froze once which was a quick fix my resetting it. Also I wish the Kindle had more titles in science fiction, fantasy, and history but other than that it has great prices and many major titles. I wish they had the Harry Potter series on Kindle but that's not Amazon's fault. I love reading my books on Kindle more than a regular book which I found surprising because I was afraid I would miss the turning of pages. Its very light and I can read faster by pressing next than turning pages. Another wish list for the Kindle would be a built in light to read in the dark as well as color pages for maps and even just for regular pictures.

The display is exactly like reading from a paper book, and 'turning' the page is as easy as a pushing a button. Ergonomically, it sits comfortably in either hand and there's none of that clumsy one hand page turning when I'm trying to read AND carry a drink while walking (HEY, if you read as much as I do, you KNOW what a hassle that can be). Downloading books is a snap. I prefer looking for books on a computer to browsing w/ the Kindle though. I like to move around and click different links and reviews and that can take a lot of maneuvering w/ the 5th key. Also, there are several books that aren't available on Kindle yet, but I'm sure they'll come along in time.I do recommend buying a case. I got the case that becomes a stand since I read in restaurants or at tables quite often; very convenient! All in all, if you're as big a bibliophile as I am, I'd say go for it!

I got the Nook, which looked great, however it would not even connect to register in the small rural community where I live (Olton, TX, 50 NW of Lubbock, TX)The cell phone service it used won't work here. At least 3 people in my town have Kindles and love them. So I got the Kindle. Since they purchased their Kindles, Amazon has changed to \\"Global\\" Kindle that uses AT&T cell phone service. It worked part of the time, and minimally. The USA Kindle that a local resident owns has displayed 3G service here (Sprint)-not my \\"improved\\" device. I asked if I could change for the USA version, no I cannot. A tech from Amazon thought he could switch cell providers for my device, but it is a hardware issue. It goes back today. Lesson: KNOW what cell service works where you live and verify Kindle uses that service. I believe only AT&T works with the Global Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exchange rates","review":"I've seen the Kindle and I love it. Great idea, well executed. I've decided to wait to get one rather than get one of the other readers on the market as I thought it would really be worth my while. So now as an Amazon UK customer I was delighted to see I could finally get my hands on one. So I go through the ordering pages expecting to see a few extra charges because it has to come from the US, but what I was not expecting was the price of the unit itself. At the time of writing this, the US price is $259 which google tells me is about 155. This doesn't match very well with the listed price of over 322. With shipping and 'Import Deposit' it comes to 390. Or about $650.

Now I either need to pull an adapter with me all over, or charge from my PC.You manage to collect tax for the right country when ordering. But sending a 110V US plug to Europe?

The wireless download handles the newspapers distribution problem just fine. (You need to allow the customer to throw away the parts of the newspaper that s/he doesn't read to minimise the download costs) And you need to allow the newspaper/periodical customer to specify what kind of ad-space that the customer considers of most value, so that the advertiser will get good value for their advertising dollar.Amazon.com has no darned newspapers or magazines because they have set up a newspaper and magazine distribution system that does not respect the organization's economic needs.I can buy a Kindel with the distribution cost savings for a newspaper or magazine. That pays for the Kindle.The newspaper are \\"taters'\\"in the sale of a Kindel. The books are \\"gravy\\" for the customer - but not for Amazon.com or the publishers.David L.

I say barely because the electronic ink just does not work the magic one would hope for. Moderately dark text on a moderately light background remind me of a cheap paperback book from the 1960s, rather than the crisp post-modern e-text of today. Internet access, although in \\"beta\\" was not even sketchy. Archaic, hard to manipulate navigation buttons and a QWERTY keyboard that is too big to thumb and too small to type on, also contribute to the 2 star rating. I sold my Kindle, barely used, on Amazon for about 1/2 of what I paid for it. Won't try again until: 1) Crisper, readable, full-color, adjustable text is standard. 2) Internet access is brought kicking and screaming into the 21st century and it is possible to access e-mail without having to use a recipe book. 3) Better navigation and typing tools are developed.

The Kindle2 is a success of course and I think that as more people get a chance to hold one (I'm frequently asked about it when I'm travelling), they'll be sold once they see it. The only fly in the ointment is the pressure that I see the publisher are putting on Amazon and other ebook vendors to raise their prices. Don't they realize enormous savings in terms of printing, retail store placements, in-store promotions, merchandiser's fees etc.?

It also means that a friend who took my advice to buy a Kindle for his daughter over a \\"hotter\\" competitor is pretty annoyed with me. I've been had.

Book samples are a great idea to help you make a decision to purchase a book and of course free books are also a big plus.I hear about Amazon's disputes with the publishers and I think this is a normal evolutionary process that will eventually determine a true market value.

It is also nice to have a dictionary where to just put the cursor on the word and you have the definition without having to flip a page!There are two downsides to the kindle. One is the fact that there are no page numbers and that makes it very difficult to cite books in the MLA format for graduate school. Secondly, it does not have a light already on the kindle, which would be very convenient. Color would also be a good addition.The Kindle is the best gift that I have ever received.

It is really one of the worst gifts I have ever received. The buttons are clunky, the 3G and internet is awful, and the books and subscriptions are way overpriced. If you have a library, usually the card is free and you can get almost any book ever printed (audio or otherwise)within a few days. Until this Kindle thing (and probably any of the other digital readers) becomes more refined, I'd not waste the up front cost and the cost of the digital books. In summary - way over priced for the product and the content, slow, and poorly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and slower","review":"This takes forever to download a new purchase or retrieve something from your archived items. To get downloads I leave the Kindle on, wireless on and plugged in anytime I'm not reading it. It takes days, not 60 seconds or less like my old Kindle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VA Hospital use","review":"I go to the VA Hospital a great deal and like to read. I put a lot of thought into buying this...I bought it and a week later it was $50.00 cheaper...just my luck. You cannot use it in the dark. You have to buy a case for it just for safety. It charges either with a wall socket or computer with a cord provided. Still learning how to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"Can't put it down. Usually read two or three books simutaneously - history, crime/action/adventure, fantasy - and now I can carry them all at once. I really enjoy/utilize the search feature when I want to review somehing I read earlier on in a book I'm reading. I use Windows Notes to download/tranfer my favorite poems right off the net. Didn't put 5 stars just because I am a lefty and I wish toggle was on other side."},{"rating":"2","title":"kindle rocks","review":"Love, love, love my kindle. What I don't love is the high price of many of the ebooks. I have downloaded many free books but cannot afford to pay more than $9 for a book. If McMillian gets their way I will probably be forced back to the used bookstore for many of my favorite reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice device and selection, but multiple failures","review":"I bought this as a gift for someone else because of the selection and variety of ebooks in categories they like. However; within the first day using it, the screen failed, prompting a return. Now; a second device has failed within a couple days of her using it; and this replacement is costing. The devices have gone to the house and the pool; not having been dropped or gotten wet at all. Not happy with two in a row having issues, kinda dissappointed in the QA process for the hardware."},{"rating":"1","title":"After replacement, still does not work","review":"First one I received was defective. The replacement was defective. No more Kindles for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle","review":"This was a gift and I would not have purchased it. It is quite convenient as I am a commuter/reader and am usually lugging a 1000pp book to and fro. The print is easy to read and downloding is painless, even for a technophobe. I do not understand why a KIndle version is more expensive than a printed one? I have downloaded some classics to get into the swing. I was a bit peeved that the price dropped a day after the present was given to me and Amazon has yet to make up the difference, even credits would be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item, high price and dropped a few days later....","review":"While I found this to be a wonderful item, it was pricy and the price dropped a few days after I purchased it. Barnes and Noble dropped their price thus Amazon followed suit...just goes to show you our wonderful capitalist system at work. Too bad they haven't dropped the larger version as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"REV OF KINDLE PURCHASE","review":"THANK YOU!

First time user."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great device, expensive books","review":"Love the Kindle, makes taking books to read very easy. It's light enough that I can slip it into my purse and really doesn't add that much weight.I do have one complaint, the books are too expensive, you would think since the publishers are not creating a physical book with the material costs and labor it would be much cheaper to distribute. I don't see why I should be paying the same cost for a book that is already out in paper back than if I went to a bookstore and bought the book itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle 2nd Generation","review":"I Received my kindle today.

She even gave me some extra accessories for the kindle for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Kindle with E-Ink","review":"I absolutely adore the convenience and readability of my Kindle 2 with 3G. I can download reading material anywhere without needing a wireless connection, and the contrast of the e-ink is as easy to read as a paperback- no matter what lighting. I've taken my Kindle to the beach and travel with it regularly. It is lightweight and easy to hold in a single hand. There is no glare in bright lighting conditions.The only complaint I have is that I use one of the early cases that has a metal hook which fits into the device. The Kindle has cracked where this case hooks into the body of the unit. I believe they've stopped selling these.I look forward to borrowing books for my Kindle from the local library. Thank you Jeff Bezos for revolutionizing my reading habit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Sneaky Problem","review":"I am what is called an early adopter. Because of this I was given a Kindle by my children for Christmas. I liked it so much that I bought one for my wife just a couple of months later.It kind of upset me that version one and version two were so close together. But then I suppose you want their best efforts at the time of purchase.We are currently in England and I just made a horrible discovery. It seems that you can charge the Kindle two from your computer just like they say. What they don't tell you is that the cable they send is special and will only work with the Kindle. I have several different camera cords and nothing fits. Guess where the special Kindle Cable is?? Back in the U. S. attached to the charger.Thenks genius engineers. I hope that you sell at least a half cozen extra chargers and cords."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Fragile!!!","review":"A simple tap on a door frame while walking thru my home broke the screen.

It is easy to navigate, light weight, fits in my purse and a great conversation piece. Downloading books is easy and very inexpensive. It holds a charge for a long time.The only drawback I can mention is that it isn't really easy to use with reference books. If you are like me and are used to thumbing through a reference book to find what you need, using a reference book on the Kindle 2 is cumbersome and time consuming.Definitely purchase a case for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clutter Free and Green!","review":"I absolutely LOVE my Kindle 2.Most of the recent reviewers have covered all of the major points when it comes to the kindle; it's use, battery life, and all its other amazing features, so I'm not going to bore you with another long review covering the same things. Instead, I would just like to say that my Kindle, which I have had for roughly 9 months now, is a life saver. I am a book-aholic and have hundreds of books in my home. Now, while there are some books that I still order hard copies of (frequently used as reference materials), the Kindle has enabled me to avoid overfilling my house with books, along with making traveling with a book super easy. And what's even better, if I finish the book while I'm on the road, a few simple clicks and I have a new one at my fingertips.So, I'll leave with that. The Kindle 2 is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Deletes Important Text","review":"Purchase a copy of Bob Greene's MANAGING DIABETES and the Kindle does NOT produce critical text information in side bars/boxes. This defect renders the purchase of the Kindle version useless, and required us to purchase a hard copy from Borders.I am so sorry that I bought this ill conceived and under performing product!

My daughter loves to read and loves using her Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"wonderful device, until...","review":"The Kindle was everything that I had hoped that it would be, until it began to malfunction. Despite a full battery, every few minutes the Kindle would suddenly return to the main menu while I was trying to read a book. Worse, occasionally it would completely reset, coming back up with a blank menu that slowly repopulated; it was more than a minute from when the device reset until I could see my books again. When I returned to my book I would find that it had lost my place and I would have to go searching, page after page, to pick up where I had left off. It so completely broke the book-like experience that I had to return it. I would give it 1 Star if not for the truly delightful few days before its malfunction. Perhaps the next-gen one will more stable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading experience","review":"As a person with terrible eyesight and enormously thick glasses...the Kindle 2 has dramatically improved my reading experience.

Thank you, Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good thing!","review":"I love my Kindle, I read on it everyday. Wish I had one years ago, so glad Jeff came up with it. The light weight is great and doesn't cramp your hands, while holding it, and its easy on your eyes. Best thing since slice pie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Kindle fan","review":"Love it! This is definitely the solution for those of us who read and travel. With the weight limits on flights getting more restrictive - this device is an absolute must. I just returned from two weeks in Europe and only needed to take the Kindle (instead of 20 books!)I purchased it just before I left and found it amazingly easy to figure out, to download books, to use, etc.The only slight negative - between the Kindle and paper books is that I can sometimes be guilty of flipping pages to find the ending - and it is much harder to do on the Kindle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle2","review":"This was better then I thought when I bought.

I absolutely love the convenience of being able to order a new release book immediately at a fraction of the cost. The Kindle is very user-friendly-easy on the eyes-just like a real book. I bought a nice black leather cover for it. I am just thrilled with my Kindle. Love it, love it, love it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift for my wife","review":"This was purchased for my wife. She is an avid reader. She can download new book releases as well as many other free books offered by Amazon for the Kindle. She loves it and the ease it is to use.

It is light and easy to read. The only issue I have is the range of books available. If you want to read the latest new releases do not buy a kindle. I have found my self reading authors I have never heard of which is good but I just can't buy books by my favorite authors.Take for example John Birmingham, one of my favorite Australian authors, his new book is available for US kindles but not international ones. Or, Stephen King or Micheal Connerly... The list is endless.The Australian Kindle bookstore says it has around 250k books available but Amazon really needs to review this list, there are so many duplicate titles that I would guess that there are a great many less titles than this available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Ordered Kindle as a birthday present for my dad.

Would prefer more reading space than rarely used buttons at bottom. Could be touch screen item on a menu screen. Also a SD card slot to increase memory would be nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for text, quite poor for maps and figures","review":"My first kindle book is \\"Day of Battle\\" by Rick Atkinson, a history of the WW2 Italian campaign. The kindle 2 displays text flawlessly, but the maps (crucial to understanding in a book like this) are absurdly poor, even using the magnification function. I checked out the print version of the book from the public library to view the maps, and found that it also contains many useful photographs, which are entirely missing from the kindle edition. I feel a kindle customer should be alerted when the book contains maps, photographs, or other content that displays poorly if at all on the kindle. The customer could then opt for the print edition. Perhaps Amazon could find some other way to deliver this content, such as an email to the kindle customer containing this content for display on a personal computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle","review":"Great product. The battery life is simply amazing. The compact size makes it easy to take anywhere. Downloading books is easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love I read. Many times I can fly through a book in a day. I was so excited a little over 2 years ago when I received my Kindle as a gift. It is definitely almost the perfect accessory. I can carry all of my books with me at one time, even though I'm usually reading 4 or 5 at a time. The only reason I say almost perfect is because the screen does not light up. This makes it very difficult to read at night. I did purchase the book light, but it is not the same. I do however like that I have the Kindle app on my phone, so I am able to read on that in bed and my books sync back and forth. I would recommend this product to book lovers, just make sure you also purchase the light!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated after returning 2 in less than 2 years","review":"I really love the portability of the Kindle. I love that I can have a wide variety of books to choose from, wherever I am. However, I am on my 3rd Kindle since Christmas 2010. In May of 2011, my first Kindle's screensaver froze. That was only 4 or 5 months later. So I contacted support and they sent another one. This past February, the replacement Kindle crapped out. I contacted support and got a replacement for the replacement. Now, today, there are lines on my 2nd replacement that won't go away. I contacted support, but I am out of warranty. I am not certain that I want to spend money on another device, if this is the kind of track record they have. I have the app on my phone and my computer, and I just might go with those. I am really bummed, cause I loved my Kindle, but I don't want to keep going through the same frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"kindle wireless reading device","review":"I am enjoying using my kindle. Wishes would be that I could access the table of contents on my books and that there was a wider selection of books to choose from. Several times I have been unable to get a book at the $9.99 price. I am still learning about how to use the kindle. If I get started on the wrong page, I seem to have to page through until I find my place. Maybe I am just not familiar enough with it. I would highly reccommend a Kindle for anyone who loves to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy!","review":"I absolutely love my Kindle II - Downloading books takes less than 60 seconds.

She was limited to a script and could not answer my question. She kept repeating herself, and eventually she agreed to transfer me to someone in the US after wasting my time for over a half hour. I will try the Barnes and Noble version for my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for computer savvy","review":"Being locked in to Amazon and only Amazon controlling what you can read, how it appears on the page, and how much you pay for it is really frustrating. I read books on my computer and cell phone, which aren't as nice to look at, but I can read anything I want--including library books.As a casual reader I tend to get books online, from the library, friends, used book stores, garage sales, etc. I cannot justify spending $250 for this gadget plus the $80 every time it needs a battery.I'm computer savvy enough to overcome the backup issues that Amazon has However, it is frustrating that this machine could do so much more but Amazon chose not to allow it.On the plus side, if you're a voracious reader and spend lots of money in bookstores, this could be for you. The display is very nice, easy to read, and light enough to carry."},{"rating":"1","title":"software updates","review":"beware of software updates.i updated my kindle 2 to a 2.3 version update and i can hardly use it now.it is so slow(5-10 minutes to get to home page).the features on the update are useless.i had to reset my kindle 40-50 times in the last 3 days.if you are considering an e reader you may want to look at a sony.i am now considering going back to paperback books but i will only buy from barnes and noble because amazon already ripped me off of 300 dollars for this crap kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low vision, beware","review":"I was very excited about this product when I first heard about it, but this didn't last long. I am a person with low vision (20/400) so I may be something of a special case. I used to be a BIG reader and the prospect of being able to read comfortably again was thrilling. Currently, the best format for me is to read HTML text online using the firefox browser which has nearly unlimited font enlargement (unlike MS IE). I reflow the text so it stays onscreen and I don't have to scroll back and forth on every line. I do this using a little software plug-in called platypus. Nothing like this is possible on the Kindle.The Kindle's 6 font sizes are woefully inadequate. Likewise the display technology shows great but but looks awful. Black letters on a gray background reduce readability even further. Combine these problems with the other short comings mentioned in other reviews and you have a poorly designed, poorly built, great idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Brother Control","review":"I was thinking of buying a Kindle, but not now. Amazon controls way too much of the product. If I buy something, I own it and I control it. However, Amazon proved that they can and will control what I buy, what I read, and all other data that comes with owning this product. They can delete, change, otherwise control the product without touching it. NO, Big Brother is not worth the money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing quality: It just stopped working","review":"The product is nice when it works, but it just stopped working.The main button will not respond to being pushed, meaning I can no longer access any of the books in the device"},{"rating":"1","title":"When the battery works its ok, only the battery is not long lived","review":"I like the kindle when the battery deems it will turn on. Maybe I just got a lemon. I had to return the kindle because the battery died. It wasnt easy to get a a replacement though. I reached an out source complaint department and found it difficult to say the least to explain that the batter died. She went through a long process reading from a manual trying all kinds of possible resolutions until she finally accepted the battery was not charging. A replacement was sent and I thought things were OK. But 6 months latter guess what the battery will not charge!!!! Now what do I now ? I am not sure they will do anything about it and I am not sure I want to go through the process. Maybe you will have better luck. I seem to have drawn the lemon. I have googled and found I am not the only one who has suffered this fate. In short I hope you have better luck.

I can only say that he loves his Kindle! I am gratified when I see him reading it every day. Finally a hit on the papa meter. The kindle seems to live up to it's hype. It performs as advertised and is an amazing device. It seems that the reading material could be a little less expensive, but everyone one is preserving their profit margin. It's ok I guess and certainly worth it to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware if giving as a gift!!!!","review":"I bought the Kindle for my wife as a Mother's Day gift, after getting the idea from a big Amazon ad campaign. One small problem -- they ship the device in a box that says KINDLE right on the shipping box!!This absolutely RUINED the surprise.Don't get me wrong - she's thrilled with the gift and loves the Kindle. But -- seriously, Amazon -- how about a wee bit of discretion, especially when the \\"give as a gift\\" check box is selected.For anyone thinking about this as a gift, make sure you ship it to a work or friend's address."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This is my first e-book reader, and I really enjoy it. I did a lot of research and comparisons before I purchased, and this seemed to be the right one for me. I would have to say; the most convenient feature is the ability to wireless download a book from anywhere (Whispernet). I love the fact that I do not have to sync to a pc or be at a wireless hotspot, it just works from anywhere, and it's extremely easy to use, that's what sold me on the kindle. I know this technology is still in its infancy, and has a lot of room for improvement, which will come with time, and new hardware/software releases, but it's a great way to store and read books, magazines, and news and save the planet at the same time. It is the future, and soon all of our reading material will be delivered in this or a similar format. I gave 4 stars, because like I said, it's early and will only get better, but in my opinion this is probably the best e-book reader you can buy right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love my Kindle","review":"Don't know how I ever lived without it.

I had compared the Kindle with Sony's e-reader and was really not sure, I made my final decision after talking to a few sales people who actually thought the idea of instant access to download books without a computer sounded like a no brainer if they were going to make a purchase. Wow, I am so glad that I made Kindle my choice, I never thought I would really need to worry about downloading my books without wires and computers but guess what I have and I love it. I can't wait for summer to enjoy this in the shade on a warm day. I have read about 4 boooks and have not had any problems. I'm not sure yet about the 2 week battery life.

A few weeks ago, she tried to use it and one corner on the upper right hand side is blocked out, therefore making reading impossible.Both she and myself spend a ton of money at Amazon with books, toys, and all of our gift shopping. I would imagine you only have a years warrantee on this item, but would hope an exception could be made to keep some good customers. A Kindle should last more than 18 months.

I had hesitations, thinking it would turn out to be just another unused gadget, but I use it all the time! So easy to download new books & handy to carry.

I had never liked reading from a screen but this device is amazing. I had to give away over 1000 books when I sold my house and moved to an apartment because of lack of storage space. I will never have that problem again! The controls are easy to use even for arthritic hands and the Kindle really does \\"go away\\" while you are reading. I would only change one thing. The background gray is a bit dark for my eyes. It would be nice if it was adjustable like the text size. Beyond that I can't find any fault. I hope someday it will come with a color screen, but whatever changes are made in the future it can only get better. I will be a customer for life - imagine being able to take your whole library to the doctor's waiting room!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"After a year or more of contemplating such an extravagant purchase, and 6 months of saving for it, I finally purchased my Kindle a little over 1 month ago.

I'm in love with my Kindle!I'm a writer who is always staring at my laptop screen, so I was afraid I'd have even more eye strain to deal with. However, the Kindle screen is very eye-friendly and I haven't had a bit of problems, even after reading for 2 hours at a time.The \\"ink\\" is clear, crisp, easy to read. The size is perfect for my smaller hands. The toggle button annoys me a bit, but not enough to lessen my love for this wonderful e-reader.I'm so glad I bought my Kindle and have purchased approximately 1 book per day in the 30 days I've had it. :-)Hooray for the Kindle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best gift I ever received.","review":"My husband gave me the Kindle for my birthday and it was the best gift he ever gave me (for my birthday).

I also like being able to increase the text size because I cannot see small print.Will the kindle prices on the more popular books decrease?I would like to know how I can locate other Kindle owners in my area in order to establish a \\"book club\\".

I take advantage of the free books if they are books I would like to read but for the most part, I order the ones that I want. I love being able to get the new releases as soon as they are available at a fraction of the cost. My only complaint is now I wish I had more time to spend with my kindle!

I especially like the sample option. It gives me a chance to see if I've read this book before or it's the type of story that's going to grab my interest.I feel, however, it should be easier to get a review or synopsis before I need to get a sample. For example when I click on the book picture it should link me up with a blurb about the book such as you see on the dust jacket of a actual book.I bought the Kindle mainly for travel.

The reviews gave me much to ponder about purchasing a Kindle. I like the idea of reading all the books & not having to build a library onto my house to store the books. Then I read, I cannot keep the books I have on my Kindle for very many years. I was attracted to the \\"read or listen\\" feature that would spare my old eyes.

The plot wasn't very interesting, the dialogue unrealistic and dull, and the narration was simple, quick, un-engaging, and akin to novels recommended for the grade seven or eight reading level.It seems to me that this book is just like any other romance with a teen-aged female protagonist. It was a quick simple read, with much repetition throughout of the initial conflict. (\\"He's Amish and I'm English.. Oh whatever will become of us?\\")I had to force myself to finish the last five chapters, and was very much dreading these reading sessions. The ending left me feeling empty and lacking of any real emotions except annoyance and anger towards this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raunchy, Vulger, but Hilarious!","review":"This movie goes way beyond the first movie which seemed to be a melange of separate skits in the Quick Mart. This movie focuses on Dante's upcoming marriage to his girlfriend. As he ponders leaving his job at a fast food restaurant and moving to Florida with his dominaneering fiancee, his friends decide to make his last day extremely memorable.With his work girlfriend (Rosario Dawson) throwing out hints to him throughout that she may be more suited to him and his best friend telling him to stop blaming everybody for his problems.Jay and Silent Bob are more outrageous than ever in some of their stunts and Dante's friend says things that would make the most hardened criminal blush. All in all, the movie is loaded with quite a few deep belly laughs. The movie will have you saying to your self several times, \\"I can't believe he just said that!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"There was something about this film that didn't quite work. I smiled a few times but never really laughed out loud as I had expected. Not sure what went wrong here. Not even Jay and Silent Bob could make the film funny.

The film seems like Clerks mixed with The Notebook. Kevin Smith has lost something in his film-making talent. It seems the more successful he becomes, the worse his movies become.Most of Clerks II is centered around Dante preparing to move to Florida with his new fiancee. So we have to sit through 90 minutes of his strangely effeminate relationship with his boss, Becky, and his clearly homosexual feelings towards Randall. At some points Smith tires to recreate the nostalgia of the original Clerks with long winded, but brilliant, conversations about nerd stuff like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, but it fails. Smith even brings in a long line of cameos to try to spruce up the movie...but that again fails. The bottom line is that this movie is mostly boring. Actually its a train wreck. Only Jay and Silent Bob keep the movie entertaining with the help of a few Clerks 1 type moments by Randall. I miss the Kevin Smith I loved in 1994...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? Why?

There wasn't a laughable moment. It was just a series of disjointed scenes that aren't funny on their own, let alone put together into a whole movie. And why start a love story 50 minutes into it? No one cares. Either stick to the no-plot theme or give the plot respect. Don't hurry it along in the last half hour because you've spent the bulk of your time on female anatomy, animal abuse, and gay jokes.

There are no obscene sight gags (except a pantsless Jason Mews dance which had me in stitches) and the crude humor is almost entirely verbal. By most people's standards, this is not considered a gross-out comedy. If you can't stomach dirty talk, then your sensitivity might be too great to sit through this movie.Despite the off-color hijinks, this movie has a poignant message about the life one choses to live, the reasons for those choices, and the value and importance of friendship.

You need a good general culture to understand some jokes, and you need to know the world that kevin created in his filmography.

Dante's acting is terrible, even his attempt at laughing casually comes out more like a witch's cackle. His relationship with Becky is completely implausible. The scene where he's painting her toenails is the definition of awkward. Half the jokes fail to hit their mark or go on too long and the serious moments all lack context. A disappointment from Kevin Smith, but nevertheless the most entertaining film released in cinemas in 2006, such is the sorry lack of non-brooding auteurs to emerge in the industry since the original Clerks' release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I loved Clerks 2! After leaving the theater, I felt like I had just gone back in time ten years. It was amazing to watch something that was able to actually take me to another time. Dante and Randall looed older, of course, but other than that it was as if the first movie just kept going and evolved into another story. It was deeper than the first movie, but that's the way life is, anyways. It's more complicated at 30 than it was at 20.I could have done without some of the gross parts (like the donkey) but I loved the movie! I also thought the soundtrack was great! I have always been a Kevin Smith fan (with a couple exceptions like Jersey Girl and Dogma), and this one is right up there with the best! I have always thought he was talented and his movies were fun, but with Clerks 2 I actually left the theater with a huge appreciation of his talents and his ability to recreate a place and time.

I loved the first Clerks movie and was excited to watch this on, but the entire movie was immensity disappointing. They completely changed and ruined all of the characters from the first ie Randall and Donnie. Randall is no longer the care free youth who understands the significance of his station and life and acts accordingly now. They turned him into no more than a jerk and a bully. Rather than being crude in a funny way, he is simply nasty now. And Donnie, he became a low life in this one. Their first was great, but this is exactly what it seams like an attempt of two middle aged men to reclaim their past fame. If you liked the first one at all, you will not like this one save for Jay and Silent Bob's bits. They are the only reason this sequel did not receive a 1 star review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Is this really the sequel from renowned director/writer Kevin Smith? The acting is sub-par, the plot is weak. Mr Smith bypasses script and acting for gross-out/shock humor. The soundtrack is pathetic... Soul Asylum? I really expected more from the guy who brought us Clerks(1), Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma. If you think \\"trans-species erotica\\" is humorous, then this movie is definitely for you. Perhaps I've just grown up since the first movie, but I think I know why Ebert panned the film. Not because of the donkey-sex show, but because this movie is simply, well, terrible.

I've used it for piping frostings and icings several times now, and everything leaks through the bag onto my hands, precluding a good grip and getting sugary grease on everything I touch (makes for an epic mess to clean up). Contrary to another review on this product, canvas is NOT the way to go-it is a loosely woven fabric, so the filling leaks between the threads. Also, the bottom of the bag is just a wee bit too big to fit my standard couplers, so frosting leaks out between the bottom of the bag and the top of the piping tip. Another problem is the finished bottom seam, making the fabric there very thick. Even if it did fit standard couplers, the seam is too thick to properly screw on a coupler ring.

The plastic span, above the tines, developed a crack one day.

The only differences are thet the Featurette will be different.In all fairness the BW verison of the film have been cleaned up a bit. The color versions are not as good as prior Legends films releases, as an example see any of the Shirley Temple films which have been colorized.

I'm a gadget guy and I find that I actually enjoy putting together a salad with this, rather than just using normal tupperware. You turn the dressing container, shake and your ready to go.

I even prepare my salads the night before and they're still fresh and crisp the next afternoon when I eat them. I was worried about the ice pack browning or freezing my lettuce/veggies, but that hasn't happened either. This is seriously one of the best purchases I have ever made, and I went into skeptical because of the price, but it's well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's fine","review":"I don't know what those other people are talking about, the knob seals well and turns easily.

This is the dumbest item I have ever seen. The plastic to plastic seal for the dressing is ridiculous. Its not even close on the seal. The dressing leaks out in minutes.

I did not receive a spork, nor was there a place for one. The dressing container leaked everywhere. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I was so excited about these containers. What a great idea, however the two that I bought didn't work. The knobs to the compartments that contains the salad dressing had to be screwed on so tight to keep the flap from dumping the dressing in transport that it was impossible to undo the knob without a pair of pliers! There is always the chance that I did get two duds, currently working with the company on a return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I got a bad one, but...","review":"First off, I can't turn the little lid for the dressing. The idea is that you open the dressing, shake it all up, and then open the lid to a dressed salad. Unfortunately, my salad ends up dressed on one half, unless I take half a bowlful, which is not enough for my main meal of the day.The ice pack gets hopelessly coated with salad dressing, even when the greens don't. The plastic utensils broke on me within a week. When I finally applied all my hand strength to open the darn dressing cup, the blessed thing broke.Nice idea, poor execution. There's got to be a better way. I'm very disappointed - looking at other reviews for Fit & Fresh products, I think I'll just steer clear of them. I'm back to Lock&Lock; containers in a lunch cooler, or my Lock&Lock; bento set."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did they update?!?","review":"I have the older version of this container and love it! I recently purchased this container for my mom and have been very disappointed in it! The container no longer comes with the fork section, but the real issue is the dressing! My container has the older style yellow cup that locks in but this one has a new white cup. The white cup will leak any thinner dressing (i.e. vinaigrette) all over the salad! what is the point! returning it and found the older style available from another retailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fit & Fresh Salad Shaker","review":"I purchased this item thinking it would be nice to take a salad to work. The plastic bowl is solid, everything else is cheap. The dressing dispenser broke before I could even put dressing in it. The knife and fork are cheaper than what you would get at a drive thru for disposal. I only rated it a one because zero wasn't an option. Save your money and buy regular plastic tubs. The extra blue ice and so called plastic ware isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Container","review":"I was really excited about this product. After I got the salad shaker, I was preparing to use it when I filled the dressing container, it leaked and made a mess of my lunch! I tried a variety of dressings but they all leaked.

The lettuce stays fresh because the dressing is kept separate until you 'drop' it from the small yellow container.

They also fit under gloves which is a great plus in the winter and when driving. I bought these because a friend recommended them to me and am so glad I did. My only question is why the right and left wrist supports didn't cost the same at Amazon; one was less than $8 while the other was over $10.

It's really a shame that we don't miss something until it's gone. I have to say that the sould and musical style of Kashif is really missing from our music today. He had a certain style and flair about his craft that still today I am trying to hear in other musicians. Like I said before......don't take music forgranted.....for all we know it maybe alittle too late to enjoy it, so I say to you buy this CD and you will see as well as hear that Kashif is really missed and totally under rated.

The very first example they give is thunderstorms are an incredible spectacle, must be created by God. We know that thunderstorms are created when warm air rushes upward and cools. They also state that lightning is the same temperature as the surface of the sun. That's not even close to correct.I was really hoping for scientific breakdown of where science fails to explain the universe around us and creation by God is a logical explanation. Instead, I got the same thing I've always heard: The world around us is awesome, has to be God!This video fails to try and convice non-believers and instead reinforces Creationists beliefs by affirming what they believe with no real substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad.","review":"This is one of the worst arguments for creationism I have ever witnessed. The entire concept of the film consists of presenting wondrous natural phenomena, pointing to vague quotes in the bible, and referring to the testimony of creationists who have studied science. These creationists explain, in scientific terms, wonders like lightning and DNA, somehow concluding that such intricacy could only be the makings of God. No reference to how this is logical. Totally unconvincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely ridiculous and not based on ANY actual facts or science","review":"Don't waste your money on this junk. It is not a factual science based documentary and there are SO many good REAL and TRUTHFUL DVDs out there. The fact that this DVD completely IGNORES the science of nature is just SO FRUSTRATING. PLEASE don't allow your children to watch this as you don't want them to grow up ignorant...they need REAL education based on REAL science.

How about a TV series that we can look forward to each week that covers different species of plants and animals showing how a Creator designed them? There just isn't enough available right now. 99% of the nature shows are geared towards evolution. It is far too lop-sided.This is a great film that I would highly recommend to Christians of all ages. They do not go into a battle here with evolution. But rather they simply present everything so it points directly to our Creator. I enjoyed that about the film. The joy of nature and science is lost when it turns into a hostile debate.I extend a friendly challenge to evolutionists to watch this film.

The difference was the depth of the center hub was 1/16\\" off. The result was the Beck Arnley Rotors were then 1/16\\" off center, thus causing the scraping and difficult stopping.In the end, Amazon promptly took them back and refunded my money.

McClendon is forced to use traditional categories while filling them with ideas for which they were never designed. For example, McClendon purposefully organizes this text into three distinct sections, avowedly borrowing a Trinitarian concept. This leaves the reader amazed to find that McClendon is not at all trinitarian in his theology; he is a Modalist (cf. chapter seven: \\"The Identity of God\\"). This sort of theological shell-game makes for difficult reading as McClendon awkwardly attempts to mask his idiosyncratic (for a baptist) theology behind Orthodox categories.

One of them is so short all I have to do is barely swat at it and it comes off. Another won't stay velcro'ed at all. The bar is difficult to get attached into the holes and is also too short so the mobile itself ends up being bent over.My son was interested in the jingling noises the animals made, but overall this is such a poor design, it's going back to the store of purchase tomorrow and I'm going to look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining for the baby but obnoxious for the mommy","review":"This item does hold the attention of my baby, but the toys are constatny comming off...the bar accross the front has never worked very well and it always gets in the way when we are putting in the car seat...We finally got another \\"whosit\\" to hang on the seat because for some reason my son LOVES it.

The cutscenes are top-notch, almost Hollywood quality, and I hate to say this, but having the f-word just makes the game cooler. The pros stop there though!Gamepley is awful. The main character moves slowly and awkwardly. Cars handle realistically, but that doesn't mean they handle in a playable manner. I do like how the cars run poorer and poorer as they get more and more damaged, but the damage itself is unrealistic. The camera is awful, never in the right place. Controls are bad as well, sure you have autoaim, but you basically just have to hold down R1 until everything is dead, because there is no telling what it is you are shooting at. I could go on and on, but the fact is that I don't care enough about this game to put it down, I just want to warn you gamers out there. I'm going back to Vice City!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be made into a movie!!!","review":"I bought this game used and overall I've enjoyed it. People keep comparing this game to GTA, but this game is way better. The graphics are good and I love the fact that you really are in london unlike the GTA games which is just in a made up city. This game has a really good story line. It's not all about sex or drugs. It actually has a deep meaning to what is going on in the game. I hate the fact that the video cuts are long and you have to watch it for like 2 minutes before playing the game but when you actually do play a mission it is worth the wait. In the end the game is probably the best game I have ever played. I'm waiting for some hotshot director to make this into a movie cuz it really should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This game is SLOW and boring. The vehicles are extremely lame. Weapons are weak. Story line was created with little to no effort. This is a prime example of a mass produced opportunistic video game aimed at a pre-established audience. My advice is if you have played and enjoyed GTA do not waste your time or money with this game. If you have not played GTA then you might be entertained by the Getaway. Yes, the graphics are VERY good but the creators need to know their customer and know when they have gone too far in one direction (graphics) thus neglecting other important areas of the game. In conclusion, I could not wait to \\"Getaway\\" from my PS2 the few times I forced myself to play in an attempt to give this game a chance to win me over. I simply cannot express my disappointment in this game as fully as i would like. The creators of this game have fooled me out of my hard earned money, I congratulate them on well advertised garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The Getaway is a repetitive rip-off of the GTA series and it's only merit is it's decent story line that cashes in on the recent popularity of British ganster movies such as Guy Ritchie's Snatch (2000) and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998). The makers of The Getaway have substituted cinematic quality for any trace of entertaining gameplay. The driving is supposed to be realistic but real cars go faster than 40 miles per hour. Instead of handling with surprising realism, the vehicles drive like they are soaked in molasses. Utterly horrible.

This game take forever to play. it's extremly boring. lots of driving and stupid police chases that start for no reason.Sorrry getaway but you no good :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Down Time","review":"You can not skip cut scenes. Every time you play a level you have to sit through the whole 10 minute cut scene, no matter how many times you've seen it. Also, when the character is on foot, he heals by leaning on the wall. Cool concept, but I spend so much time waiting for him to heal. You just sit there and watch him breath for like 60 seconds. It really adds up after a while. Between that and the cut scenes, this game winds up being a huge waist of time. It's a shame, it looks great, and the driving parts are very cool. There's just too much down time. I suggest getting a book or magazine to read while playing this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Controls Ever !!!","review":"I just can't play this game. I want to like it, but I just can't. The controls are HORRIBLE. The camera view is a DISGRACE. I can't see where the heck I'm going. I am an experienced gamer but I just can't get past the first level. I keep trying then end up yelling and cursing. I thought about BREAKING the game. Now I'm here looking at what this game goes for and am thinking about selling it.

Basically, if you love driving very far from point A to B many many times, then this is the game for you.

It may be cheap right now, but it's still not worth it.The controls are horrible, and the game's difficulty is just driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Game","review":"GO OUT AND BUY THIS GAME.This is a great game and is beyond quality that Vice City will put out.

It's important to note the M for Mature rating on the game. This will save some parents the shock of noticing their kids playing a game with plenty of cursing and adult situations in it.Getaway isn't too much of a GTA knockoff. It's simply just a great game idea taken in a different direction. Getaway does get a bit old in spots. There can be too much of a good thing. You drive and then kill and then drive some more only to go kill some more. The controls aren't too dificult to master, but don't always make gameplay easy. There is no rotate character control, which easily could have been done using the right analog stick.Getaway has good voice acting, great graphics and fun gameplay. Although it can get a bit old in spots (especially if you love GTA) this is definitely a game to rent if not buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"gritty, dirty and awespme!!","review":"This game is so realistic. In some ways it is lie grand theft auto and others it is like metal gear solid which are both sweet games. In this fame you asume the role of tqwo charaters. Mark Hammond who is trying to get his son back from his mob boss charlie who killed his wife, and Frank Carter a cop trying to get Charlie. What makes this game so cool is the realistic city London. They took pictures of the 40 square mile city and put it into the game. Also there are over 56 cars you can jack and 10 hidden. Obvoiusly the car action is from grand theft auto and the stealthie is from meatal gear solid. The game features a free roam mode at the end of the game when you beat it. This is hopw you can find the secret cars. There are some sweet weapons you can get like the double pistols, shotguns, ak-47's and more. This has to be the game of year from my eyes and I reccomed this to everybody who owns a ps2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated!","review":"This game just isn't that good! You don't have very much control over the cars while driving, there are no maps, no ammo count, very limited type of guns and cars, and the game itself moves pretty slow. They make you do the same things over and over, so much that it's not even fun anymore by the time you finish that mission. And the guy huffs and puffs so loudly while you are playing, it sounds like a cheesy porno! The graphic do rock and the soundtrach is decent, but that doesn't make up for how lame the game actually is. Save your money and just keep on playing Vice City or Max Payne."},{"rating":"1","title":"controls? what controls.","review":"cool idea, cool setting, good graphics, entertaining cut scenes with plenty of swearing, even the sound is good, but whatever is good about this game is completely let down by game controls and camera positioning that leave you getting shot in the back when all you want to do is pop around the corner and shoot the bad guys. It really is a shame. I wanted to like this game but as it stands I'm glad that I only rented it and didn't waste forty bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good idea, but...","review":"This game took three years to make, but it has become apparent that in those three years of designing, programming, and testing, control response was not high on the priority list. This could have been a great game! The story is good, the graphics are great, the voice acting is right on, but the controls downright [stink]. There is a level invovling some tricky manuvering through laser detection beams, and the control thwarts you every time. The cars have little distinction in manuverability, although I'll admit they're a little more responsive to the controller than when you're on foot. I would have gladly waited another six to twelve months for Sony to improve the controls on this one. Oh, by the way, London is HUGE, and the road system there [stinks], both in real life and in the game. An on-screen map or even a pack-in map with the game woulda helped a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not customizable, horrible graphics","review":"1. Cannot customize controls2. Horrible graphics3.

The liberal use of the F-word thoughout the FMV was a turnoff. The game design is generic at best (limited camera angles) and the controls are bad. Seems to me they put this out quickly to ride the coattails of GTA:Vice City. I can't believe people was praising this game for being realistic?!

It is NOT like the GTA games. The GTA games are free, loose and fun. The Getaway is stiff, humorless and frustrating. I appreciate the ability to drive through \\"the real streets of London\\", but you feel trapped in those streets. They're too narrow and congested and you have to obey all the traffic laws, otherwise you'll get a bunch of cops on your tail.When you're out of the car, the game gets even worse. The camera always seems to be looking the wrong way, which makes it difficult to deal with the bad guys that are shooting at you. There are no health or ammo meters---and I know that they were purposely omitted for \\"realism\\", but realism aside, it would be helpful to see your vitals.The Getaway is more like the Driver games---strictly mission based with no room for fun. I rented it, played it about twice and took it back. As the British would say: \\"Fookin' Rubbish!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I Expected Better","review":"This game is ok. It is fun in certain ways such as taking hostages. It is kind of annoying when you have to spend half the game against the wall regaining your health.

A lot of ideas here are going to seem very familiar to GTA but with a slightly different twist. This is an OK game - but is could have been great. The designers forgot to put in decent gameplay. The first person shooter is pretty fun but the controls are a little clunky at times. The car scenes are just frustrating and dull - 10 plus minutes to drive across London to the next mission - its not that fun in real life. Worth trying it if you can find it cheap - if not wait till they come out with a version with a decent game involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh WOW!!!","review":"The getaway has to be by far one of the best games i have played on the ps2 console...

Warren Haynes is an amazing musician, and justifiably he gets a lot of praise for his guitar playing. In fact, his work on the guitar is so famed that sometimes we forget that this guy is also an outstanding vocalist. This subdued acoustic set foregoes the blazing guitar that we Gov't Mule fans love so much in favor of simple acoustic melodies, and the spotlight is on this guy's astounding vocals. It's worth the few bucks you'll pay for it for the cover of Elton John's Indian Summer alone. Throw in longtime Gov't Mule concert staples like I'll Be The One and Fallen Down, and this EP is a no-brainer. The Lone EP offers a chance to enjoy one hell of a good singer (and musician) at the top of his craft. I'm giving it four stars, I'd give it five if it were a full length recording. My only complaint is that it's over so soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great - but this book sucks","review":"This book has incredible potential. This could have been a great book. But unfortunately this book really sucks. The author only gives partial explanations while he is deriving formulas.

This is not an introductory book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor printing!!","review":"I actually can't believe they are selling the book as is. The alignment of the printing is awful! The cover is not only crooked, but the title is cut off both on the front cover and back cover.

It, however, remains my favorite. It contains some of the best ensemble playing of any Garbarek album that I can recall. A lot of these tracks seem to materialize slowly out of thin air and then take you on a journey that will leave you breathless. Special kudos to guitarist David Torn, who has never been more suited to his surroundings. A lot of the powerful mood of this disc is a direct result of his interaction of Garbarek's compositions. And Eberhard Weber's fluid yet substantial bass never disappoints, as always. All the tracks seem knitted intricately to one another; yet all maintain an individuality on their own. This is a great place to start if you don't own any of Jan Garbarek's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love most of Jan's recordings","review":"Thanks to my new portable cassette player , i was just able to revisit this 1984 GROUP set with Tavid Torn on guitars , Eberhard Weber on bass and Michael DiPasqua on drums .

To me he's so ecocative , emotional and thoughtful on most of his recordings (regardless of the setting) that i find few modern peers . Everyone plays brilliantly here .

Very disappointed in, considering the price. Keep your money and keep looking. All three of my kids have loved legos and the little lego action figures. We would have done much better getting legos instead of this. Same for the Robosapien, we tried it too and for our kids neither one was a hit.

I thought it would notice the environment more or it's legs would move better. Not sure exactly what I was expecting but it was cute while it lasted.

She may have been the 'blood' countess but she is a bloody terrible actress. I would have more to say but I turned it off after an hour. Stilted, stiff movie. Don't waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The actress is not good. this role reminds me of Isabelle Huppert's the piano teacher, a very difficult role, in which she plays a harsh, cold woman in a sublime and superbly mesmerizing way. However, here this actress was trying so hard but she was unnatural to watch. I also agree with someone said here there is no chemistry between her and other casts. Scripts are not interesting either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and disgusting","review":"After an incredibly slow build up, the movie turns into a disgusting display of sadism that made me turn the TV off. The supposedly romantic scenes are boring, the sex scenes are not arousing, but the sadistic scenes (from a beautiful little girl killing a chick to baths in human blood) are stomach turning. Gosh! What a disaster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't finish watching it","review":"I am not into blood and gore and had not read the other reviews prior to starting watch it so I had nver heard of the Blood Countess. I was not impressed with the acting and and just stopped watching at the point in the movie she started getting fascinated with the blood of a virgin preserving her youth. Yuck, guess I should've read the reviews first. Lesson learned, I'll pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like movies","review":"As someone who likes all kinds of movies, I thought that this selection would be a worthwhile watch. It was not finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actors should not direct themselves in movies","review":"Actors should not direct themselves in movies (Clint Eastwood the only exception) and this proves the Rule. Julie Delpy wrote a halfway decent script but she needed outside Leadership to bring out the True spirit and Life of Erzebet Bathory. The acting was wooden and without life, and the script and supporting roles without depth. This could have been an amazing movie, maybe even Oscar worthy--true life, amazing settings and costumes, interesting story. But the direction and cinematography, the editing, made this a mediocre film barely worthy of note. Too bad. The life of Erzebet Bathory, the first recorded female serial killer, is one of the great mysteries of history and certainly worthy of better. I suggest you wait until Amazon drops the rental price to $1.99, or until Hollywood puts this in the hands of a better actress and director, before watching a movie about the Amazing Erzebet Bathory"},{"rating":"1","title":"No thank you.","review":"I would love to have loved this film. It has all the ingredients for a wonderful work.I could not even finish it.Julie Deply did a great job in Six Feet Under - a perfect role for her.But this?Is beyond bad.It's not even b grade. I can't imagine anyone thinking this is good work.There is some decent acting by others, but in the end, after about 45 minutes, I had to give up.The lead actress was so poor it ruined anything of redeeming value about the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange but Good","review":"This was an interesting video not to mention the Countess was a little weird and obsessed with her vanity. It held my attention and gave me a bit of a surprise towards the end. I'm glad it was free not something I would pay buy or rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody","review":"This is a long, boring, bloody movie that nobody should waste their time on. The countess wasn't a nice person and this makes her look even worse than she probably was. Not well acted. A great disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"When I chose this movie I didn't read about it. I was surprised at it's content. But I sat through the whole movie and enjoyed it very much. I thought it was very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Story Worth Retelling","review":"The story of the Blood Countess -- as she was called -- was not worth retelling. Her story is one of pure evil, cruelty and insanity. There is nothing enjoyable about it. I agree with the reviewer that said only people who like blood and gore movies could possibly enjoy this film. I thought it was horrible. Not even the costumes could save it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color me unimpressed","review":"This was listed as a suggested viewing for me, based on previous movies I've viewed through Amazon. It looked promising - had some decent actors and set during a time period I enjoy. While the settings and costumes were excellent - and the acting wasn't too bad - it was difficult to get through the entire movie. The story is disjointed, the dialogue simplistic - there is no flow, no build up of drama or tension. Excessively bland for what looked to be an interesting premise. I didn't hate it - thus the two stars - but I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood and gore","review":"This film is for horror fans only. If you want a well acted enjoyable evening choose something else.The costumes were well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as interesting as I expected","review":"I've researched the countess before and expected this movie to be much more interesting. Though I was disappointed in the portrayal of Bathory and her crimes, this movie was very well done. I do recommend for anyone who enjoys a good movie, but keep in mind that this portrayal focuses on Bathory as a woman in power and makes the men of history to be nothing but power-hungry jealous women-haters. Bathory was a merciless and disturbed serial killer who got by with way too many crimes, and this movie almost glorifies her as a woman who only craved love and youth. I disagree with the portrayal but do not deny the validity of this movie as a good watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Countess","review":"I tend to like movies set in this period but, unfortunately, this was boring. The Countess had no substance and no character. She was supposed to be a strong woman but her love affair with a much younger man was pathetic and, therefore, not worth the time spent watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gruesome","review":"This movie was nothing like what I was expecting. It was horrifyingly gruesome. It sickened me to be honest.The countess kills young virgin girls. Drains them of their blood so she can smear their blood on her face and hands because she is warped enough to believe that their blood makes her skin young. All out of vanity ...because she wants to stay young for the younger man she has fallen in love with. She is what ? 20 years or more older than him?Hundreds of girls died.Hmmm... whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"best action","review":"Have to say the story is not very good (dump!!!) However, you can just watch it with out audio and still having a great time.Tony Jaa used to be a stunt man for many movies including \\"Mortal Kombat\\". Therefore, he did all by himself and did not use any stunt man. That was amazing to see human being and do all that without anyhelp from hollywood technology.I must say that I like \\"ONG BAK\\" better. Hopefully \\"ONG BAK II\\" will be out to the USA (Ong Bak (part I) did not??!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action...Action ...

I bought \\"Tom Yum Goong\\" at a cheaper price and was extatic. Now I would like to ask a few questions:Why did Mr. Tarantino trim about 30 minutes of the original film?Why did the powers that be, charge me over $20 for this movie, decieving me into believing it was a NEW Tony Jaa film?I bought \\"Tom Yum Goong\\" at a cheaper price. It was the original Thai version with English subtitles and everything else. It was a good edition. I was happy. Is this type of release ETHICAL at all?It's really the same old story: take a good movie, add a lot of hype, change the title (or keep it with the caption EXTENDED EDITION or UNRATED), or 2-DISK COLLECTOR's EDITION, and sell it to the fans to make more money out of them.So, there you have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Protector","review":"It is a pity that Tony Jaa's skill is wasted on such a miserable movie. If at least it was flowing. But it is so boring! Thank God for fast forward. The only reason why I did not give it one star is because of Tony Jaa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect...","review":"Product was exactly as described. Flawless transaction, best Martial Arts movie ever!Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad editing job","review":"This movie was a headache to watch. The sequences throughout the film aren't really smooth and consistent. I found myself saying \\"hey, wait a minute\\". I thought that maybe I wasn't paying attention to the movie but then quickly figured out that it was the \\"style\\" of the film.Plus, as a Deaf person, I found myself having to switch back and forth with the subtitles and captions. Some scenes are spoken in Thai, which are subtitled. However, once English is spoken, I had to switch to captions. Usually, the captions or subtitles will take care of everything...not this film.Anyways, this movie is about avenging the theft of royal elephants (and the death of one), which were raised for the king's service. So, Kham is sent to Australia to return the elephants. Simple plot.What I loved about this movie was the fight scenes. I found myself grimacing as I saw these scenes. I don't think I've ever seen one man fight against so many people...not even with Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Simple plot BUT great martial arts ACTION. People no one watches action movies for great plots..thats for suspense/thriller themes and even drama. Once again the fighting sequence was marvelous. Looking forward to more from Tony Jaa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Martial Arts Movie - Still love Tony Jaa","review":"This was movie was so ridiculous, I'm not even sure where to start. I was a HUGE fan of the \\"Thai Warrior\\" movie, and was really excited to get this. This was bad, and I mean really bad. If you like Tony Jaa, don't bother.In the first place, he loses his elephant. Now, I don't mean it runs away or anything. I mean, it's STANDING NEXT TO HIM at a martial arts show, and it wanders off on it's own. It's made even more ridiculous by the fact that he JUST BOUGHT a bell for it and had just hung it around it's neck.Tony Jaa is amazing, I mean just amazing. But this movie just seems like set-ups for his aerial work, and some fighting. My friends and I laughed all the way through this, but it's a wearying effort even then. Pass this one up for sure"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review.","review":"VERY dissapointed. This movie sucked. All the hype about Tony Jaa doesn't show through in this movie. The story line was bad. The only fight sequence worth seeing is near the end when Tony Jaa is fighting this \\"Man Mountain\\". But for the price, it's not worth it. If gotta see this, RedBox this movie. At least the dissapointment in this movie won't be nowhere near as bad when your only spending $1.00 to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many special effects","review":"Poor story line and acting but I'm not complaining about that. This is an action movie and it delivers the fight sceens...sort of. I expected hard hitting action like I saw in Ong Bak.This movie had a bigger budget and they moved away from the format that made Ong Bak great. It's less gritty and they tried to make it look like it was produced in Hollywood but they failed. Instead of looking slick it seems overdone. I mean really, cgi? It made the action cheesy.They ruined the fight scenes which is the only reason to see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spastic.","review":"This is by far one of the most spastic movies I have ever seen. It is kind of like those annoying stylized action flicks, but without the stylin' gimmicks; it is just bafflingly without transitions. It is fast paced and silly. Silly without being funny. But there are a couple amusing foes here and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"GEEZ, Where Do I Start?","review":"As you can tell, I was very disappointed with this movie. I REALLY like fighting movies and the previews looked great... but I think I know why I didn't like the movie. It really seems like they shot 2 hours and 30 minutes of film and then took out all the plot footage, leaving only poorly arranged fight scenes with little to no segway between them. The movie just didn't make sense.I will, however, admit that the fight scenes were good and there was lots of arm and leg breakage, etc, which I like. Just don't buy this movie thinking you're getting a movie of the quality of Jet Li's Fearless, as it is FAAAAARRRR from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!!","review":"do not buy this movie!!!this is the crappy american cut of a wonderful film. In this cut, all the motivations of the character are editted out, because the suits thought Americans might not understand the deep love and friendship between a man and his elephant.Also, the wonderful last bit of voiceover that bokends the picture is gone.what you are looking for if you think you want this movie is TOM YUM GOONG. This is the REAL version of this movie. Do yourself a favor and get the real of this pic, and send the studio a message about crapping up quality films because they think the rest of america is a stupid or predjuduced as them.If amazon is out of TOM YUM GOONG, check out the Bay, as you can usually get a decent boot for around 15 bux. I did. Six times."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE","review":"If you really want to see some action this is sure enough the movie.I would watch it every other day if i had the time.You really have to watch the movie to understand with the elephants but really good movie to have in your collection if you like martial arts."},{"rating":"2","title":"henry","review":"brilliant film, would recommend this to anyone who loves Martial arts.Toni Jaa's best film since Ong-Bak. He doesn't use stunt doubles, wires or CGI."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next....","review":"Tony Jaa is amazing! This is the type of movie that martial arts/action fans live for--something different..something that gives the illusion of being 'new' or the 'next big thing'..we want the same feeling we got when we saw Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee fight in 'RETURN of the DRAGON' or the first time we saw Michael Jackson perform 'Billy Jean' on the Grammys--Tony Jaa delivers. His style teeters somewhere between: balletic, acrobatic and swift & bone-breaking brutality.*Check out the scene that is one continuous shot following Jaa up and down stairs,thru different rooms as he dispatches numerous foes...Also, the scene at the end of the film where Jaa takes out 53 foes in less than 3 minutes!!!...yeah, i did count all 52...eh, 51 -- if you don't believe me, buy the DVD and prove me wrong!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome flick","review":"Beautifully filmed. Awesome locations, cinematography, sound. The action choreography is just phenomenal. I've watched this movie many times. The only criticism is with the actors phonetically speaking English. It's obvious that they don't speak or understand a word of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Lisa Gerrard repeats herself","review":"Dead Can Dance's former singer, Lisa Gerrard, sounds good (like she always does) on this album, yet she repeats herself, coming accross a LOT like she did in \\"Whale Rider\\". The oceanic-like quality to her music plays a central role in this soundtrack, and makes me a bit doubtful about future efforts, unless she begins to experiment a little more, like she did in her DCD days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting","review":"Like another reviewer stated, it sounds corny and fake. I must agree. Some of it is ok, but it sounds like commercialized North American Indian music, which I suppose it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"judging the work for the quality of the art","review":"This album is an accomplished, gorgeous tribute that should only lead to a thousand roads of compliments. Some of the aforementioned reviewers (such as Brent Michael Davids - Composer, Mohican Nation) prove laughable in their perspectives of \\"hyper-political correctness.\\" Amazon is such a mystery: that a reviewer with an Anglo name, but referring to himself as \\"Composer, Mohican nation,\\" would have the nerve to criticize Lisa Gerrard (a seasoned world musician) for doing this album.A Thousand Roads is a wonderful release that should be treasured for its inherent sound and the attention it is bringing to a culture. The entire spirit of Dead Can Dance was to bring many worlds together. Lisa Gerrard is proudly keeping this important tradition alive and well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The human - emotion","review":"Surprised as I was that Lisa Gerrard was asked to co-score A Thousand Roads, happy as I am now that she was. The soundtrack is beautiful, more then just pieces of music. Lisa's voice glues all the pieces together. Where the Indian musicians bring in the ethnic cultural pieces, it is Lisa who brings out the Human part: The emotion. It was a perfect choice eventhough Lisa Gerrard is not from Native-American decent but the film is not a National Geographic Special..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage phone","review":"I bought this phone simply to have a phone with a cord. It looks really neat on the wall and has a very cool retro ring. The sound quality is not great as it echos but I was aware of quality issues before purchasing. It feels like a substantial phone and I have gotten several compliments on it. Shipped as promised by vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make A Good Weapon","review":"We've had this in our kitchen for several years now, but avoid using it if at all possible. It's extremely heavy and the handle is shaped so as to make it nearly impossible to prop between your ear and your shoulder. Dialing is a bit slow because of the placement of the numbers. All in all, I guess if a burglar came into my house at the exact same time I was using this phone, I would feel safer because it's weight at the end of the cord could act like an ancient mace and knock the intruder out. An excellent weapon I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Touch Tuscan-Inspired Kitchen","review":"This is my \\"all-time-favorite-purchase-so-far-this-year\\". I \\"longed for\\" this phone for more than six months because it was the missing piece in my \\"red accents\\" kitchen. Finally, I decided to make the purchase and I am so glad that I did! The phone is a rich, red color with a sleek design and truly \\"rings\\" of nostalgia. In my kitchen, I have red pots, artwork with red poppy fields, red peppers hanging on the wall and a red roman shade with gold scrolls. This phone completes the picture and the extra-long cord is excellent for moving around the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"The phone looks great on the wall but it I have trouble hearing callers. The volume only adjusts the ringer not the speaker. Not sure if it's a defect or just a problem. Could someone respond to that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Great/A Few Drawbacks","review":"I love the retro look of this phone, and it works good. Ringer is a bit loud, but not a problem. 2 drawbacks though, you cannot change out handset cord for a longer one. It is a permanent cord that comes on the phone. Handset does not rest on shoulder while talking, as it is sort of beveled rather than flat on the back, so you cannot rest it on your shoulder easily, should you need to free up your hands for a minute. Other than that though, the phone is nice and I don't regret the purchase, it's a really cool looking phone for my farmhouse kitchen style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retro phone unable to get replacement parts from mfg","review":"Loved the phone the minute I saw it. It was perfect for my new kitchen... but my calls kept getting cut off. I contacted the mfg several times for a replacement receiver and never got a return email or call. I proceeded to contact Amazon and they issued me a 1 time exception return because the mfg has not gotten back to me. I'm now looking for the same retro look but from another company."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed","review":"Bought this phone based on memories of quality Crosley products from many years ago.

Too bad I can't find a similar red phone elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phone Review","review":"Thought this phone would fit my decor, but wasn't sure it would be totally functional when I ordered it. I was wrong, it works great! Sound quality is very good, cord is long enough, looks great too. You need to remember that while it is touch tone dialing, the keys are in the circular placement like a rotary dial. That is taking a bit to get used to, but everything else is great. Handset is nice and heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy a longer cord for this!","review":"I like this phone, have had lots of positive comments. The ring is not quite as expected, but fits the phone, although a little loud even on lowest setting. I purchased a longer cord (it is offered as a set with the two together)thinking the one included would not be long enough. It is PLENTY long and very sturdy! In addition, it is not possible to change out the cord. I sent back the cord I purchased as the \\"buy them both\\" offer, but was not given a refund for it when I sent it back!! The push buttons take some getting used to, since they are in a circle layout rather than the usual square layout. Very sturdy phone all around, and will not easily be bumped off the wall, which was the biggest problem with my other phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dimensions, please?","review":"How am I supposed to order the phone if I cannot find the dimensions anywhere on the web?

I'm looking for a replacement phone already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Builders' Depot Horrible","review":"Builders' Depot sent my purchase to the wrong address and they wanted me to wait for reimbursement for their mistake. They even wanted UPS to take responsibility for their error which is inexcusable. It was only when I vehemently complained that they agreed to credit my charge account.

I called and Amazon had no problem replacing it and I received my new phone today and once again this is not brand new I can tell it had been returned before and again the ringer would not work on high.

I am looking for other options online now."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"This phone looks like the phone my grandmother had, as well as my mother had when I was a kid.... I wanted that phone to hang in my house.... however its NOTHING like the original, at all. Its push button, but shaped like a rotary phone, so as I tried to call out, my fingers fumbled- I can text on my iphone with my eyes closed- so I should not have trouble with this! Second the hand piece is irregularly shaped, nothing like the old version, its very hard too. The ring sounds like a bicycle \\"cling-cling, cling-cling\\" not like the original. The cord is short, and that is about the only thing that is similar to the old phone- however I remember being able to disconnect the cord and replace it with a longer one, this does not allow that- so when you are looking at this phone, even though a suggested addition to your purchase is a longer cord, it will be useless because this cord is fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool but broken","review":"Cool looking phone but buttons stopped working after 6 months.

This week the earpiece broke off, and since it was glued on rather than screwed on, it cannot be repaired.I am secretly relieved because I have despised this phone.

After only 6 months the handset gave out. No incoming sound. Only then did I realize that the receiver is HARDWIRED. No module plug, so if the cord goes bad, the whole thing is a paperweight.It's really too bad that someone can't make a retro phone designed to last like the old Bell phones. It looked great in our 50's kitchen.

The main problem I have is that it is not a modular cord attached but one that is permanently attached and cannot be replaced by the consumer.

I wish someone had written about this when I read the reviews, I would not have purshased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"only worked for one month","review":"This phone only worked for a couple of weeks before it was pure static.

I always know where the phone is and it is alway charged. In case of power failure, I will have a phone connection. My complaint is that yes, the phone receiver is heavy. You have to hold with one hand and dial with another, or put the phone down. No big deal in my mind. I enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Phone... For A While","review":"I LOVE this phone... it looks great, it rings just like the old-fashioned phones, and works great FOR AWHILE. I'm on my 4th phone (yes, I'm an idiot, I keep re-buying the same phone again and again... it's about the only one like this on the market) and the exact same thing has happened with every phone. It works great for about 2 months and then one day suddenly the buttons stop working. It can still receive calls, but you can't call out since you can't dial. At first I thought it was a fluke, but all four phones I've purchased have done the exact same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but hummy","review":"Since the day I hung this beautiful phone on the wall I've being dealing with a HuMMMMMM sound on the line.I tried taking the phone to another house but still I have the HUMMMMM sound.Consider your buy because I've had a bad experience with mine.I even call the telephone company and they came to my house in order to check the line, and told me the problem as on the phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek, stylish phone","review":"I bought this for style (because it is in a very visible spot) and function, since it is good to have one corded phone in the house. I love the look and heft of the phone. The cord is long and I find the ring amply loud. It even has that classic, metallic ring that I remember from old phones. The buttons are arranged in a circle, to resemble an old rotary dial, but I don't consider this a problem. The only thing that would improve it is to have a handset cord in grey or silver, which would go better with a chrome phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Broke 3 times withon one year (dial pad just stopped working).

When using the other house phones, the hum/buzz is not present. Seems like an uncomplicated thing like a phone should last for life... like the real phones of yesteryear did.One other thing to consider: this is not a rotary dial phone. It has a circular array of push buttons for number entry. It's not a bad thing, just not what you might expect in a retro phone, and the product photo doesn't reveal this fact too well.Oh, one other thing: The cord is not replaceable as is the case with most \\"modern\\" corded phones. In this phone, the cord is a part of the handset; there is no disconnect for it.One last thing: the \\"redial\\" function on the phone has not worked since we received it. It didn't annoy me enough to return it, but thought I'd include the information here."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good phone to have if the power goes out.","review":"The sound quality is good, it woks the way the directions say.

I liked the retro look to it as well (I grew up in a rural area with a rotary phone and the old style party line). I could not even hang the phone on the wall because it had the wrong mount for US wall mounts (RJ11C modular). It had 4 inch mounts. Standard US phones are 3 1/4 inches.

It has a good ring and looks nice. Problems I have are two:1. The handset is not suitable to use your shoulder to hold it to your ear while you use both hands to do something. The handset is not flat on the back but has a triangular shape, so it slips off the shoulder quite readily.2. The cord is not modular on the handset and a wire broke inside within 1 month of owning it. This made the phone useless. All I can use it for now is to ring.Bad choice of wiring design, modular on both ends would have been a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good looks don't cut it....","review":"It looks great on the wall, but the sound is terrible, fuzzy and buzzy.

Of course, the plastic isn't the heavy duty stuff that phones in the 50s and 60s were made of, but it's plenty sturdy and looks good on the wall. No unsightly electric cords to plug in, just runs on power from the wall phone jack! There's no need to buy the additional 12 foot cord, if you're considering it.

Also the warmer mechanism ONLY wraps around the bottle and does NOT have anything that warms the bottom of the bottle so you will have to be sure to shake around the bottle during the warming process to ensure the milk gets warm enough. I would not waste my time trying to use this each time even though I know the tricks of it. I'm currently researching for another brand of travel warmer and this time will spend a little more for something decent and would never recommend this to anyone even for a quick fix! Just NOT! worth the hassle...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"My husband and i are always on the run and we thought something like this would be perfect. It says it's fast at heating them up but once we used it, it took almost 30 minutes! On top of that it has a saftey switch on the bottom so it knows when the bottle is it. Well since the button is so far down compared to the heat band, the lower section of the bottle does not get heated. It took so long and i rather of spent a few more dollars to get something that really worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"We bought this product last week because our daughter was finally allowed to go out in public. We thought this would be convenient for us when we travel out of town next month. Unfortunately this isn't working out. The first time we used it we used it on a 5 oz. bottle. It said it would warm up in 15 minutes but to check it every 5 minutes and shake. I did that and when 15 minutes was up the band at the top only warmed up therefore not warming the bottle at all. I had to give the bottle to my baby real cold. The next time I used it I figured it would work better with a 6 oz bottle since it was taller and rounder. Also I didn't take the bottle out every 5 minutes instead I shook it every 5 minutes. When 15 minutes was up the bottle was hot at the top but again milk was cold. It goes back tomorrow. What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TOO LONG TO WARM UP!","review":"I tell you the truth. I was so happy that this existed. But quickly became disappointed. It took so long and it never really made a diference. I find it easier to just sit it on my lap or snug between my thighs and warm up the bottle with my own body heat while I drive or sit in the car. It turned out to be more useful that way. When my baby was on powdered formula, I would heat up the water before leaving the house and carry it in a thermal pack. That worked too. Great idea, but needs lots of improvements. I am glad it works for other parents. It just didn't do the job for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"I used this once, and decided it wasn't worth the wait. All you have to do is fill your bottles with room temp water, and add powder formula right before feeding. That way you don't need some other contraption to keep the bottles cold, and you don't need this to warm them up. Problem solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started fire in our car","review":"We have been quite happy with the warmer until last week. We plugged it in and 5 seconds later it was smoking and burning at the car adapter outlet. My husband right away pulled out the burning plug but it already melted and a metal piece of it stayed int the outlet causing an electric short.

So, when my daugher at at Noon, I started to warm the bottle at 11am. This is crazy and I do not recommend trying to warm a bottle for that long. Sometimes I would go ahead and slightlly warm the bottle in the microwave before I headed for the car. Then I used this product to warm it the rest of the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"We have made it work but.......","review":"The idea is great, the product is not so great. We have the same reviews as everyone else. The bottles (we use VentAir) do not touch the \\"on\\" sensor, and it takes more than 30 minutes to warm our 8 oz bottles. Our son will not take them luke warm, he likes them very warm.How we made it work for us:Clothes pin that we just clip on over the sensor to turn the warmer on.And one hour before our son's feeding time we start warming the bottle.Very slow process, I wish I would have done more research upon buying this warmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is the worst thing I've ever bought.

It says not to leave it plugged in too long as well, and I wonder if we're using it for \\"too long\\" to get the bottle to the heat that it needs to be at! I wouldn't recommend this product, but see it as a necissary evil for long car trips, just so the bottle can be warmed without having to pull into a gas station that may have a microwave!

Research has shown that while most mothers/fathers \\"bond\\" to their infant around the time of birth, it is not until the child is around eight months of age, when it starts to understand that there is such a thing as individual people, familiar and not familiar, that *attachment* behaviors begin, e.g. the child will shy away from unfamiliar people, cling to mom when someone unfamiliar comes into the home, etc. Professionals speak of \\"bonding\\" as something parents do, whereas \\"attachment\\" is what children do.Failing to understanding child attachment has led to a great deal of unnecessary heart ache, separation, and even abuse, all generated by the child welfare system.For a research-based understanding, I recommend Jean Mercer's book \\"Understanding Attachment.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Adoption Healing.... a path to recovery","review":"As a first mother, I was really anticipating a well written book.

One of the Great things about this game is its online game play. Anyone who has Xbox Live will be quite pleased and will have fun for hours on end. They have also upgraded the Crib,and its Franchise Mode. In the franchise mode you get to prepare for your games. What I mean by that is that you can have team meetings,press confrences,train players and also have them watch films on their opponets to make sure they bring their A game to the field. 2K5 also brinks back its First Person Mode. A new addition to this years edition is its 25 year aniversry mode. In it you are given situations to complete in some of NFLs greatest games. The controling in the game is very easy to pick up.

Each character, male and female, longs for a love they don't have. In the beginning, their yearnings are as much for self-validation as for affection.As the novel unfolds, some characters use the journey and its lessons to distinguish between wanting love and needing love.

The cord to the handset was short, and had to be replaced for normal use. The handset touchpad places the numbers in two rows of buttons rather than the normal 3 rows, making it hard to find numbers. The letters on the buttons were small and nearly impossible to see while dialing. The phone worked for about 3 or 4 months, and then became gradually more and more static-prone until it stopped working -- and this was with light use, no dropping of the phone, etc. I finally gave the phone to my young daughter as a toy and went back to a boring but reliable and easy-to-use phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Three - A Jazz Classic of Classics","review":"Ever since I first heard this album as a student back at Auburn University in the mid-eighties, I became enamored with the masterfully cool, smooth, passionate jazz oozing from this incredibly famous trio of musicians.

Ray Brown's bass playing is at it's best, and Shelly Manne and Joe Sample tear it up too! These guys are true jazz cats, and they make you feel their soul with every beat. The more you listen to this music, the more you will like and appreciate it.

His web cam doesn't have the avatars but he could see mine as well as see the superior video quality of the Fusion.I'm rating only a 4 because the sound seems to be having a little feedback issue. However, this may be my hardware. I've installed the Web cam on a T21 IBM Notebook, plus I'm a developer with a lot of installed software. The feedback issue is resolved when the headset is plugged in.This is great setup with a grand picture.

The book is not strictly about the Bozeman Trail alone. It is also a history of the gold fields of early Montana, the Plummer gang, the vigilantes, etc.The book covers the important Indian fights at Forts Phil Kearny and C.F.

She is the most talked about writer in underground circles in years. Her work is so unusual and unique I really think there is no one to compare her to. There has never been literature of this kind before. Such an array of weird and complex characters combined with language so stunning and visual that it leaves one breathless. I am so bored with all these so called uplifting books that make all this publicity noise and never live up to the hype. It is refreshing to see a real writer perfect her craft in such a fresh and individual manner without pandering to current tastes and lurid attention seeking. Emer Martin is the real thing and her books are the last bastion of hope in these tired fawning self congratulatory days."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is the bomb!!!","review":"Man, I became a fan of Emer Martin after reading the awesome Breakfast In Babylon. That book just blew me away. I was jumping up and down when I saw another Emer Martin book in the store. Yet I was afraid that it wouldn't live up to the first one and I would be shattered and bummed. More Bread Or I'll Appear is just as good and even better. I love all the crazy characters and the way she uses words makes me want to hop on a plane to Ireland and check the place out. Is everyone over there as witty as these characters? There is a scene in a Dublin bar with the characters sitting and talking that had me cracking up. This book covers even more ground than the last. Emer Martin's writing is GLOBAL!!! Gangsters in Las Vegas, Bull fighters in Mexico city, hippies in honduras, fancy hotels in San Francisco, trannies in Japan, wild uncle's in New York, runaway cult members in Hawaii. Cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disinterest or Dislike","review":"About half way through this book, I realized that, at best, I was disinterested in these characters. At worst, I disliked them. I waffled back and forth between the two positions until I decided, about three-quarters through this book, that I hadn't worked up a modicum of liking for any of them. I put the book down and decided to try it again in a year or so.

The red letters on a purple background are completely indistinguishable to my colorblind husband. He also has problems with the yellow letters on the red background. It looks like one big grayish mess to him. Others enjoy it quite a bit. It's just not a good one if you have problems seeing colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very challenging and not all that much fun","review":"Cheater is a rummy-style game where players have to be the first one to spell in \\"Cheater\\" in one \\"suit.\\" I agree with the reviewer who complained about the color cards. The color is the suit, and the four colors are peculiar choices -- red, yellow, blue and purple. There is an additional aspect to the game: if you roll the dice and get doubles, you get to be the Cheater. The cheater had extra powers, like being able to pull two cards from the deck instead of one during a turn, which other players can't do.Personally, I found it pretty boring, but I'm used to more challenging games. If you're looking to play a simple, quick card game, it's OK. Basically, all you have to do is know how to spell the word CHEATER and be willing to have other players mad at you if you take certain actions agaist them."},{"rating":"2","title":"healthy dose of christain goodness","review":"as good as their very first cd they released , a well worth cd to add to your christain misic collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This book is less an autobiography than it is a memoir of dealing with cancer. The entire book is pretty much about the nitty gritty details of cancer, which could prove a valuable comforting resource for those going through something similar. Wish there had been more about her life and career. But it's pretty much all about cancer and Gene Wilder, whom she obviously adored.

It was very courageous of her to put her thoughts on paper, and I am sure so many people have benefited from reading about her experiences. It always amazes me how people can be so candid about their \\"dirty laundry\\". For example, her cancer had a negative impact on her marriage. There were fights, some very ugly, and yet she is able to bare it all. I am sure it was not with a voyeuristic sense, but to show what havoc cancer can run in your life, and how you are not alone in your feelings.

Her book is a lasting gift to all her fans, as well as an inspiration to those whose lives have been touched by cancer.It ia also a moving love story. She and Gene Wilder made quite a pair. It was surprising to discover that while Gene is such an outrageous comic onscreen, he is actually a shy person at heart.While cancer took its toll on both of them, it never diminished the deep love and respect they had for each other. Parts of the book are difficult to read, as Gilda shares the torment of her many treatments and her eventual physical decline. Yet, she always manages to uplift us with some ironic twist, or practical joke on her caregivers.Through it all, she kept hope alive and did her best to enjoy life. We can all learn a lot from her journey. Cancer eventually conquered her body, but it never defeated her spirit.

I gave this such a low rating because the loop on the sun suction that is illustrated in the picture which allows you to connect the caterpillar to the sun was not there! There was NO WAY to attach the mobile to the suction arm! I had to rig up a way to connect them with some durable string and while I was able to get it connected and put in the car for my daughter to love its still pretty lame that such an essential part was missing... If I were to see this in a store and could be sure that all parts were present I would buy this toy again and would recommend it to friends... but don't buy it online, go to Target and get it there instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby loves this...","review":"My baby loves this toy!

My daughter hates car rides so I needed something to distract and amuse her. The toys are all really cute, she likes the rattle the most though, and I'm not really sure what the point of the mirror is, it's tiny and blurry, but my biggest complaint is this thing is suppose to be held togther by magnets, I wouldn't mind if it actually stayed together, but it's suck a pain because everytime I pull the carseat out it comes undone. I actually recently just tied it in a knot, my daughter loves it, I just wish it wasn't so easy to undo.Update: Due to my frustration with the magnets I stopped using this, my mom got me the Bright Starts Hop Along Carrier Toy Bar and both my daughter and I like that one a lot better, she played with it a lot more. So save your money on this one and find something that stays strapped on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a mobile...suctiong cup arm, too short","review":"First off, this really isn't a mobile, nothng moves, its just a loop of fabic haning on a arm with a suction cup. The loop has three animals haning from it. This isn't so bad but the suction cup arm doesn't extend far enough from the window of our Honda Element for it to even near our child...she simply can see it. This may work fine for small cars where the child may be closer to the window but if you think it might be a issue in your car, chances are it will..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"as a gift, I received the Sassy caterpillar mobile with suction arm which we've been using to attach to my daughter's high chair tray to keep her busy. We've been using it for many months, she is now 9 mos old. Today, I noticed that there are rips on the snail's shell which is covered with some shiny greenish-blue crinkly material. It looks like from her sucking on it has caused it to come apart. I am now concerned that she has been sucking on this and ingesting this plastic(?) or whatever it is made out of, which can not be good for her or any child. It can now be easily ripped apart and could have been further ingested by my daughter. I think this is a definite safety issue for any child of any age. i have contacted Sassy and requested they recall this item!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace & Quiet in the Car!","review":"My 3-1/2 month old would scream every time I put him in the car.

He was so mesmerized by the dangling bugs that I didn't hear a peep out of him the whole car ride!! Totally worth the ten dollars I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caterpillar doesn't stay together - UPDATE","review":"I can't get the caterpillar to stay together in a circle. It has a magnet in the head and tail but doesn't stay together. Not really a mobile if it doesn't stay together. Also hangs weird without it being in a circle.3/5/07 UPDATEI contacted Sassy about the caterpillar not staying together. Their customer service was excellent. Responded the same day that they would send me a postage paid envelop to return the product. Once they received the defective mobile they sent me a new one and it stays together much better. I was very impressed with their customer service!I couldn't change the amount of stars I originally gave but I would give it 4 stars now based on the customer service and the quality of the replacement they sent."},{"rating":"1","title":"bitter","review":"I had previously tasted the pumpkin seed version of this snack, and it was very good. I went ahead and ordered them in the walnut version because walnuts are supposed to be so healthy. These turned out to be very bitter. My children had to spit them out. Some of them were bitter from the first bite, and others just had a bitter aftertaste. I was informed by Amazon that you cannot return food items, so I went back and tried them again. There seem to be some good ones among the bad, but for the most part, they have a bitter taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"I, too, enjoyed the cashew and pecan snacks, however, the walnut snacks are bitter.

Even the raccoons and squirrels would not eat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like walnuts, you'll like these","review":"I love Mrs. May's nut snacks. I had only had the Almond crunch before this, which is amazing. I liked the Walnut a little less than the almond, but it was still very good and I enjoyed it. You know when walnuts are cut they have powdery crumbs, and for this reason the bite size pieces of Walnut crunch are not as clean to eat as the Almond crunch pieces. They taste just like walnuts, with a little honey added, so if you love walnuts, you'll love this snack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, unfortuately it is garbage!!","review":"Same thing that happened to the previous poster happened to my son's toy. The turtle cup came off after the first use (and within 20 min!). My son is 8 months old and it can't even withstand the pulling of an 8 month old. And a sharp screw is revealed when the cup comes off. Luckily we noticed it before my son was injured, unfortunately I had to remove it immediately which of course upset my son, who no longer had his toy to play with. I would pay more for something that is quality so it is sad and amazing that companies put out cheap quality products that break immediately and expose dangerous parts. I would recommend that you do not buy this item. I now have to waste more time returning it to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mommy to Baby #2","review":"I bought this toy bar for my second child and absolutely loved it at first. My daughter loves to play and chew on the toys and it keeps her totally entertained for trips to the mall or doctor. It fits beautifully on my Graco Quattro Tour stroller. The big drawback is the turtle snack cup came off, revealing a screw, which scratched my daughters arm. I feel Sassy needs to recall this item and make some adjustments. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the potential hazard of the cup coming off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peice of Crap","review":"After only 2 months this toy fell apart.

I had it attached to her carrier carseat. It was pure coincidence that I happened to pull over and had to get something out of the back seat. She began to choke and had her mouth open and at first I could not figure out what was going on. I finally just put my fingers in her mouth and scooped out a piece of the shiny yellow celophane like material out of her throat. I almost couldn't even see it. I was very lucky. I have contacted the ocmpany to let them know, but I think until someone's child dies, they will not do anything. The shiny yellow material is what came off and ended up in her throat.

So did I, but I also was entertained by the unusual, always-surprising plot and the good, page-turning writing. It's hard to write simply and inoffensively for a wide audience, but Past does it very well. There's humor and suspense, as well as romance, here and just enough science to keep it interesting. I especially liked the ending, which was a natural segue into the sequels to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enormous fun!","review":"The very fast-paced plot is based on some interesting premises, there are many well-sketched characters (and some good character development), and the book is loaded with local color of several flavors. I'd add that there's a touch of innocence about the worldview that reminds me slightly of golden-age SF. I'm systematically reading my way through the series, and I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile","review":"While the overall story is interesting, I found the treatment of the female protagonist immature. The descriptions and interactions of the protagonist remind me of a teenage boy's fantasy - quite disappointing really.If you enjoy the unusual ideas and situations common to most Sci-Fi, you'll probably enjoy this book.

Looked it up on iTunes where it cost a mere 2.99. Strange when the 'real' book costs so much more....After getting through 280 pages I can only think that this is from vanity press. There are some positive things to say about the writing style, but overall this is clearly an amateur piece of work - not the bestseller it is made out to be. The reviews are slightly suspicious when you take a closer look. I won't finish this book, the storyline is both implausible and monotonous.With ebooks, and the success of series such as twilight, the market is more diverse than it has been in the last 20 years, meaning fans of quality literature need to be more discerning.

Unfortunately for me, I did not preview any of the tracks because I was impatient enough to buy the import version. I would much rather have received a CD with remixes of 1977.

But despite the fact that they are a string quartet, this is not a classical album. The intonation, many of the chord structures and a lot of the rhythms are uniquely African. \\"Bossa Baroque\\" is a particularly imaginative piece, and SSQ do a wonderful job of combining bossa rhythms with a Bach touch. This is one album that everyone should have a chance to listen to. Who would have thought that 18th century European instruments could beat with the pulse of Africa like they do here. Some of the pieces are contempory, some traditional. Paul Simon's 'Graceland' album is saluted in a medley, and Sting's \\"St. Agnes and the burning bed\\" is given the SSQ touch, and all are wonderful.

Why the 4-star review? Because I am pissed that starting in season 2 THE GOOD WIFE added a digital blur to the DVD discs on top of the optical blur that the series is shot in to obscure the age of the stars. I am irritated that the studio deliberately ships inferior video for the DVD format on seasons two and three. If season one is sharp, why can't they do that next year, and the year after for season two and three???

As color pencils on its own, they are nice; the colors are very vibrant, even more so than the normal crayola colored pencils. As watercolor pencils, they are great for the price. The thing I don't really like about them is that the pigment that is a little deeper deposited into the paper does not dissolve in water. It kind of just stays there so you don't have this seamless look of just watercolor. It looks more like both watercolor and colored pencil together. I eventually bought Derwent Inktense and they are very wonderful! Granted, they are pricier but if you're wanting even more pigmented and vibrant colors, I suggest going with the Inktense pencils."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap dust boots","review":"I got a set of these to replace my stock sway bar end links when they wore out and started rattling.

I'm psyched wounded bird has grabbed the Harem Scarem cds that they have (although there's many more never released in the u.s.).There's all the Harem Scarem cues, great songwriting, vocal harmonies to die for, guitars, but it's more downbeat & cynical, which worked at the time.Not sure someone jumping in from 2010 could get into it immediately, but this is in the top 3 of all their studio releases, and a melodic rock classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not any big hits, but who cares - this is one of JD's best","review":"This is my favorite John Denver album.

My absolute favorite song on the album (and maybe of all his work) is \\"Berkeley Woman.\\" I love the line in the song \\"a women is the sweetest fruit that God ever put on the vine.\\" This live version tells the tale of longing for another woman while at the same time feeling guilty. It's great. \\"Life is so good\\" is a simple, soulful prayer on the gift of life. \\"Joseph&Joe\\", \\"Garden Song\\", \\"Songs of\\", and \\"Southwind\\" are also classics.

Even the songs I did not like here seemed to stretch Denver's mostly self-inflicted artistic boundaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the best have an off day","review":"As a brilliant singer/songwriter, John Denver still managed to come up with a couple of turkeys during his career and this for me is one of them. At the time he exchanged his traditional acoustic sound for electric guitar which unfortunately led him to believe that he could sing rock & roll, a style to which his voice wasn't particularly suited. Nevertheless there are a couple of pearls on this album, namely WHATS ON YOUR MIND and THE GARDEN SONG. As a \\"bonus\\"(? ) you are also treated to part of John's early album WHOSE GARDEN WAS THIS which must be THE worst that he did.

My personal fav is \\"Mojo Highway\\". A half funk/half reggae opus featuring many of Peter Erskines subtle and not so subtle drum riffs. It also features the best (of the many available) versions of John Scofield's blues classic \\"Thanks Again\\".As typical on the ECM label the recording quality is stunning...particularly the bass response.

It's not something I will listen to very often though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginner","review":"The book is a great start for newbies in FEM.

The best \\"digging\\" toy we've ever had.","review":"We've had a lot of \\"digging\\" toys (gem digs etc). Most of them were really nice, but our favorite is this dino dig. I was worried that the dino pieces would be flimsy and cheesy and wouldn't go together well and would probably fall apart and fall over (like a lot of 3D plastic things). But the quality is very good and the pieces went together without any hassle and has stayed together and is sturdy. The dino stands on its own on two feet and is very durable. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"It's great!

Let's start with the clay that the dino is in. It will get all over you. Then the \\"chisel\\" will break apart in your hands. To get a good head start, run the item under hot water. It will get rid of the clay dust and make the mold more pliable. Then when you are completely frustrated after finally getting the darn dino out, be prepared to line up tiny holes to put it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was fun","review":"This was fun. It did take some work to excavate the bones. Truly probably something that we should have done over many days rather than try to make it an activity. Also the dust got all over the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids had fun with it","review":"The bones come encapsulated in a block of dry clay. The kit comes with little tools to remove the bones. It takes FOREVER to get them out. My kids were getting impatient with it (they are 7 and 9 and very impatient kids). So I showed them to wet the block, and this made it much easier and faster to get the bones out. I know it was cheating but seriously I think they would have given up on it otherwise. Anyway, they had a lot of fun putting it together once they got the bones out, and didn't need any help from me doing it. Overall a neat toy, I'm happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural Factors DGL","review":"I already knew that I was ordering a good product that I have been using for 18 months. Natural Factors has the best tasting DGL that I have found.

This was the best price I could find on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am very pleased!","review":"Between these and HCL w/ pepsin tablets, I am completely off of acid blockers. My reflux kept getting worse and they kept putting me on stronger meds. I was so miserable with fatigue, constipation, ibs, etc. that I just had to get off the meds. I searched around and found some natural remedies which actually work BETTER than the strongest acid blockers.I can finally stay awake, my hair and nails grow better and faster and I have no more IBS SYMPTOMS!!The only problem with these is they are nasty. I had to plug my nose when chewing and swallowing at first. I am now used to them so they aren't as bad.

I am not on any medication or supplements, so it couldn't have been an interaction. I can't really say that it didn't help my stomach because I don't think that I took it for long enough to say. The dizziness was enough to make me stop taking this though. They are pretty chalky and don't have the best flavor, but they aren't so bad that you can't eat them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DGL stands for Does Gag Lots","review":"I am going to force myself to keep taking it, and I will update again if my opinion changes, but right now, I'd rather have the burning and gasping for air of acid reflux than these disgusting pills. It somehow manages to be oily and powdery at the same time which defies science. I love licorice, but this tastes nothing like. They stay in your teeth 10 minutes after you're done eating them, so you get to continue to experience the flavor--without relief! I've been careful to take them 15 minutes prior to eating, and they aren't working any more than a few Tums would. I was looking for a magic pill and so far, this isn't it. I will keep trying them though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes Horrible!","review":"I have tried several different brands of DGL Licorice, and this is the worst tasting one of all.

Careful diet most effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"My opinion ONLY!","review":"Lady Abigail Weston was a twenty-five year old spinster and determined to see her younger sister, Caroline, wed well. However, without knowing what happened in the marriage bed (except the horrible things she had been told) Abby could not explain it to Caroline. To rectify this, Abigail hired someone to give her lessons!James Stevens was the illegitimate son of an earl. James thought nothing could ever surprise him again, until Abigail's request for love lessons! Curious and intrigued, he agreed!** I warn everyone up front that this book contains A LOT explicit sex! I can only recommend this book for mature readers! The love scenes go into detail and each is several pages long. Not really much of a plot to this book, except for a past paramour interfering out of jealousy. Caroline seemed, to me, as if she was thrown into the book as an after thought. The book is well written, grammar wise. But, in my opinion, the book came across to me as soft porno instead of romance. **"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"The hero's parents were absolutely horrible! They had his brother and him out of wedlock, subjecting them to the ridicule of Polite Society and denying them public acknowledgment by their own father, and wondered why they were so angry? Hmm, that's a tough one. The heroine's actions were also dishonorable and cowardly--claiming to love James while refusing to even acknowledge him in public. Needless to say, the love story was unbelievable, and the happily-ever-after ending more than a bit pat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"Great primary characters but I had massive problems with the hero's parents. I hated the way the mother completely defended the father, and accepted that the love of her life wouldn't publicly acknowledge their sons. Absolutely despicable. And the Mother kept saying to Abby (the heroine) that she should be willing to declare her love publicly if she did indeed realloy love him. I thought - how about you get their father to acknowledge them and then everyone else would follow suit!!! She should have been livid with the Earl, rather than lovey-dovey with him. Of course sons will hate a father who snubs them in public, and is too ashamed to even introduce them to their own half-siblings."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This book might be interesting to read if you have never had sex before. To read the same thing described over and over gets a bit old. I agree with the other reviewers who complain about a lack of story. She lost me at the part where the virginal Ameilia claimed she never saw her own breasts before, come on, I know its supposed to be the 1800's but unless she never changed her clothes in her entire life I don't think that's possible. The sex depicted in the book is kinda gross in my opinion, the male character constantly has to \\"relieve\\" himself and uses other women to do so. Not my idea or a romantic leading man. I like Cheryl Holts other books that I have read so far but this one is not my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the world?!","review":"The first half of the book was not that bad. But from the point where the relationship was consummated, the quality of the writing went from passable to horrifying! I'm still scratching my head as to why the author allowed the book to go down the drain...I wonder who helped her edit her work, because it was a half-arsed job."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much sex","review":"I borrowed this book from the library. I'm glad I did not spend the money. I would give this book a x rating. It was more like a porn movie than a romance novel. I will not read anymore of her novels. I would not put her in the sane category as Stephanie Laurens, Julia Quinn, or any other author that writes romance novels. I only read three chapters and that was enough for me. The three chapters that I read was all about sex. Not my kind of novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Believe","review":"I find the whole circumstances of the story unbelievable. Abigail is a beautiful 25 year old spinster. However, the reason she never wed and had a chance to find a husband is because she is busy taking care of her younger sister, Caroline, after their mother died. The age difference between the 2 sisters were only 8 years apart. That is just too small of an age gap to make it believable that Abigail is able to take care of Caroline. Also, their older brother, who is still alive, is a lord of the realm, therefore, I believe there are no financial hardship in hiring a governess, nanny, housekeeper, etc. Also 25 years old just doesn't seem that old by today's standard. The book keep going on and on about her being a 25 years old spinster. I just have a hard time overcoming the unbelievable circumstances of the story.It would be a different matter if Abigail is approaching 40. I would find that more believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erotic Romance","review":"I really enjoyed reading Love Lessons, and primarily due to the fact that it is one of the most erotic novels I have read in a long time. Cheryl Holt can conjure a very steamy atmosphere with her writing and coupled with the absence of purple prose, this one definitely deserves to be in the 'erotic romance' category.I would have been happier if she would have focused more on the main couple....It started off very nicely toward the begining, but Ms Holt introduced a lot of secondary characters which detracted from the story line. Still, it was a good read and I look forward to reading Total Surrender."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like raunchy Sex Lessons.","review":"I actually prefer romances with an erotic flair. But this story isn't romantic and sometimes the sex scenes made me feel sorry for the main character. In the interest of birth control, the author wrote a money shot into the novel, to which the heroine cries \\"Tis so beautiful!\\" I actually yelled \\"NO. NO, IT'S NOT\\" at the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWEFUL TO LEARN, USE AND KEEP COOL","review":"I had a Pioneer DVD 5-Disc home theater system and wanted a receiver to hook this and other A/V stuff(playstation, X-box, DVD, computer) to.

The controls are hard to figure out to get sound to all 5 speakers and the Sub-woofer. It feels solid but can't keep itself cool there is no cooling fan in the system just wide vents that if you look through you see the big heat sink.

Well, was I ever wrong! It wasn't about pets at all, but about giving love and shelter to troubled youths. Claire was such a gutsy heroine - someone to be admired and looked up to because she never backed down from a challenging situation. With a warm and soft heart, she reached out to the lost and lonely, and helped them find themselves and their way in life. I appreciated the slow and patient way Nick and Claire developed their friendship and grew to trust each other over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly dissatisfied with Golda's Kitchen","review":"I would advise you NOT to purchase an apron from Golda's kitchen online. I paid $33 for what was pictured as a nice blue & white striped apron and yet when I received a boring plain white one they stated that although they had a photograph of the blue & white one - the second bulleted item stated that it was white. They refused to pay the return shipping to exchange the apron. And then after a bunch of back and forth through emails (as they do not take any cutomer complaints over the phone and simply direct you to an emial adress) it turns out that they don't even carry the pictured apron at all! So be certain you read all of the small print and disregard what you see in their photographs before purchasing. Dealing with them has been absolutely infuriating and not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This book or should I say short study guide is very basic.

I ordered sweet honeysuckle, not only did it NOT smell like honeysuckle at all the scent was WAY too strong and had a heavy, musty, incense-like scent. Definitely not worth 30 dollars + shipping.

There are a few great points: when the Doctor is conversing with Chris about regeneration and what it's like. There is also a point in the book where the Doctor is (faking) dead and buried. A few chapters are from his point-of-view while he's under the ground (very interesting). I think the basic plot is clouded out by the fact that the Doctor is constantly worrying (foreseeing?) his regeneration and Chris' emotional problems. Oh yeah, this is another PSI story, just so you know. (Come on Kate, find another plot device.

I still can't believe they left out the extra footage. You actually get to see newts family and you get to know things about Ripley that you wouldn't know. Alien 3 is okay but can be a bit depressing at times, no offence to David Fincher though, but it lacks in the same sort of rush as the first two and stands at the bottom in terms of quality. Alien resurection is excellent. Sigourney Weaver looks amazing and her half Alien character is often funny and creepy. The supporting cast are good and it's great to see Wynona Ryder back.

Aliens is the extended director's cut, and has literally hundreds of still shots of the cast, as well as production photos of equipment and vehicles.

Probably, but did they include any face-huggers, queen mothers and acid for blood? I think not!Alien Legacy is one of the best buys on the market, you get all 4 films including special effects enhancements and the behind-the-scenes, making of Aliens for a very reasonable price. This had to be the largest purchase I have ever made on Amazon, but it was more than worth it.The quality of sound and picture for this set is just like seeing them in the theatre for the first time.

There are tons of new sceneces on that set AND most importantly all the movies were reworked and are BRIGHTER CRISPER and well just plain unbelievable ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and simple box set.","review":"This is the much older Alien Legacy box set containing the oldest DVD editions of the four Alien movies and offers little of anything new in terms of DVD extras.

Since I was so pleased, recently, I purchased another wicker file cabinet. The quality is good. I would not hesitate to recommend it.

The fact that it deals with post-breast cancer makes this story twice as grand! Jenni had been cancer free for five years, yet the pain was as raw and as real as ever. Never did she ever think she'd find a man who would be willing to love her knowing what the cancer had done to her!But when Jenni's nephew, Cory, caused Todd to walk into their lives she would soon discover that not all men looked on the outside of a person. No matter how scarred or flawed we think we are, true love looks on the inside!This is one of my favorites of the entire Loving series (I also thought the first book in this series was great). I like how the author develops romance and outward expressions of that love throughout the book instead of waiting until the last chapter; and Todd was a sweetheart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NIGHTMARE MACHINE","review":"I WISH I HAD NEVER BOUGHT THIS RADIO.

In fact, the book states that it \\"is outside the scope of this book to teach you the basics of programming ASP.Net.\\" I don't think it would have been too much to expect a small primer on each of the technologies, even if it meant adding an appendix or two.

Some conversations were added to make it more interesting, but most of it was true. I am reading tons of bios from the same series (the Childhood of Famous Americans series). I would encouage everyone to read this book and other books of the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disapointing Victory record","review":"Comeback Kid has held a special place in my heart for several years. A band who has been good to my local hardcore scene, CBK was known for consistently solid performances and equally solid albums. I use the past tense because \\"Broadcasting\\" was one of the biggest disappointments of 2007. The first post Scott album from CBK lacks the urgency and depth of Turn it Around and Wake the Dead. While not terrible, the album sounds like it was made to appeal to an MTV crowd. More polished, and hardly engaging. If you've never heard CBK, do not get this album. Pick up Turn It Around. I have a feeling that this album will go down as either the last listen-able CBK album, or a decided flop in the band's career that will be relegated to the status of the favorite of a small pocket of fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"The production is on par with a lot of other stuff going on, but if you're looking for something as engaging as the first two albums, especially Wake the Dead, don't expect it from Broadcasting. Scott Wade defined the front-end sound of Comeback Kid, and, while sometimes bands can move forward after changing singers, I believe Comeback Kid just moved in a different direction. Not altogether bad, but not the earlier Comeback Kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!!!!!","review":"COMEBACK KID'S LAST TWO ALBUMS WERE FILLED WITH GREAT HOOKS, CATCHY SING-A-LONGS AND SOME PRETTY GOOD BREAKDOWNS.

SECONDLY THE HOOKS AND SING-A-LONGS ARE JUST PLAIN BLAND. LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE MUSIC IS FAIRLY UNINTERESTING AND SOUNDS LIKE A THOUSAND OTHER \\"OLD SCHOOL MELODIC HARDCORE\\" BANDS THAT CLOG UP THE SCENE.

Does Dr. Pressman like to hear himself talk? Where does he form his ideas, values, ideology... ? The book carries no real (other than speculative) substance. I can gather only that the authors delight in self-aggrandizing their views with nothing to back up their thesis other than relationship that the two claim to share...a fairy tale? Anyone could have written this book with half an imagination and a good dose of Disney in their fantasies. Pathetic attempt to publish, shame on the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely difficult to read, not very helpful","review":"This book is extremely complex. The book assumes you already have a great understanding of magnetic recording terminology and physics. I wouldn't need the book if I understood it already.

Terminology & technology is often referenced w/o any explanation to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good guide to raising questions on the right career match for an ADDer","review":"Don't expect this book to give you the answers to your struggles with ADD in the workplace. This book is not a cookbook on the issue,and it rather encourages introspection to discover who you really are and then take some action: your job has to match your skills and your interests, and it has to be an activity where your downside shows as little as possible. It is the only way to overcome ADD in an easier way and to achieve success. The author shows, with some story telling, different possibilities for different people. Some advice is also given about optimizing performance at work taking into account ADD traits (I wish she had been a bit more comprehensive in this part). Overall a very good book and an important addition to the ADD library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but of limited application to most adults","review":"I found this book interesting but it came up short in application to a wide population of people who have not been in therapy.

In an Adventure with Ahab (Whaling). I read both, hoping the second would be better than this one, but was disappointed. There is almost no action, funny awkward situations or even inappropriate material that could bring a laugh. The characters in the story, especially the Captain, are mostly incompetent and dishonest, not very funny characteristics. Try Bored of the Rings or a George Carlin book, heck, even Dave Barry is funnier than these time-wasters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get McAfee Instead","review":"You will be sorry if you downloaded this product, or actually any Norton products into your computer. Norton software is very intrusive. It goes into your system and tries to disable everything and change the codes in windows so that it can start controlling your computer its own way. It's a big fat virus itself. The worst part is the tech support team is very retarded. They don't know how to fix the problems they created and they try to pin pon you around to different departments until you give up calling them anymore.

Tech support was polite and well-intentioned but really only suggested vague guesses or repeated uninstalls and reinstalls -- time-consuming operations with no real benefit.I gave it every benefit of the doubt for a few weeks, but finally my business couldn't withstand any more downtime or hours spent trying to get it to work.

I have a system with 2 hard drives where the second drive is primarily used for backup. I had GoBack installed, and there was a problem with the backup drive. My PC would not boot to Windows because GoBack was not able to access all of its data. I tried unhooking the backup drive, and still couldn't boot to Windows. During bootup, there is a GoBack splash screen saying \\"press spacebar for options\\", but pressing spacebar yields an error message, followed by \\"press any key to restart\\".

I have had to uninstall and reinstall the current Internet Security program, just to get the Live Update to work properly. My computer now makes a clicking noise when I turn it on, and that is only the beginning of the negative repercussions this has caused to my computer.

The CPU's are continuously maxed out. My laptop now overheats without even running additional software. I have been blocked from using my home network, a problem with no apparent solution. I may as well be using a dial-up modem instead of the Cable internet I'm paying for. I would expect the Symantec knowledge base to have solved these issues long ago, but they maintain that none of them exist. The real travesty is that I cannot convert my subscriptions back to the 2005 version, which ran beautifully.

That's it! The installation program went fine without a problem, and I'm using the NSW program now. There are a few upgrades from NSW 2005 and my computer seems to run quicker overall.

Magic is integrated into the culture fairly modestly, with a few people having special powers or qualities. While there's some evil, like the first book, this one seemed a bit lighter to me. I'm afraid I saw through the major plot device immediately, but then I'm far from the target teenager audience. That didn't keep me from enjoying the tale.

On finishing this book, it is difficult to see how it might have been improved except by, perhaps, not writing it. The author's claims are ludicrous rhetoric, easily falsifiable with even the most cursory glance at the facts. One suspects that the entire work was meant to justify the Air Chief's failures as a commander, besides the obvious politically nationalist angle in a nation that has never really other than toyed with democracy.

This would have made distribution to the students easy. Instead, the large box we received was divided into sections, each section containing crayons of the same color.

I found his unending attempts to use women (seducing, beating if they refused him, and out right rape) so distasteful that I gave it the two star rating (and since I would never read another in the series because of this-even if given free, maybe this should be a one star rating)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easily offended, but George MacDonald Fraser did it.","review":"A little too offensive.

The story is risque and winking rather than ribald. Flashman reports how bad he is, but it's mostly words. He casts himself as a coward, but in fact is the only guy on all the scenes of critical events (even if he fled there). There seems to be some accurate history here (footnotes even), the generals are so quakingly incompetent they must be real, and the epidemic warlordism still rings true.

And over the years as I eagerly awaited more of the great cad's adventures, I discovered that Fraser was not only giving us one of the great picaresque characters of all time, but a lot of 19th century history as well. How wonderful that Harry is in the center of every (disasterous) major event of that time period. When he meets Lincoln, no less, Lincoln, our former president, an able evaluator of scurrilous humans, senses that the man he is talking to is not who he claims to be.

A British Gentleman, O.B.E. and all that, once told me Flashman was one of his favorites. Take that as a high compliment Mr. Fraser. My only gripe is that the long awaited Civil War novel has yet to appear. Try one, they are very re-readable and at the moment available.

In this, the first effort in the acclaimed \\"Flashman\\" series, Fraser is at the top of his game. In this spare, but well crafted narrative we follow the early career of the datardly and unrepentant scoundrel, Harry Flashman in the first Afghanistan War. It is rare that a book can make you howl with laughter while teaching you history at the same time. Flashman undergoes a harrowing experience on the retreat from Kabul, in the process becoming one of the most delightfully politically-incorrect heroes in popular fiction.

I understood a \\"rogue\\" to be a \\"mischievous person.\\" The character \\"Harry Flashman\\" is pond scum. In particular, I do not find the beating of women humorous or entertaining. The best thing I can do with this book is recycle the paper. The best thing you can do is find a different author."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining read","review":"I was recommended this book by a friend who said that he had managed to get a number of his friend's hooked on the series. I can see why. The storyline is quite clever and the character of Flashman is an original and refreshing one. Certainly the kind of book you can easily spend hours reading.Overall I'd say this is a boy's book since the main topics relate to Flash's military and sexual adventures. However, I'm pretty sure that there are some females out there would enjoy the fun too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Show Ole Flashy","review":"Probably there is little I can say that hasn't already been said in one or two of the other reviews below. The story reminds me of the movies that were made in the thirties, starring Cary Grant and Victor MacGlothlin. Stout upper lip, carry on for England and the Queen (and all that rot). Best of all, Flashy is such a bounder, but is forthright enough to admit it.I can see why this series is so popular, because it never takes itself seriously. If you keep in mind as to the 'times' it was purportedly written in, you can get by some of the terrible stereotyping that occurs in the story. But, I would never look to have Flashy made 'politically correct', he is who he was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, not to be missed","review":"This is a fantastic book, with the magic the the first book in a series always contains, even though most of us flashie fans count the one of the others as the best. The point of view is so unique, the warped view of an old scoundrel looking back on himself young, all make it funny, insightful, adventurous and just darn good reading! Do not miss it, and do not miss the others...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you would expect from an anti-hero","review":"Harry Flashman is the quinticential anti-hero: a liar, cheat, adulterer, poltroon, theif and braggart. He is also seen as the very model of Victorian virtue. And therein lies the appeal and delicious duplicity that has made the Flashman papers so popular. We, the reader, are in on the joke.In _Flashman_, the template is set for Fraser's other Flashman novels: Flash's unceremonious expulsion from public school, his \\"shotgun wedding,\\" and the wildly undeserved accolades for bravery and gallantry while Flashy engages in every manner of dubious and lecherous behaviour.For fans of historical fiction, military history or slightly off-colour humor, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better with age!","review":"I first read the Flashman series (then only six volumes) as an eighteen year old history student. The first book had me rifling through regimental histories of the 11th Hussars and various other sources, constantly following the story of Harry Flashman. Not knowing any better, it took a friend to break it to me gently that Mr McDonald Fraser was having a lend of me. I mention this as testiment to the authenticity of the work, the careful research that obviously tied Harry to Victorian history and the pacy way in which GMF writes. The characterisation of Harry Flashman is brilliant. A self-confessed anti hero, you just can't really dislike him, especially when he allows his humanity to occasionally sneak through, and with the humour he uses to recount his story. Cardigan, Elphinstone et.al. are famously described warts and all. If you like history, if you have a sense of humour and you can read English, then you must read Flashman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent book","review":"This turned out to be a lighter video than expected.I would stick with the book which is excellent and ignore the video.Brett"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book to me.

His understanding of the tribal nature of the Iraqis has no parallel in the US. Americans, especially those who've not visited the Middle East, have little concept of the reality of the region and the daily challenges faced by Westerners who attempt to function there. Etherington painted a portrait of the region that is utterly realistic and authentic. His prose is readable and refreshing in the use of terms and phrases more commonly used in the UK. I thank him for sharing his time and expertise with the Iraqis and his attempts to make the situation better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selfagrandizing Fiction - Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"Most of this book is complete rubbish which does nothing to outline the situation in Iraq but seeks to bolster Mark Etherington's ego. In fact the very fact that he wrote this book making him look like some kind of hero speaks to his character and the character of the book. Etherington personally placed the security of the compound at Al Kut at risk when he disregarded security improvements recommended by the civilian security contractors. He further placed the personnel in the compound at risk by failing to evacuate the compound at the recommendation of the same security contractor.He had no plan to coordinate with III Corps to facilitate the mobilization of the QRF or any other support of that nature. He gave contradicting reports so that he could preserve the illusion that all was well in Al Kut refusing to evacuate the compound.Save your money - do not buy this book. This is one man's ego trip that in no way represents the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad security and bad decisions","review":"I was on the site during the big battle in the book, when Etherington insisted on staying to negotiate with insurgents who weren't interested in negotiating but were buying time to dig in around us. In fact, they were looking for hostages, preferably American. The CPA compound was renovated at an expense of $20,000,000 but that did not include fortifications for the river bank because the governor liked the view of the river. When the compound was surrounded by hundreds of insurgents on April 6th, that exposed flank made it possible to shell the compound at will.I could go on but there's steam coming out of my ears right now and I shouldn't write under those conditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dream Sequence & A Sly Seduction Scene","review":"One of the earliest Noir classics the film features a justly famous and totally spellbinding dream sequence but also has one of the drollest and funniest failed-seduction scenes in movie history(McGuire only magages to get Tallichet to remove her socks).

The theoretical framework of Smith's approach to the application of force and the implications of applying force to various types of situations is enlightening and instantly appealing. Smith encourages the reader to engage with ideas of the use of force that depart from the norm by providing real life experience and examples to underscore the utility that is the central thematic premise of the book. Great for military and non-military readers alike. Especially recommended to academics and security studies students who are seeking a constructivist examination of force and its ultimate purpose in the contemporary security environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Dull and poorly written.

For someone whose experiences would, I presume, give him a lot to say, he has a lot of trouble saying it in this book. There really is no real strong thesis and he makes few overt arguments in favor of hi spoint. The book rambles, moves from vignette to vignette, and never gets to the point.

Unlike most Surrender models cast from public auditions, she was not an empty headed doll with large hooters and a foreign accent. When she spoke, she had the charisma of a studio star like Charlize Theron or Heather Graham. Imdb posters all wonder where she went and what she does now. Maybe I'm biased since one dream scene has a line, \\"Cindy, I'm home!\\" that reminded me of a girl I had a crush on in high school. Otherwise, this movie is a very silly spoof of Star Trek featuring Spock and Khan-like characters, lazer battles, engine repair, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice compendium","review":"A very nice compendium, and I love the illustrations.

They worked OK, but they don't allow as much water to pass through the bottom end as they allowed to enter the top. When it rains heavily water will leak out the top of the diverter and run down the side of your house. I patched mine up with foam sealant, but it was annoying. After two years these units took a beating from the sun and basically fell apart. The plastic in mine wasn't very thick and seemed to break down after being outside for a while -- hopefully they've modified the design. I've been using the RainReserve diverter units for a couple of months now, and I'm very impressed. Better plastic, MUCH stronger, and they have a hatch that can be removed to clean out the entire unit. The hoses are bigger too (and you can hook up two barrels to one diverter to fill them in parallel). Best of all, they don't suffer from the capacity issue that plagues this one. The extra $10 is worth it. Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"Product works good as long as your not getting a extreme amount of rain, but I would still recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rain Saver:Rain Spout Diverter unit","review":"I had this installed because my rain barrel was \\"around the Corner\\" from my downspout.

If you are wavering, trying to decide if you will rent this, DON'T. It is shot terribly - horrible angles, terrible lighting, just...atrocious. The dialog and script, plot and pacing - all abysmal. The acting is beyond bad and well and truly into the realm of unwatchable. Even for C-horror (the relatively new genre of shot-on-video-no budget-\\"backyard\\" productions that are so prevalent in this age of inexpensive video filmmaking), this one is a waste of time in every aspect. You can very safely ignore the four star rating one review chose to bestow on this. You can also safely ignore the somewhat catchy DVD artwork, which admittedly suckered me in. Just do yourself a giant favor and keep looking - there are many good C-horror movies out there (if you enjoy C-horror).

In the past two years, no book (besides the Old Testament) has been her selection more than When the Whippoorwill Calls. The Blue Ridge family it depicts finds out the federal government is buying up their mountain to make way for the Blue Ridge Parkway. In the process, the seven-year-old protagonist learns a lesson of hope from the example of her father, who struggles with, but in the end adapts to, their move to the flatlands. The beauty of the story, though, is in its language. Like the mountain people she writes about, Ms. Ransom has a gift for expressing complicated sentiment in simple and concrete ways. After a number of readings, it dawned on me that I was reading good poetry. I should mention that the lllustrations are lovely and the layout of the pages is attractive and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Wait for the Movie.","review":"I got through about the first three stories in this book and threw it away.

The boot does not look as if it would be waterproof and would require some sort of sealent to be used to prevent any corrosion, so be prepared with this before you climb to the top of your mast to install this unit. The other problem is the terminals, these do not look as if they are corrosion proof. I would suggest that you cut the terminals off completely and use the copper wire to terminate on your antenna. Alternatively terminate with some kind of corrosion proof plated terminals. So if you are armed with some waterproof sealant and some corrosion proof terminals this unit may be for you! I have bought three on the units but it is not worth me returning them. The postage for the three units was more than the units were worth in the first place.

There are a lot I'm forgetting I'm sure. Anyway this one is just a mess with the direction they take with the new story line with old episodes. The new animation that was made for this is of poor quality and the voices don't match up, i.e. Porky Pig sounds like Bugs Bunny.This could have been one of their first compilations so it wasn't as good as what came after it I suppose. A shame, I'd love to watch this in October but I'd rather just watch the unedited shorts from the 'Looney Tunes Golden Collection'.

The only saving grace is original voices. But its just not anything a true looney tunes fan would want to see. Now that I've seen it, I will avoid it at all costs.

There are many bizarre lines in the book, and Marilyn miraculously predicts she will wind up dead with a bottle of pills in her hand. While it is true she always believed she would die young (a la Jean Harlow) this is just a little too absurd. In fact, the whole book is absurd. It's not really worth reading at all.

Richly illustrated, it is a short story about another of Winnie the Pooh's quests for honey, a scheme that involves an inflated baloon, bees and Christopher Robin's cork gun.The book, like other Milne's stories, is very sweet and uses simple words that even a toddler will understand, but the underlying humor of a simple-minded bear trying to con bees (unsuccessfully) might cause your child to giggle and want to read other Winnie the Pooh stories. The book itself is printed on cardboard that can take a beating.

While there were a few interesting how-tos, I found most of the exercises mundane and designs mediocre. I would, instead recommend the How-to-Wow InDesign or the InDesign Cookbook if you're looking for a design oriented InDesign book (too true, not very many InDesign graphic design books out there, but plenty others if all you want to do are print/book and text heavy docs). Pass on this and take a looksee at the other two which I found inspiring, beautifully designed and well laid out - worth 5*."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to reitre my LP","review":"Heartbeats & Triggers is a great album from this 80's band. It looks like during the span of their career they have released a handful of albums. Though I have only heard a few of the songs on the other albums, I still think this is their strongest release.Some of my favorites on this album have to be their classic, Everywhere That I'm Not, along with, Necessary Spinning, and When I Am With You. Another great song is, Sleepless Snakes which is of course a protest to the Cold War and the nuclear arms race. And in the 80's, who didn't have a nuclear protest song?The band is really good at quick guitar riffs and fast drum beats in their songs. Combine that with the lyrics and good vocals and there you have a winner. And again, this is one of those bands from the 80's that deserved more attention than they received."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great price!","review":"These shirts are worth $12 or more per shirt.

Nice to have such a big bottle of white (especially since sets of paint so seldom come with white). It does smell a bit odd, but not strongly so, and it's not really that unpleasant.My only beef is that the cap broke (I don't think it broke in shipping; I think I broke it carrying it in my bag), so I can't store the bottle on its side in my daughter's crafts box.

I owe a big portion of my CEH certification to Michael Gregg and this book.

The Bible has all the prophecies in it, but sometimes it is confusing for a lay person to understand them. This is because there are bits of prophecy thoughout the Bible and they are not necessarally in the order in which they have happened or will happen. The title of this book mystifies me because there is only one chapter devoted to angels and their roles. Perhaps someone suggested that title because of the popularity of the topic of angels at the time this book was released. I would and do recommend this book to my friends. Too bad it is out of print now.

It is a good companion to the Boys Adrift and gives me a better understanding of where Dr Sax is coming from. As a parent I will change some discipline action now that I understand that my daughter will understand if I say I am 'disappointed' in her behavior.

I came from a \\"we are all the same\\" bias but Leonard Sax convinced me otherwise. He managed to do so while being respectful to both genders.This book is engaging and well researched. As promised by the author, in chapter 1, he backs up all his statements about how girls and boys are different with documented studies from peer-reviewed studies. But don't let me give you the wrong impression that this is a dry read. On the contrary, \\"Why Gender Matters\\" is a compelling read. It is filled with interesting stories and great suggestions for parents.Dr. Jenn Bermanwww.DoctorJenn.comAuthor ofThe A to Z Guide to Raising Happy, Confident Kids"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, do more research than this book","review":"A lot of the research that Dr. Sax is quoting is seriously generalized. There is very little research that has been done on children's brains, so many of the claims he is making about boys and girls is actually based on research done on adult men and women. some of his claims are even based on research done on rats. He obviously has to cite all these claims, so it's easy to look up for yourself. Be wary of his advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any school teacher/parent","review":"While I may not agree with every single one of Dr Sax's opinions, this book is well organised, well written, and most of all, it irelies on a vast compilation of scientific research, which gives it a solid foundation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservative Bias of Yesteryear","review":"There is so much great literature out there on the subject of gender in education. Unfortunately that this book is not one of them. It is clear after the first chapter that Sax has an agenda, baggage that he wants us to understand about boys and girl that all too often lacks scientific backing.This is a great text to represent the minority opinion in the field. Contemporary scholarship makes this book too easy to refute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex Differences are Hard-Wired.","review":"This brilliant and highly readable book demolishes the 70's fantasythat sex differences are socially constructed. Dr. Sax, both a family physician and psychologist, writes compellingly and with sly humor on a number of interesting topics such as aggression, sex, discipline, and drugs. \\"Why Gender Matters\\" is thoroughly researched and guaranteed to challenge conservatives as well as liberals. Many members of both the medical and educational establishments really dislike this book so Sax must be doing something right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sax&Gurian Discredited","review":"The research and views presented in this work are wholly without merit and have been refuted.[..]When a school district in Vermillion Parish, LA attempted to institute gender segregated education based on the views in this book,they ended up having to scrap the program and settle a suit with the ACLU in the face of a federal court injunction.The material in this book is not science, it is not even academic psychology, rather it is the product of gross incompetence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"More genuinely new and relevant information in this volume than in anything I've read in a long time.

Yes you can read the tutorials on line, but they don't talk about the particular XML file you are working on, so it's slow going.Even with this book it was slow going.

I don't look at books the way a person who has never read a book on negotiation would. Such a person could find this book OK or could even like it ... Perhaps.To me, there is nothing new here. Sensationalistic title words such as STRATEGIC and BREAKTHROUGH are poor taste at best or misleading advertising at worst.Just as there are too many books on time management, there are far to many books on negotiation.

This is required reading for any Welles fan and an invaluable tool for anybody who has to write an essay on CITIZEN KANE.Carringer's writing style is engaging and eloquent without being too academic. He doesn't bombard the reader with a million esoteric film terms but instead instills his prose with an infectious passion for his subject.

One reviewer says that the movie was stupid, with cheap laughs, but gives it 5 stars??? Cheap laughs come from very staged scenes. They wanted to show people being startled, so they have the older boy cleaning the tub at 6 a.m. by getting inside the tub, closing the shower curtain and making no noise - don't think much cleaning is going to get done. But it does allow the mother and the boy to be startled when she opens the shower curtain and finds him in the tub.Aside from the adorable, talented canine playing the family dog, the acting is not good. Still, it's a clean movie that children may find entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it a zero","review":"This is the worst Harlequin Presents I have ever read.

Merton lets us in on some very surprising information, for example, he was planning to take a Tibetan guru to learn Tibetan Buddhist Tantric meditation techniques. he comments on Sufiem, Zen, Taoism, Hindooism, and Buddhism with great eloquence, although his style is a bit dull. Even so, it is a wonder that he wasn't excommunicated for his ecumenicism. Few Christians that I know of would be so willing to look with an open heart and mind into the world of eastern mystical practices without being superior or condemning. He looks upon these practices with reverence and respect. Still, it is hard to get much out of such a small book, and little is really said, either about his own personal struggles or the religions in question. A nice addition includes his interviews with Llamo Thondup, the 14th Dalai Llama. If you're into Merton, this is a nice book, but it is not really for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to see Fairies","review":"Wasn't what I expected, compared to his owl books.

After a few chapters it started to dawn on me that Mr Weinberger truly felt that Hollywood owed him because he had an MBA (a fact that he reminds the reader of at any given opportunity). I live in Hollywood and have not climbed the ranks yet either, but at least I am giving it more than a year. Mr Weinberger came off as a whiny, immature spoilt brat.

It is also not an accurate representation of the great Hollywood job hunt. The book speaks volumes about his personality in that he was unable to land the sort of job that he sought in all the months he was in LA. These jobs are simply not that difficult to get. The ending was particularly whiny - all people in entertainment are unethical and mean-spirited and now that he knows this he doesn't really want a job anyway. So there! Please ... Mr. Weinberg returned to NY to rejoin the investment banking community!

The stories are not hilarious or cutting edge in any way; rather they are the mundane ups and downs of possible opportunities. One of the major stories is an interview to be Alec Baldwin's assistant. Yes, the interview is the major part of the story. All the while the author (in my opinion) is looking at the book as the way to get back into Hollywood. (An early part of the book describes how the scene would look in camera angles and at the end there is a gleeful note that the book has been optioned as a screenplay.) Overall, the author does not understand the byzantine rules by which Hollywood operates and I didn't gain much insight from his book either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Section on regulation very disappointing","review":"I bought this book because I recently joined the in-house legal department of a telecom company and wanted to know more about telecom regulation. I saw the book in a bookstore and, seeing that it had about 150 pages on regulation, ordered it through amazon later. Big mistake. The regulation section is a series of almost completely random articles on the subject of regulation - whatever they could get a contributor to write about, I guess. I wanted a structured intro into US telecom regulation. While there is some coverage it is not presented as a guide and there is a lot of utterly useless stuff - for an example, a discussion of the Gambian experience in deregulation (I wish I was making this up..).

When I read the book to a group of students they really enjoyed telling me where all the clues were in the pictures.

After three months I am still trying to understand music notes (that look like spaghetti to me) and the proper way to hold a guitar (hand placements). This book was not written for beginners. Who ever wrote this book may have had a working knowledge of playing a guitar but does not know how to teach beginning students how to play.As you can tell I am very disappoint and I feel cheated in my purchase.

She said it uses a different method to key an identification. I ordered a copy from Amazon. My friend was correct; it does use a different method - a much simpler and less ambiguous method. I have even been able to use this book to identify plants by remembering the shapes of their leaves.I bought the softcover edition. It seems rugged enough to stand field use and is a good size to slip into a day pack or a cargo pocket in a pair of hiking pants.It has been said that, if all you know is the name of something, you know nothing.

Pattern recognition books usually have pretty pictures of flowers arranged by color and then require you to search many pages to find one that looks like your flower. Newcomb's takes an alternative approach; it requires that you actually look at the flower. The key system is simple to use; for example, how many petals does it have, do the leaves alternate or are they on opposite sides of the stem, is it an herb, bush, or vine, etc. Only after narrowing down the possibilities extensively do you arrive at the pattern recognition stage and have only a few possibilities from which to choose.

What did he learn?His description of the Aikido organization he was involved with was pretty sad too. All the senior teachers sounded rather pathetic.

As someone with an interest in Aikido, it kind of turned me off the whole thing.I think a bit less reporting and a bit more introspection, as well as a more careful control of the narrative to avoid confusion in the reader, would have made it a better book.

The Zimmerman, the Hosokawa, Yun, Verese, Holliger and Carter pieces need to be collected together on a series of recordings and the Bach either jettisoned or sequestered.

Because I want to communicate with people my own age when I go to Russia, I know that theyre not going to speak all prim and proper-I know I don't speak English that way! While decency would prevent me from saying many things, also for fear of my own life, it's great to have the vocab as well as to teach it to English speaking friends so that together, you can pretend to compliment people in a language they don't understand.

Set on an army base in (apparently) the 1960s, this book tries to blend farce with love story with meditation on the fallacy of God. It doesn't ever really all come together, and in fact no one element works very well on its own either. The farce aspect just wasn't that funny, the love story was hoary and trite, and the meditations of the cruelty and indifference of God seemed rather forced into the rest of it. There are some good scenes here and there, and a large cast of nutty characters, but rarely was I made to care about any of them.

Minor Threat is one of my favorite bands so I was really looking forward to the Pailhead material with Ian MacKaye, and interestingly they ended up being my favorites on the disc.

The original vinyl is the only way to hear this song begin on the first beat. The PAILHEAD cd that preceded this one made the same mistake with this same song, although not as much was cut off there as on SIDE TRAX. I bought this CD partly to correct that problem, but no such luck. At least the other Ministry reissue, EARLY TRAX, corrected this problem with the song, \\"Every Day Is Holloween\\".

Craven even rips off his famous \\"not-alone-in-the-bathtub-during-a-dream-sequence\\" from the original \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\"!! What is with the blue tinge to everything?

No surprises there but the real surprise was that I found the original murky, muddled and incoherent. Am I alone in that?This mess has been given a coat of polish; the story, such as it is, has been streamlined and it actually benefits from being dumbed down for a dumb American audience with plenty of CGI effects, always a crowd pleaser.I didn't care much for it, or its technology-gone-awry message but it should stop a gap when there's nothing else to do.I still wonder, has it, or its Japanese predecessor, any relation to the 1988 shocker - also called Pulse - with Cliff de Young which explored a very, very similar theme?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost flatlined","review":"Pulse is yet another remake of a Japanese horror film, but this one boasts that it has a screenplay by horror master Wes Craven. Whether or not that's true, Pulse doesn't offer much that we haven't seen before in the tons of drivel, PG-13 horror remakes before it. The ungodly good looking young cast, including Veronica Mars' Kristen Bell, Lost's Ian Somerhalder, Jonathan Tucker, and Christina Millian; are pretty much nothing worth noting either, but is that really a surprise. That aside, there are some wonderfully creepy moments to behold thanks to some great CGI effects, and the film's apocalyptic ending is a nice shot in the arm to boot. Those good points aside, the rest of Pulse is horror fodder, even with some re-edited moments to remove the PG-13 rating. Worth a look if for some reason you like the films to come out of the wave of Japanese PG-13 remakes, but otherwise there is plenty of other horror films that are far better and far more deserve your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Pulse is dead","review":"They should leave this stuff to the Japanese.Like the previous writer had said,Who would go to this college.I would of said the town,city and state.If the people can't handle the truth it is not my problem.Anyway our main hero here is Mattie,a confused woman who can't understand why her boyfriend isn't returning her calls.Well he's not himself Mattie you see your sleazy lover has been spending way too much time on his computer with viruses.He now just unleashed it through ways of communication.All your friends are gone.Its up to her and whats his name to save the day or night or whatever.Maybe they should save it from itself.The only character who made in impact was Brad Dourif.He was even smart enough not to stay.Final words RENT PREY INSTEAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Booo...I mean zzzzzzzz","review":"I think there was some interesting commentary trying to be made here.

Even the Jason and Freddy Krueger movies did a better job of making you care about the victims. All you know about these people is that they sleep around and like to hack into computers.3.) Good acting - self-explanatory; none of the cast members are likely to have an Academy Award in their future.4.) A coherent plot - if the ghosts are dependent on the communications network, then why don't they disappear after the infrastructure collapses?

Craig Venter and Francis Collins (the two de facto leaders of the Human Genome Project), an article co-written by Dr. Collins, articles on business and philosophical aspects of genomics, etc.Overall, I thought this book was interesting. It doesn't get the 5th star because of the sort of hodge-podge feel to the book (it is an anthology of somewhat disparate articles not originally intended to be published together) ... which more assertive editing may have solved.

You go away feeling that the world is a cold and evil place, and I all but shivered in my bed afterwards. After 90 minuites of violence and death in a bleak, cold amphibian world, I took one look at the repulsive cover and realised that it was created as a warning by some well intentioned graphic designer who wished to warn people away from this movie. do not waste your money!

Half of the guitar fills sound like Zakk Wylde & the rhythm section seems small & talentless.The vocals sound pedestrian & at times heavily produced & while they may sound powerful they are not distinctive. The singer's ability to carry a note is admirable, but range & power does not equal interest.

Alas, when he abandons the 'civic' discourse of the eighteenth century to address the world of Blake and Hazlitt he gets into a bit of a mess. His comments on Blake are eccentric to say the least.

After 500 plus pages of character development, we finally get to what passes for action. The problem is, you don't really care what happens to anyone and you know Wolfe can't possibly wrap this up in the final 200 pages. And he doesn't. He needs an epilogue for that. Did no editor dare tell the emperor he has no clothes? This is not to say there aren't passages of great Tom Wolfe writing, particularly when he delves into the life of his main character Charlie Croker. But please, Mr. Wolfe...you don't need to impress us with how much you learned driving around Atlanta neighborhoods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsatisfying Last Minute epiphanies","review":"Word by word, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, scene by scene, chapter by Chapter I savored Wolf's novel A Man In Full. Then I reached the climax with its absurd, paradoxical epiphanies and subsequent celebration of cynicism triumphant in Wes Jordan's office. Other, more satisfying choices were available for Charlie . He didn't have to be caught up in the despair driven epiphany of Conrad the big handed Stoic particularly at a moment when Cap'm Charlie's trophy wife Serena was beginning to show a spark of character, affection, intelligence and authentic support for the Sixty Minute Man. Tom Wolf is one of my favorite authors and aside from the ending I enjoyed every second of his narration. I found the \\"saddlebags\\" scene particularly vivid, hilarious and frightening.

I did, anyway. Likewise, the power brokers and poverty peddlers will find themselves skewered as well.All in all, an incredibly satisfying story. I put down the book comfortable that the cosmic scales of justice had balanced themselves nicely.The last 200 pages or so (of the hardcover) simply cannot be put down. I rarely find myself so completely hooked in a story, as I was when I found the wild arrangement of sub-plots finally tying into a perfect weave. Mr. Wolfe deserves congrats for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted : Editor for Famous Former Journalist","review":"Oh dear. This book provides indisputable evidence that once you become a Famous American Writer, no editor will dare to tell you when your writing stops being witty and perceptive and becomes instead a tedious, self-indulgent bore. No doubt Wolfe-as-reporter benefited mightily from the editor's pencil and A Man in (Very)Full shows all too clearly that Wolfe-as-novelist has retained this need. Repetitive, fetishistically obsessed with items of clothing, and badly paced, the book nonetheless still contains enough stunning passages to show what might have been. Finally, as others have already pointed out, the ending is a brutally incompetent disaster, a garbled summing up of the characters' fate. Presumably by this stage the author had had enough of his characters and their story, a sentiment many readers will have come to share."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very realistic and absorbing until the big press conference.","review":"Having grown up in Atlanta, graduating from Georgia Tech about the time Charlie Croker fictionally did, I found it getting very real.

Men who had to fight or possibly connive to build such an empire. Some lost it all, but none went out with a whimper.

On the positive side this book entertains and keeps your attention with a gripping interesting, if somewhat warped storyline. On the other hand we also have here juvenile writing (Roger Too White); a plot too often upset by unfathomable contrivance (the earthquake); and page after page of descriptions of inanimate objects. I would like to present a reading list to those of you who gave this book 5 stars, but I will muffle at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Wolfe's novel entertains and captures the imagination - and made me giggle. He's such a master of character and inner-dialogue (you can always smell the sweat on these people) that the watery plot is forgiven easily enough.

It swept me along fantastically! As in \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\", Wolfe again vividly illustrates the roots of most people's problems: sex, money and ego. That said, the main quibbles I have with the book are, firstly, that the ending is very disappointing after all that intense involvement in the characters. A shoddy way of tying up all the loose ends. Secondly, he seems not to be able to create multi-dimensionable and believable female characters. Thirdly, while Conrad is a very likeable character, all that business with the Stoics seems very contrived. It's still a great read, though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlie Croker never read \\"the Millionaire Next Door\\"","review":"What a useless, wasteful novel about nothing except the exploitation of money.

Wolfe is good at language -- jail/street talk, southern patois, lovingly described architecture, sartorial detail, interior decorating; but his characters leave you unmoved.

His book is hollow and fundamentally dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant","review":"It was with great anticipation that I purchased T. Wolfe's \\"A Man In Full\\".

By then I knew that the ending was to be anti-climactic or contrived, so I didn't finish it for 10 days--something I never do normally. It almost seemed like he had to cut the book off suddenly, and then wrap it up. But the characterizations along the way were just SUPERB!

What marvelous work overall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dark Side of Wolfe","review":"Tom Wolfe had always been on a pedastal for me--I read in awe of his way of writing. \\"A Man In Full,\\" however, really changed that. Wolfe still has a magic with words and can be a quality writer, but...it is darker than anything else I've read by him, especially \\"Bonfire of the Vanities.\\" It also took a long time to get interested in the story. So, as a warning to others, there are graphic Wolfe-isms of horses mating with a little help from their handlers, and jailhouse sex, body fluids, and violence. For me, the story itself could not withstand that, so I stopped reading about 2/3 through--it just wasn't that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great work with a lousy ending","review":"It is hard for me to remember another work that has captivated me such as A Man in Full has. It was a wonderful read full of excellent detail. However, the detail seemed to end before the story did. The end of the book is a severe and quick.

The fun is discovering them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute junk, not worth the time or the money","review":"The hype that preceded this book was obviously a publisher's attempt to regain what must have been a hefty advance. This book is total fluff - 742 pages worth. No redeeming qualities here at all - not a single chapter, character, phrase, sentence or word justifies the time and money invested.

The characters are two- dimensional, the story is shhalllowwwpppllloddddiiiinnng. After 700 pages I can only ask WWWhhhyyyyyy? Wolfe is the one who seems full of himself, as he overreaches so badly in what appears to be a mighty attempt to impress the reader with his writing skills. It leaves me with the view that the author had several independent story ideas but decided to scramble them together into a single bowl and hope for a good outcome. How does it taste?

All I can say is it looks like Wolfe fell asleep at the wheel. I would only recommend this book if you have nothing else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Tom Wolfe is one of my favorite writers, and BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES one of my favorite books. Imagine my anticipation when I opened this book -- and my disappointment when I closed it. To me it was a sad rehash of BONFIRE, an attempt to jam every two-dimensional stereotypical character into a novel that would lampoon all of our society's quirks. I couldn't muster up any real interest in any of these people, no matter how sympathetically they were painted. The entire plot, including its creaky ending, seemed to be a BONFIRE rewrite, transplanted to Atlanta. If you're interested in horse breeding, one scene may interest you. If not, check out ELECTRIC KOOL -AID ACID TESTS or BONFIRE."},{"rating":"1","title":"long-winded and boring","review":"I read the first half of this novel and promptly stopped.

If all Conrad is going to do to the hopeless Croker is convert him to stoicism, I don't care. 730 pages of page turning dialogue and complex situations to have the whole book come down to some long forgotten philosophy.

I laughed out loud many times which in itself was worth the time and money for me. It just seemed that the author or editor or publisher or somebody said \\"Hey, its getting way too long.

Fell asleep. There's a lot of ground covered in this book, but so what? Spare me the detailed descriptions of hardwood, jewelry, clothing and sex between horses. This book is a mile wide and an inch deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressive","review":"Almost 800 pages, this story is dramatically over-developed in some areas, woefully under-developed in others and at the end of the book, things just end. It's almost as if Mr. Wolfe's publisher said \\"Enough already! We have too many pages to print as it is!\\". Before I read this book, I was considering buying his other books...no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bonfire It's Not.","review":"'Bonfire of the Vanities' was a book that was made extraordinarily rich by Wolfe's detail descriptions of places and events. Unfortunately, 'A Man In Full' gives you the impression that Wolfe listed 200 things he wanted to describe and then wrote a book to showcase those descriptions. It is boring, long, and pompous. I won't give it away to anyone I know because I don't want them to get mad at me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Bonfire--Not","review":"I just loved Bonfire of the Vanities. I read it several years ago, and still think of it often (Master of the Universe!!! I have days like that!!). I was positively relishing the thought of A Man in Full. I bought it and deliberately kept myself from reading it for a couple of weeks just so I could look forward to it. Then when I finally started in--Yuck. I put it down in the middle in disgust. The characters were so completely unappealing that I didn't want to spend time with them. I forced myself to pick the book up again and finish. The last 300 pages were not so bad. Maybe if the book were a little shorter it would be more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - a testament to powerful book PR machines!","review":"Wolfe attempted to write the novel capturing the mood of the 90's, but perhaps his own lack of writing depth best exemplified the shallowness of this past decade. Wolfe's strength is his power of observation and conveying this in words. The book is strongest in these short moments: dinner at the Plantation, Conrad in jail, etc. However, the rest of the book never gets rolling and never engages the reader. Crocker's dilemma is hardly a situation on which to rest a 700-page novel. And if the book was less a comment on today's society, but a vignette to demonstrate the principles of Stoicism, it failed as well. The salty air of the Hamptons and heat of the Georgia summer must have gotten to Tom. Having enjoyed Wolfe's work in the past, I only hope this is not his last."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweeping, satirical look at late 20th life in U.S.","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I've read many of them. Through characters that span the spectrum of American life, Wolfe explpores the moral/spiritual gaps that develop in a society with so much wealth, freedoms and opportunities. As the story develops, those that have the most wealth and power become increasing miserable, while a principled young idealist discovers happiness through an ancient spiritual code. This book is significant in that it reaffirms that a spiritual aspect to life is a necessary means to achieving happiness regardless of one's wealth or freedom. Character, it seems, still matters in late 20th century America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown and overwritten with a totally unbelievable ending","review":"I should have given up when I found this book absolutely just too heavy to hold, uncomfortable to read in any position. I kept waiting for it to get better but it only got worse. Pages could be skipped with nothing lost. I agree with all who said the ending was a monumental disappointment; it was as if Wolfe couldn't think of what to do with the story he spent ten years creating. I finished it last night and have already forgotten what happened to the main character! And the pompous dedications at the beginning .... please! Next time Wolfe should find a good copy editor. Or maybe just stick to the lecture circuit. P.S.

The bottom line - - who cares! The characters were uninteresting and most importantly unsympathetic. They were down right annoying! I didn't want to get to know them or delve futher into their situation.Great dialogue makes for a great book and A Man in Full fully lacked such!Can't believe I even finished it - - but being the frugal person I am had to.

I'm marching straight down to the used bookstore to see if I can recoup my ill spent \\"investment.\\" Thank goodness for Amazon.com for making this purchase not as steep as it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"great until the incredibly STUPID ending","review":"This book is entertaining and interesting most of the way through, but then veers off into the most implausible, annoying, and downright dumb ending you may ever come across, with the exception of maybe a comic book or a Star Trek episode. One thing that really, really gets on my nerves is when a writer puts forth a philosophy or a message at the end of a book without bothering to make the rest of the book tie into that philosophy at all. The only thing that bothers me more is when an author spends an entire book developing a character and then to wrap things up has that character do something completely out of personality and context, with no connection at all. Wolfe does both these things. I can only recommend this book with a warning to hold your nose at the end. I think Wolfe himself must have gotten sick and tired of writing the thing, or maybe he had to meet a deadline or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was o.k. and that is it!!!","review":"I keep reading thinking is this it??? I mean over 750 pages and we get to read about lawns compared to a woman's breast. Come on I know I ain't no Frued but really. And the scene of the horse breeding---honey I was raised on a ranch \\"a big un\\" and we never took our guest out to the barn to veiw \\"the breeding\\". Turn the book loose Zues and butn the thing. I did like the charactors but noway did I love them. I mean Rodger Too White and Peepgrass did those names just come to you or was it when you were looking at the swelling lawns of a breast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attempt at Satire Achieves Only Insult","review":"Like the protagonist, I grew up in south Georgia and went to school at Georgia Tech. The territory is familiar. Wolf captures much of the flavor of this life. He ruins all this with an air of smug superiority that fails to achieve satire and results in unbelievable insult. There is not a single character in this book who is admirable on the whole. He can keep the money, but I would like to retrieve the hours spent reading this misguided attempt at God knows what."},{"rating":"1","title":"a novel of stereotypes doing stereotypical things.","review":"The final sentence in the book is: \\"I'll be back,\\" portending (god forbid)a sequel. I loved Bonfire of the Vanities, and on reading the first chapter of A Man In His Full, I was a bit disquieted, but looked forward to a long read which would sweep me away like Bonfire did. It was certainly a long read but it was disappointing. Even the good chapters such as the dinner party at the quail house proir to which the guests were entertained by the mating of two thoroughbred horses, could have been written better. (I've seen thoroughbreds mate, and some of the more interesting details were omitted.) There were enjoyable parts and several good laughs, but they were scarce. The business dealings were portrayed as being extraordinary, but they were in fact fairly routine. If you're seeking high caliber, fast paced business writing you're better advised to read Barbarians at the Gate. I expected better."},{"rating":"1","title":"big book; big disappointment","review":"This book is exactly what one would expect from an author resting on his laurels. Several hundred pages are (unnecessarily) devoted to developing characters that are simply stereotypes. The plot is complex, but to what purpose? Wolfe baits the reader, suggesting that some great irony or insight will be the reward for patiently reading the first 600 pages. But in the end, the plot is cut short. Perhaps Wolfe was in a hurry to bring this book to market for the hoiliday season? This book is like a car from the late 1970s. It looks big and powerful, but it turns out to be heavy, slow and wasteful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated","review":"Nobody would say nice things about this book if it wasn't written by Tom Wolfe. It would be considered mediocre at best, with a contrived plot, writing style dropped half way through as though a different writer finished it, a roll-your-eyes and groan ending, and little if any meaning. Overall, a waste of valuable reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't succumb to the hype","review":"Wolfe is a vastly overrated writer, skilled with language but utterly lacking in soul. What I've read of this book confirms for me his utter lack of psychological insight and his heavy-handed approach to writing. Danielle Steele with a haughtily superior attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought Wolfe was supposed to be this good writer.","review":"I was under the impression Tom Wolfe was a good writer; indeed, the book was recommended by a friend and Wolfe wrote the popular Bonfire of the Vanities. So I happily shelled out 12 dollars (Cdn) for a little entertainment. It turns out that Wolfe can't write. He's not witty, concise, or funny and in order for him to bring a scene to life he has to resort to pages of tedious description. His characters are implausible and unlikable, and the situations he puts them in are silly. For example, he has a manual labourer look for white collar work which the labourer can't get because labour has made his fingers too big to type. It's not a funny bit and it's not a good metaphor. Distrust anyone who says this is a good book; their taste is suspect. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Book You Ever Read? Puh-leese!","review":"Anyone who says this is the best book they've ever read hasn't read enough books. I truly can't remember the last book I read that I thought was worse than this one. I prefer shorter novels with well-drawn characters. I prefer authors who actually want their readers to use their imaginations and do some thinking on their own. For example, Ian McEwan or J.M. Coetzee or Penelope Fitzgerald or Alice McDermott or Amy Bloom or Magnus Mills or Tim Winton or Graham Swift. Read something shortlisted for the Booker Prize if you want thoughtful, provocative literature. Tom Wolfe can't hold a candle to any of these authors. The Right Stuff was well done. The Bonfire of the Vanities was superficial, but entertaining. A Man in Full was none of these. Just another example of media-driven, overblown hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH PLEASE!","review":"This book is a waste of good reading time! It is clearly meant to be a satire of the wealthy, of race and racial issues, and of the narcissism of slice of a wealthy \\"generation me\\" class of the late 1990s. However, the only feeling this book left with me was a disgust of the cynicism, selfishness and short-sightedness of Wolfe's characters. I have to admit that the characters are richly drawn, and the road they take towards the climax is interesting enough to pull the reader along. Wolfe also does exhibit a great deal of courage talking about issues of wealth and race in very direct terms, which is a breath of fresh air in our P.C. time. However, Wolfe's characters, all of whom are pathetic and completely dislikable, stumble into an ending that is ridiculous at best as it careens off into surrealism. I kept reminding myself as I was reading it, that if it had a good ending, all would be worth it. That was a unrealistic expectation. Don't waste your time. Read another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fell apart near the end","review":"A must read for anyone involved in real estate. Some of the chapters excellently portray certain aspects of the industry (ie: Saddlebags). Parts of the plot fall apart and it gets little Sci. Fi. near the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but lacking","review":"This book gave observations and insights into different levels of the Atlanta social structure. The novel read easily but never had me thinking beyond superficial levels. The cast of characters is too wide for Wolfe to explore deeply. The novel's faults far outweigh the positive points.What I found particularly bothersome was Wolfe's portrayal of younger generations. He wrote with a woefully misunderstanding tone towards those below college graduation age. He came across as an old cronie. What I also didn't like was his comparisons of young attractive women to 'boys with breasts'. I don't see it that way. My guess is that it is Wolfe's observation about a change in the feminin ideal of beauty from voluptuoust towards slender and athletic (hence scenes in aerobics classes). Once again, this is Wolfe coming across as old.Had the book been a slower more demanding read, I would have closed the book never to finish. The finish was anti-climatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Wolfe strikes again, but again fails to develop women","review":"Tom Wolfe gives us a witty tour of the inner workings of the city of Atlanta. Along the way he introduces us to the political and social forces that have shaped the city. As usual, Wolfe is incredibly sensitve to racial issues, which makes his failure to develop the females characters even more glaring. Wolfe gives us a token woman to ponder, the discarded \\"first wife\\" of lead character Charlie Croker. The subejct matter--high stakes finance, real estate, municipal politics, and college athletics-- fails to justify Wolfe's lack of interest in the role women play in today's society--in Atlanta or elsewhere. Wolfe also creates a number of the supporting characters that are almost one-dimensional -- one wonders whether he has another book in the planning stages to pick up the story line. Overall, it is an enjoyable, if long read."},{"rating":"1","title":"False hope","review":"This is the best door stop I have ever bought. By weight and volume it is unsurpassed. However, as enjoyable reading it is fleeting at best. Mr. Wolfe has his moments - 742 pages can't be all bad - but in general the book is an incredibly disappointment. My only hope is they don't make a movie of this dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment on a Wolfeian scale","review":"As much as I enjoyed Bonfire, which was so engrossing that I knocked it off in a weekend, I could not seem to pick this book up.Riddled with cookie cutter cliches and themes from Bonfire of the Vanities, only Tom Wolfe seems able to create as collosel of a 'repeat' as this. It was like sitting through the entire \\"Rocky\\" series without an escape.It illustrates the reason I rarely read Pop fiction anymore (the book was a gift)- every book is the same old thing.-Carl Friedrich, Rye, NY"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this book ever get published?","review":"This has got to be one of the most ridiculous story lines I have ever picked up. It appears that Wolfe had three or four partial story ideas he had been working on and crammed all of them into this mess, with a forced relationship and interaction. The rendering of the characters is shallow at best and generally unbelievable. Wolfe has given us the deed to this book in lieu of foreclosure because this attempt is intellectually and artistically bankrupt."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as timely as Big Hair and Parachute Pants","review":"Tom Wolfe's new novel is travesty in a time warp. A novel started 10 years ago should have been finished in two years -- all his premises are now cliched -- who cares!! The average American up on public issues could have written the same plot. Not to mention all the help he credits. 10 years for that! Just typical of a bunch of guys sitting around talking about how great it's going to be. Wolfe attempts to create timeless Shakespearean character(s) but ends with characters and a plot as timely as big hair and parachute pants. John Updike's review, \\"...a book that defies you not to buy it,\\" is the politically correct review that Tom Wolfe deserves in recognition of his earlier achievements. It's nice to see that there are gentlemen among novelists, I, however, cannot be so kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'VE READ TOM WOLFE AND HE'S NO DICKENS","review":"SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. is it possible to simply get tired of wolfe's literary pyrotechnics? but to call him a modern day Dickens--as some reviewers have--is a travesty. when i think of all the talented fiction writers who never get the hype he does, it is even worse. his constant weaving back and forth made no character coherant for any length of time; his women were all cardboard cut out stereotypes and so much of his observations were about surface attributes or non attributes, such as nymphet abs vs. over-the-hill flab. instead of satire, it sounds like hackneyed thoughts of his own. he should have grown up by now."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amateurish, downright boring, agonizing book.","review":"A Man in Full is agonizing because you want so desperately to like it. Maybe only because you loved Bonfire so much. Maybe because of all the hype. Or maybe because it seems like it'll be a good story from the jacket. But read 100 pages - ugggh.A Man in Full wants to be so much, and tries so hard, but what you get is a bowl full of slop - like when you mixed up your chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice cream as a kid to make a syrupy soup. It's also very glib, which makes any book difficult to enjoy when the writing's not there to support it. And knowing, at page 100, that you have another 700 to endure - well, it's tortuous.Repetition - a device used so masterfully in DeLillo's Underworld - is so oversimplified and haphazard it seems psychotic. Not psychotic as in deep and meaningful and bolstering of story and character. But an awfully unbearable psychotic. Wholly unenjoyable.Don't give in to the hype. Re-read Bonfire instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I read the whole book hoping it would get better.

Well, I was totally wrong. This book suffers from the same problems that Bonfire did, totally unconvincing characters. Wolfe takes an inordinate amount of time painstakingly developing his characters, then gives them nowhere to go and very little to do. In a 700 plus page book he uses 650 page to develop various storylines and then, seemingly realizing he had gotten nowhere with this story, he tacks on the most contrived, absurd and insulting ending I've encountered. I literally burst into laughter, the ending was so bad. If this was the last book availible on the planet I wouldn't reccomend it to my worst enemy.

The sterotypes are in full, one-note force: grasping, greedy, harpy-like women LOVE to tear their men down, while happily emptying their wallets. At the other extreme, and this saves the book and makes it the compulsive page-turner it is, the male characters are diverse, whole, and beautifully portrayed. Like many other customers, I too found the last chapter to be a disappointment...Wolfe obviously had a deadline to meet, or just ran out of juice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book ... Awkward ending","review":"As many have already pointed out, the ending of this book is not particularly satisfying. However, the story itself is wonderfully complex with characters who are vivid and disctinct. Wolfe does a superb job with his descriptions and the scenes are very entertaining. Some are just down right funny. Especially fun are the few occasions when the reader is privy to multiple perspectives of the same event; when we are given the opportunity to see the differences between women and men, or blacks and whites. The body of the story is so strong and enjoyable, that the flaws of the conclusion do not sufficiently distract from the value of the book as a whole. I would definitely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Man if Full","review":"The first Tom Wolfe I've read- picked up because I knew nothing about it.

Overall, highy recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Master","review":"This book is not exactly what one would expect from an author resting on his laurels. Several hundred pages are necessarily devoted to developing characters that are simply hilarious. The plot is complex. Wolfe baits the reader, suggesting that some great irony or insight will be the reward for patiently reading the first 600 pages. In the end, the promise is fulfilled. Perhaps Wolfe was in a literary \\"zone?\\" This book is like a car from the late 1950s. It is big and powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not everyday","review":"that you read a book that comes together quite so well as this, Don Dellios' Underworld was better though, I guess because it was of a more serious nature, and went together less well making it ring truer somehow.

You keep reading and reading waiting for something to happen and it never does. This was a BIG let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Wolfe Got Way Too \\"Full\\".","review":"Talk about a letdown. A major disappointment. Characters are larger than life yet so flawed that one winds up not liking any of them with the possible exception of Atlanta's mayor and the kid from Oakland. It's not even worth remembering their names. The storyline starts out well enough, but the last third of the book read like the author got to a point in the plot that he realized he did'nt possess a clue as to how to end it sensibly. The \\"new age\\" awareness that our boy Croker falls into seemed to be a total cop-out. I got the feeling Wolfe wrote all but the last 100 pages and then decided \\"I've got one hour to finish this thing\\". Way too much description of what people were wearing, the food they ate, and on and on. This kind of book leaves we wondering if others who raved about this were reading the same piece of literature I suffered through. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. And he misspelled \\"Freaknik\\".","review":"That's the only word for it. I spent most of my life in Atlanta, and I have no clue what city Wolfe's writing about, because it sure isn't Atlanta. I've never even met anyone who'd been to a debutante ball or whatever that is. Wolfe oversimplifies Atlanta, turning it into some \\"Gone With The Wind\\" ripoff.All I can say is - I've never seen anything like the Atlanta he describes. And I lived there.Tom Wolfe's writing is clever for about the first 10 pages. Afterwards, it's like driving nails into your forehead.And one last detail - anyone, and I mean anyone, who's lived in Atlanta will know what Freaknik is, and how much contraversy surrounds it. But on page 1, Wolfe misspells it. For somebody who's so concerned with accuracy and local color, he sure is sloppy.This isn't satire - this is torture."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't find the ending that bad!","review":"Many readers seem to hate the ending a lot. But I actually liked it better than BONFIRE's. Tom Wolfe is not for everybody. There are some very dramatic turns, but all in all his storyline and characters are far too realistic to form a typical novel where every sentence needs a purpose, every other page has a crafted plot twist, and everything gets wrapped up nicely at the end. I think he did a fairly good job with what happened to the numerous characters. But the real enjoyment of the book is relishing the descriptions, the dialogue, the satire, and everything else that makes Tom Wolfe's writing so special. Two or three more pages on Croker at the very end, and a bigger role for his ex-wife, and I would have given this book five stars. (Doesn't the Concourse carry her name? Just a thought.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most over rated book I've read in a long time.","review":"I once heard a minister say if it takes longer than 20 minutes to get his message across he loses his audience and is likely to repeat himself. Tom Wolfe should have taken a lesson from him, I found the book extremely redundant. This is the most over rated, disappointing book I've read since \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literature it ain't","review":"This book is like a summer blockbuster action movie - easy to sit though, but leaving no meaningful impression. That this collection of stereotypical characters and trite plot resolutions got nominated for book awards is a tribute to its impressive marketing campaign, not its content. I enjoyed Wolfe's other books far more. His time seems past."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak characters and a poor story!","review":"An avid Tom Wolfe fan, I awaited this latest novel with anticipation. What a disappointment. The characters have absolutely no depth, they are all superficial, shallow, and worst of all--artifical. This book is more akin to a Danielle Steel novel than one by Mr. Wolfe . Avoid the hype on this one-- don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"A man in full ... of himself.

The characters and scenes are described such that the reader actually feels like he/she has been involve d in a Banks' Workout session or worked in a frozen food warehouse.I would have given it five stars if it had not been for the \\"Scooby Doo\\" ending. Having spent 700 pages with all the characters I felt cheated when two of the characters meet and fill in the blanks with a final conversation. However, I had a hard enough time carrying this book around with me and I would not have been able to travel with it had it been 1000 plus pages. The ending is not too great a price to pay for rich characters and vivid scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Man In Full by TOM WOLFE really reaked.","review":"It was the worst book that I have ever read in my life.

Out the window..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how the book ends??","review":"I couldn't believe that after about 750 pages, the book ended in the ridiculous manner in which it did. I couldn't decide how many stars to give the book because I was enthralled until literally the last ten pages, and then utterly disappointed by the very end of the novel.It is a very engaging look at particularly the male of the species, and the ego that can control it. I was hoping for a bit more character development in particularly the main character, but the detail of the story was phenomenal and Wolfe's writing very much pulls you in. I admit that this was the first Wolfe that I've ever read, but after the disappointment of this ending, I doubt that I'll invest another thousand pages of my life in anything else by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Men full of themselves","review":"This is a great book. I've read it three times. This is a book about men. I know it was quite horrifying that someone could possibly write a book not by, for or about women. But this is a refreshing example of just that. I loved the character of Conrad. The ending was weak. I thought the author just wanted to end it somehow. In forty years this will be a very important book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the Hurry?","review":"This was a very good read, with colorful characters, and good character development for the most part. But the ending of the book was rushed. It was conventional and pat . . . the last few chapters went by so fast, I had to re-read part of it to see if I wasn't missing something, and I wasn't. The end of the book made what came before almost trite and meaningless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover....","review":"I should have received a clue that this was going to be a pompous, over-written disaster of a book when the author's name was written in text 5 times taller than the title of the book.The characters were unlikeable, the story was barely enthralling and it was pretty evident at the end that either Wolfe had become bored or his editor had told him to wrap it up because I have seen less predictable and convenient endings on Scobby Doo.I bought this book for $1 at a yard sale and I barely think I got my money's worth. The most interesting thing for me were the descriptions of Atlanta, and even those Wolfe managed to get wrong in several places.

Unfortunately, that's where it should have stayed. Wolfe appears to be a clueless wordsmith, weaving sometimes great prose into a meaningless fog. His characters are contrived and overblown, the story a tedious morass. If this is what Wolfe sees when he \\"observes\\" America, then perhaps he should visit an optometrist. Halfway through, I was so put off by the hateful cynicism that is Wolfe's excuse for satire that the book literally went into my wood stove."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAD TO PUT IT DOWN!","review":"On average I read a book a week. But after 3 weeks and 450 painstaking pages, I had to put this book down. This is coming from a person who has never put a book down without finishing it. Further, after wasting 3 weeks I couldn't believe that Wolfe was still developing his characters and to my dismay I couldn't for the life of me follow the plot. In fact, after 450 pages, I asked myself...what plot?I must say that after reading The Bonfire of the Vanities many years back I was extremely disappointed in A Man In Full and because I put it down, I'll never know who that man is, nor do I really care.

It does not, however, live up to the promise of Bonfire of the Vanities. It opens in a smilar vein, casting a critical eye on a variety of interesting denizens of high-society Atlanta. It falls flat when it involves Conrad Hensely, the huge-forearmed Everyman loser who ends up as the prophet of the latest cult religion--the return of Stoicism. While it remains a relatively pleasurable reading experience, the last third of the book really calls into question what the author is up to--it was working fairly well as social satire, but when the last third rolls around, it almost sounds like a pitch for the Stoic religion some of the characters convert to. Didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating","review":"I must be missing something. I found this book excruciating to get through.

Like all of Wolfe's books it is well written, covers a lot of ground and develops substantial characters. It has so many different strains that the novel remains lively with three or four differnt threads moving quickly throughout until they join together in the end. Each differnt story could have been a good book in itself, but combining all of them into this single epic was a difficult, but effective, trick. I can't vouch for the accuracy of the social commentary in contemporary Atlanta, but it certainly made for a compelling book. I would highly recommend this book for Wolfe fans, but it would be an excellent selection for people interested in social commentary, American studies or good, quick reading novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book was purchased as a gift and I received great reviews on it. I will continue to buy copies to share."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Human Comedy","review":"I'm surprised that \\"A Man in Full\\" hasn't gotten more 4- and 5-star reviews. It may not be Dostoevesky, but it IS great popular fiction -- a clever send up of the manic drive for status that fuels American consumption and blights our culture. The book succeeds on different levels. For one thing, it's simply a great read: the plot is lively, the characters are deftly-drawn, and laugh-out-loud scenes abound. The book is also superbly reported: readers learn about horse-breeding, bankruptcy workouts, jail life, racial politics, courtship amongst the 1%, Stoicism, and much, much more. Finally, the story actually has a moral: namely, that people who accumulate piles of wealth at the cost of their souls (and their relationships) strike a bad bargain with life. To be fair, parts of \\"A Man in Full\\" read like journalism rather than fiction, but that didn't bug me. I loved the book and wish it had been 300 pages longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, Tom Wolfe has outlived his genius.","review":"The most destructive attribute a creative artist can have is competitivness. Tom Wolfe, like the late Norman Mailer, seems to feel that he not only has to compete with other high profile members of the (New York) literary establishment, but with himself. Each book has to be a bigger \\"blockbutster\\" than the one before.But bigger does not necessarly mean better - it can mean bloated.Wolfe (like Mailer) is basically a creative journalist who got too big for his literary britches. In the Right Stuff, Wolfe pushed the envelope to the tearing point. Then he ventured into the realm of fiction, lost his focus, and was out of his depth. Without an anchor of reality, his writing floated into the rarefied air of the implausible, not to say ridiculous. The old Tom Wolfe is a parody of the young Tom Wolfe. His earlier works have earned him immortality; his later works (i.e. novels) are evidence of his mortality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Societal Vista","review":"This book is a vista, tying together many currents of society: 1) The dynamics of Atlanta and surrounding communities, 2) Life within African-American culture, 3) Boom-town developers and their genetically motivated underpinings, 4) The economically unsuccessful and their adaptations, 5) Political refugees from Asia, 6) The unremitting drive for the pursuit of status beyond any pretense of meeting basic needs, 7) Societal wars. This is a big vista, skillfully rendered. The ending is abrupt. Tom Wolfe himself said he didn't know how to end this appropriately, which shows. Yet the ending did appeal to me in its whimsicalness. A heck of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scottie Pippen Writes Books?","review":"After reading many of the reviews contained herein, I wished I'd read them before I started this 700 page endeavor. Although I enjoyed many of the characters, I was completely appalled by the ending. It reminded me of the time our Chicago Bull hometown hero told the Coach he wouldn't go back in the game down by one with 1.8 seconds left. Like Pippen, Wolfe must have realized Full Court shots rarely go in, and after spending 600 pages developing characters, he decided to take his paycheck and go home, rather than seeing his writing thru to the end. I am a frequent reader, and found this to be the worst ending of a story ever imagineable. I'll never read another book by Wolfe again. I felt violated as I closed the book the final time. Unless you have too much time on your hands, I would recommend leaving A Man In Full on the shelf and making another selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like 2 different books","review":"The first 3/4 of this book was highly enjoyable; the last 1/4 was a grating, tedious, fingernails-on-the-chalkboard experience, too the point where it was almost unreadable. The direction the plot takes is bizarre and implausible, but beyond that, there is even a noticeable decline in the quality of Wolfe's writing. It is almost like a different author took over, without being briefed on the character development of the first 500 pages. And, if I never hear about Zeus again, it will be too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one...","review":"Tom Wolfe is a wonderful storyteller, and he proves this for two-thirds of this novel.

That part, Wolfe got right, but it wasn't worth wading through a book of this length.His penchant for repeating cute phrases such as \\"Roger Too White\\" and \\"boys with breasts\\" got on my nerves. But most disappointing (and disturbing) is that all the Heros of his book are white (including the really obnoxious, despicable lead character, Charlie Croker whom he converts into a rather unbelievable hero by the end of the book) and all the black characters are either portrayed in a negative light or as rather weak in principals (such as the mayor). Why couldn't Wolfe include some good African-American role models in a book about a predominantly black city?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pee-you","review":"What a waste of time this one was. I struggled to get through the first 200 pages, bolstering myself with fond memories of other TW books I had read. The story finally picked up, but became only mildly amusing. I agree that TW has a problem with women, especially middle-aged women--there wasn't a single female character in this book who wasn't hateful, greedy, nagging, conniving, etc.The prison story was completely unlikely (no one in California goes to a maximum security prison for a first offense of aggravated assault). TW makes some hilarious mistakes regarding prison and gang lingo, e.g., he refers to a Latino nickname as Weddo (Blondie). THE WORD IS \\"HUERO,\\" which means blond in Spanish.It appears that TW ran into an editorial deadline and decided to wrap up a 787-page epic with a ending I would only expect from beginning writers. Where were his editors?I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spins A Great Yarn!","review":"I thought Wolfe depicted the qualities of an \\"old southern gentleman\\" right on the money. Charlie Crocker and company wove an intersting tale of greed, egotism, male chauvinism, ambition, pride, courage, betryal, and loss. I enjoyed the characters and the subtle humor (Wringer, Fleasom and Tick is a pretty humorous name for a law firm) and thought Wolfe did a good job of not being afraid to write how things \\"really\\" are in the OLD south, especially where there is race, money and power operating. Like many others, I was rather disappointed in the ending.....I would have like to have known more about how Charlie's life progressed and could not imagine him being an evangelist of all things! All in all, a great story, although I must agree with one of the other reviewers....the book is defintely not a postcard showcasing life in Atlanta."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"Although this book is not for the casual reader, it packs a fantastic wallop of details across the American continent. Wolfe has written convincing portraits of what happens in prisons, in the elite rich neighborhoods in Atlanta and also at other levels of society.

Larger let down","review":"Neat story with great character development (why not when you've got over 700 pages to work with). Admittedly there are some slow periods, but the higher points (\\"excuse us while we have a cactus\\") more than make up them. I had to soak my feet after spending a day in Oakland with Conrad. What an adventure! However, what happened with the ending? Did the author run out of ink? Time? Imagination? Patience? Perhaps there is no way to \\"properly\\" end such a saga, but there certainly has to be a better ending than the one used, as it leaves the reader feeling let down and frustrated for having spent the time to read the prior 700+ pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Man in Fulll is Empty","review":"A Man in Full is massively overwritten, tedious, filled with unengaging characters and a baffling plot-line.

This could've gone on another 1,500 pages without complaint from me. I loved it and think all readers will love it as well. Mr. Wolfe, your writing abilities are without peer. You are the best.

Only one small heart's desire of mine possibly qualifies me for membership in the decade, if Mr. Wolfe is its defining chronicler. And, that desire is mentioned at least 4 times as THE signature ornament of the standard luxury mansion bedroom, and the attic room occupied by the Stoic --- the matelasse counterpane. Maybe I could relate to the story, reclaim my rightful place as a member of the decade and the century, if only I had one of those things, or some dear friends from prison or from the billionaires' club. I got this book as a Christmas present and saved it to savor in summer. What a waste of 3 days! Florid prose, cartoon scenery, thin characters and no payoff of a decent end for the pain of slogging through the bazillion or so words."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending - - an excalamation point for a bad book!","review":"As a native Georgian, I was anxious to read this book. I was interested through the beginning of the book, no doubt enticed by the Charlie's dealings with his bank as I am a banker. Even though the bank discussions interested me, I found it a bit far-fetched and unlikely. I believe the book was a let down, however, I forged on and read (sometimes rushing through pages--especially the Conrad chapters) the whole book. I truly have a hard time understanding how Wolfe ended the book as if he had one minute to think up an ending. He did a pretty good job of setting the reader up for the ending, yet he fumbled miserably. I can not honestly recommend to anyone to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"mostly good","review":"Don't read the epilogue, and you'll like \\"Man in Full\\" a lot better. As for the Southern question, I'm and born-and-bred Southerner myself, and I have no beef with Wolfe's depiction. He skewered us the same way he skewered New Yorkers, and I would expect no less. Overall, it's a gripping tale with a stupid ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book, great ending!!","review":"I don't understand why everyone is complaining about the length or the ending. I thought it was a terrific entertaining read, and I wanted it to go on. It seemed too short to me. And the ending was unexpected and so, to me, perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I read the whole thing!","review":"If this book hadn't been a present from someone whose taste in books I respect, I would have dumped it earlier. I found the descriptive details of the man's wife and her friend tiresome and boring. Then again, I am a woman -- so the details don't titillate. When Istart wondering about the author, the disruption intrudes into the story. As to the story--terrific plot. Could have been enjoyable if it were one third the length.I have never read (skimmed in lots of places) a book that screamed so loudly for a good edit!!! Do not recommend anyone spend a dime on this book. Check it out at the library or borrow it from a friend, that way you can put it down permanently after the first foray into the thicket of verbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it one star because there was no 'no star' category","review":"In short (a concept Tom Wolfe should consider adopting) - thecharacters were caricatures, the plot was annoyingly contrived and thelanguage was, at best, 6th grade level (apologies to all you 6th graders out there). Oh, yeah, I almost forgot - all women over the age of 40 and women who don't look like 'boys with breasts' - beware. Now for the good news - the book is huge and comes in handy as a step stool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Your Time","review":"Don't let the fact that this book is extremely long discourage you. It is definitely worth taking the time to read it. I haven't read any of Wolfe's other books to compare it to, but I did enjoy this book and plan on reading more by him because of it. The ending, however, was mildly dissapointing. I think it ended to quickly. Wolfe could have written more, but his story just suddenly stopped. Despite that I enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"This is one of the most irritating writers I have come across in a long time. Example: Mr Wolfe delights in supplying the correct anatomical term for each and every muscle his heroes are decked out with. We keep reading about latissimus dorsii and deltoids and the trapezius, etc. Is he a frustrated weightlifter, or merely showing off? Example: This one is not only silly, but I found it insulting. Each person is described by his exact colour, from dark to light chocolate, to high yeller, etc. And the worst of them all: an authentic blue-blood black? Example: I have not come across any woman in this book who is not bitchy, shrill, clinging, pathetic etc. On the other hand, there are at least two types of men: There are MEN, and there are the others. Say no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indecision of the long-winded kind","review":"I loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it--pretty much in that order. Around page 500 or so it started to really get good and then as so many others have said, Wolfe couldn't decide how to end it so he just did! Terribly! Unbelievably! Disappointingly! His constant explanations of \\"street\\" language and translations into \\"southern\\" were annoying if not insulting to his readers. But he really had a good thing going for awhile. Too bad he couldn't decide. Maybe the movie will have better editors and tie up the loose ends. One can only hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"tom wolfe is full of himself","review":"This book is about 400 pages too long, and the ending is pathetic. Wolfe takes his time describing men's ties and shoes, and ladies' loins and breasts, but rushes through the ending. I did enjoy the prison scenes, although, the jive talk was pretty much annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING BUT A CROCK","review":"HOW MUCH MONEY? I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T GET IT! TOM WOLFE SPENDS TEN YEARS WRITING THIS THING AND THIS IS WHAT HE COMES UP WITH, AN OVERLONG CONVOLUTED MISH-MOSH CONCERNING RACE, WEALTH, POWER AND THE STOICS? AND THEN, AFTER 700 PAGES HE RUNS OUT OF GAS AND LEAVES US WITH AN EPILOGUE TO SUM UP THE STORY. SORRY TOM, BUT SPEND LESS TIME DECRIBING WHAT THE CHARACTERS ARE WEARING AND HOW THEY ARE LIVING, AND MORE TIME ON CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. GIVE ME A REASON TO UNDERSTAND CHARLIE AND HIS RABBLE. GIVE ME MORE INDEPTH INSIGHT INTO CONRAD'S SPIRITIAL METAMORPOSIS AND LESS TIME SPOTLIGHTING HIS IMMENSE FOREARMS.

Absolutely!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How long could he have made it??","review":"This was the most drawn out book I have ever read, and I read alot. I like wolfe's work, usually!

Having enjoyed books by Tom Wolfe in the past and seeing the great size of the book , i knew i had found the perfect book. Imagine my surprise when the only thing this book is perfect for is a door stop. I finished this book about ten days ago and i cannot remember the name of one character, cannot remember one scene that grabbed me and i have no desire to ever buy another of Tom Wolfe's books. maybe he set out to make this book like the highway system in atlanta. long, tedious, crowded and never ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts strongly, but fades...","review":"I liked this book. It is in fact, a hard book to dislike, however, I was somewhat disappointed with the finish. It seemed almost as if Wolfe was desperate to get the thing finished off and shot to the publisher, because the last few chapters seem out of step with the rest of the book, smacking of a \\"lets get this baby wrapped up\\" attitude. Having said that, the book was a page turner, the characters were engaging, and the commentary pithy. Very good, but not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertaining Social satire","review":"I normally don't finish books over 500 pages but I did polish this one off. It was entertaining but the characters seemed somewhat one-dimensional and the plot too similar to \\"Bonfire\\" with the characters southernized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expressive writing doesn't keep it from being boring.","review":"It is so long it feels padded. I couldn't make it past the unconvincing scene that described Wes showing Roger the real Atlanta - this scene was intended to edify the reader not Roger. Roger was a life long Atlantan, educated, sophisticated and an active member of the professional community - he certainly didn't need a lecture ( a long, long lecture) from Wes. As for the novels comic moments, the parts with Charlie Croker were funny but most of the other characters (men only - the women were cyphers) were depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the mark with this one","review":"What a disappointment! TW has really lost touch with society -- it is painfully obvious as he attempts to describe the black youth of today - obviously styled after what he's seen on television and film.

I had to put it away after wasting four hours trying to find something to make me want to turn the next page"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words","review":"The man who wrote such perfect magical-realist journalistic writing in concise and compact form is now producing novels that are bloated in every sense. Big fat doorstops full of overblown writing and sloppy construction. Pity he got so famous no one at the publishing company will act the tough guy and edit him properly. Big fat smug book written by a compact smug man."},{"rating":"1","title":"He got tired of writing and threw together a sorry ending","review":"Its not worth your time. None of the characters are admirable."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"I tried, I really tried to read this boring, self- indulgent, deadly tedious book, but I just couldn't get past the 200th page (and that was pushing it). The only thing about the book that was on the positive side was it helped me fall directly to sleep. Plus what's the deal with his obvious strong dislike of women past 40? He's no prize himself. I think Mr. Wolfe should take a break from writing and maybe try another profession. Yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a masterpiece, but great nonetheless","review":"Tom Wolfe has managed to capture our society at its most absurd and touching. He keeps our interest with his sharp wit, keen insight and sardonic humor through 700 pages. Unfortunately, I agree that the ending is a stinker and the relationship between Croker and Conrad is too contrived. I disagree with readers who said the characters are too wooden or two-dimensional. Au contraire! I felt most of the characters could walk off the page and have tea in my living room. Eager to see how Hollywood screws this one up. At least, Bonfire of the Vanities fiasco generated an excellent, entertaining book about how Hollywood destroyed the story --The Devil's Candy. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rolling Stone magazine printed a few pages of this book","review":"If you subscribe to Rolling Stone Magazine than you might have read a four page excertion from \\"A man in Full,\\" that was printed in this months issue. After reading these four or five pages, I despritally wanted to rush out and buy this book. I could have read the entire thing because I was so into the magical writing style of Tom Wolfe. I cannot wait to read this book and others that will follow. He is one of my favorite authors and I hope he continues to write great wonderfull books. \\"The Electric Kool-aid Acid Test\\" was a great piece of work also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Prodigeous","review":"I can't believe all the people with prodigeous arms, the women with prodigeous backs Wolfe writes about. There is very little imagination as he introduces new characters. His poor use of ebonics and slang is unwelcome, his phonetics for southern accents is silly. I should have read a spiderman comic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this one","review":"I was so disappointed with this book...with the characters, the plot, the setting, the length. By the time I finished it, I was angry that I'd wasted my time reading it. What a yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"You pretentious little man!","review":"He should have just called it \\"shanks akimbo\\" and gotten it over with. Mr. Wolfe used this unusual phrase more times than he did \\"a man in full\\". He even included it in a rap song. Now, I'm not exactly a rap afficianado, but I doubt that particular phrase has ever been used in a rap song, or ever will be. Maybe he just thought it made him sound more intelligent. It served only to pull me out of the story, over and over again.I know that Mr. Wolfe has produced much better works than this. His research is painstaking in some areas, nonexistent in others (shooting quail with buckshot?). Oh yeah, and we get the accent thing (thang).I know that I personally spend enormous amounts of time worrying about whether or not people in New York will think I'm provincial. Please!Quick--someone get this man an editor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, simply dreadful stuff","review":"Overwrought descriptions, contorted plot, repetitious language, and a let-down ending... Are we certain this is the same author who gave us Bonfires?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the last 10 pages first","review":"Simply: The book's ending leaves you wishing you hadn't read the book at all. While the book is quite interesting most of the way through, the conclusion was boring, unbelievable and clearly lazy on Wolfe's part. Like Billy Crystal's character in When Harry Met Sally, read the ending first - you won't bother reading the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author got tired of writing and finished fast with epilogue.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel until the last chapter and epilogue. Unfortunately, Tom Wolf got tired of this novel and finished up the story with a wrap-up in the epilogue. I would really have loved to continue the saga and understand what really happened to these people. For instance, what could have posessed Martha to marry Peepgas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy, dull, and unimaginative","review":"This book is no \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\". His description of every piece of furniture in a room as if it makes any difference only makes it longer. The description of the lawns in Buckhead as \\"great green breasts\\" is trite, high school caliber writing. The realizations he learned after his heart surgery and the stoic philosophy are interesting, but certainly nothing new. That was my last Tom Wolfe book, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his Masterpiece but...","review":"Must be tough to sit down at the keyboard and try to top Bonfire of the Vanities and Right Stuff. Man in Full isn't painted on the broad canvas that made Bonfire so exellent. Feels like Wolfe just kept developing plot until suddenly an editor said, \\"hey Tom, how about wrapping this thing up?\\" Every issue resolved in 70 pages or so and then the epilogue. He's still a great stylist though and the book is worth reading for that alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"i very much looked forward to reading this book. but i found it tedious in its detail and repetitive to the point of frustration. entire pages could be skipped without loosing the (weak) plot. and after all that, it just ended without a whimper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A genuine dissapointment","review":"Wolfe clearly wanted to create larger than life characters pushed into a larger than life situation. Instead, he created one dimensional, completely unbelievable characters running around in a far fetched, cliched drama that was hard to believe in the beginning, boring in the middle, and plain flat at the end. Doubly frustrating was his clear intention to write a sequel to that mess, no doubt to cast some light on what was supposed to be a catchy but unclear ending. Give this one a big miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre writing of a somewhat fun story","review":"This is one book which could have been written in half the pages - think of the trees we could have saved! While there are high points and some wonderful satire, overall the book becomes tiresome and redundant. It's entertaining if you want a book which can be skimmed through over a rainy weekend and provide some satire, humor and interesting, if predictable, characters. This is not a piece of good literature that requires reading every line. Wait until the paperback comes out if you want to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last book to read of Tom Wolfe","review":"Very little of interest in this book except how the rich live. I went through one chapter reading the right-hand pages only and still knew what was going on. I only kept reading because I always try to finish a book especially after paying the price of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane and irrelevant, should not have been published!","review":"This massive missive is racist, bigoted, bloated and boring. Frankly, it has absolutely no saving feature. If not received as a Christmas gift from a desperate family, I would not have had the misfortune of reading it! The plot is thin, the characters thin, the dialog grinding and tedious, the entire text tedious. How this book and author were acclaimed is not understandable. His previous text, Bonfire of the Vanities, was only marginally better. Why Tom Wolfe? New York, I guess......."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 pages of content written on 750","review":"A was extremely dissapointed in this #1 bestseller by Tom Wolfe. You could easily skip chapter after chapter and not miss a beat. Meaningless characters were overdeveloped and many subplots should have been left. I was so pround of myself for struggling through all 742 pages just to be greeted with a terrible ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Titanic Novel?","review":"At first blush it appears that the size and power of A Man In Full puts it roughly in the dreadnought class. Unfortunately, things soon sink rapidly. Readers suffer a heavy ordinance of a now familiar Wolfian device of contriving to place each character in the most tortuous situation possible. This gets old fast. Nor does the book tap into the Zeitgeist in the same way that Bonfire did. The biggest flaw here is the conclusion. Readers will heave an enormous yawn at the relently vapid and dippy culmination of this buxom volume. Don't buy the hype -- this book has about as much chance of becoming an enduring American classic as Tom Wolfe has of winning the Soul Train Lifetime Achievement Award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essentially a 742-page comic strip.","review":"Ol' Tom proved himself to be a marvelous essayist in \\"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\"......but as Mary said to Charles, \\"Lamb, stick to essays.\\" \\"Bonfire\\" had one-dimensional characters and a plot that not even the author could tie up at the end, but some of the atmospherics were wonderful. Alas, \\"A Man in Full\\" lacks even a touch of redeeming atmospherics. Essentially, it's a 742-page comic strip, with trite sidebars such as \\"Epictetus in the Alameda County Jail.\\" Don't miss the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed the first 500 pages of the book...","review":"The character development was great. But after about 500 pages, I found myself asking, \\"Is this book WORTH 700-plus pages? The answer was NO. But I have to admit, I have been totally spoiled by The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test and Bonfire of the Vanities."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Tom Wolfe, you'll like this.","review":"If you don't like Tom Wolfe, don't read this. If you like Tom Wolfe, you'll like this. A lot. I loved Bonfire and this is almost as good. His characters are just as real, with good and bad points for all to see. It's long, but worth it (for some of us)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Father of Glamorama","review":"Now we now who Brett Easton Ellis' direct literary descednant is: Tom Wolfe. Whatever cred he may've had back when boomers were society's tastebuds ain't there now. Laundry lists of socio-economically relevant identifiers. A narrative strategy that completely lacks subtlety and surprise. The ending says, Ha ha. You've invested financial capital and personal capital -- i.e., moments of your Life and Breath -- so I know you're going to love the ending. Guess what? Some of us retain our abilities to judge even when we find out at the end that we've been flammed. A previous review stated that if you voted for Clinton, you'd love this book. That says everything you need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tremendous waste of a tree","review":"This drivel has unfortunately minimized Tom Wolfe's earlier work. If the author doesn't take you on one of his endless character tangents, he busies himself immersing the characters in homosexual, homophobic, and and bigoted issues, all with no identifiable point. If I could give it fewer than one star I would! Tom, we didn't \\"get it\\" !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Wolfe is my new hero","review":"I got this book on a lark. I have now read 5 books by Wolfe. All are great, but A Man in Full is the best. Atlanta, Georgia comes to life in full! We are treated to a grand allegory on the scale of a Jonathan Swift tale.

I am getting rather bored with many people chacterizing rural southeners as a bunch of good old boy rednecks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Have Been Better - Totally Pleasing","review":"This is a good book, really, and I expected nothing better. It's more than just entertainment, and it does not represent literature as an art, and represents the 90s. The characters are deep. The plot is complex and some passages are very funny and it's a page turner. It justifies all the \\"frenesi\\" created around it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a Man indeed","review":"This is what literature should be about. Mr. Wolfe takes you by the hand, you can relax, lay back and know you are going to be entertained. Superb! The end left me puzzeled though. Suddenly mr. Wolfe was gone; his work was done. A must read if you want to know LIFE!!! Compare this to The Great Story Tellers (e.g. Dostojevsky!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A promising begining, but a pathetic ending","review":"A Man in Full starts off with tremendous promise. Wolfe again weaves the same rich tapestry of characters, who intersect in and out of one another's lives, much as he did in Bonfire. I was really looking forward to a delicious climax. But less than half way through the book, we get lost. Instead, the players who seemed to offer the possibility of such rich texture muddle about as charicatures of themselves, or of players we've seen before in Bonfire or in other moral panderings. Even the names of the characters are there to beat you over the head with Wolfe's point: the sniveling sycophant named Peepgas (honest, I'm not making this up), or the successful black lawyer, Roger White, who is challenged by his \\"blacker than thou\\" friend, the Mayor of Atlanta. Ultimately, the ending is beyond disappointment. My advice: read the first 1/2, then put it down and imagine your own ending. You'll be much happier than if you suffer through the last 300-400 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor format for a lesson on standing up for what you believe","review":"With a nice starting plot and an interesting lead character the book traps you into thinking that lag equals suspence. Lag, later in the story, actually turns out to be the author's wondering about in blind search of a story to fit his ending and moral lesson.Stereotyped characters make the demographic rifts as subtle as a garbage truck on a baseball diamond. I quickly became tired of the repeated moral lesson from the Job-like character that abandoned his family and then spread the word to the lead character, who then left his family, to preach the word of Zeus.If it sounds bad, its because it is. Re-read a book you like rather than venture into this story of depthless characters and soapbox preaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Man in Full","review":"I should have quit reading when he mentioned shooting quail with buckshot. The author apparently did no research to make this a credible story.The ending was deplorable. The characters are caricatures.

It is as if Mr. Wolfe knew it was time to close the book, but lost interest instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!","review":"With so many reviews already available here, it is hardly necessary to add another one. I can be brief therefore. If you like Wolfe's prose style and are not one of those souls who profess they cannot stand it, this is one of his best books. It will keep you reading. Wolfe is humorous and a very keen observer of society. One thing that I noticed, and it is a very minor criticism, is that Wolfe's attempts at creating realistic settings for his books suffers here somewhat from a lack of research or personal experience. It is unimportant, but to give an example, he is way off on the climatic conditions at the wharehouse in Contra Costa County, the flight pattern of the Oakland airport and other such details of Conrad's California experience. Again, you can ignore that minor lapse, and I would not even mention it if it were not for Wolfe's attention to detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"the usual wolfe treatment--but thats ok with me.","review":"I understand Norman Mailer has written a review of A Man in Full--but I have been unable to find this. Can anyone help me here?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant satire about Southern life and life in America.","review":"\\"A Man in Full\\" is Tom Wolfe's brilliant satire about life in the South at the end of the millenium. He captures vacuous Southern society, the conflicts between Blacks and Whites, what it feels like to be a middle-aged wife who is dumped for a young chick and the sex charged life in our prisons. Wonderful characters such as Charlie Croker, the original Georgia Cracker, Roger Too White, lawyer and friend of Atlanta's mayor and about 45 others. You'll enjoy the way this story develops and how the plot twists and turns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters, dissapointing ending","review":"Like many of my friends who read this epic, we loved the characters, especially Charlie and Conrad. Wolfe made them and others come alive, warts and all, on the pages. The storyline was engaging and never tiring despite the book's length. Until the final chapter. It stunk. I got the feeling that Wolfe had spent all of this time developing these great characters and decided to just end the book before it went on for another few hundred pages. A wrriter with his genius is capable of a better, more believable ending. However, if you can look past this one flaw, you should enjoy A Man in Full."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars if not for the stupid ending","review":"I found the development of the story very enveloping. The parallel struggles of a rich man and a poor man and the attempt of a mediocre man to rise and a great man to avoid a fall. As the political aspect of the story evolved, there was an attempt at creating an issue and resolution of racial tension but the African American mayor and lawyer were just a side show and no real resolution was reached where there was not enough tension created that required a resolution.The first 600 pages of the 690 page book aside, were great. Then, apparently the author became bored and just decided to end the story by having everyone go crazy and give up on any further goals or motivations that had been created in the earlier part of the book.This was my first Thomas Wolfe novel. As I worked through the first 600 pages I told myself that I would read all of his works. After reading the last 90 pages of the book, I find it unlikely that I will read any more Wolfe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book; huge but worth the time to read; 4 1/2 stars","review":"I'm late in reviewing this based on the twenty billionreviews below.I will say to hit see all reviews and click the button inthe middle list that ranks by MOST HELPFUL (meaning these got the most clicks for helping). Otherwise, you'll be on this pageforever.Regarding the book, I really liked it. It was great untilthe end where it seemed to fall apart. I haven't yetdetermined if the author just got tired or he was trying tomake some offbeat message that I didn't get.If you need a reference, this is a notch below THE BONFIREOF THE VANITIES in story structure but the characters andevents and little things are just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling passages; unsatisfying plot","review":"I read this book shortly after I moved to Atlanta and was struck by the accuracy of Wolfe's portayal of this city. Wolfe's Atlanta characters are mainly wealthy white businessmen and black politicans, although some immigrants have cameos. I found the author's caricature of Atlanta's social and political life to be accurate. The most compelling scenes, however, were the ones set in a California prison, where one of the characters spends a few weeks. Overall, the book has an unsatisfying plot, but Wolfe's writing can often immerse you in the settings of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Well the best thing about this book was the ability to skim dozens of pages and read it fast. This book lacks the spirit and interest of Bonfire. The characters are too stereotyped and the whole thing with Conrad is sort of out there too far until the end, and then does not sufficiently tie. The better lecture on Epictetus is provided by J.D. Salinger 30 some years ago. I could have thought of better endings and certainly would have edited it more. Overall I found the book disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner of the first order","review":"Anyone with ambition can relate to the lead character in this marvelous story about an aging captain of industry who ultimately finds the journey far more enjoyable than the destination. Tom Wolfe has my vote as a talented author with the ability to keep the reader's interest through all subplots and characters he employs to tell the story of Charlie Croker, a Man in Full. An excellent and believable story that educates as well as entertains, I would recommend this book to anyone who simply likes to hear a good yarn."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly sucky ending","review":"Conrad is a wonderful character and the book is captivating but the ending is almost unbelievably idiotic and has taken my star rating for it down by four; contrary to the book blurb, it is not a hilarious work unless you count the TRULY SUCKY ENDING and even that isn't so much funny as it is a fracking slap in the face to the reader. What you have is a situation in which, after you read almost 700 pages, the author decides to tell you that you are a stupid fool for getting into the characters and tacks on a disgraceful, flippant ending. What a POS."},{"rating":"1","title":"First edition provider","review":"The provider would not return the book as I wanted original printing and this was the 3rd printing.I sent the book back and it was returned due to the provider not being there.They would not accept a return.Very disappointed---This is a zero rating"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story was undermined by an uninteresting side plot","review":"half the story seemed like a worthless tangent.

I'm sorry to say that I'm deeply disappointed. It's simply a very poor novel in every respect. The only way to make it interesting is to look upon the book as written not by the novelist Tom Wolfe but by the journalist Tom Wolfe as an portrait and measure of US in the 1990's. But as such it's a very sad and depressing portrait which must have been written by a man who hates the society he lives in. It's a society governed by self-interest displayed as greed or the fear of poverty.It makes me sad because I met much more of humanity and dignity when I spent a lot of time in US about 20 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over The Top Flop","review":"Simply, the longest cartoon ever. There is no grit here, just bluster and farce. Frankly, the story just isn't very interesting (even before it gets silly)and Wolfe must have realized that at some point in the writing, necessitating his shift to anexaggerated narrative that simply never gains traction or provokes any empathy for any character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above Most Heads","review":"Tom Wolfe can't do better than this and neither can anyone else. I would have read another 800 pages of this story. For me it wasn't overstuffed enough. The brilliance that Wolfe brings to bear in this novel boggles my mind. The amount of research he would have had to do for almost every element of the novel, from prison to Atalnata politics to horse breading would make most authors cringe away from undertaking such a task. What flies over most heads, it seems to me, is the ending. Are we supposed to take this final foray into the absurd seriously? I don't know. Was Don Quixote insane or inspired? If I were Mr. Wolfe I would be reading most of these reviews with a sardonic grin.

While some readers may find it reminiscent of 19th century novels and their focus on manners, I find it refreshing to live with believable people who are both the shapers and the products of their society. And is there anyone who can draw pictures in words as well as Wolfe? At times, I laughed aloud: he was describing people I see every day - their movements, their clothes (what a fabulous eye the man has!), their sweat stains. He also has them talk, and the sounds of Hawaiian pidgen, Georgia cracker, California Okie, urban street talk, and whiney bankdom (among others)all ring true.

While not a perfect book, and surprisingly devoid of his signaturerunonsentencesasonlytomwolfecancreate, this is nonetheless a worthwhile and even important novel.

You find yourself wisking through a dozen pages at a time, being pestered with minor, irrelevant detail, constant and annoying insights in to what characters are thinking. A good third of this book doesn't need to be read----it's just too bad he didn't mark the pages he wrote strictly to achieve the desired length.

Usually wary of promotional hype, I gave A Man in Full A Try. I've never done so much skimming when reading. The plot is weak. There are no fully developed characters; not even good caricatures.

The great characters, the multilevel \\"reversal of fortune\\" story, and especially the acute cultural observations that we expect from Wolfe are all there. But the ending is a failure. Where the ending of Bonfire was both believable and fulfilling for the reader (man loses all the world but gains his own soul), Man in Full ends with Croker becoming some kind of pagan Jerry Falwell, preaching Zuesian tent revivals all over the south. Am I missing something, or did my revered Man in White run out of steam and throw his plot over the top?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed way more editing","review":"WHAT a disappointment. The book was way too long by several hundred pages, and the constant repetition of descriptions (HOW many times did I need to know about Serena's cascading hair??? etc. etc.) was really tiresome. Perhaps Mr. Wolfe's reputation discouraged his editor(s) from actually doing their job. A pity. I have no idea what all the raving over this book was about. It was interesting in spots, but overall not worth the necessary investment in time. Could have been a lot better if the constant repetitions and endless descriptions had been pared down, and more effort had gone into the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Wolfe writes arrogantly, repeatedly reminding me what the Deep South (in his imagination) pronunciation is of hundreds of words.

Rarely does one encounter a human being without any redeeming quatlities whatsoever. However, Tom Wolfe managed to create an entire city of such characters. There was not one character in all of the book that I cared about in the least, which in committing to spend a week or more in reading a novel, is critical. Charlie Croker's arrogance is only equaled by Conrad Hensley's sanctimony. The ending was trite befitting the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long, Too Slow, No Ending, etc.....","review":"It takes forever to get into the story line, but after a couple of hundred pages you actually meet all the characters.

However, this book is tiresome, not pleasurable, and simplistic in its character portrayals. The characters are such unpleasant people; not one of them demands the reader's sympathy, and some are pretty pathetic I'm convinced it would not have been considered for publishing were the author not Tom Wolfe.

UGH!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't shoot Quail with Buckshot","review":"You don't shoot quail with buckshot, you shoot deer with buckshot and quail with birdshot. Ask the folks down in Albany, GA. A great book. Mr. Wolfe must be the most observant person ever! Sometimes I got too much detail and often that detail was repeated later. I did not care for the ending. I feel like I know what made Charlie tick and don't think he would have bowed out like he did. Ending wasn't believable. All that said, I am going to read another of Tom Wolfe's books. What a talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you must -- wait for the paperback","review":"I settled down for a good read. Wolfe rambled around and took me on a herky-jerky ride through interesting sub-plots that ended nowhere.

This author wasted my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing style and characters substitute for no plot","review":"Without a doubt, TW writes some of the best social commentary and can develop characters with the best of them. Here, the character development and subplots are so well done that it hides the fact that the book really didn't have a story to tell (plot). The end was a real flop and steers the book dangerourly close to much ado about nothing. However, even though I felt cheated by the ending, the first 90% of the book kept me entertained so I can't demote this work too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let-down","review":"This book was a disappointment. It was so contrived. Wolfe spent 11 years on this book. Tom Clancy writes even longer books in three months, and Wolfe is certainly a better writer than Clancy, but he doesn't show that HERE. I'm not feeling sorry for him financially, since Wolfe made millions off A MAN IN FULL. But what a waste of talent, when he could have been producing something great. F. Scott Fitzgerald said that the stuff he wrote the fastest was the best stuff. Wolfe should have heeded this advice in year 5, and started a different book. Oh, well, Wolfe can take comfort in the fact that Edmund Morris spent 16 years on his Reagan book DUTCH, and it's even bigger garbage than A MAN IN FULL. I hope Wolfe returns to nonfiction, which is what he does best (witness his recent article in FORBES)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transplanted Atlantan Speaks","review":"As a person who has been physically removed from Atlanta for several years, I was asked to read Wolfe's book so I could comment on the validity of the scenario. I felt like I was riding in the limo with Wesley Dobbs Jordan and Roger Too White! I'm ready to go back and travel those streets myself! Wolfe is a fabulous researcher. I found myself so connected to the book that it was a letdown when I actually finished it. Never have I read a 750+ page book in such a short time. I also felt betrayed at the end because I did not want to see the characters end up the way they did. I have not read Bonfire of the Vanities, but I plan to read it right away! I recommend this book to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"4-in-1","review":"At least 4 great novels wrapped in one average novel. Average by standards of Tom Wolfe off course. After reading his other novel \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\", you feel that Tom Wolfe could have done much better than this one. The most disturbing aspect of this book is, like I said before, that there are too many different stories going on and they have a not much of an influence on the main story. At least one of them, the story of the guy who was sacked from a company owned by the main character, has no relevance to the main story until the ending pages and even that link is very weak. Honestly, I was a bit disappointed when I finished this book. Not because it's lousy, no, it's not, but because I was expecting much more riveting thing from the author of \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\". My recommendations: A must read and if you haven't read \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\", read this book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing, sweeping, epic","review":"Wolfe is brilliant. Don't miss this book. What I like best is how the author captures the feel of all the different places and sub-cultures he takes us to.

The ending feels somewhat abrupt, but that does nothing to detract from the overall greatness of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Memorable Story of a Man","review":"\\"A Man in Full\\" is a very good character study in the form of a novel. This book traces the arc of one man's personal and professional development and change. This arc is traced through the eyes of that very man, through the eyes of his personal and professional acquaintances and in a well-defined time and elegantly crafted place.This, to me, offers many of the elements that define a great novel: a character-driven storyline, a clear and multi-threaded plot and a well-defined time and place. \\"A Man in Full\\" offers each of these elements and overlays a bit of philosophy as well.The philosophical bent to this book makes sense at times but ends up confusing things at the close of this novel, in my opinion. That notwithstanding, I recommend this book to readers looking for an entertaining and engaging read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain fun reading","review":"Wolfe's bestseller from a couple years back is an enormously entertaining, satirical, yet all too real take on America at the close of the 20th century. Set in Atlanta, the paths of bankrupt real estate entrpreneur, Charlie Croker, and escaped felon, Conrad Hensley, are inexorably drawn together to the book's climax. Along the way, their stories hilariously touch upon themes of capitalism run amok, race relations, sex relations, crime and punishment, aging, trophy wives, and ancient Stoic philosphy. I'm not a great fan of satire, but Wolfe does it so adroitly with such well-drawn and entertaining characters that I found this book hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ironic, a little long, still a page-turner. Weak ending","review":"Wolfe certainly has his pulse on the late 1990s. I wonder if it will rekindle interest in Philosophy, or will his portrayal of Conrad seem a little too hard to believe?

The popularity of books like A Man In Full, I think, stems from how little they challenge people-- that is we can read these books and feal literate because we understand them, where as legitmiate writing is too challenging, and makes us feel that we are not up to its requirrements."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Panned in Full'","review":"Unwieldy 'Brave New Journalism'.. so where's the beef?

I live in the South, 85 miles from Atlanta, and have worked in Atlanta for 5 years. I know most of these people, and the ones I don't know I am sure I have run into on Peachtree Street at some point.

There were some parts that could have been better edited and others that should have had longer treatment.

Not so. Instead of a recovery from his well-publicized psychological problems, for Wolfe this book seems more like therapy. He covers over 700 pages with cardboard characters, soap opera dialogue, B-movie action scenes, and formula-driven story lines, but only occasionally succeeds in compelling my attention. Perhaps the main problem is that among all the egos and libidos there is not one character who is complex or sympathetic.

However, there are some sublime reading moments within (the quail plantation dinner, Martha's interactions with Ray, the jail tv room, the workout session at the bank). But you work much too hard laboring through the rest of it. This needed better editing. Wolfe should have negotiated for six more months to cut it back some, tighten the whole thing and come up with a plausible ending. The ending screams \\"Deadline Panic.\\" Read the first half of the book, read about Conrad in jail and avoid the last few chapters.

But ultimately, I was left feeling absolutely betrayed and cheated by the ridiculous and contrived ending concocted by Mr. Wolfe. It makes no sense to invest this much time and energy into developing characters \\"in full,\\" only to subject them to a fate right out of Mad Magazine or National Lampoon. One can only conclude that Mr. Wolfe, like his protagonist, lacked the energy and/or interest to resolve the \\"tornados\\" spinning in Mr. Croker's mind and simply left everything a mess for others to sort out. In the final analysis, you will be disappointed with this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much,too long","review":"The author has certainly displayed his command of the English language.Unfortunately, he was too zealous in impressing this reader of his command of street and prison vocabulary. No reader should have to work so hard to follow his characters' long conversations. The author's descriptions are so long as to make one wonder if he is paid by the word.

The rest is just so much dirty froth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed!","review":"I liked Bonfire of the Vanities a lot--it is one of my favorite books. So I looked forward to reading A Man in Full but I was really disappointed. I agree with the negative reviews.

This tale (not all that profound to begin with) could have been told in not even half the space. Wolfe has famously disparaged some of his contemporaries (notabley Mailer and Updike) for not \\"leaving the building,\\" that is not getting out and observing how the world really works. Sorry, but Mailer and Updike were artists and \\"A Man in Full\\" is artless in the extreme. This is a thrilling ride for the first 250 pages or so ('The Saddlebags' chapter is brilliant), but, alas, there are over 500 pages after that, and only a dutiful reader will make it to the extremely disappointing end. This is an overwritten, extremely repetitious novel of, in the end, commonplace observations. This will not keep me from tackling \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons\\" in the near future, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"A MAN IN FULL is author Tom Wolfe at his best, which is to say: Brilliant. As a social historian, there is no one better than Wolfe. He details his stories with an abundance of background detail that add to these stories' success in ringing chords of truth. Wolfe also is a satirist, noting and then puncturing the bubbles of pretension that permeate every stratum of society.A MAN IN FULL is a vast novel, almost Dickensonian in its scope. It crosses the United States, in the process touching on many of the subcultures and social classes which now reside within our borders. Wolfe never loses his pitch, crafting a plot in which every one of the multitude of detail pulls together into a cohesive whole. He keeps the reader engrossed to the final page."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much written... so little said","review":"Never has so much been written about so little. This book is a real snoozer. There are way too many details, and the author tries too hard to be politically correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Wolfe's comic talent?","review":"Not by far as funny as 'Bonfire of the Vanities'. It is a reasonably entertaining story though, that you keep reading to find out what will happen, but not because of the writing itself. The book is also worth reading because of its illustrations of interesting things like the goings on in investment banking and how a bank attempts to retrieve a large loan from a company. And the life of a business tycoon, and prison life, and the world of illegal aliens. These illustrations would all be based on journalistic research and not on the imagination of the writer. What is rather fanciful is the enthousiasm of the young labourer for the writings of the Stoics, and the business tycoon transforming his life because of his teaching from it. But what I missed above all was the comedy that you expect having read his previous novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The traffic report was more interesting","review":"I ordered this book on audiotape for the daily commute. Like others I anticipated an interesting story based on The Bonfire of the Vanities. After several tapes I kept flipping it off for the radio. I struggled on through a few more but finally gave up. The characters are so damn boring and stupid. Charlie Crocker the man who has built this huge empire is totally clueless. His wife, son, financial adviser, bankers all have to give him direction. The other main plot line built around Conrad story was a playback of The Bonfire of the Vanities but this time with a dirt-poor protagonist rather than a rich and powerful one.Nothing in this book is interesting. Usually if you don't like the characters you can find some enjoyment in the construction or the background material but this just grinds on with endless boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buchhead brillantly displayed by the Master of Storytelling","review":"After reading the Bonfire of the Vanities and The Right Stuff, Wolfe is my nr. 1! A Man in Full resembles the Bonfire a lot. I do remember that also the bonfire has a bit disappointing end so does a MIF. However the first 400 pages are terrific. I read the book in a couple of days on the beach in Puerto Rico and often I had to explain to my company why I was lauching in myself. Especially the scenes in Oakland (Suicidal Freezer and in the desperate scene with the towed away car are magnificient. Also the workouts from Charlie by PlannersBanc are very good. I think Wolfe is at his best describing ultimate painful situations. I think this novel is a must read for anybody!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why use one word when ten will do?","review":"The character development was interesting, and not at all difficult to keep apace. The plot line, or lines, has enough swirl in and out of focus to allow both the development of parallel themes, while reminding the reader that other things were going on, too.I would have enjoyed the book more if Mr. Wolfe had left something to the imagination besides the ending. Every scene, every line, even the accent of the main character, was described to a level of detail that only took 125 pages to become boring. Mr. Wolfe should appreciate his audience more, and regard their intelligence more highly. My lasting impresssion will be that I was insulted by a over-bearing, over-burdensome novel, that I wish I had not paid as much for it. It only needed to be about 325 pages long."},{"rating":"1","title":"BONFIRE WAS BETTER","review":"When I started reading this book I thought it had potential to be as enjoyable as Bonfire. I was mistaken. Actually, the last two hundred pages were almost torture. The conclusion was terrible. Don't be fooled by all the hype!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He tried but his writing ruined a good story.","review":"I didn't find it funny. The story could have been told in one-third the pages. The early development of Charlie Croker was perfect but wasn't sustained as the descriptions of his behavior as attempts to define his personality became repetitive. To anyone who has known someone like that (or lived in Georgia), who he was became qukckly apparent. The possible humor in his becoming an evangelist was without impact because by the time it was revealed, the reader's thought was only, \\"when is this thing going to end?\\". My enjoyment of the book was ruined by many factual errors. For example Gulfstream have always numbered their successive models with Roman Numerals (Gulfstream V, not Gulfstream 5). He should have invented his own airplane and called it the \\"Big time flyer\\" or some such. The story concept was very good but the reader was so overburdened with page after page of unrelated words that the humor in, and potential of, the story was lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner that exemplifies America in the 90s","review":"Man, can Tom Wolfe write! The author of The Right Stuff and Bonfire of the Vanities (not to mention The Electric Acid Kool-Aid Test) has done an excellent job re-creating all of modern-day Americana in a single tome. The characters, some villainous, others heroic, all have characteristics that we can identify with. The story woven around these characters is very good, but this book is mostly about what they represent, not what they do. And it's funny to boot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I wasted my time (and money).","review":"Is Mr. Wolfe kidding? This is one of the least satisfying reading experiences I have ever had. He loses steam at the end and wraps up all the very loose ends in the plot with a conversation between two of the characters. I don't blame him. I couldn't figure out much relationship between the two stories he is telling, either. He has filled the book with almost unreadable dialect. No one since Mark Twain has done dialect well, and even he used it sparingly. This book is a classic reminder to beware of hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Tom Wolfe paid by the word?","review":"Thank goodness I bought this book at a discount store (my apology to Amazon.com). I started to read it while keeping my wife company as she lay in a hospital bed...I was soon in more pain than she was. Wordy, wordy, wordy,blah, blah, blah. Not very much to say with so very many words. The pages flew by as I skipped page after page of boredom. I finally put it down, after 300+ pages and won't pick it up again. I started reading a book my almost 9 year old daughter was reading, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\", and it was far more enjoyable, interesting, and well written. I recommend \\"Harry...\\". Pass on Tom's tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Wolf has never written a bad book and this one is great.","review":"I'll be honest with you, I haven't always loved 'everything' Tom Wolfe has written, but I never read one of his books that I didn't like a lot. After reading a couple of press reviews, including RS, of 'A Man In Full' I was convinced and ordered it. I really enjoyed the story, the characters and the tight writing style. Not as exciting as Steiger's thriller, Alien Rapture, but an excellent read never-the-less. I've read thirty books from amazon this year and can recommend; Blood Work by Connelly, Cobra Event by Preston (Hot Zone), and best of all, Alien Rapture by Brad Steiger. All excellent reading written by the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big ol' Peyton Place bore","review":"What a joke! Caricature's, stereotypes, high drama and an ending written with an obvious sequel in mind. Is this what all the hype is about?Not only are the women cartoon characters but so are the men. My first Tom Wolfe novel and probably my last. All the hullabaloo and I'm thinking, great, a well written, intense, maybe even profound novel. Perfect! What a mistake. The characters have no dimension whatsoever, there are no surprises and I finished this book and thought, what a rip! I'm surprised Oprah hasn't put this one on her book list. All those kudos and I'll never know why. John Updike and Norman Mailor have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO FEAR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointingly flat and limited","review":"I laughed all the way through Bonfire, but had only an occassional chuckle with A Man in Full. Only two characters develop, and only because Wolfe needs a story line. I hope I missed most of the jokes because I know the northeast well and have little experience with Atlanta. If this is true,it is a novel someone else would enjoy. However, it also means that Wolfe is not writing literature for all times, but local fiction about a particular era. (Better to read John Irving's Widow for One Year: it's full of unlikeable characters, but they're real and one cares about them.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to start but then picks up","review":"Started the book and read it for two weeks and only was able to get through about 200 pages. Then it started getting interesting. Was unable to finish the book at that time as I had borrowed it from a friend and had to return it. Unable to stop thinking about it and bought it myself to finish it. Thought it was very good from about page 250, A particularly interesting story in the book involves a character named Conrad and what happens to him when he goes into Oakland, CA to apply for a temporary job."},{"rating":"1","title":"EGAD, WHAT AN ENDING!","review":"WOLFE HAS CRAFTED AN INTERESTING PLOT WITH A VARIED CAST OF CHARACTERS, ALL DRAWN TOGETHER IN EVER-TIGHTENING CIRCLES. IT ALL WORKS WELL FOR ABOUT 650 PAGES AND KEPT ME PONDERING THE VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES FOR THE ENDING. WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! PREPOSTEROUS, RIDICULOUS, STUPID, TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE, IDIOTIC! WHAT HAPPENED? DID MR. WOLFE SUDDENLY GET SICK OF WRITING THIS STORY? KIND OF REMINDS ME OF GRISHAM WHOSE BOOKS SUFFER THE SAME DISEASE. THE NY TIMES REVIEW IS RIGHT ON THE MARK."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable and humerous tour-de-force","review":"A Man in Full is great. The story follows Atlanta real-estate mogul Charlie Croker through his peak, fall, and ultimate redemption as he grapples with executives at PlannersBank for control of his waning empire. The novel also depicts a maze of supporting characters through situations ranging from corporate conspiracy to prison escape. Wolfe's writing is in vintage form, and his commentary on class and race are right-on. The novel is hilarious and compelling, and difficult to put down. The characters are well-developed and multifaceted; the human depiction encourages the reader to feel sympathy rather than contempt even in the midst of high depravity. Highly recommended to readers who enjoy sophisticated humor and tightly-woven plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts well. Ends poorly","review":"The structure of the characters were interesting. Less written would have been an improvement. Too much warm up. Author could have shortened the manuscript. I fell asleep reading this one. Better luck next time. A tint of Greek methology. Life in the 90's???? Give me the 20's to'59"},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlanta in Full","review":"Take a nice starting plot and an interesting lead character, and you have a book that traps you. Later in the story, it actually turns that the author's character Conrad is wandering about in search of a moral lesson.Hilarious characters make the demographic rifts as smooth as a truck on a truck lot. I quickly became enamored of the lesson from the Job-like character that abandoned his family and then spread the word to the lead character, who then left his family, to preach the word of Zeus.If it sounds great, its because it is. Re-read this book and venture into this story of deep characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rollicking Good Fun","review":"There's more generalized hubris in this book than Moby Dick, more twists and turns than a trip down the Mississippi with Huck Finn. Like most great books 'A Man in Full' can be taken at several levels. In this case as a cautionary tale of modern life, a classics inspired allegory of pride and recompense or perhaps as a satirical lampoon of the great American success story (including the great American novel). Which ever of these ways you take it you will enjoy the rich descriptive essays and humour of life in the 1990's. If you're the type who goes into paroxysms of self righteous indignation at anything resembling political incorrectness or less than subtle characterizations of life and frailty in our modern world stay away from this book. Tom Wolfe has a steel tipped harpoon aimed directly at you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very very very long read but kept me going until the end.","review":"I have never read anything by Tom Wolfe although I did see Bonfire and Right Stuff in the Theaters and actually liked both a lot. This book is nothing like the other two stories, which isn't a bad thing. The author is has an amzing ability to weave a story and bring unlikely characters together. That said, I felt that some of the characters portrayed were somewhat weak in terms of being interesting or shallow in their developemnet. There were two fasinating characters that make this book worthwhile and that get you going until the end.The ending was a big disapointment that left you thinking why did I spend the time to get such a lousy forced climax. It is like a roller coaster with out a big drop.Over all the book had some real nice nuggets but but not enough of them to recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why are readers criticising the ending?","review":"I have just finished this book which I read in less than a week. It had me hooked from beginning to end. I had read some of the reviews here before I read the book so was prepared to be disappointed by the end, but thought it was a great ending for such an absorbing book. Not being an American may have made a difference, but I enjoyed all Wolfe's caricatures of contemporary American manhood - the real estate developer, upand coming Black lawyer, aspiring politician, jailbird, arrogant athlete, failed middle management banker, etc etc, even Croker's tramsformation into an inspirational speaker at the end - all these are real, albeit exaggerated, examples of America today. Great book; even better than Bonfire of the Vanities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beats sleeping pills anytime","review":"A Man in Full is a Book in Dull. I firmly believe that without the name Tom Wolfe on the cover, it would not have been published, it wouldn't have even found a literary agent. I didn't care for the characters and the story bored me to death-I used the novel to put me to sleep for two months, that's how long it took me to finish it. The sparkle and brilliance of his earlier work is completely missing here. Having written the above, now I confess that Tom Wolfe is my favorite author, and the two best books I've ever read were written by him: The Bonfire of the Vanities, and the much older The Right Stuff. Tremendous pity. No star given by this reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Promise.... No Delivery!","review":"A lesson on how to ruin a good book!

It's a fine story that marks a good introduction to this series. You learn just enough during the course of the stories to want to learn more, which you do in future installments. It sets the template for what is to come: Zen is given a case that no one really wants solved, there is trouble. Good, solid mystery with many interesting secondary charracters. Read the first, you will continue to the last. Maybe not compulsively but steadily."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clever psychological mystery set in Perugia, Italy","review":"A friend passed on this book, saying that I would like it in spite of the fact that it was a mystery novel.

A very satisfying novel, full of interesting bad guys and even a few good ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accomplished their purpose and beyond","review":"I believe that the authors wanted to display the wonderful true life AIM lifestyle in fiction format and they have succeeded. Beyond that they have provided a fun yet very educational book. What better way to learn the ins and outs of network business than by an entertaining and enjoyable novel.

I fully expected to get a book that had a history of U.S. artillery from--as the title says--The Spanish/American War to Present. What I got was an awful book with lousy production values that centered on a hodgepodge of photos about U.S. artilleryman UNIFORMS. Brother. The first couple of pages are color, and then the book descends into a morass of black-and-white photos. Now I know that a lot of (pre-color film) photos were created in B&W, but some are conversions from color to B&W...and very, very poorly done, at that. They're muddy; haven't been corrected at all, and the screening they did in production is abysmal.

The radio is nicely designed, comes with a sharp leather case- when you whip this baby out, everyone will be impressed with your cosmopoliatan Euro-cool. Less impressive is the performance of this radio. Tinny audio, only fair fidelity on FM, and shortwave performance is pretty dismal. Sensitivity to weak signals is mediocre, selectivity (ability to separate closely-spaced stations) is poor, and the shortwave bands are full of noise from the internal synthesiser.

Very useful for deep sleepers, and recommended for anyone who ever slept through their alarm clock.Other than the ultra-loud buzzer, this model features HUGE numbers, possibly the biggest I've seen for any clock radio. Useful for those who wear glasses/contacts and remove them at bedtime. The brightness of the numbers can also be dimmed so that it won't distract you.Also features an \\"Alarm Reset\\" button which resets your alarm for 24 hours. The button is conveniently placed over an inch behind the \\"snooze\\" bar, farther away than all other buttons to prevent accidental pushing.All in all, a good clock radio with a simple-to-use design to make sure you wake up on time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it work?","review":"The clock radio has had problems and I've only had it for a week.

Now that I have it, I see why this was the only model left.What the box doesn't say is that one alarm setting is for the radio and the other is for the buzzer. Frankly the \\"user manual\\" doesn't explain this either. I didn't know that the buzzer and radio each had a separate alarm time setting until I read one of the other reviews here. The user manual could have been written much better.The physical design is poor. How many buttons does it take to implement these features: Radio on/off, setting the clock, setting alarm 1, setting alarm 2, and snooze? This alarm clock uses two 4-position slide switches and seven separate buttons. User-friendly this ain't. The goal of a good manual is to eliminate the need for product support.

I've read the manual and I'll have to admit it's not very clear about using the secret \\"Alarm Reset\\" button. You have to set 2 different things on this alarm clock in order for it to go off in the morning. It's one of those things that is very easy to miss when you're tired and want to go to bed. As a result, I have missed several morning class sessions due to my alarm not going off in the morning. Try explaining that one to your professor!!!

The most heinous example is the ending words of the book: Wilde tells us that in order for civilization to advance Reason [apparently exclusively male] had to conquer Mystery [the female speciality]. The book is rather disorganized, as if Wilde changed her purpose part way through. She looks at Central Asian warrior women, but rejects them as not matching closely enough with the Amazons' history/myth. Then she hops around in time and space recounting instances of feminine authority, especially in the religious sphere. Interesting little tidbits, but nothing really startling.

Here is real life--people struggling to make lives for themselves in a country that is neither easy nor forgiving.

It's a clunker, if you put this thing in your pocket (if it will fit) you will feel it. Hell, it might even pull your pants down. The thickness also makes it awkward to write in since it never folds flat and there is always resistance when jotting down an idea, which makes writing a chore (which is counter productive to the pocketbook ideal, which is maximum convenience).

I've read every book he's published since Matt Scudder's drinking days. But he's gotten soft and complacent in recent books. Yes, all his characters talk exactly the same: they all go into these silly off-topic tangents and have a wry humor that is just fine for Bernie, but is way off the mark for Matt or Keller. Block has drifted far away from his noir roots. Keller is not a cold blooded hit man, he's a transparent piece of cardboard. A real killer would have speculated about killing the kids playing basketball in the driveway, if that's what it took to carry out his contract. This is the first Block book in twenty years that I have put aside unfinished. A major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit Man","review":"The John Keller character just got me going.I liked the simple conversations and John's day dreamingaround every hit he was on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable flawed character","review":"I had never read a Lawrence Block book and it was recommended that I do so by a friend, but he recommended the Matt Scudder series. Seeing this, I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. It was well written with interesting characters and scenarios. It was a fast read.

Had the suspicion not lingered, however, I doubt whether I could have continued to read through to the end. Indeed, the uncertainty was what kept me turning the pages. I had to know. I have to say, though, that had the finish revealed a HIT MAN to have been taken seriously, I'd have been angry for failing to sense that direction and for wasting my time and energy reading something I'd have found quite unpalatable. (All shadows of all doubts were convincingly erased with the introduction of philately.) I wonder how many authors could have pulled this off successfully.Thanks, Mr. Block, for a deliciously spicy read. Now, how about more Matt Scudder."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, a hit man who is not miscaninthropic.","review":"This is another boonie dog book review by Wolfie and Kansas. Lawrence Block's \\"Hit Man\\" is a breath of fresh air in the contract killer genre. Hit men in books have tended to be miscaninthropic. Rex Feral included a section on the elimination of guard dogs in \\"Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors\\". Donald Goines' Daddy Cool murdered a German shepherd in cold blood. However, Block's hit man, Keller, likes dogs and is a tolerably conscientious companion to a dog for a portion of this book.Block's \\"Hit Man\\" is a collection of short stories which, taken together, form as coherent a whole as any novel. The reader witnesses Keller's moral development over time. We hope that Block continues writing Keller stories and developing this character. Keller has the potential to become a canine rights activist like Rex Miller's Daniel \\"Chaingang\\" Bunkowski."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not vintage Block","review":"While I never tire of Block's style and his ability to shape characters, I found this book to be 'Seinfeld-ish'. It was over 300 pages about nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - man just doing his job.","review":"This book makes me yawn. Basically, this is a story of a guy who likes dogs.

While I wasn't expecting literature, I expect a thriller to, well, thrill. No story, no action, no plot and flat, banal characters of little interest. Dialogue too sketchy to fill a Walker-Texas Ranger episode. Other than that, the pointless descriptions of the main character's imaginary conversations with his dog are real page turners--in the sense that you flip pages to skip those sections. This book has no tension, no drama, no conflicts of any kind. Any Jane Austin book is more pulse-pounding than this. The only mystery about it is why anyone would waste their time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"The book was written well by the author but only in his use of words. I felt by the limited experience of the author it really didnt do the subject matter justice. Keller seemed as though he was in a daze most of the time and in dire need of mental confinement. This character lacked the true emotional stability necessary for his line of work. Furthermore, the character remained so unfocused throughout his \\"hits\\" that it seemed highly unlikely he could have completed the contracts or get away with the act. The \\"hits\\"and there descriptions were so novice that had there actually been a real need for an assasination I doubt very seriously that the author could have interpreted it to paper.P.S.

I don't know what I kept expecting to heppen, but whatever it was...didn't. What a character sketch Mr. Block has given us. I loved every part of this book.

Although the book is an easy read, I found myself at a loss when it came to relating to the lead character, Keller. Certain points along the way made me laugh and then others just made me think what kind of person just kills for the sole sake of money? Isn't there more to life than just waiting for the phone to ring for the next kill? Lastly, I kept hoping at the end that Keller would have some redeeming qualities, but it never happened. I would have thought the ending more fitting if Keller, himself, had been killed.

Not because it was so interesting, but because it was so depressing. Keller is very good at what he does but his life is dull. Maybe that's Mr. Block's point. A hit man is just another poor slob trying to get through life, doing what he does best and trying to make sense of it all.

I skipped whole sections in the back about stamp collecting. Just kill some more people why don't you? If we wanted to know about feelings, we'd read Jane Eyre.The humor is really lame, too.

Is the Palm 3xe slightly bigger than the older units? I don't know, but regardless this dosen't work.As far as the quality of materials used, they seemed good, but not great.

I could tell that something had broken off, but I didn't have the expertise to fix it & resew the leather. So I sent it back to Palm for a refund.Now my Palm stays in my pocket.

The TRGpro (same size as a Palm III) fits in the case snugly with the cover still attached and slides out easily. The case clips to a belt or scrubs without a problem and hasn't even come close to falling off.

Otherwise it's a great buy at ~ $17.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"may actually cost $100!...","review":"The Palm III is just a great thing you want to carry everywhere with you. This case just looked great and I would tend to trust 3com for the quality of their products... Bad idea. The day after I bought this case, I found a nice crack on the screen of the palm. No way to know what happened but I did not do anything special and can not remember any peculiar shock. I must have just carried the palm in the case on my belt most of the time, and in my front pocket one hour as I used to do before to buy the case...

When I went to take a shot of this once in a lifetime event, the camera lens froze in the out position and would not take a picture. A moment lost forever! Attempts to get the camera fixed overseas were futile, as they would not honor a US warranty. I sent several emails to Olympus asking some direction but received no response.Also, soon after we purchased this model, my husband and I stood side by side taking the same picture with this and a Samsung comparable model, both on automatic, and found the resulting pictures to have no noticeable difference.

This movie was released by Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment (TCFHE) in the early days of DVD's. If you have a substantial DVD collection (or if you own True Lies), you know where I'm going with this. The movie is presented in wide screen format, BUT only for a 4:3 television set. IT IS NOT ENHANCED FOR 16:9 TV's. When you play the movie on a 16:9 TV, you get black bars on all four sides. As a result, the image is very small.

And you can quote me on that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monumentally Awful","review":"Truely one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to lay eyes on. I award this one star only because the Amazon ranking system does not allow zero ( or negative !) stars in the rating options. I thought \\"The Quiet Man\\" was a bad enough representation of an \\"Oirish\\" movie but Waking Ned explores previously uncharteded depths. I know this movie is supposed to be a light piece of whimsy and not to be taken too seriously. Believe me, I am as open to whimsy as the next person but when one sees how much better it can be ( and has been ) done - \\"Whisky Galore\\" immediately comes to mind - it is just bloody annoying to have to sit through this mindless drivel. A movie clearly designed for the mass American market of tourists who come to Ireland , wearing lime green trousers, dreadful garish jackets and proclaiming themselves to be \\"Irish\\". I am amazed that this movie has been a success. It deserves to wither away and die."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bunch of thieves","review":"Am I the only viewer in the world who has trouble with a movie who's premise is that it is ok to steal...both from the lottery and from the rightful heir to Devine's fortune (who is the heir because of the scummy morals of the local \\"beauty\\").

I didn\`t find anything humorous about two greedy men who find Ned Devine a recent winner of the lottery dies of apparent shock when he found out he won. So the two men go out of their way to claim the money. Ridulcous and obvislouy the producers wanted to cash in on the surprising sucess of THE FULL MONTY and failed misrably.

This is both a good thing and a bad thing, since there is a tendency to rely on cosiness when portraying the Republic in film and television, and to populate beuatiful scenery with stereotyped \\"Eejits\\". To some extent Waking Ned fals into this trap, but it is saved by a Ted-like anarchy and a better than average plot. It's also great to see David Kelly in particular in a starring role, he will be familiar to fans of Fawlty Towers as O'Reilly the builder."},{"rating":"2","title":"YAY!","review":"All i can say is when i finished watching the movie... i said YAY!

Filmed in a beautiful village on the Isle of Man, it features actors that are not beautiful physically (although not ugly either) and a story line that is incredible, but not quite impossible. And you come away from it feeling good. Even the Wicked Witch gets her just desserts.I lent it to an Irish friend who was down after attending several funerals of old friends and it restored his good spirits. It's that kind of film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"I never get tired of this film or it's music (and I rarely go for soundtracks, but I picked up this one). Leonard Maltin's movie book calls this a \\"slight\\" film but I find it huge on charm and heart. It's a well-paced, old-fashioned caper story in which all but two residents (approximately 52 to begin with) of an impoverished remote rural Irish village conspire to collect the big lottery when their old pal, Ned Devine, has died in the excitement of learning he's won. Of the two exceptions, one is the head priest who is conveniently out of town when the story is set in motion and the other is a humorless old crone who threatens to tattle. You can't help but cheer on the chicanery in a film where the humor ranges from the black to the silly to the sentimental. Seems to me the only person who will not be won over by this movie is a humorless old crone. The scenery is stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and Refreshing!","review":"Movies try so hard these days to send a message or portray an epic or be the master in fine special effects that when a delightful, funny, sweet movie with no ulterior motive comes along, it feels like a breath of fresh air. Waking Ned Devine is all of those-witty and charming, it tells of the antics of the small Irish town of Tully Moor, that tries to cash in on a lottery ticket of one of its citizens, except that the poor man is dead. But this movie is not without substance; interlaced among the comedic hijinks of the town we get to know the characters and their lives: the trials of Maggie, trying to raise a small son alone; Finn, the pig farmer, who's in love with Maggie; the town crank who is out to unveil the lottery scheme; and Jackie and Michael, two men whose friendship is a testament to the sweet Irish life. This is a hilarious movie full of great dialogue and a great storyline to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Excellent!","review":"This is a touching movie, full of beautiful Irish accents, jokes and music! This movie will touch your heart and give you a wonderful feeling all over.The actors do a beyond excellent job in this charming tale of Ned Divine who won the lotto, then died from the shock of it. His 2 friends decide to split the winnings amoung the small village, but they have to make sure the Lotto doesn't know Ned Divine is really dead.If you don't like this film, you've got no one to blame but yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Ballykissangel?","review":"I just got done watching this movie. It is a hoot!If you enjoyed the series Ballykissangel, you will enjoy this movie.It moves very fast and you will wish it lasted longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bit O' Irish Fun","review":"Waking Ned Devine is a wonderful, hilarious movie that focuses on the antics of two old (but not down) men who hatch a brilliant but very risky scheme that if it works, will bring wealth to their small Irish town, but if it fails will land them in jail for fraud. The performances by all are so good, you are drawn into the movie and in love with all the characters from the start.A subplot of romance between a beautiful single mother and an earnest (but smelly) pig farmer adds to the general warmth of the movie. The end scene is one of the most well-executed ones I have ever seen. It is a real show stopper.

When the lucky winner dies, Jackie and his old pal Michael (David Kelly) come up with a plan to cash in anyway.This simple tale of likeable folk who conspire to commit grand larceny is a real feel-good comedy. Bannen and Kelly are irresistible and had me under their spell from the beginning.

One person wins the lottery then dies, and a small town shares the winnings. But the movie didn't convince me at all. It lacked the real emotion that in real life it would create.

This snap-case version is the same version that kino video is selling except in a keepcase form. so who in there right mind would pay $100.00 for the same movie and transfer and original artwork. the only diffrence is the snapper case says image entertainment kino. ok...so what. kino video is the same cover same back except ooops not image entertainment. who lickes the snapper case cover anyway they damage easily. anyhow this movie is a classic and i highly recomend buy the cheaper price version which is basically the same with poster artwork inside. don't be robbed by these unrealstic sellers...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title says it all!","review":"A relentless thunderstorm forces an odd assortment of travelers to seek shelter in an isolated country house.

You can see Gloria Stuart, now famous for her role in Titanic, in one of the films that inspired her to quit show business the first time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"No gods or monsters","review":"All reviews (including this one) can be wrong. I relied on reviews from all sources to decide to buy this DVD.The feeble attempt to link the quality of the original \\"Frankenstein\\" to this film via a graphics screen between the titles and the film itself says it all: no one saw it.The print is often inadequate. The script puerile. The plot short and shoddy except for atmospheric changes which may be mistaken for bad image treatment.Without Karloff (who's wasted as a drunk) and the recent release of James Whale's autopix 'Gods and Monsters' no one would care any more about this film than they would George W. Bush without his father's presidency.Melvyn Douglas' performance is the DVD's one saving grace. Why Melvyn?Film restoration is priceless.

The acting is superb with some of finest British actors of the day, but perhaps a little too much talk and not enough action. Still the old house is refuge for a group of people trying to escape the thunderstorm, but finding more hostility and fear than welcome. The family inhabiting the old house is eccentric to say the least. This movie is a must for fans of old haunted houses. I can't imagine anyone actually going to bed and sleeping there.

Now you've got the early to mid (and in many people's minds, the best) recording eras of Holliday covered.It sure beats any other \\"best of\\" out there.

The cable is uber long I don't know what's up with that, why would I need a 4 foot cable 0_O so I have a bit of it still tied with the twisty tie so it doesn't get hooked on things when I walk by them or my little dog thinks it's a toy that I'm dangling over him."},{"rating":"2","title":"superior headphones","review":"these do all they say they will do and more. blocked out 99% of the backround noise on several recents flights i have taken. compared to 3 other pair on the same trip and they were far superior"},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could give ten stars, I would- **********!!!!!!!!","review":"These are the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned, the sound quality is EXCELLENT, well balanced highs and lows, and even bass!The volume control is a great plus, also!

They were rebranded as Koss PRO35A and cost $40. I was happy with them despite the price. After reading about these online, I realized I was a victim of an obscene mark-up. I returned them and bought a pair from here. These are great headphones.Pros: clear rich sound, good bass, good treble, decent mids, good style, good price, comfortable, L-shaped plug, short cord (may be a con for some)Cons: Nothing considerable. They don't seem like the sturdiest headphones. However, this means they're portable and light-weight. I can't expect much more for the price.If you want some practical headphones for your mp3 player and you hate ear-buds like me, then buy these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BUY IN HEADPHONES!","review":"These headphones are a best buy at only about $20 and you have to spend much more to get better ones. They're very comfortable and light. The bass is deep and the midrange and high-end is fairly clear. You have to keep the volume at a moderate level since the bass is strong. Otherwise this an amazing buy at the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing frequency response","review":"I was expecting these to be pretty good for the money as Koss is a good name in headphones, but given the price these are outrageously good. I have a lot of headphones, with several purchased this year from all the big names ranging from the Audio Technica M50's (the standard for \\"over-the-ear\\" as far as I'm concerned), Sennheiser HD 238 equally good but \\"on-ear\\" and the other end of the spectrum in price the JVC HA-V570. And these. I had been amazed at the availability of ultra-cheap headphones available at discount stores this holiday season and wondered how far roughly $10-$15 would go on Amazon. I chose these over the endless cheap cans available and I am stunned at how good they sound for the money, especially the bass response which is really good. These seem a lot like the Koss port-a-pro (I believe they were called) lightweight, over the ear Headphones. They are well made and seem less flimsy than others I've used of this type. Can't go wrong with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice sound for the money","review":"I finally had to replace my 20+ Sony studio headphones and did not want to spend a whole lot of money. I gave these a try and I really lucked out - these are great sounding headphones. My only complaint is a complaint I have on pretty much all headphones under $100. - the cord and connections are thin and cheesy. The Sony headphones I bought back in the day had a nice 10 foot curly telephone type cord that was indestructible. However, for the money these Koss headphones are a solid value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headphones","review":"These headphones fit my head fine but the sound is awful.

I recently passed them down to my son and was looking for another pair. I couldn't find them, but through some searching I found out that loss made them for radio shack. Turns out the ktxpro1 is the same as the pro35a. Go figure. Quality is great and sound is awesome. Plus they are 60 ohm impedance which is good for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb sound quality, but the volume controls are trouble","review":"I have a pair of these and I must say that while their sound quality is superb, the external volume control is already giving me problems. When Koss makes a break in the wire to splice it into a volume control, those splices have a potential to be the weakest part of the circuit and they break first.I have thought of splicing around the volume box, but the coated wires are tough to splice effectively. They should make this without the external volume control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound - Great, Fit - YMMV","review":"Pro - These sound great. The price-point is hard to beat.Con - The fitting did not work for me initially. There is only one point of pivot for the speaker on each ear. These replaced a very old pair of headphones of the same price level that were shorting out. The design of the old pair had two points of swivel in the speaker over each ear creating a more comfortable fit. I imagine the over-the-head band part on these phones has a metal core as I was able to bend it to it fit better. Before bending, I could really feel the thicker band over the head (compared to the skinny band of my old set).Summary - I'm happy after bending to fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for TV","review":"I use these for watching TV, and occasionally for music on iPod & phone. The sound quality is excellent (and much better than other comparably priced sets I've tried), with plenty of volume range. They're also comfortable, and I can wear them without feedback from my BTE hearing aids. My only complaint would be that the volume slider becomes finicky after a few months of use, and eventually one ear stops working (has happened on 3 different sets over a period of several years). But the price is so reasonable, and I've never found a headset that works as well for me, so I consider that a small price to pay to be able to hear well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For the Price","review":"I purchased this unit for sitting around, and a Koss behind-the-ear unit to wear with a cap, for about the same price. The latter unit is fine, but this KTXPRO1 unit is far superior, with better full-spectrum sound and more comfortable fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed !!!!","review":"After using KOSS products for years I am disappointed. First the headband was too big, so it did not fit on my ear right. If that was not bad enough, then there is the sound. The lows and highs are good but the midrange is weak. The vocals sound like they are in the background and are almost muffled at times. The cheap KOSS clip-on's sound better. This headphone just makes KOSS look and sound bad. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not fit well","review":"These headphoes are light, but you need to press them against your ears to fully hear the sound. There is no good position that I could find that these headphones would sit on my head comfortably. They keep slipping. On the top of that, after half an hour or so I start feeling pressure and slowly getting a headache.Maybe if you have a smaller head they might work for you, but not for me (I do have a larger than average head). I will be looking for a new pair as these are much worse than I expected, even for this price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"These lasted a whole two months.

I have several pair so I am not a novice. These have a mind of their own and when they decide they don't want to be on my head anymore they simply slip off.I have adjusted them in every way possible but eventually they end up on my nose or at the back of my head. Also, I have to keep the volume up at maximum to really hear and even then I want for more. The sound is muddy at best and I don't know how to describe the bass but it ain't right.

I immediately knew they were koss, but they were on sale for $20.00.I always thought they sounded excellent for the price, similar but not as good to my Grado $99 headphones which are extraordinary for the price.

I listen to all types of music from classical opera to the old blues masters. Others have already commented on the accuracy of their bass reproduction, and throughout the audio range. I will agree and also comment on the transparency and clarity of their sound. The last thing that impressed me this much was a pair of the old AR-3ax speakers of the sixties when I first listened to them. The accuracy of their sound reproduction and clarity is amazing, and is most likely due to their use of titanium coating on the diaphrams...but whatever,it works. These are one of the great buys in the Audio World right now for the money. Just ask any manager of a Radio Shack store (which carries these)...most of them have at least two pairs of these for their personal use at home. One of them was who convinced me to try a pair....Thanx!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked ok for 6 weeks then wires broke near volume control","review":"These headphones worked and sounded good for about 6 weeks.

I have to say the reviews are pretty much spot-on. These phones do sound excellent for the price, and they don't hurt or overheat my ears.The headband adjustment hasn't been a major problem, but the way it's designed, the size adjustment doesn't lock into place very securely.I agree the overall look of the headset is cheesy and dated, especially with the rubber flap thing.I also have a pair of Sennheiser PX 100 headphones. The sound is very similar between the two, but the bass is a bit richer/deeper on the PX 100. The styling and headband design on the PX 100 blows away the KTX design, but you'll pay for that difference.Bottom line: If you want an inexpensive pair of phones that sound great, the KTXPRO1 will do the job quite well. What you'll lose in the bargain is styling and a well designed headband."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phones","review":"Couldn't be any happier with these headphones.

The cool thing that I liked about them was the volume control on the cable. However, it was entirely uncool when the volume control shorted out. We didn't mistreat these things. We use them while walking on a treadmill and there's never any stress put on the cable. Through typical use of the volume control it has proven that it wasn't well-made.

I was quite impressed with the sound initially but in less than 2 months, the left ear started to produce conspicuous distortion at low frequencies. Then, there was the jack itself. The jack is not a sturdy L jack as shown in the picture but it is straight. The jack failed a few days back and I have to keep adjusting them every time I move even a little. As for comfort, my ears are still hurting! But maybe it's just for me and not for everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Large","review":"The sound quality was wonderful after too many pairs of cheap headphones, but that didn't mean much since they wouldn't stay on my head.

I still have the Sony ones for when the pair of these stop working until I can wait to buy another pair of these. They have excellent volume but it seems I have to buy a new pair once every 2 or 3 months.This can be annoying but the sound is so great that its worth it to keep buying new pairs.

Wearing is very comfortable, although it is a little bulky (not heavy).The sound quality is very good for anything twice its price range. But when I compare it with Sennheiser PX-200, I found that it is not as detailed on the top end as PX-200. The bass is very strong, but slightly boomy. For certain types of music, I may even prefer this headphone over PX-200 because of the good bass.It is more efficient than PX-200. The acoustic output is stronger for the same electric input.It really deserves more 4 stars considering its price. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound -- strange fit","review":"I purchased these headphones and was a bit confused by the blue rubbery plastic thing that goes across the top. At first I thought it was something added just for shipping, but I couldn't easily remove it so thought twice about continuing to yank on it. So I came back to this product description to find out what it was. Turns out it is an \\"adjustable headband with a sling for a comfortable and secure fit.\\" So the sound is fantastic, I love the volume control, but being a grown woman I'm surprised that the headband (even with the \\"sling\\") is too loose. Even with the strange blue rubbery sling that pulls slightly on my hair, I can't get the headband to feel tight and secure since the headband part feels lose when I'm exercising. Such a huge improvement though over earbuds -- those things hurt my ears!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money just horrible.","review":"Well where do I start they don't fit well I am constantly adjusting them to keep them on my head, since KOSS has a lifetime warranty I had to replace them twice that is three headphones within a year.

To me, the sound quality is exceptional, offering decent mids and highs with bass that is second to none. The sound quality combined with the price is what keeps me with these headphones, as those are the two main things I care about.To me there are also two negatives. The first is the comfort. After a couple hours of listening, the foam pads on the speakers start to seem very thin... An also my ears are larger, and they contact some of the un-padded area of the headphones which can cause some discomfort over time. I usually just take a 5-10 minute break and then I'm fine.The second negative is the reliability. They usually develop a rattling in the speaker after about a year or so. But no set of headphones lasts forever, and even buying these headphones over and over has proven more economical to me than many other options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koss Headphones","review":"I really like these headphones for what i payed for them they're operating very nicely.

They have held up well and the in-line volume control is a handy feature to have. They are comfortable to wear and produce good sound, plus they are light and airy over the ears, which is why I like to use them when I exercise. I really don't think you can beat them for the price.

The sound is excellent, with more bass (but not too much) than Sony's. I use the volume control a lot more than I thought I would, & now I can't imagine headphones w/o one. The only slight negative is that I possess very little hair on top of my head, & the piece that helps hold the 'phones on doesn't grip well enough when I look down: opps! Headphones in my lap!

They are the only headphones I can wear without having to constantly \\"refit\\" on my head everytime I move around. (I use the broken pair in the rain; and, still, they continue to give me great sound!)UPDATE 2/26/2012I am ordering a third pair -- not because the second ones broke but because my daughter recently claimed mine.

Too quickly that delight turned to sheer dismay. The book is clumsy. Its scenes drag and plod. The authors are to be commended for their excellent taste in literature, and excoriated for their pale counterfeit. I will not attack its premise or its facts. If it had at least entertained, its shortcomings would be easily overlooked. Unfortunately, it does not entertain, or even mildly amuse. In 45 years I have never taken a book back to a bookstore to demand a refund, no matter how disappointed I was in the book. I am sorry to say that Desire and Duty became the first. A reader's time is better spent on Aiken or Tennant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drudgery and Dreariness","review":"The authors certainly seem to have done their homework on the time period - the endnotes are extensive. (But who expected endnotes in a novel, anyway?) Unfortunately, the endnotes are the only interesting part of the book. While the story may have been good (I don't know; I didn't get that far.), the writing was awful. The characters were unbelievable and did not resemble Austen's characters of the same names. The dialogue was stilted and fake. Descriptions were forced. All in all, I found this very amateurish. I could not \\"get lost\\" in the story or \\"feel\\" the characters because the poor writing continually drew my attention. After several chapters, it was simply too painful to continue reading and I returned the book to the library. I do not believe I have ever read such a poorly-written story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best...","review":"Some novels try to mimic the same writing style as Austen, and some novels try to remain true to her plot or characters. This book does neither. The writing is \\"hokey\\" - I'm sorry I can't come up with a better word for it! While the authors go to great length to explain how they were true to the language of Jane Austen, they miss the mark entirely. Then you have the characters - while the names and places were the same (Mr. Darcy, Lizzy, Pemberley, etc.) there was very little likeness in how they were portrayed, not to mention a see-through plot. If you go into this book with the expectation that it is a stand alone historical romance, then you might not be let down by the final result, but if you are looking for a good follow-up to Janes Austen then don't bother, there are much better books out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austin this isn't!!","review":"I've read several Pride & Prejudice sequels in recent weeks, this is by far the worst.While the Bader's did an admirable job of keeping with the historical acurateness of the novel, they didn't really seem to understand the characters or what made them appealing in the first place.We have Lady Catherine who in the interest of Family Felicity forgives Mr. Darcy for marrying beneath him. Lady Catherine is a vindictive witch who would never have given up her haughty prideful behaviour and sure wouldn't have accepted Elizabeth who was said to pollute Pemberly.We have Mr. Darcy becoming warm and open with everyone. Showing his affection in public. And Elizabeth, she seems to have become a 'dutiful' wife, not the Willful lady we all adore."},{"rating":"1","title":"nicely crafted and well researched","review":"The authors have clearly delivered a thoughtfully crafted tale, consistent with the history and customs and class and sexual politics of the times. However, it lacks shine and wit for my taste. I miss the delightful and droll humor of Jane Austen, often causing me to laugh out loud after 2-3 pages of dialogue building to an understated punch. For those who love the P&P characters, they are here; as are their times. For those who love Jane Austen's writing gift, alas, it is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I love the works of Jane Austen and have looked for sequels that show me more of the world of her characters. There are some very fine ones, including Anne Telscombe's Sanditon and the works of Julia Barrett, but this is not one of them. The book almost seems to be written for children in its extreme simplicity and moralizing. The authors are not true to Austen's characterization, either - Mr. Darcy is frank and open about skeletons in the family closet, and Georgiana is obsessed with religion. I also found the Historical Notes distracting and unnecessary; they seemed to be included only to show how \\"knowledgeable\\" the authors were about the period and did not have much at all to do with the text. I find it interesting that these authors have reviewed their own book (very positively) on this website and others. There would be no need for such stuffing of the ballot-box if the book stood well on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you want to know how bad it is,","review":"give this book a miss.

I should have known better & relied on my imagination to go to work on what might have happened to Elizabeth, Darcy & the other characters. This book is heavy-handed, lacks any of the humour or wit of P&P, and at times is downright irritating. Some of the dialogue actually made me wince, and I did not recognise any aspect of Jane Austen's original characterisations in this book. I have read Austen's original more times than I care to remember without ever tiring of it - this book is a lazy, unintelligent and patronizing attempt at imitating her work. However, I am grateful for one thing - I now know better than to waste my time & money on any other 'sequel' to Austen's originals by ANY author. p.s. the one star awarded is for the authors spelling their names correctly (miaow...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Pride and Predjudice - Skip this book","review":"I was very excited when I was given this book as a gift.

The authors did not do a good job at all in duplicating Jane Austen's style of writing. Some of the dialouge was almost laughable. They made Mr. Darcy very preachy on the evils of strong drink.

Practically any author in the Republic of Pemberley (including 12 years old girls) writes better, with more style and more understanding of the epoch. More childish example of Austen's sequel I never read! My recommendation for the authors - to read some romances. Even the most sentimental and historically inaccurate novel is better than their work. My recommendation to the Austen's lovers - never, never buy this book!

There were way too many undeveloped characters. Both the newly introduced characters and the characters from Pride and Prejudice have no personality whatsoever.

The sentences are extremely awkward, including Mr. Darcy telling Lizzy, \\"I was fearful of losing the light of my life...\\" and Lizzy telling Mr. Darcy, \\"...you are my tower of strength.\\" Way too sappy, and and there was no purpose to include all this sickening nostalgia. i almost didn't finish it, this book was simply terrible. don't read it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is the sencond sequel I have read and I was disappointed.

The language that was used was not reminiscent of the time period and I think some of the conversations in this book were very cheesy. (Like Elizabeth telling Mr. Darcy when she was ill \\"...make sure you visit me often for you are my pillar of strength...\\" I laughed at that line) The plot was slow moving and the events were pointles.

The authors undertook the complex task of creating a believable sequel to Austen's book and did an admirable job, in my estimation. I don't claim to be a self appointed 'expert'in Austen's work; I am, in fact, an average book lover who enjoys a good read. I especially enjoy the efforts of authors who work hard to ensure the authenticity of a work set in times past. It is easy to weave a story by plowing new ground; quite another to attempt to remain true to an admired writer who's works have been examined for generations. I say bravo to the authors and I await the movie possibilities with hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmoric Dribble","review":"While I will read anything that is even remotely related to Jane Austen, or her story lines, I had to force myself to finish this questionable piece of literature.

Quite honestly, I can't get enough of Jane Austen's work. I've read all her books multiple times. Unfortunately, the quality of Austen's books made this book all the more reprehensible. This was truly the worst book I have ever read. I can't think of words strong enough to discourage a Jane Austen fan from wasting their time and money on this book.

I kept in mind, though, that any sequel to a novel, not written by the same author, is bound to disappoint.

The book is not for everyone, but any fan of Pride and Prejudice should give it a chance to decide for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Attempt","review":"It was not possible an any time to see the characters in this book as having anything to do with Jane Austens'. Ms Austen wrote from her knowledge of life as the daughter of a clergy man, but never did she spend pages preaching to her reader. This writing team actually had their heroine worrying that another character was not suffiently christian for her. At times it was so distracting that it was necessary to skip over paragraphs of text waiting for the story to resume. Perhaps if the writers were not so involved with trying to impress readers with the scope of their historical information they would have been able to edit their book and create something vaguely readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is my favorite book.

Even if it were not following the masterful Pride & Prejudice I still would consider it poorly written. The plot is ill-formed, the characters are shallow (difficult to do when they've already been created in a previous book), and the grammar is atrocious. Not only were the characters shallow, but they have been changed to the extent that I find it hard to believe the authors ever read Pride & Prejudice! Lizzy has become biddable, Darcy doesn't seem to have respect for her, and Mary is popular and outgoing. It was a painful ordeal to force myself to read it through to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank Ghod I didn't buy for this turkey!","review":"Hooray for the library - I can give this one back and never see it again. Terrible, stilted writing, laughable dialogue, a dull and predictable plot, AND heavy-handed religious moralizing that would never have passed Jane Austen's pen. I felt throughout that the authors were trying to put across their own religious agenda. The characters were not true to P&P and the book had absolutely none of Austen's wit and sparkle. I finished it, but I will never touch a book by these authors again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly horrible book!","review":"This book is so bad as to be laughable. It is poorly written, with stilted dialogue and unbelievable characters. The authors also offer such tedious sermons that it makes the reader wish for Mr. Collins to step in and read a selection from \\"Fordyce's Sermons\\" for true comic relief. It is unimaginable that this book not only got published, but that the movie rights have been sold!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment...","review":"Please save your money - this book is dreadful. I have read many of Jane Austen sequels, yet this one is by far the worst. There is simply no plot nor character development. In fact, the book is so decidedly uncomplicated, I wondered if it were written for children - I rejected this explanation, for most children's books are better. What surprises me most, is that anyone found this book worthwhile. Several of the reviews on this page were positive, and the preface to the book includes an endorsement by a college professor.

That book comes with a desperate amount of typos, which are forgiveable only because the story is so compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever published...","review":"I would have given this negative stars but it wasnt an option. I haven't even read this book because the first 10 pages were enough to tell me that the author of this insipid piece of trash should be jailed for assault on the senses of the public. If Ms. Austen were alive she'd be suing for damages. The language is third grade elementary at best and the idea that Elizabeth Bennett (possibly the greatest heroine ever written)would ever whine about anything, let alone Darcy wanting to work instead of eat breakfast with her, is INSANE and a reaction only her sister Lydia would have!

If we don't have the proper tools to maintain a relationship how can we all survive on the larger global issues? Maria gives very practicle easy to use Principles with Do's and Don'ts for a healthy relationship. Her case histories make it easy for most people to identify with their own experiences.

The focus of this book as compared to other development books (i.e. Todaro) is that it emphasizes the importance of economic growth rather than equity issues. I find this approach refreshing. Van den Berg uses historical and current case studies to bring the theory out of the book and into the real world. Overall, Economic Growth and Development is an informative and stimulating read for professors, students, and anyone else who is interested in understanding why some countries are developed while others are still developing.

It's extremely reminiscent of works by KMFDM, Pig, Sow, Schaft and Slick Idiot but with an occasional Eastern twist on the vocals.

A lot of the beats sound Sascha-like and the guitars sound a lot like Watts, so I don't see how its not that reminescent. Some of it sounds different, but different is good.

Most of the album has no direction in the songs. They start nowhere and go nowhere. Just a random beat or really cool synth line will appear and then fade into trash. No songs convey any energy and the vocal content (at least whats in english and some of the german) is quite minimal. Sascha K. said himself that he thought Shwein was a \\"sub-par\\" effort and thats a member of the group saying that. I dont know, maybe too much of the Buck Tick bleeds through (but i have to admit the japanese vocals sound pretty neat) or maybe it was just a lack of funding or time, but schwinstein presents alot of potential for the \\"supergroup\\", but they just dont deliver it on this album"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"[....]Knowing that Sascha, Raymond, and two Buck Tick members were in on this, you'd think it would be the best album ever made, right? WRONG. Throughout the whole album, I cannot detect a shred of Sascha in it at all. As far as I'm concerned, he might as well have not been included. Lucia also does some vocals on this cd, but they're totally not as impressive as her stuff with MDFMK. This album is a giant let down for me. It has next to no replay value and pretty much contains two songs worth listening to. My advice is to listen to this album before dumping 30+ dollars on it. It might not be what you think it is. It just seems like they threw this album together in one day or something. It doesn't seem focused...pretty aimless. I just want some new KMFDM and Pig already! YEAH!

Like other reviewers have said, it reads like a college essay. Also... He's all. over. the. place. And he quotes so many people it speaks of a rookie writer relying on and appealing to authority, detracting away from his own perspective.

I just wish he hadn't done so in such a needlessly wordy and meandering fashion. This book could easily have been limited to the length of an essay and conveyed the same ideas. My biggest gripe, however, is the painful, self-consciously hip way in which the book is written. The author seems to really want to be perceived as extremely cool, and this annoying tendency adds a lot of unnecessary fluff to the book.

I say \\"had\\" because after the digital transition, there's no TV reception. A total waste of money on my part. Don't waste yours. No wonder they've lowered the price to almost half. Sony should have at least posted a warning that it wouldn't work after the transition. I no electronics wiz and I don't appreciate being ripped off because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"We've had 2 of these!","review":"My brother knows a lot about electronics, and bought this for us as a Christmas gift. It was wonderful! We especially liked the TV band, so we could listen to the local news while in the shower in the morning. Unfortunately, it died after about a year in the shower. That's the only reason I don't give it 5 stars. We went out and bought another shower radio with CD Player (a feature we never use), but the reception is poor and the speakers aren't great. So we're ordering another one of these radios. This time, we'll hang it at the BACK of the shower, to minimize the water damage. Hopefully that will help it last longer, because it really is a great radio. And, in our experience, once you get used to having a radio in the bathroom, it's hard to do without one. We're also buying one for a \\"White Elephant\\" Christmas gift exchange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"The shower radio has been great so far. I read reviews prior to purchasing, so I knew what to expect. The product shipped promptly and was received in just a few days. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a month","review":"What is with Sony products lately? I had this for a little over a month and it just stopped working. Fresh batteries made no difference. For $50, I would expect better. Quality seems to be a major problem with Sony lately and I'm going to avoid ALL their products from now on. It's a shame, as they used to be high quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio Doesn't Hold Up To Long Term Use","review":"The radio seems good at first but they don't hold up to long-term use in the shower. I've had two of these which have died after several months of use, and am trying a different brand instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is great","review":"I'm so happy that I got this radio - the sound is great. I had a radio from Bath, Bed, and Beyond that the cd stopped working after a year, and then the radio went after about 2 years of working. The sound was never as good as the Sony radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT water resistant, didn't last very long.","review":"At first I had it hanging under the shower head where it would occasionally get a splash. On the 3rd or 4th shower water got into it and it quit working. I put it in the bedroom for a couple of weeks to dry out and it worked again. Then I put it on the window sill in the shower where it would rarely get water on it but it didn't last long there either. I let it dry out again and put it on a self over the sink in the bathroom where it would never get wet but apparently the steam condensed inside it because there was water in it again (I could see tiny little drops on the inside of the display). After that I threw it a way. Needless to say I was very disappointed in a Shower Radio I couldn't even keep in the bathroom let a lone the shower itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fine unit--loud and clear","review":"I switched from a cheapo shower radio I got at Bed Bath & Beyond to this one. Boy what a difference. Much clearer, much louder.Remember, you have to hear a shower radio over the shower and the bathroom fan, so it does need to be loud, especially if you listen mostly to NPR like me. I had to turn my old one all the way up, and I still couldn't hear interviews well.One thing: the reason for the long battery life folks like here is because it takes C batteries. I used the AA rechargeables I was using in my old radio, and it works fine, fully as advertised. The battery life is satisfactory--not impressive, but OK for my purposes. But when they die, they don't fade or give warning, they just die.It is more expensive than I really wanted to pay for this purpose, but I did get value for money. It's a fine unit, and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shower Radio","review":"I really like the Sony shower radio. I have owned a few other brands that did not work nearly as well. The digital tuning is awesome. The sound has been great and overall I have been very pleased. I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value. Radio works great!","review":"This tv stations come in clear and the radio works great in the shower. Definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality for the price","review":"Though a little pricier than most other shower radios, this one is worth it. Excellent design features that one would expect from Sony: all buttons are the membrane type, so no worry about water seeping into the unit; all digital tuning, it locks in the stations beautifully, even the TV and weather band. Will go for months without need of fresh batteries. (I play mine about 1/2 hour daily). The only minor disappointment is tone quality. Frequency response could be little wider on both the low and high ends. But hey, how high of performance can you expect for any waterproof speaker?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reception but there's a problem with the buttons","review":"I've had this radio for about 6 years, my parents and boyfriend also have the same radio. We all keep it right in our showers. Like many of the other people who have written reviews, my parents' and boyfriend's buttons have cracked and peeled away, but I have not had this problem. My shower is a bathtub/shower combo so it's pretty long and I keep it toward the back of the shower away from the spray, while they both have shower stalls so the radio is much closer to the spray; I think this is why they've had the problems and I haven't. Other than the button problem, this radio is great. Always gets great reception, easy to tune and the timer is wonderful. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great radio","review":"We use this in our bathroom and it's the perfect size. Our bathroom is small, so having a compact radio works well. It's easy to use, the sound is decent and the reception is pretty good. I even got one for my father as a present and he loves it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must if you like news radio in the morning","review":"I've always listened to news radio in the mornings and I like to take long showers. This is absolutely the way to go if you want to listen to radio in the shower. I've had it for over 2 years now and it has been through just 5 batteries. It comes with a bundled antennae which you can stick to the shower's wall and reception is amazing. Buttons are easy to operate and it can even tune into local TV stations so you get the audio. Sometimes I do have to crank up the volume to hear over the shower noise, but I never go more than half way up. This shower radio is excellent, get it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome shower radio.","review":"It works and it is one of the only shower radios out there these days. The stations come in quite well and we keep ours IN the shower with us. Its easy to use. I'd recommend it to anyone for a great shower radio. It was a wonderful wedding present - one of our favorites for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Radio","review":"We bought this years ago, and it works just fine! You can raise the volume high enough to hear the radio outside of the shower. The 'off' button, has began to wear away, but that's ok since everything still works, and does so efficiently. It's such a durable radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall pleased... this time","review":"This is our second Sony shower radio. The first succumbed to steam in the bathroom after only a few months of use. It sat on the sink several feet from the shower.Honestly, I would not have purchased a second one but my wife really wanted another for Christmas; it seems to be the best shower radio in this price range.This time, however, I've used a large Zip-Lock style bag to cover it, sealed about 95 percent, with only a slight opening for the suction-cup antennae to poke through. It sits in a shower organizer mounted behind the shower head and gets splashed on frequently. Thankfully, the controls are still quite easy to view and use through the bag. With this much protection, I'm expecting it to last much longer. If it doesn't I will definitely update this post."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shower Radio","review":"This product is exactly what I wanted.

It's a great buy! Looks good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shower Radio","review":"The only reason this doesn't get a 5 is because it isn't very loud. I honestly didn't expect it to be, especially with a single speaker.Everything else works as advertised. I can get TV/AM/FM/Weather stations well. The old Curtis shower radio I had was very spotty. Digital tuning is awesome. The old one was analog and a real pain to lock on to stations that had a great signal. The presets work wonderfully, and the timer feature was an added bonus.Only time will tell if it lasts though. The Curtis died after a year and a half. If the Sony lasts that long I will be more than happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shower Radio to Tune Into","review":"Nov 2011Wow, it's been over five years since I purchased this radio, and it's working great and on it's original batteries! Well worth the investment. LOVE it!Nov 2006My cheap shower radio finally failed and I was in need of a replacement. I took the chance to significantly upgrade on this radio and it has been worth every penny! I love the reception, the sound quality, and convenience of use. The pre-set buttons are wonderful so I can easily switch between channels.

You can imagine my surprise and disappointment when the radio wouldn't catch the station my husband likes to listen to. The reception is horrible!

Would have been perfect, if it only WORKED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor material design - Limited life","review":"The buttons have worn through in 6 months on BOTH my radios.

Poor TV reception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Singing In The Shower","review":"With buttons offering instant access to the listener's choice of preset stations, and good reception, this shower radio has been a big hit in my house. The digital clock is also a nice feature, but is a bit hard to read by night-light if you're checking the time during a late-night bio-break. This is a fine product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony Shower Radio","review":"Got this for my daughter well over a year ago. Solid construction and it lives in the bathroom.

While setting up the new radio I was reminded of the unecessary complexity of tuning the stations. This is a major drawback to the use of this radio. If another such radio were available on the market for a reasonable price this Sony model would be outclassed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I keep coming back to this one","review":"I owned this before for several years. It finally gave up after water got into it through a small rip in the top, but it gave us alot of good use. This new one has the weather band button, which we also like.

Just bought another for my son because he kept taking mine and wasn't putting it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Form and function","review":"As with all Sony products it is a cool design and works great. Easy to use, gets great reception. It gets FM, AM, Weather and TV - although it comes with a warning that the TV band won't work once television stations switch to digital next year - but how many people listen to television stations on a radio? It comes with a small suction cup that I guess is supposed to be used to hang it in the shower, although I don't think I would trust it to hold. Pre-programing your favorite stations, auto-shut off, and alarm functions. Great size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the TV band","review":"We own 3 of these. The first one was purchased for me, one of my boys claimed it. The other asked for one for Christmas and then I bought the last for myself. They are great. I have had one for over 2 years with no problems. I especially like the TV band so I can listen to the news in the morning while applying make-up or getting dressed or ironing... This floats between my walk-in closet (where I iron), beside my jacuzzi tub and next to my vanity/sink...easy to move, easy to use... My kids leave theirs in the shower full-time...This is a great gift for the person who has everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't waste your money on the cheesy brands","review":"This radio is great. There are a couple of features I really enjoy; first are the preset buttons. No more spending 10 minutes trying to tune in low-signal NPR on a tiny dial using wet hands. Second is the auto shutoff timer feature. I've gone through many-a-battery by accidently leaving previous shower radios on all day. This radio is excellent; it sounds great and the features are well thought out without being confusing or overdone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I expected a radio that was made for a shower.

Obviously it is waterproof, and the reception is better than my medium-high end stereo tuner on some distant stations. The 6 pushbuttons are a much better way to go that twisting a knob. This is my second one. Unfortunately something in the volume control went highwire (it became constantly super loud) and changing the batteries was not the answer. I still give it 4 stars because it is a great performer otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka!

The only negative I have is the antenna. It doesn't provide very good reception. I can't get one of my local tv stations to come in, nor can I get my favorite radio station that's broadcast from 30 or so miles away (I can get it from any other radio). But most everything else comes in clearly. They could put a more powerful antenna on this radio and it would be perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"On our second one","review":"Seems like the nicest shower radio out there, and has a lot of nice features, but is not very water proof. First one quit working, and when I opened the battery compartment, it was completely rusted. It was hung on a towel rack at the far end of the shower, and didn't have a whole lot of direct water sprayed at it. I tried to clean it out, but I think too much water had gotten in and fried the unit. We ended up throwing it out. We liked the radio so much we thought we'd give it another chance and purchased another one. The second one started to have the same problem. I cleaned up the battery compartment and let if air out for a few days and it started working again. We now only use it on the bathroom counter. I still think it's a nice radio, but not really worth it if it can't be used in the shower. I think if the battery compartment cover had a better rubber gasket, and was able to be tightened down, then it would be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the Big O collector","review":"This one is a single as opposed to a full album, but it is worth getting if you can. In addition to the karaoke versions of the Big O opening and closing themes (\\"Big O\\" and \\"And Forever\\"), there are also the unedited versions of the songs, the \\"Big O Showtime!\\" variant that played only once in the entire series (during a fight scene, of course) and then there's Respect. What's not to love?Definitely a must for dedicated fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"There IS something that seems strange about someone playing stone sculptures in a German Cathedral - it seems like it should be avant-guard noise. But it is profoundly calming. The stones are stroked and resonate reverberations or are struck and produce muted tones. It took me a moment to realize that the humming on the first track was stone and not some synthesizer. While a sophomoric observation, the liner notes show slow time photos of the stones being played, and, not surprisingly, they are in sharp time focus with the player slow time blurred, suggesting, of course, the permanence of stone and the fleeting temporal qualities of our lives. The stones are accompanied by other instruments that people familiar with Micus know; the reeds and flutes that float the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play Ball!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book from an adult's perspective.

Not all are strange, but those that aren't are at least out of the ordinary. Most will not give you nightmares or make the reader uneasy. Well, except . . .\\"Waiting for Gandalf\\" may be a bit predictable, but maybe that's the problem. In \\"Fish\\" it seems like the newly married couple are getting what they deserve. The characters in \\"The Little Mermaid\\" are more than bizarre, but it's easy to be sympathetic to some. The most positive story is \\"Faith and Hope Go Shopping,\\" whose elderly characters are delightful.This collection is a quick read and very different from the usual run of short stories. Harris has a talent for making the bizarre seem almost ordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful for collectors, and for time-travelers, too","review":"If you are out to collect gas-station artifacts this book will be useful in that it shows photos of a myriad of pumps, pump globes, petroleum product containers, and signage, along with price ranges. However, the display of 137 historic gas-station photos suffers from rather muddy reproduction on matte-surface paper that prevents showing the detail to be found in the original glossy prints. (On slick magazine paper, I've seen many of these same photos come to life. Why any photo book is printed on anything but slick paper is beyond me.)

But all my hopes sank without a trace when the huge battles began. It's a shame because the basis of the plot, a robot STC, is such a good idea.

I urge anyone who wants to read good sci fi to stay well clear of this book. The plot is unreqalistic (to say the least) as we see smaller numbers win out in every battle. Why? They are the good guys, of course. Battles have been made gory just to be glamorous, the writing is immature and there is nothing to keep you hooked.Non-40K players should steer clear of this, it will have nothing for them.

He has a record deal which is selling extremely well and we should all stop hatin and be happy for the guy. He is definately laughing all the way to the bank. $25,000 plus royalties <- some of you are missing the little detail that royalties were made part of this deal. Even if this is the last successful CD he ever sells, he will definately not be forgotten. How can you forget this guy? You all know that if someone offered you a legit $25,000+ you would accept it too. And when his star does fade, he'll still make a better life than most as an engineer from UC Berkeley. Be happy for the guy and buy his CD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter garbage!","review":"I borrowed the CD from a friend and listened to it.

And never once were we laughing WITH you, William Hung, but at you. Was the fame worth it? Was the money worth it? This is like becoming famous through the Darwin Awards, or for being on Cops. Buying this album is just a silly thing to do. But go ahead and do it if you have millions of dollars and lots of time to waste. Go ahead, I don't care. In fact, I might buy it since I obviously have nothing to do, writing reviews on William Hung. God have mercy on my soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing...","review":"I was expecting the best out of Will, but I guess that I was wrong. I guess he sounds better live. Either that or we never should have made a big deal out of his audition. He does have some inspiring words of wisdom, but our parents and teachers already have that job. He ruined Hotel California, one of my favorite songs. Now to the positives. He does have his famous She Bangs song and most of it is pretty funny and you may get a few laughs out of it, yet it all seems pretty old by now. His best songs are She Bangs, I Believe I Can Fly, Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Rocket Man, and Shake Your Bon Bon. All the other songs are very disappointing. 2.2/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell was the Recording Industry thinking?","review":"First, the recording industry starts suing people for downloading music, then they start releasing crap like this, who the hell wants to spend their money on CDs if you cant even listen to it without getting a headache...dont bother buying it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Classic","review":"Forget what you've heard about the White Stripes, or Outkast, or any of the other vaunted 'saviors of popular music' - William Hung has the pipes and the attitude to rise to the ranks of the Next Big Thing.

Look, this guy has no talent! Everybody knows that, so why do we praise him for being funny? Nobody should get popular in music if they suck! This guy totally butchers the song \\"Rocket Man\\" which is a classic Elton John Song. This guy has no right to do that. I have no respect for him. Who does he think he is?

It's amazing how simular their stories really are. An ugly duckling, lifted up to the lime light only to be degraded and humiliated for the amusement of the majority. This album is nothing more than a cruel joke. The sad thing is that Hung is completely oblivious to it. I think that Hung is the first of a long line to be victims of the \\"American Idol\\" craze. Perhaps they should just come right out and announce a \\"Whipping boy\\" category to their show. The winner gets to be the oblivious laughing stalk of America. As for the music. All one has to do is listen to \\"She Bangs\\". That can easily sum up what to expect from Mr.Hung. I have listened to the whole album and I felt nothing but heart felt pitty for him. to put it simply, Just ignore this album.

I never purchased the CD, but just listening to the 30 second samples of the clips on iTunes, I thought I could say something about this horrendous album. One, he's got the worse vocals ever known. Two, he says he \\"sings from his heart\\"? WTF? Clearly when he's covering all the songs and don't have any musical talent, there's no way that he's really singing from his heart. And three, I think he's gotten fatter - there seems to be more fat on his big head, especially around his mouth. Clearly, this album is a joke, and he's a joke. We loved to laugh at him, but now it simply is annoying, and we want him out. And it's gonna be more of hell for us if he stays in the music business and keeps singing.

Maybe he's the next meteor..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the HELL?","review":"I don't see anything funny, laughable, comical, or inspirational about this album. They are just plain wrong to let this man record this album sounding like this, especially when there's so much real undiscovered talent out there. I think they know that he sounds horrible, but they are just making him look really stupid, and he's too stupid to know that he's being made fun of. If I had the choice between listening to this album, and getting a big blunt object and bashing my head in, I would find the biggest boulder I could, and smash away. We (the people) really don't deserve this torture. On top of that, they actually expect someone to buy this album (that's the funny part).

I mean, come on!And this whole record is just embarrasing. I felt like I was going to vomit after hearing his version of 'Hotel California.' And listening to him butcher Elton John's classic 'Rocket Man'? One of the worst versions of a song ever recorded.Do not buy this and encourage William Hung to put out yet another record containing more of this crap. He reminds me of an artist that's had his/her 15 minutes of fame, but wants to extend the time to 30 minutes.NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, through track 1","review":"But once you get beyond this guy's \\"one-hit-wonder\\", it starts to get really annoying. No, I didn't pay for this record - AOL had a free internet screening of the whole thing. I made it until about 3/4 of the way through the third song before his voice bacame unbearable. I doubt Apple would ever put this one on iTunes, but if they did, just download \\"She Bangs\\" and listen to it when you're drunk. The rest of the album, as far as I'm concerned, is just filler, to get an additional $9 or $10 out of people who think they have a sense of humor, or don't know they have too much money to burn. If you do buy it, good luck getting rid of it at the CD exchange. I doubt they'll even take it, knowing full well after Hong's 15 minutes are up, nobody is EVER gonna want to listen to him sing again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's William Hung's world, we just live in it.","review":"What happened to all of the reviews?

There are so many people out there who bleed with much more talent than Hung and never make it in the biz, whether it be music, sports, entertainment or anything that involves talent and skill, and many of them are honest just like Hung. I mean its great that he's getting his chance but come on now, a joke is a joke.Bottom line, I don't know how anyone could buy something like this, as I mentioned, maybe I'll make a cd and call it \\"No Talent Ass Clown\\" just to see how many people would buy it?

There are so many struggling talented artists who don't get recognition for years. And William Hung, who just sang one lousy song which was terrible (I have to admit it was funny) and get millions of dollars. I say that is plain unfair and the society have gone insane.

He represents a refreshing contrast to the corporate recording industry. He's incorrigible.

Real talent is no longer raw, it is manufacturered--one ends up buying Simon Cowell producer-inspired music. Love him, love corporate music. Then go ahead, and take a spoonful of it like a good consumer. That's a good citizen.I want something different NOW. And William takes the cake. Ride the wave, WIlliam. Scr*w your critics.

He should've written a book or something if he was trying to be sweet - forget the CD. Honestly, I can't see anybody sitting around listening to his CD. As an aspiring musician/singer/songwriter, it makes me shudder when I see stuff like this happening - here I am a true artist, I write my own songs, I play my own instruments, but a guy who can't carry a tune in a bucket - AND EVERONE KNOWS IT - is cracking the top 40 and I'm not even getting recognized.

But what makes William Hung different is that at least he makes you laugh.Yes, no need to say that this is indeed one of the worst albums ever recorded, but I can tell you for sure that there's been worse.Yet, for being such a hilarious record, I give this album 2 stars instead of 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap!","review":"this guy should bugger off! its rubbish! the industry has fallen to an all time low!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! he has milked his 15 mins of fame!!! this is disgusting! waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Next Sex Symbol","review":"This CD has got to be a joke right???This guy makes me laugh and if the CD is meant to be that way, then I'd have to rate it higher, but at the same time, there is only so much you can take by this guy.At least he sounds better than past American Idol \\"winners\\".How desperate are record companies going to get anyway????"},{"rating":"1","title":"As if the producer wanted him to fall on his face","review":"I've done a lot of studio engineering work with pretty awful amateur musicians, and you can make them sound pretty decent through filtering, pitch correction, and other signal processing.Clearly, none of that was done on this album.

I bought a little William Hung trucker hat and thought it was the coolest thing in the world, and I still do. But, come one, a CD? This guy got a record deal with that voice?

If people are really convinced that he's good, why didn't he make it on Idol? The judges rejected him for a reason, and that is because he is a disgrace to anything or anyone that has ever made a sound! It's shameful that he has made a CD when some other people from Idol that were fairly good (but weren't finalists) have not.

Slight mental retardation comes to mind when i think of him, and maybe he can use the money he makes off of the cd to fix those messed up teeth. I gave him 2 stars because he is so horrible, it makes me laugh. Everyone seems to think that Hung is some sort of logician, but there are people saying the same things he is everywhere.

However, I decided to give William Hung a chance and listen to the samples before passing judgment. Upon deciding to be open minded, I realize this cd is awesome. Why? it speaks volumes about courage, dreams are tangible, NO! is just a word, having a no limit life and so on. Yes, this cd is worth the money, because every time you hear William Hung, (clearly not a singer) its perceptible any, every and all things are possible. Also, while I was listing to the samples I found my self singing a long and feeling sooooooooo HAPPY. SOLD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"William Hung-DO NOT BUY","review":"William Hung's debut (and hopefully final) album is the worst CD I have ever boughten. It was funny for the first five minutes, but then I was sick of it. I thought it was the biggest waste of money anybody could waste. The two songs that were the worst were \\"She Bangs\\" and \\"The Circle of Life\\". Hung is no Elton John or Ricky Martin, he is just a guy with a horrible voice who should never have been allowed to put out a CD. Dont ever buy this CD, you'll regret it...believe me.."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD really deserves no stars!!!","review":"This cd is so gay. words can't even describe how bad it really is.

Because HE CANNOT SING. I do not plan on buying this cd because i refuse to contribute to the oddness of this American Idol season. Why would anyone encourage this junk as if it were real music?

He can't sing, he can't write good songs.(obviously, if almost every track is a cover...a horribly performed cover...) After watching these, I began to get angry. It's people like him that are going to bring our music industries down.

This guy's 15 minutes were up 15 minutes after he was booted off. There are literally thousands of talented people who would give their right arm for a records deal and this loser gets one for two reasons:1. He is a novelty, flavor of the month2. America has no taste and the attention span of the American public is all in their mouthIt just keeps getting worse and worse and worse. Every month it seems someone else is the next big thing. Today it is this jerk and tomorrow who knows who will be a hit.Whatever happened to real talent? It went out the window with America's inability to realize garbage and no talent when they see it. I can sing rings around this moron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jealous?","review":"William Hung is simply a student who managed to hit it off with what he really enjoys, music - he said so himself on American Idol - but can't sing himself.

A must-have, for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS THE RECORD BUSINEES COMING TO.","review":"Just listening to snippets of this I just have to ask WHAT ARE THESE RECORD COMPANIES THINKING? Why would a record company shell out money to record this?? Better yet why would people shell out money to buy this?? People People!! If you want to buy this for comic relief buy it used, say for one dollar. Do not give in to the record companies and buy it new. My hats off to William Hung for having the guts to record this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How unfair.....","review":"I only watch American Idol for the comedic factor and the the fact that The OC came on right after. Personally I think the people that audition just want their 5 min of fame on TV, but why the fuss over William Hung, I could think of better people to give an album deal too - the blonde Hillary Duff look alike that is in the finals for starters. At least she has a decent voice and can pronouce the words. Hung can't sing and for someone to give him an album deal is plain cruel. He is getting mocked at by people. He was getting a good education and I'm sure this will mess all that up. How can potential employers take him seriously when they see that he made a horrible album. There are plenty of bad albums out there we don't need one more, besides -- who will even buy the CD when they can just download it for free.....I feel sorry for Hung, it is just like in high school when the popular kids gang up on the nerds and \\"act\\" like they like them and just set them up for humiliation."},{"rating":"1","title":"You either love him or you hate him","review":"In iTunes, this CD is classified as \\"comedy,\\" so that should give you some idea of what you should expect. He can't sing. In fact, it's so awful that it's funny. You wouldn't listen to this cd for the music... you listen to it so you and your little friends can giggle at how funny it is to hear a dorky asian guy who can't sing. Most of the reviews here are either 5 stars or 1 star, so you either like laughing at william hung, or you don't. I personally know I'd be ashamed if the only reason I was making money was because people enjoyed laughing at how pathetic I was. This has clearly gone too far..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe people are actually paying to hear this....","review":"Is our country so tired of our entertainment that the media has to make it's own entertainment by taking a guy who resembles all the stereotypes of an Asian male and making him into a 'star'? There is no way William Hung would have been made into the 'star' he is right now if he didn't fit into all of these stereotypes, but still had the horrible voice and attitude he currently has. I can't believe a joke like this can be taken so far as to giving this guy his own 'Story of William Hung' show to air once, massive publicity, a $25,000 check for a record deal, and huge sales from this record which is nothing but crap. I haven't listened to the entire album and don't plan on it. I don't want to waste my time and make my ears bleed. I've listened to the sample clips, and that's all I need to hear. I have no clue why anyone would seriously pay money to hear this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"lack of musical talent aside...","review":"I think the record company is taking advantage of William.

I think he actually believes he is good. When he comes to that realization the psychological damage will be done.I have listened to the tracks from AOL and I can't believe anyone is spending money on this. I am going to lose it if this album sells enough to eclipse some of the true musicians on the Billboards top 50 of the top 200 albums.Also, I really don't want to hear this horrible mockery music over my local pop station.Please William finish school and leave your singing to performances at your local karoke bar.If this CD can sell albums why can't any drunk off the street sell them.This is a mockery of true musicians or talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disgrace to Asians","review":"I don't care if he went to Berkeley, he is making a fool out of himself to get money.

I can't stand this guy and juss so ya know, I am not jealous because he is famous. there are plenty of famous guys out there for me to be jealous. I just hope William STOP doing these stupid things and give faces to Asians"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a grip folks","review":"I can't believe that anyone would actually spend money on this CD.

I was hoping to buy a CD that was funny and bad singing, but after the first two songs, I was sick of it. Just find the songs online, but don't buy the album. It's funny for like 5 minutes, but after that it's just sickening. If there was one song that was the worst one he sang, it would be \\"Circle of Life\\" by Elton John.

I give Mr. Hung more credit than that.Buy this album if you want to keep listening to what the music industry wants you to listen to.Until another artist like Nirvana (Kurt Cobain) comes out and shoves all this produced garbage into the trash again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I got to give Mr. Hung credit; he exposed American Idol for the mockery it truly is. American Idol is not about the MUSIC only about the MONEY. Beautiful business plan AI. Have people vote for their favorite Karaoke singer and then sell a million records to the voters. What A&R rep can guarantee platinum records like this???This is an example of what is truly wrong with music today it is all about the $$$$ and less about the music. It does not matter if you got talent or no talent if the people want you, you get a record deal.For those who listen to music to express emotions you will find the apparent sincerity that Mr. hung supposedly has in any local Bar on any given night. Go out and support your local musicians and you will find the sincerity that supposedly won Mr. Hung his fans.Nothing against Mr. hung personally but this is part of the reason why record sales have dropped. People see past the coating and are seeking an alternative.."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this world coming to","review":"I mean sure Will Hung is more of a spoof on the music industry then an actual artist, but i still can't bear to listen to him!

When Morrisey and Paul Weller can't get played, or in some cases, even a record contract in America, and yet Mr. Hung is a \\"star\\", there is something seriously wrong. I watch a basketball game and see this young man singing, and yet I can't remember the last time I saw Radiohead on TV, but there's a difference. Mr. Hung is all hype, and in a couple of months when we're talking about Mr. Hung in the same breath as the infamous Gerardo and Right Said Fred, company he so richly deserves.

Gerard Manley Hopkins said, \\"Each mortal thing does one thing the same\\", an axiom which still rings throughout the lonesome gut of Bill Monroe's mandolin, suggesting each man and woman does similar things....Will Hung sings. As a Screaming Eagle my beak opens and closes when I talk, Will Hung does not have any beak advantages at all, none so ever, but still maintains the dignity and self-respect of a golfer spray-painted silver. Go ahead and shake your fists full of American Express and complain but you are as complacent as the martinis in your belly you stir with each gesture. Hung sings and devils dine. Caw-caw!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist","review":"This album is racist trash. Hung I'm sure is a nice guy but he is projecting the image of Asian men as fools.

Your real fans love ya Will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad album, great personality.","review":"Granted that the album is not good and you could hear better versions of these songs at your local club. I think that the one thing that makes this CD special and Will Hung as a whole special is his personality. Coming from a show where EVERYONE thinks that they were slighted or should have moved on, he was the only one in three seasons that took what was given with descency and respect. \\"I gave it my best and I have no regrets.\\", That's all one needs to know about the kid. The CD is not good, nor will he have another. But the attitude is what is driving the CD here, not the music. Our world could use people with attitudes such as this and not the attitude most people have these days. For the Attitude a 5 star for the music a 1 star. The \\"Insperational thoughts\\" made me give it a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE NEXT WING!","review":"If you have never heard of the singer Wing, you have to check her out. Hung and Wing are destined to become classics in the horrible singer category!I agree that Hung's ability to sing is lacking, and it is almost an slap in the music industry's face that he even was allowed to release this album; however, he has, and if you're looking for a laugh you've found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it's not \\"St. Anger\\"","review":"Wow. Unbelievable.I used to think that there would never be another album that could possibly come close to being as bad as Metallica's crummy latest release, \\"St. Anger.\\" I was wrong.However, unlike Metallica, I can honestly tell that William's heart is in it. He is trying his absolute hardest to do his best, while James and Lars, who are supposed to actually HAVE talent, seem intent on feeding their fans absolute CRAP. That's why this CD at least deserves an extra star, for effort.Ya know, if the whole pop music thing doesn't work out for Will, he can always join a rock band. Listening to the majority of new bands coming out lately, you really don't need to carry a decent tune to be famous. Just look what it did for Chino. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love him or hate him","review":"Either you're going to love this guy or hate him. For me, he's an inspiration.

There isn't any deep meaning to understand here. This cd is so bad, it brings tears to my eyes. And it isn't even funny, because despite the fact that he's so sincere and thinks he's doing well, the ONLY reason this cd is out is for people to make fun of him.Really, that's how low we've sunk as a society. We've gotten to the point where a record company will put up the time and money to sign a singer that people will point and laugh at. And Hung is so naieve that he doesn't get that this is the point of the cd; sure, sure, they sold him a line about being inspirational, but the whole point of this album is to make Hung a laughingstock.

It's like they know he is a big joke and the are capitalizing on it and getting rich. While he got $50,000, that really is not that much money. I guess he'll get royalties from this, I'm not sure. Also, didn't the writers of the songs he is murdering have to give their permission for them to be used? Why would they do that?
