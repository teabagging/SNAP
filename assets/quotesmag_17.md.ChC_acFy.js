Somewhat uncharacteristically, I allowed myself to be drawn by a book jacket's plot description into buying an unknown author. I was not disappointed. The Perfect Assassin was actually a great story. Larsen grabs the reader in the first few pages and propels him on a page-turning ride. Once you start this book, it will be difficult to put down. Like many of the recent spy-genre novels published by many authors of late, Larsen is focused on the Middle East. Unlike many that have an al-Qaeda connection, however, Larsen spins his tale around Israeli assassin David Slaton, the Mossad, and the State of Israel. If you have been wondering about whether to take a chance with a new author, pick up this book.

Many of the free and inexpensive Kindle offerings are new authors, with minimal editing, and plot holes big enough to drive through. This was pretty good.Some of the ideas strained at logic, time was condensed/expanded inconsistently, but the story moved well. It was tightly written with few superfluous detours. I liked that there were as many good, trustworthy people as there were bad, deceptive ones. It had a few unrealistic moments, but the protagonist was a little smarter and more capable than everyone else, and I always like that in my thrillers.I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Assassin","review":"I am not finished this book yet but I can say it is holding my attention, moving fast, and well written.

A trained Israeli assassin, he is what we all love in an action hero. The story is about some stolen armaments (I wont reveal details). A bit cliched and not really new. However, the book involves a great chase worthy of Frederick Forsyth. The author has good trade craft when it comes to 'somebody being on the run', 'spying' and action scenes.The book is much btter than what Daniel Silva writes. An I like Slaton better than Gabrial Allon. The scenes involving Christine get too cliched later on and could have been avoided.

But pretty soon it departs from the formula. Unfortunately, it's not in a good way. For a long part of the movie, they sit around telling stories that don't add anything to the plot. Some new characters are thrown in and strange things happen with no apparent logic and the end makes no sense.

Characters would appear and disappear for no reason; people told pointless ghost stories to pad the run time of the movie; somebody puked up weird insect things... I have been slowly trying to plow through my collection of 3,000 movies, and most of the time when they are this bad I've been turning them off. I just kept expecting more from this.

The company sent me a replacement bulb, it burned out today after 3 weeks. I have been over the proper use and location for the product with the company and am following it. However, the bulbs still last less than a month. The UV-C light does help with the mold and such in my apartment. I reccomend using UV-C light, Just NOT this brand.

Since putting this in our home, (knock on wood) no one in the family has had a cold and that is awesome, especially because of the holidays and all the stomach flu-like symptoms that were going around...we didn't get it!!!

I had read TeleVue's specs on the bag before purchasing. That said, it would be nice to be able to choose from say 2 or 3 configurations. My hard reality is that I would need 3 to 4 of these cases for all my eyepieces and then there would be eyepieces left over that did not fit the remaining cutouts.

Additionally, much of the book is a series of lists of symptoms or signs without much explanation. The author does provide many web site listings where you can get more (and much better) information though. I would not recommend this book at all as it would be a waste of money.A really good book on the same topic is \\"Why am I Still Depressed?\\" by Jim Phelps, M.D. Dr. Phelps provides much more explanation when he discusses topics. There are no \\"laundry lists\\" of symptoms. Additionally, Dr. Phelps provides a very good set of additional references at the end of his book.So, if you like checklists of symptoms, this book is for you.If you prefer real information, clear explanations, and good writing, \\"Why am I still Depressed?\\" by Jim Phelps is your better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to Agree--Unfortunate","review":"For those of us just diagnosed and searching for detailed information about \\"softer\\" forms of bipolar, this book is discouraging.

There are some \\"case histories,\\" but there are no studies to back up this guy's conclusions (he refers to \\"my experience\\" a lot). It's just not good enough.There are a lot of references to \\"helpful\\" web sites, but did we really need to spend extra money to figure out we can use the web?I found the information that IS there disorganized and unenlightening.

Modan spends far too much time on the linguistic side of anthropology; after finishing this book, I still had no idea what the day-to-day life was like in Mt. Pleasant.

These Gerber bags are far better than both.The reason I do not like these Lansinoh bags is that of the three brands that I purchased, these seem the thinest and flimsiest. The seams of the bags appear very thin and fragile, however, of the few bags that I have used so far none have leaked. Also, the ziploc on the bags is not great. I always try to eliminate as much air as possible when I seal a bag but the ziploc on these bags can be a tad bit challenging to line up and seal quickly.

What is the point of a milk storage bag, if it is going to leak from the bottom seam. It is not like the manufacturer warns you about this potential, but they probably should considering that reviews discussing bags leaking from the bottom seam go back several years.

I have found that they leak less often if frozen flat,rather than upright, but they still leak. The best way to prevent leaking is to open the bag to release the vaccuum seal, then thaw it tilting down towards the top of the bag, since the bottom of the bag is where it breaks. This morning I forgot to do that, and I lost an ounce and a half to the sink. That's a lot of milk! I nearly cried. I've been working hard at keeping up my milk supply since I started taking my son to daycare, and it's a shame to keep losing milk due to leaks.I am debating getting the milk freeze trays from freshbaby that lets you freeze them into little 1-ounce milk cubes, then you can put them in a ziploc freezer bag after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Bags","review":"We bought these because we liked the safety of the double-zipper.

However, when thawing these bags out I found that I was losing sometimes 4 and 5 bags of at a time due to leakage not from the double seal at the top, but from a seam at the bottom (and no I did not fill them over the 6 oz mark). I later tried some of the other bags out there and found that yes, these bags are better than their competitors, but they were not good enough for me. I have worked way too hard to provide my child with nourishment only to have it leak all over the place. My solution was to use bottles. They too have disadvantages (take up more room in the freezer), but I feel that they are a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"These suckers leak!","review":"I got an opened package of these from a friend who gave me some of her extra stuff. I rarely pump and even more rarely thaw out frozen breastmilk, so when one leaked I thought it was a fluke and possibly because the bags were old. I ordered some new ones online, and out of 6 that I have used so far two have leaked. That's in addition to the one that leaked earlier, so the \\"leakage rate\\" of these so far has been 1 out of 3. At least it forces me to thoroughly clean my fridge shelves!The only reason I gave two stars is that I do like the space on top to label it so that there's no chance of permanent marker leaching through to the milk.I even double-checked to make sure these are actually freezer bags, and it says they are freezer safe right on the package!

Its not time to stop pointing fingers, its time to start lopping off heads.We've been walking around with blinders on ignoring what can be plainly pointed out in this book. Buy it, read it, and then, throw it at someone you know who buys into the media's propaganda-filled views, and tell them to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Ammunition For the Intellectual Rearming of the Right","review":"The author's unique qualifications and experiences inside the belly of the leftist Clinton Administration allow him to backup theories with real life experiences. His description of trade with the NY Times - they get an interview and Clinton gets a free pass on pre presidential activities destroys the illusion of balance in the NY Times. Morris goes on to show how the Times role as the flagship of the American press affects the morning paper delivered to your doorstep in Podunk .Certainly this book played a major role in the recent management purge at the NYTMorris lays bare the rise of terrorism in the US in a way that will be spin resistant as Tom D and his media friends attempt to escape from responsibility. In the process he exposes the greatest flaw of the Clinton administration, the inability or unwillingness to lead and plan for the future.A great read. Provides the required ammunition to counter the spin of the left."},{"rating":"1","title":"OFF WITH ALL THEIR HEADS","review":"I read about 50 pages of this book and could take no more. Dick Morris should know deception when he sees it. How about a guy who solicits ladies of the evening while serving in government and writing this book? Fine man who is right where he belongs, on the FAUX NEWS CHANNEL in such fine company as William J. Bennett (Virtuous High Roller), Newt Gingrich (intern doer), Sean Hannity (propagada merchant), and Bill O'Reilly (pathological liar). Completely discredited. I say off with ALLtheir heads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dick Morris - Fair & Balanced","review":"Dick Morris' new book is about more than politics, but there is a political or legal answer to the issues he discusses. He criticizes many people, and many groups, but he has done it fairly. And he compliments the targets of his criticism, when appropriate, showing that he is fair and balanced. That balance is missing in many books on politics and current events. One must always look for bias, what the author says (and doesn't care to mention) to see if he is giving it to us straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"leave your party behind and just embrace this book","review":"This book is a great read. If your are truly interested in America's well being ahead of your party affiliation this book is for you. This book takes the U.S.'s ememies to task whether they are external or internal. If you love America I can only say one thing read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"He makes good points, but...","review":"He makes good points, but this book was very tough to read.Morris jumped on the liberal bashing band wagon with this book, pointing out all the usual hypocrits and immoral scum in hollywood, wall street, the senate and so on. Although he had some witty euphamisms and allusions, it was just very hard to read beacuse it was somewhat dry and carried on too long. He esily could of cut a 150-200 pages out of this book, and the French phrases really bothered me, they just didn't need to be included. So my synopsis is that this book probably needed a better editor, but the Morris is an ok guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as great as his appearances on Fox News","review":"I liked this book alot. Dick Morris is probably the best political commentator on Fox News - therefore the best on TV. His opinions and ideas are usually right on the mark.I did feel that he tended to hammer his points a little too much in this book. Do we really need 50 pages to convince us that the NY Times is pushing its liberal dogma to the masses? I don't think so.I would have liked to read more of his thoughts on what I feel is the biggest threat to the American political system - Hilary Clinton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clinton is responsible for terrorism?","review":"I stopped reading this Morris' illogical book when he accused Clinton of being responsible for terrorism.Was Morris really suggesting that terrorism didn't exist before the Clinton administration?After that stupidity, why would ANYBODY bother reading any further?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"The only thing Morris gets right with this book is the title. He spends so many pages attempting to justify all of the mistakes - economic & political mistakes - of the Bush Administration that he has wasted a fantastic time to do a service to the reading public. After having read this book, I immediately wanted my money back. This was a huge ripoff. He should have used the space to examine the economy and factors leading up to the current debacle created by the Bush Team and their long list of \\"pay backs\\" they've had to carry out. Over 90% of the book was his attempt at justifying the Bush Administration's policies; it was a lost cause. My advice DON'T BUY THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't deserve one star","review":"Everyone needs to make a living, even self-destructive nuts like Morris. Talented? Yes, but nutty as a fruitcake. What was he was doing in that hotel?Off with their heads? Start here with Dick Morris, who fits his title as few others can."},{"rating":"1","title":"insightful if not pompous","review":"This guy has something to prove - his exaggeration and claims of prescience are simply embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right wing nutball","review":"As usual the right wing blames everything on Bill Clinton, ignoring the obvious fact that clinton is a top 5 president of all time, this coming from a moderate republican, me. The far right gets so carried away, it ruins the cause for the realistic moderates. Mr. Morris is mad as hell because he does not understand too many basic principles of human nature and economics. What we should all be reading about is how to get the rules written to get President Clinton back in office to get this economy going like he did before!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dick Morris' game","review":"When Morris recently appeared on a talk show, the inteviewer went along with Morris' line of thought, and then continued by saying \\"So basically what you say depends on who is paying you\\".It took Morris about 10 seconds to realize what was going, indicating that in fact the interviewer had correctly identified Morris' game.So it is with the latest book by Dick Morris.Recall that his zipper problems got him fired from the Clinton team. Imagine that.Remember: The Right wing lies. They just want to take your money so they can buy drugs, gamble, or work with an employee from the oldest profession. Ignore them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Off With Their Heads - Traitors, Crooks & Obstructionists","review":"The title almost turned me off. I believe the title sells the book short. That is the only criticism I have.Because I have little regard for former President Clinton, and knowing that the author was his close advisor, I almost didn't read it. However, the author appears to treat everyone fairly and criticizes politicians on both sides of the isle. His review of a multitude of topics sheds light on issues that need more oversight by all of us.It was most enlightening and easy to read.It also reinforced my low regard for Clinton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting book and definitely not \\"gripping\\"!","review":"This book is basically a chronicle of the murder of Amy St. Laurent - and it is a poorly written one at that. Footnoted information should have been incorporated into the text of the book, especially the part about part-time officer Ryan Campbell. And there is absolutely no suspense whatsoever - it is know almost immediately who committed the crime. As far as the crime itself, I find it appalling that it was months before anybody actually searched the location where Amy's body was found. It was an obvious location and was the first place that came to my mind. Also found the two-person narrative distracting and uneven. If you are really interested in reading about the Amy St. Laurent murder, read about it on the internet. It will be a more interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring Read - Could Barely Finish","review":"I am a avid reader of true stories and have read many books in this genre over the years. This one was slow-moving and basically you knew who did it from the very eaerly pages. There was no mystery, just lots of dragging boring details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it all weekend","review":"The story caught me...and kept me captive for the whole weekend. This book lets you experience how a real investigation and prosecution unfolds. To me, the most revealing detail was how the detectives looked for testimony that was too perfect, that repeated a story's details in exactly the same way. Perfect repetition can indicate a made-up story and heightens the suspicions of an experienced interrogator. Reading Finding Amy carried me away from the safe embraces of a one-hour TV detective story to the scary reality of apparently safe streets where real crimes occur--and real detectives painstakingly solve them. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value for the money","review":"looks good, grills great.

Every kitchen top drawer should have one. It is very bright, lasts forever, and mostly easy to use (more about that later). It is super reliable and does not take up a lot of batteries or space. It is light weight.The one problem is that the switch is not very easy to operate. You really have to depress it hard and deep and sometimes it just doesn't work at all. I can see how in a year or two of regular use the switch is going to give out and then you will have to replace it. Not a big deal at that price though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"It broke in two weeks ..it would shut off when you shake it ..the inside looks like a 5th grader made it in class for a project ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality light","review":"This light worked for just over a month----didn't use it much----just quit for no reason.

The light itself illuminates nothing! All this flashlight shed light on is the fact that I have to purchase another light. I guess you get what you pay for. One star because it actually turned on. (Although, keeping it on is another matter.) Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K.","review":"Quality of light is good. The switch is inconsistent.

This thing is almost perfect. When on in the pitch dark of the woods, I could see about 20-30 feet with a similar amount width wise (at its widest). It comes with a handy dandy wrist strap and batteries (which you should prob swap for some name brand).My only gripe is I've experienced the \\"intermittent\\" lighting issue where the spring has trouble connecting to the battery. A quick smack/shake cured it while in the woods and a pad of aluminum foil fixed the issues with the lighting. If it hadn't have had this, it would have easily gotten 5 stars.Even with the gripe, this is by far an excellent deal @ only $2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought Two Flashlights. One worked, one did not.","review":"I bought two of these flashlights. My roomate and I work as security at a nightclub and we needed flashlights. One worked great, the other had maybe 1/4th of the brightness the other had. I returned one for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessive shipping charge - bait and switch on premium","review":"A shipping charge of $7.69 is truly excessive for four little flashlights.Beware of vendors selling cheap merchandise with high \\"shipping\\" charges -- it is really an upcharge or markup in disguise.Amazon should get wise to this and outlaw it before their reputation and customer base suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay more, get much more","review":"I bought both this 9-LED unit and one each of the \\"GIANT Light - Small Package\\" Flashlights; the 21-LED and 28-LED versions, both for $[...], right here on Amazon.com. side-by-side, the light put out by the 9-LED unit's embarrassing. Yes, the 9-LED unit is slimmer; the head is the same size as the barrel, essentially, so it'll slide conveniently into a space the size of a roll of quarters. But, when you pull it out and use it, if you're lucky, like some here, it will work. In my case, I have to keep unscrewing and screwing in the battery compartment lid to keep it on... and it *still* flickers off for no reason or if lightly jostled. Forget it.The 21- and 28-LED units light up a dark closet like a floodlight. They're amazing. For 12 bucks, the 28-LED unit is an excellent deal. Since they're both the same size and price, I'd get it over the 21-LED unit. LEDs are power misers. And both units have been rock solid. And they come with a nifty little nylon velcro-closed belt case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Fine Print","review":"I was first attracted to this product by its small size, excellent light intensity, and price. When I received the package, right on the back was a safety disclaimer. Turns out this product is manufactured in China and the pain they use on it is lead based. More troubling was the fact that warning label advised the user to wear goggles and gloves when using the flashlight. When was the last time anyone had to use flashlights and gloves to use a flashlight. As the proverbial saying goes, you get what you pay for. I just didn't expect that such an simple product would be a detrimental health risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"I needed several small flashlights so I purchased one to evaluate quality - good thing I did because they don't seem any good. The sample I received does not work at all (that is, there is no light output). I put fresh batteries in it but that didn't help. I checked for loose or missing parts but could find no obvious cause for the failure.I then purchased 6 Sears Craftsman LED flashlights for $7.50 on sale. Every one of them works perfectly.(I gave it a one star rating only because I couldn't give it a zero star rating.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noway! Never again!!!","review":"This item is a real piece of C%$P... Well you know. It's a bad product. I bought three of them and the first thing was the little black strap was not on it. I tried to attach it. Forget it. Not worth the trouble. Next, I went to put one in the kitchen and it fell apart. I mean I didn't even drop it, it just sprang apart. The front popped right off. I've seen this same item in the local store for $1.99 Come on now! For the price I paid I could have gotten one OK flashlight. Now I own three really cheap ones. I would put a few drops of supper glue on the front lens edges to keep it in place. That is most likely where others are getting the flickering from, and was the reson it fell apart. The front lens popped right out. I would worn others to stay clear of this item. You could do MUCH better!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sturdy and good value","review":"After I purchased this flashlight, I inadvertently dropped it in the snow in my back yard. I didn't notice it missing for a few days and then couldn't find it. Three weeks later after more snow and rain and thaw, I noticed it laying on the lawn. It still looked great and worked like a champ. It's small size makes it ideal for coat pocket or car. It's small price and proven sturdiness and water resistance makes it a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but fragile","review":"The product gives good light. However it is not sturdy, a fall onto a rug from about 18 inches and that was the end. Purchase something else that may cost a few bucks more, but it would still working and give better or equivalent illumination."},{"rating":"2","title":"the supplier seems to matter as to what LED you get","review":"I happened to order this jet black 9 LED flashlight twice. The first time I ordered from etoolcity and got a very good light for the price. The second time I ordered what I thought was the same light, but the supplier was HottestDealEver and the quality of the light I received is much lower. The two lights look very similar but the first is slightly larger, has much better spring and contact positioning, and is better constructed and seems brighter with the same batteries. The second light from HottestDealEver was very low cost but also much less valuable to me. Since Amazon.com does not seem to have actual part numbers, it is challenging to make sure that varied suppliers listed are actually selling the same item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries smashed on arrival","review":"When I opened this product one of the three batteries it came with was crushed in the middle.

The most annoying thing to me though, is the way the light will just cut out for no reason....and if you tap it good...it comes back on for a bit...then pulls the same stunt again.

I would not wish to depend on any of these, to get me out of the deep woods after dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap but Defective","review":"These lights look good and are fine when they work but several were defective out of the box and others failed later.

The slightest movement causes it to lose contact and power off. There is a short somewhere. I can't find it.I tried to make it work reliably, but it jsut won't behave.Helpful Tip: Smack it. Wack it. Throw it. It'll turn on... for a few seconds. Then the next slightest movement will cause it to turn off again. Oh? That wasn't helpful? Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap = Cheap","review":"I have three of these and two have failed. One where the plastic faceplate just popped off one day.

I will proabably sell it on eBay or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Dorcy or Fenix, still very cheap..tons better quality","review":"This torch is cheap enough that you probably would not necessarily be dissappointed, but after I got this I discovered Dorcy and Fenix brands so this one will be regulated to a very non-critical bag or drawer.If I had to say something nice, it is very light. That is about it for the positive aspect. The idea of all the LEDs was appealing to me until the first bulb went out after twenty minutes of use, and two more were out before the first set of batts ran out.It is just crappy quality and I have a single lamp, 1 AAA Fenix keychain light that seems just as bright.Spend a extra buck or two for kne of the other brands I mentioned, you may not be as impresses as I am, but at least they won't start failing on the first battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well made","review":"It worked great for a few days.

I thought it would be nice to have a small flashlight that put out a lot of light. However, this light is heavy, and is not very bright. The tailcap switch is useful and it also has a little strap on it. I used to carry it in my vest at work for when I needed extra light, but I quickly changed to using my Streamlight pen light that I got for checking pupils. Spending a little more on a good quality pen light will get you a better quality product and still in the same general use area of what you are looking for if you are viewing this product, as pen lights are very compact and light and can be very bright. I would not recommend this light to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light","review":"Great flashlight for your pocket. Small but big light. Push button on end makes it easy to use.

It's bright, lasts more hours than I have counted on its 3 AAA batteries, and it's at minimum splash proof as mine has been dropped in several puddles and still works.It's also very durable, mine rattles around in the bottom of my tool bag with hammers, wrenches, and pry-bars, and does not mind at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright, when you change the batteries","review":"I purchased this flashlight and was extremely disappointed with the dimness of the beam.

This is a cheap flashlight and I would not buy it for myself (I'd want something to last forever) but I think it is an excellent choice at *six-tee* percent off the list price for camp if there is the chance it will be lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"9 LED jet black flashlight","review":"Love the design and compact size.

I don't want much more from a flashlight.Based on the warning that came with it I'd imagine some of the inner casing (certainly not the shell, it's too light) is made of lead.

My favorite of his and one of my favorite of all, and I own a few thousand recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing but","review":"As Mac Rebennack he built a solid reputation as an inspired session player, able to inject a little New Orleans life into any song. As Dr. John, the Night Tripper he earned a small, devoted following and one hit record, \\"Right Place, Wrong Time.\\" In 1981, he dropped the voodoo trappings of his stage act, sat down at the piano and played this lovely set of original tunes and New Orleans standards. The piano work here is less ornate that of Rebennack's predecessors, Professor Longhair and Tuts Washington, but every note sounds heartfelt. For those who think of Dr. John as a funky New Orleans singer, this album will demonstrate his solid musicianship and his abilities as a tunesmith. Out of print for several years, this remastered recording adds a few unreleased tunes and makes one of the great moments in Dr. John's brilliant career available once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow a pleasure to read","review":"There are few physics books that I can say I enjoy reading for fun (and I'm a student of physics) but I must admit that this book is excellent. It holds true not only to its reputation but to what the author's original intent was. It is thorough, enlightening, to the point and fun to read, the author's sense of humor not only aids in ease or reading but makes retention and elucidation all the more easy! This is an excellent graduate text on basic solid sate physics, even though it was published in 1975.It covers all the bascis areas, from periodicty to lattice waves, phonons, semiconductors etc at an accessible level to the beginning graduate student. A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Boring!","review":"Perhaps I would have enjoyed this book if I were a parent however, I found this book incredibly boring and it was a struggle to finish it. It seemed as if the author did not give a lot of thought to the structure of the novel and its characters. There were characters which were thrown into the novel and did not seem to have any purpose or add in any way to the understanding of the novel. Quite frankly, the various characters who floated in and out of the book just added to the disjointed nature of the novel. I kept waiting for something to happen and just when I thought that I was just around the corner from suspense, there was nothing. This book was not worth the time investing in reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish this book was missing...","review":"I found this book was the basis for the TV movie \\"Without A Trace\\" and decided to read it. What a disappointment. The book does hit some home runs when it comes to describing the mother's feelings and reactions but overall, the characters are shallow, undeveloped and stereotypical. I also found the writing to be very poor in most places, even amateurish. The book was more like a high school student reading about Etan Patz (real life disappearance)and writing about it for a composition class. The low point is the ending, which I won't give away. Aside from being highly improbable, it felt very rushed, abrupt and WAY predictable. When an author spends more time and effort describing an encounter with a homosexual prostitute than in a book's conclusion, there is something wrong. I have never read Gutcheon's work before; \\"Still Missing\\" would not make me seek her out again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book I read","review":"The book I read was about a boy named alex selky who is missing.

I really felt like I was part of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"ELP-In The Beginning","review":"This release takes you back to their birth. It is amazing to see how comfortable they were with stage, the audience, and each other, so early on. The concert footage is pretty darn good considering the time it was recorded. The background of the concert, the event, and the interspersed interviews with the members of ELP (in 2005 when this was released) really help to give you insight into where they were as individuals, what they hoped to achieve, the luck they knew they had in their timing and venue; and their surprise of the world-wide reaction immediately after that concert.Whether you are a fan or not this is great entertainment. It will bring you back to the greatest live concert event to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip-off!","review":"DVD is almost entirely Pictures and Rondo, except for interviews and lame footage of the festival grounds and attendees. My sense is there is no new footage here that what was on the previous IOW offerings. The Pictures footage is almost un-watchable, due to lame stop-action and slo-mo effects. Rondo is good, however, w/o the aforementioned effects. Full Palmer drum solo is shown. Take a Pebble is almost entirely played with worthless footage of the festival grounds and attendees. No footage of Nutrocker. I suppose the interviews may be of interest. Keith, filmed in 2005, does a cool demo and plays a few bars on his Moog rig. I'm mad there's not more here, but I think I'll come to like the few bits that are there - especially Rondo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back good times....","review":"I used to buy these at my hometown movie theater when I was a child and I was delighted to see them again!When I received my box of Linda's Lollies in the mail I was overjoyed...they were just as delicious to me 15 years later!I highly recommend these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Taste Horrible","review":"These pops were absolutely awful. My first try was the German Chocolate Cake, which barely tasted like chocolate and more like a mild root beer flavored candy. The second try was the Cherry Cheesecake, which tasted like cherry flavored cough syrup. The third attempt was the Coconut Creme Pie, which had a mild coconut flavor.I gave up after the third attempt and shared a few of the remaining pops with some coworkers; most of them hated the pops as well, stating they tasted very artificial.I was very disappointed considering other products of this nature appear to have higher ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Error-filled","review":"As other reviewers have noted, there are problems with this book, despite its laudable intent. In short, it is doubtful that the author speaks fluent Spanish herself, and it seems as if she simply opened a Spanish-English dictionary to create the book.For example, for 'azul/blue' she displays a fish, which she calls a \\"pescado.\\" As any second-year Spanish student can tell you, the animal is a 'pez' whereas prepared food is called 'pescado' (literally, \\"that which has been fished\\"). Also, on the back cover she writes \\"¡Recolecte todos los libres en la serie!\\" (Collect all the books in the series). The verb \\"recolectar\\" means \\"to gather\\", not \\"to collect\\" as in a collection (she needed to use \\"coleccionar\\")As a Spanish professor, I commend her good intentions with this book, but I cannot recommend this book until the errors are corrected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning book!","review":"This book will help my baby learn colors and other words in both languages.

One you need to have all 3 suctions in place and hold them there while pumping the pump. It isn't easy it takes quite a bit of manuvering and once you finally get the suctioning working it isn't an equal suctioning. Might be too hard on the nipples and not enough on the clit. The vibrating was so so but after 30 minutes the batteries died. All of them. I gave it 2 stars because over all it has some stimulation but it didn't give me the pleasure I thought it would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very vague and broad","review":"I was very excited when I saw this book hoping it'd open me all of the secrets of not-known-until-now world of HDL Synthesis. How wrong I was. The title is very misleading, the book spends just a few pages on synthesis. Overall, this book might be useful for a novice, but even for me, an undergrad ECE major, it turned out to be almost useless. It contains minimum of factual information, often outdated(and this is critical in the ECE world), and only slightly touches the surface on a number of topics it tries to cover. I think the authors whould have concentrated on something specific, instead of giving \\"what happened in Computer Engineering in last 15 years\\" review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less and more, Richard!","review":"I am having trouble understanding the good reviews. This is a paper mill book that is rushed to press to get it out there before the next version of Flash comes out.It starts out slow, too slow, and then accelerates into oblivion, with information that could be useful, however isn't reinforced enough by the exercises or further explannation. If one is to learn independently, there needs to be many more exercises reinforcing less content.There is a nice format and THAT has merrit, but due to the numerous errors (mostly omitting instruction steps) I have found this book to be detrimental to learning Flash.Who wrote those reviews, anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was VERY dissapointed with this series. My daughter read this book in a class designed around it. She told me that everyone in the class, including the teacher, disliked the books and thought them to be quite boring. The book has a very nice Christian message, but does nothing to keep your attention. The book would go on and on for pages about the same topic and was very wordy. All of the reviews and descriptions are very misleading. I have heard that the Elsie series (that was actually written by Martha Finley) were very good and I imagine that is why the Violet series was so bad. Martha Finley did not write them! In the end, I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and to the point","review":"I am really glad I bought this book. I also purchased The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2008 and Beyond Disney. The latter 2 are Huge books (one of them being over 800 pages of info) full of more info than I can possibly dig into.This book is great because it is short and to the point telling you the top 10 attractions in many different catergories. I suggest getting this book on top of your Frommers or Unofficial guide as it will help you know what you want to research in the other books.While there is not a lot of details in this book about each place, it is best used as a guide to figure out what you want to research more into. It also has some really nice fold out laminated maps on the cover which will be so helpful to bring with on our vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on Orlando, period.","review":"This book goes beyond all others.

The plastic fish have metal in their mouth so the pirate can \\"catch\\" them. It comes with a bucket to put your fish in, 2 oars that attach to the gunwales or fit in the pirate's hand, & lamp that attaches to the back of the boat. Cute, cute toy.

I tried the Shampoo alone and it still did it and the Conditioner seemed to make it worse! I don't see how anyone could praise the Super Skinny Shampoo & Conditioner... i liken it to putting crisco on my head. I LOVE the Super Skinny Serum but would not recommend the matching Super Skinny Shampoo or Super Skinny Conditioner to my worst enemy.

Whether love is aplenty in your life, or lacking momentarily, this album leads you on thinking of the simplicity and purity of love. Wilson's vocal is flawless and her phrasing superbly delivered.

I knew it would be a great read, but it was full of wonderful extra touches! Ms. O'Brien really put some oomph into the details, and the sweet sexual awareness between the main characters is palpable. In addition to the well-done suspense aspect of the story line, there were some sharply funny laugh-out-loud moments! Two people who have suffered great loss, an adorable little boy with a cute dog, and a worthy supporting cast all come together for a terrific romance read.

The product I got was damaged and had a corner chipped off + I didn't know what to do with a box that could have been used for shipping a medium-sized fridge.Regarding the way it works: it doesn't, at least if your dog is determined. The tray is supposed to keep a wee wee pad in place and facilitate cleaning, but my dog had no problem removing the pad and shredding it into pieces, no matter how hard i tried to press together the two parts of the tray.

Further there are as well some B-sides (New York City & Strange) which are for the first time released on CD/album. The record company knew why! The hammer is the title \\"Papa Chico\\" - one of the worst if not the worst single release of Boney M. ever.. which flopped, no wonder, terribly. So I ask myself: WHY THIS? Why not a putting a compilation together with the big hits and some of the finest tracks that Boney M did like \\"Never Change Lovers..\\" \\"Boonoonoonoos, or \\"Still I'm Sad\\".

I didn't need anything indepth. Even with my low standards, I was still disappointed. The book is simplified down to the point where its not even correct anymore. For instance, on page 83, discussing transcription it says: \\"RNA leaves the nucleolus and picks up the chemical coded message from the DNA. The process of \\"picking up\\" the coded message is called transcription. RNA then leaves the nucleus with the coded message and travels to the ribosomes\\".The way transcription actually works is that a copy of RNA (premessenger RNA) is made from a strand of DNA and modified into messenger RNA, and then sent out of the nucleus to ribosomes. RNA doesn't go to DNA for anything after its made, RNA is copied from a strand of DNA.I only read one page, and that page was incorrect. That's pretty bad.

Although the tempos are pretty crazy(at least to my Bernstein,Solti conditioned ears), I was inspired by the ferocity of the playing. These guys were monsters - Vacchiano(1st trumpet) , Johnny Ware(posthorn solo),Gordon Pulis (trombone),James Chambers (1st horn) - this recording is such an enjoyment. These guys are legends and this demonstrates how they got that status. The only reason I give it 4 stars, is that not everyone is a brass fiend and the overall performance is more a testament to the virtuousity of the NYP at that time, rather than a definitive interpretation. The section work in the brass is killer!

There are many layers and delightful characters, with Ms. Rice combining intelligence and a light touch in a way reminiscent of Susan Elizabeth Phillips. This is a first rate choice for contemporary romance readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"If you are a fan of Susan Elizabeth Phillips, you will most certainly love this book. It has a feisty heroine, a wounded but repairable hero, a handful of cute kids, and a small town of eccentric characters.

A light, fun read, with one of the few laugh-out-loud birth scenes I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable...","review":"I'm sure this is a nice enough book for someone else.Frankly, it was just too unoriginal for me.

But of course, as soon as the heroine meets the hero- she cannot seem to function in life without him and must be \\"rescued\\" by the big strong guy-this supposedly from a character who has a masters in education and has fought her way up from being a child of the foster care system? It gets tiresome.After repeatedly falling asleep trying to read this, I quit 70 pages in. The names are also laughably cliche'- Maya (New Age) Alyssum (a flower for flower child of course) and Axell Holm-Axell? are you kidding me? Like the Axell of a car or Axel Rose huh? LOL.

The fan is almost entirely made of plastic. This itself isn't a major problem. But the plastic components aren't assembled tightly, which causes the fan to wobble and produce an annoying sound when operating at any speed. This makes for an unpleasant experience when the fan is sitting within a couple feet of me. I'm reluctant to use the fan because of the irritating noise it generates.I've had good experiences with the more expensive Vornado whole-room air circulators. But, in this case, Vornado clearly put their reputation on the line to save a few dollars with a poorly designed & manufactured product."},{"rating":"2","title":"just run-of-the-mill EXCELLENT!","review":"I've had this fan a little over two years and since then it's been running year round for me. In the summer it helps cool the air and circulate the central A/C more efficiently. In the winter months it circulates the heat for me as well. I've tried other fans and this one lives up to the claims in its description that it moves air both faster and further than fans its size and even those much larger.On low it makes just enough white noise to be appreciated as a sleep aid. On high it's a little too noisy for my tastes. It moves air so well though that I never really need it on high unless I've burned something in the kitchen and need to exchange the air rapidly.I have pets in the home and I like that the grill is tightly designed so no little paws can get hurt here.One star deducted for noisy in high cool mode but otherwise very pleased with this product and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better built","review":"Have had this Vornado for 3 months and the knob broke out of the blue just with normal use.

Not very useful without the knob!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design decisions","review":"I can't believe no one mentioned this, but the switch goes from off to high to medium to low. It doesn't go from off to low or vice versa. If you want to set it to low, you have to switch to high and then to medium first. This really annoyed me, especially because the low setting is the only one that's very quiet. The other two are rather loud.Another thing I didn't like is that it tilts up, but not down. If you don't need this, then you won't notice.The plastic is of higher quality than cheaper fans, but considering that it doesn't oscillate, it wasn't worth it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor makes strange noise","review":"Motor makes an accelerating/de-accelerating noise with operation.

After much debate on the installation of a ceiling fan and the complications which may arise from a dimmer switch, I decided to purchase a Vornado. This fan moves a great deal of air even on its lowest setting. It has rendered the need for an air conditioner dispensable, even in a top floor apartment. On the most brutal days of a summer in New York City, the Vornado is nothing short of superb. My only gripe is the sound can get rather loud on its highest setting, especially when one is trying to read in silence. Nevertheless, the sound is much lower than the decibels an air conditioner unit would reach. I have been so impressed, I purchased two of these units in case I find myself too lazy to transfer the unit from my bedroom to the living room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother","review":"This piece of junk completely stopped working on only the third use. It just all of a suddenly stopped working in all three speeds/settings.

I have always used fans in my home and office forever. I just like lots of air circulation, and when I'm a little hot, I like to fix it. I have always had lots of fans in my home. This fan is the ONLY one I have ever used that always remains quiet. If you have ever owned a fan, you know that sooner or later (usually sooner) they start making noises. Rattling fan covers and blades happen to every fan I ever had except the Vornado ones. I don't know why or how they do it but they do. I have 4 of these exact fans and love them. After five years they are still running quiet as ever and I keep them on 24hrs a day. None have stopped working either. I remember when I purchased the first one it cost more than others of the same size and I took a chance. The higher cost is far more than worth it. If then ever do fail, I'll buy more just like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this model. Control knob breaks within weeks","review":"I've always bought Vornado. We have three that go back 15 years. They WERE the best air circulators. Now this version, 530, we bought two. Within weeks the control knob cracked and we had to change the fan speed without it, which is painful. Specially since my mother, who has arthritis, had trouble using it. So we just put it for use in the basement, plug and unplug to turn it in and off. The second 530 fan lasted a little longer, then that knob cracked too. Now I've got to replace both these fans; it's summer and we need them in the kitchen and guest room. But I am still a Vornado devotee (cannot me a masochist) so I spent $90 on the USA made 715 model, which is supposed to be a premium fan and will last.

Unfortunately after several knocks to the floor over 4 years it stopped working.Then I order this model (530B) as a replacement. In the lowest speed it rattled like an old pick up truck with a payload of aluminum cans. In the two higher speeds the unit rattled less but was as loud as those huge metal \\"industrial\\" fans that are used in gyms or dance clubs to move vast amounts of stale air. Usually the hum of a fan helps me sleep at night, but this Vornado was WAY too disruptive. The fan's noise dominated the room such that I couldn't watch TV at a decent volume. I'm returning this fan. This is a disappointing product from Vornado brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted....Warranty is worthless","review":"This fan seemed great at first--it was quiet and powerful. After about 2 weeks of use, it started making a rattling sound on the higher speeds. After 2 years of occasional use, it stopped working altogether yesterday. Even though it is technically under warranty still, the warranty is not worth anything. To get it repaired, you have to not only pay to ship it back to Vornado, but they make you include a check for $20 for return shipping & handling. Plus, they say it will take 3-5 weeks to repair.

Perhaps if the author would have taken more time she could have done better. Perhaps some people can get something out of it, but I was not impressed with it. There just wasn't any continuity to it. I give her credit for addressing a subject that deserves to be written about, but I would not waste my money on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would rate it lower if I could","review":"Simply an absurd book based on pick-and-choose, mish-mash eclecticism that does justice to neither Wicca nor Christianity. Major tenets of both faiths have to be ignored to come up with this conglomeration that is neither Christian nor Wiccan, but insulting to both by using the names of the respective faiths.It strikes me as pseudo-paganism for people who want to be pagan but are afraid they'll go to hell for it if they don't adhere to at least a modicum of Christian doctrine, while totally ignoring that the Christian Bible condemns witchcraft in more than one place and refuses to share Godhead with any, even a feminine consort (ESPECIALLY the feminine, if you look at the vehemence with which the cults of Astarte were persecuted).I only wish Amazon would let me give this book a negative rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"RENAME THIS BOOK!!!","review":"I am sorry, while I agree with the ideas the author puts forth, being both very open minded and calm when hearing other ideas, I just cant get over the fact that perhaps the author has confused PAGANISM with WICCA! Wicca is an established religion, albiet rather new in the borad scheme of things, but the beliefs and practices of wicca are not up for debate, or go-as-you-please. *PAGANISM* is however, as varied as the rainbow. To confuse Wicca and Paganism once is fine, but to write a whole book saying that Wicca is synonomous with paganism is just disrespectful.Im all for people saying they are Pagan Christians, the idea of a holy trinity works well into an earthbased religious system, even one using ceremonial magic. This could be a beautiful spiritual system.A \\"Wiccan Christian,\\" however, just can not exist. That is disrespectful of the accepted rules of *both* those religions.Please, dont confuse eclectic earth based god-and-goddess paganism with Wicca."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Gonna Work.","review":"Ok. Seriously. Like the other person said, you can't be a pagan Christian. And also, that is a JEWISH star in the background. Wiccan stars have only five points.

I am not against Christianity, but can people just leave others alone and let them believe what they want to believe? Convert is the worst word in the English language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rename the book. Insulting!","review":"I won't buy the book. There has never been a thing called Christian Wicca, and there is no such thing as a Christian Witch. Wicca is for those bound to Earth-- the Druids, Pagans, Witches, Wiccans. It is our faith. We don't need Christianity in it. It's a slap in the face. Especially since many Christians believe us Wiccans worship a \\"Satan\\". Wrong again. That is a Christian built evilness. Leave your faith out of ours please. You may be magical in your own ways, but that doesn't make you Wiccan.

There was scarcely a page if any without a grammatical or spelling error, and usually numerous ones. It contains various factual errors as well. I was disappointed as this is a topic I am interested in: I am not a Christopagan, but I have developed mostly Christian rituals with mystical themes as a parallel to my traditional Christian devotions and liturgies. The best part of the book may be the outlines for ritual. I am not Wiccan, neo-Wiccan, or anything remotely close to that, so they were not helpful to me as I continue to develop my path, but if one is more inclined toward Wicca and shares Christian sentiments, this part of the book might be more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great starter book for Christian Wiccans!","review":"While I haven't read the book in depth yet, I can say that it seems to be well-written and I really like the ritual script for the ceremonies.

Cath talks about different things she did to make herself better and different things to do and things that I never would have even thought of as to some causes that can contribute to this desease.

BP Medical sent replacements TWICE but during the Summer it's difficult to say how warm the product gets during shipping. The second shipment was also ruined due to it being too hot the second time it arrived and sat in our mailbox until someone got home.

It is NOT an attempt to create H.P. Lovecraft's frightening, though fictitious, book, the Necronomicon. What this really is, is a sort of dictionary of the Lovecraftian mythos, containing entries on various places and creatures.As for me, I found the first chapters to be quite excellent, especially those focusing on the seven Great Old Ones.

While note the sanity blasting tome of the original stories, it is a well though out and assembled narrative which touches on and reveals connections to other works upon reflection. Tyson's mythos scholarship and detail works in very smoothly, even neatly working around some of the original authors' inconsistencies. (If bored, plenty of margin room would allow annotation to reference other mythos works.) I would recomend this without hesitation to any mythos fan, or mythos tabletop roleplayer.

I think this cot would be only good for a child. It is impossible for an adult to sleep comfortable on this because it is so narrow that your arms fall off the sides! It's also a pain overall to put together. You have to join some cot bars to form the sides and the cot bars do NOT stay together and will come apart while assembling this and inside of the canvas material. The legs are a pain to put on as well and you have to bend them a lot before you can even get them to stay in. I also feel like this cot is pretty flimsy and have been scared when I sleep on it that I am going to fall through.

I was looking forward to use in the field as the previous year I had slept on the cold hard ground. First night in the field, I get everything set up and I am laying in the tent on the cot appreciating that I am not on the ground. A little later, I rolled onto my side and my elbow went right through the canvas of the cot rendering the cot unusable. I'm about 215 lbs, but the cot says it will work up to 250 lbs.

The one I received today, goes together much easier (no tool required), but the fabric doesn't seem quite as taut when assembled. I layed on it after assembly (6' @ 210lbs)and didn't have any problems. The legs take a little muscle to get in, but just stand it up on edge an lean on em' - they'll go. All-in-all, these are pretty sturdy little cots for the money. Durable enough to survive scout camp, and will fit inside a footlocker for transport.

No doubt about that. The control panel, in shape of a bat: totally cool. If that is not enough, the remote is also batshaped.What about picture quality? Good. No, not awesome, HDTV quality. But, good quality for a small 13 inch TV. Great for a batfan, or a kid's room.

Though we had a high performing team with piqued strengths in leading large scale horizontal change, he helped us understand how the makeup of the team needed to change as the charter changed. Against typical instincts (why change what's working) we consciously supported some departures and refashioned the team for the second phase of organization effectiveness, after initial integration was largely complete. We also used Peter's approach to advise our own internal clients on how their teams needed to change to accomodate expectations that became apparent in the press 6 months later.

(I love the old Decca Arabella with Lisa Della Casa.) I would like to suggest that in much the same way that some Callas performances \\"improve\\" with repeated hearings, Price's unique voice quality and expressive artistry merit the same attention. I love her plush, sumptous sound, and what she does with those arias!As for Gruberova, arguably the greatest coloratura soprano of the last half century, she is the quintessence of Zerbinetta.

Good thing I only paid $4 for this set. It doesn't even have Peter Haycock (from Climax Blues Band--guitarist) on it.

They are very soothing and inspirational. Anyone who was a Catholic before the 1960's will remember these and the emotions they evoke will be love, peace, and healing. Beth Nielsen Chapman rolled memory, emotion, and spirituality into one nice package. The Ave Maria at the end soars up to heaven with any prayer you have to offer. I listened to it while undergoing a medical treatment and everyone in the clinic was astounded at the beauty and calming nature of the music. Get this one while it's available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful harmonies","review":"This has to be my favorite CD of Beth Neilsen Chapman's collection. It is very unlike her other CDs, being mostly composed of Catholic hymns.

The hymns are sung in a very peaceful, haunting manner with beautiful harmonies and minimal instrumentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time","review":"I was listening to NPR one evening and heard the interview with Beth Chapman. I was delighted to hear the \\"old\\" songs of the Catholic Church presented in a contemporary, sophisticated, yet respectful manner. That night I immediately logged on to Amazon and ordered enough for my choir. They all enjoyed the music, and, knowing I've been trying to get them to sing more Latin at Mass, found the music accessible. As a church musician, I've grown weary of the watered-down Kum-Ba-Yah approach the Catholic Church has moved into. Perhaps more people will see that the \\"old\\" music is everlasting for a reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely memories...","review":"I was raised as a Catholic, but throughout even in my earliest days in parochial school, I was disturbed by the hypocrisy and contradictory church doctrines. As a young woman I began to earnestly study the Bible, eventually renounced Catholicism, and became a non-denominational Christian at the age of 25. I add that to my review because it affects my disposition, my perception. I occasionally miss some of the beautiful things about Catholicism, particularly the music I grew up with. Though I left the church confused, discouraged, and feeling disconnected from God, the reverent and beautiful music inspired me to keep searching for Him. This CD is a pure, uncluttered rendition of some of the most gorgeous, worshipful music I've heard to date. I'm glad to tap into fond memories without the bitter aftertaste usually connected to my religious upbringing.

But, as I said, I have too many blackheads and huge pores with acne scars, I guess my case is more difficult and complicated.

I'm using every day after cleansing my face, and the price is wonderful, better than a lot of dollars spent on Proactive, Neutrogena, Acnefree, etc ...It came on time in an envelope.

Something that I thought was really exciting was that I could actually see all the oil that this masque sucked out of my pores!

I mainly use it to dry out acne which it does a fair job at. It is also rather relaxing. There is no burning or irritation for me when I use it. The smell when it is applied is, as expected, minty but when it is rinsed off a stil minty but slightly unpleasant smell lingers but is not there long enough to bother me. Definitely try to keep this out of your hair.

This masque is no exception. There isno reason to spend oodles of cash on high end deep pore cleansing masques when this one does the job and then some. After each use my skin feels totally firm and totally sebum-free. I usually add a drop of lavender or peppermint essential oil to the masque which turns it into my own private spa treatment. The lavender calms while the peppermint refreshes. Tea tree oil is great too for more problem skin.

I bought this mask for the first time. I liked the reviews about the product. As a result, I am very happy with their purchase. The mask works wonderfully. I am struck at 15 minutes, a thin layer of the mask. The mask immediately dried on my face, and the longer I sat with it, the more it contracts face. The mask is not a strong smell, there is a faint smell of mint and the first time, it cools the face. The mask is easily washed off with warm water. The only mask is a little dry my skin. Next time I will apply it only to problem areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"No moisturizer needed afterwards","review":"I found this mask at a friends house and decided to try it because I had heard about it before.

I read other's reviews about this and I was quite taken by the idea of this product. I tested it last night after a shower and after the 15 minutes of waiting to let the mask dry, I washed it away with warm water and a wash cloth. I noticed that it did indeed seem to take away some of the blackheads and make others seem smaller. That was just a first try, so I will use it again and again to see if it really does minimize large pores and take away blackheads! I love the smell of it and the thickness of this product. I definitely felt all of the tingling as I was putting it on and as it was drying! The bottle is big, so you get alot for your money!

Well, I apparently put the masque really close to my lips or actually got on to my lips. Let me tell you, it started to get warm then burning sensation. It felt like I rubbed habanero pepper over my lips. I couldn't wait another 12 minutes, so I pretty much rinsed it off right after I put the masque on.The result: my lips were saved and my face felt clean and smooth.

The plot is fairly complex and well-drawn, but the characters are purely schizophrenic, changing moods without reason or warning, swinging from cozily romantic to blazingly hostile and back, often in a single paragraph. And aren't the characters in these books allowed to have a single weakness? The male lead is a lawyer, a potter, a professional wrestler, looks after his 6 siblings and cancer-stricken mama and, oh yeah, we're constantly reminded, he's gorgeous and built. The female is a gallery owner, a country-western singer, a silent contributor to the local homeless shelter, and--yep--gorgeous and built. As to the narrative, if your idea of snappy repartee is lines like, \\"You're a gifted genius!\\" (this at the apex of a love scene, mind you) or \\"He had a hot poker in his pants,\\" well then, put down the Shelley and Shakespeare; Patricia Rice is your gal."},{"rating":"2","title":"How still we see thy satellite news reports...","review":"With excellent British understatement and subtle humour, Bethlehem Year Zero presents the Christmas Story in a modern context, bringing new insights to what you thought was a familiar tale. The details remain historically accurate while being presented as contemporary breaking news. Three diplomats from the East, for instance, arrive in Mercedes Limosines, and King Herod's Special Intelligence Forces carry out his instructions of Matthew 2:16. The storyline is presented as a series of fifteen-minute news reports in CNN or Nightline style, and presented in such a way that both devout Christians and confirmed atheists will enjoy it without finding any part of it offensive or patronizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The were once great.","review":"I have to say that I have spent many a night with the Fenian's at the Harp in enjoying their music.

Was I ever wrong.The music here is a suffocating pabulum that should raise the hackles of any true fan of Celtic music. The songs are wrapped around clichés and played so half-heartedly that a pulse check seems in order. The all-too-smooth and mellow vocals smother any power the band starts to display, and the songs invariably fail to rouse the listener's interest.Maybe this band is better live, but they should display some mettle and surrender the name Fenians now.

I also read this book before giving it to them, and I think it is wonderful. It really goes into Tink's personality and how she feels about her talents, her friends, etc. Even how she feels about getting mad at and leaving Peter Pan. Perfect little book.

Fairy tag is much more complicated than Clumsy tag, but when Timk loses her tinkers hammer, her life is practicly ruined! Tink is the best pots-and-pans talent in all of Pixie Hollow. She can't possibly fix anything without her tinkers hammer! The worst part is that she has a spare hammer, but when she went to visit and live with Peter Pan and the lost boys, she left it there.

The C-Clip that holds the shackel to the box eventually rusts away, but it does not affect the functionality of the box... the shackel can become separated from the box but it just needs to simply be put back in. It would be good if the engineers used Stainless steel for this part. The best parts are that you can use ANY number of digits for the combination and they are harder to break into than the other combination locks.

I can see the fleas hanging out all around it, but they are not attracted to it at all. They do stick to it, when I catch them by hand and put them in...so it is sticky enough. It just doesn't attract them in any way. I think it may catch some fleas if the infestation is bad enough that they hop into it by chance.

In that time it has caught one small beetle bug and one very small bug, perhaps a flea.During this time I have been bitten constantly by fleas, and the trap has been placed in the area where I am most often bit.I can only conclude the flea trap does not really attract fleas, and has really done nothing for me but provide a night light.It may work better for someone with an overwhelming volume of fleas on the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"STICK EM UP, FLEAS","review":"The Victor flea trap works as advertised. Within 3 days there were numerous little black specks stuck to the trap. The only thing I should have considered is that it takes up floor space. Also, one of the \\"night lights\\" came apart as I was unscrewing it to get it set up. It would have been more convenient if the unit had been totally unassembled in order to avoid having to take it all apart in order to get the bulb and cord into the top and the sticky trap into the bottom. Having two night lights on in the room at night does make it a bit bright, so if you plan on having one of these in a bedroom, take that into consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us.","review":"After using this trap for 2 weeks, we caught a total of 5 fleas.

We have 3 dogs and 2 cats and lots and lots of fleas as a result. This trap failed to catch fleas I saw jumping around it. I've used another brand that works on the same pricipal - small light bulb that draws the fleas to a sticky surface, and that one worked pretty well. This one was basically a FAIL.This is going back (along with the refill pack I grabbed in my hopes the glue papers would fill up in a few nights).After realizing this wasn't working, I plunked down the cash and bought a tub of fleabusters.

Not only fleas but mosquitos, ants and other unrecognizable crawlies that I'm glad are stuck in the trap and not roaming free to bother me and my 2 dogs. I can't use pesticides so these traps are a great adjunct to my all natural pest control arsenal. I'm glad I didn't give up on them before they started to catch bugs. It's a month later and I'm proud to announce a total of 24 in my bedroom trap and 8 in my living room one. If there is one thing that's a negative it's how bright the light is in them.

Unfortunately, he never jumped in. In fact, of the 100 fleas that ended up in the trap, 99 of them were ones I caught and put in there. For that purpose it was helpful, as even rinsing them down the drain wasn't a guarantee that the fleas would stay down (Some would climb back out!). At least they'd stay stuck to the sticky paper.I finally gave up this time and had Terminex come in and spray the carpet. That took care of the fleas. There was no odor within a short time.

Reading some of the reviews, I do think you need to know the limits of these traps. If you have pets, you have to use an effective flea treatment. Vacuuming daily really speeds the process along. Laundering all potentially infested areas, etc, etc. But if you do not want to use harsh chemicals in your house, these traps are your best bet. We found that these are also caught a lot of other regular house bugs. So we kept using them long after the fleas were gone. The bulbs burn out after a while. They can be replaced with regular night-light bulbs.

I had a similar product years ago so pretty much knew what to expect. My traps catch a lot of fleas, and I feel really good about the non-toxic approach. However, most flea infestations (in my experience) require other controls as well. I put flea control like Advantage on my cats (the product you put between their shoulderblades once per month).

Since I'd been spraying too, I thought maybe there were no adult fleas and left the flea trap plugged just in case.The clearest indication that this trap doesn't work is that I FOUND an adult flea on my sock one night... quickly removed my sock and positioned it alongside the trap(practically draping it into the trap). The flea was NOT drawn to the trap and went away from it.Next I put the flea trap out in the yard where my dogs live and there are infinite fleas(from squirrels and neighborhood cats)... it caught a mosquito but nothing else.Don't waste your money.

We saw far fewer fleas after only a few days, and now after 3 weeks of use we haven't seen one flea in more than a week. This trap saved us from having to use a harsh chemical bug bomb.

The cheap $1 apiece glue boards caught more fleas than the flea trap. That's pretty sad. After 48 hours, the trap caught maybe 30 fleas where I would say the glue boards caught 50+ each. Victor is charging $15 for a $2 light, a $1 plastic dome, and two $1-2 glue boards. Even an optimistic estimate means they're charging at least twice what this is worth.

After several days, not a single flea was caught.

Probably about triple the amount the Springstar did. Just a word of advice for getting rid of fleas though.

I actually now own 5 of these traps and have them placed in strategic locations around my house.

Results were visible after the first night of use. In the morning, there were fleas in the trap. Place the trap in the area of your home that your pet spends the majority of its time as per the manufacturer’s directions and it’s as simple as that. The flea trap is very easy to setup and is ready to use in a matter of minutes. The product arrived very quickly. Depending on the amount of fleas that you may suspect to be in your home, it may be wise to order some replacement discs to have on hand. The flea trap arrives with two discs which are good for 2 �?4 weeks only.

I tried setting out trays of soapy water with a lit candle at nighttime. This typically resulted in a handful of caught fleas by morning. I bought this product hoping to increase the amount of fleas caught. To date it has yet to catch a single flea.

They surely catch fleas, however, they will not resolve a flea infestation. This requires other products. But the traps are excellent to measure the grade of infestation and to determine in which areas of the house there is an actual problem. This product does not seem to be intended for anything else. Also, these traps do not work by light but through the heat the lamp creates. Thereby, it emulates the warmth of a body. So, if a trap is placed in a well-heated room or next to an animal, it will not work particularly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate waste of money","review":"I had an infest of fleas in my master bedroom and I tried the dawn soap mixed with water,lysol,salt and flea powder on the carpet, none of those worked so I bought this ultimate flea trap and it was plugged in for a little under a week. It did not catch a single thing. My co-worker suggested that I wear white long socks in the dark and turn off the light for about 15-20 seconds and the fleas would be attracted to my feet.

Getting the sticky pad insert into the flea trap itself was a nightmare and the sticky pads were all warped and curved because they had been stored, rolled up, inside the trap during transit. I am not sure if that was something the seller did or something that the manufacturer did. Now, did this thing catch bugs? Yes! I had two little gnats stuck in there in about a week. But fleas? No. I have three dogs, all had fleas pretty seriously off and on during the summer, and the trap had nary a flea in there.

The fleas hop into the bowl and get stuck on the sticky paper.I caught between 30 and 50 fleas before the bulb burned out in my unit. The same amount of money could have been better spent on some permethrin based insecticide.This is more of a gimmick or a toy. I knew that ahead of time but I like gadgets so I bought one.

Apparently the heat from the light bulb is supposed to attract any fleas and they stick to the paper.Well it doesn't work and the reason is simple.

When I removed the sticky pad and its cover it was impossible to get it flat into the trap floor.If you look at the materials used in the trap, it is really simplistic and cheap. It is basically a plastic top and bottom and a tiny light bulb.

Yes, they have collected a scattering of fleas in two weeks, but I could have collected far more with my vacuum cleaner. I consider this purchase a waste of money.

I have a young baby who has just begun to crawl so I really didnt want all the chemical residue that most flea bombs leave behind in my carpets and around my house.I did not catch even ONE flea. I caught several other bugs who were attracted to the light. I made sure to mostly use my traps at night, because most stated in other reviews that was when it seemed to work the best. Only one of my traps actually came with refills. which is just a cheap sticker really, you could but some double sided tape down across the carpet, essientially its the same thing.

A few more months went by, and my petwas itching, again. So I tried the traps once more.After a week, there were two creatures.

This product seemed good enough, we put it together and set it up. It can act as a nice night light, but thats it. After 2 weeks of leaving it in various parts of our house where we had been bitten no fleas. I left it on my couch, because I knew there were fleas there, as I had been devoured by them an hour earlier. Left it there for a week and it caught nothing. I repeat NOTHING. I took off my couch cover and went over to a bathtub of water and shook it out, about 15 fleas fell into the water. So what this tells me is that this contraption can catch fleas that \\"accidentally\\" wander on to the paper, but it will NOT attract fleas.

This one is definitely not worth the money. Maybe $20, nothing more.The blue backlight is very very dim. It will be useless for the reason I bought it. Since the letters on the keys are backlit too, they have to be translucent. That makes the letters less bright than had they been identified with white paint.

I have taken over 3,000 photos since I got the camera, and that was all within the first 2 months. It was great until then, and then it stopped working. I never had a problem with the batteries until April of 2005. Ever since then, the camera will turn on, take 3 pictures, and then I have to charge the batteries.Sometimes my camera decides to turn itself off suddenly with no warning. Othertimes, the LCD will turn bright pink, and it will shut down. No explaination. No warning.The folks at HP have been of zero help.

You can put brand new AA batteries in it, and it will maybe take one or two photos. Often, it will only turn on for a few seconds and then abruptly cut off. I have emailed HP repeatedly with this information in addition to providing links to numerous message boards where many have stated the same problem. Their solution was to send me a long email with an update file for the camera. After going through the whole process, I realized my camera already had the suggested update on it. Bottom line is that this camera is garbage and a total waste of money. HP should have offered refunds or coupons off of future purchases in order to rectify this situation. As a result, I will never by another HP product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery-hog.

In its price range, it was the \\"best\\" one with a video capture function (although the videos are very grainy). I used it extensively in Paris for a trip to museums, and such. Overall, I was pleased with the pictures ...for a 3.2MP camera, and the 3x optical zoom.But it eats batteries --any kind I threw at it, even after updating the firmware to v1.07.Also, it developed a habit of shutting off at I was reviewing/scrolling though pictures on the view-finder. It now shuts off while navigating, and I need to remove the batteries to reset it. VERY frustrating.

The first one I purchased was a hp Photosmart 620. The 620 was great. I am extremely dissapointed with the M305. If you use the flash, be prepared to change the batteries out after just a few pictures. If you use rechargeables (even the 2500 amh), you will need to have the charger nearby and be prepared to take the two AAs out every minute or so. Even when using alkalines, the camera drains the power to quickly. I have also lost pictures in the camera due to losing power and having problems with the camera writing to memory.Stick to a camera that uses 4 AAs instead of two. Pass on the M305, I wish I had.The camera also crashes when you try to take subsequent photos.

The pictures are acceptable quality, and it's a handy size to tote around anywhere.Unfortunately, HP totally missed the quality-control boat on this one. My first one had a defective shutter. The replacement eats batteries, I don't get even an hour's use on lithium batteries.The bundled software isn't much to write home about either- it's not well-organized, and takes too many steps to do simple tasks like sort and delete batches of photos, and select photos for editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP IS SELLING GARBAGE","review":"I bought this camera as a gift for my father. His first digital camera. Just to make the story short:1. The batteries don't last more than 3 to 5 low quality pictures.2.

The camera won't work any different after you spent hours and additional money following the technician instructions.4. You can't return the camera after 30days, so you are stuck with a piece of garbage. (All HP M series are the same)5. The proposed solution is to upgrade to a better model (HP R707).

I had HP replace the camera only to have the same problem with the new camera right off the bat. As for the picture quality, I have no issue there. The pictures are decently clear.

The words for the children were challenging enough for them, but not overwhelming as was the adult version,(which I don't believe to be suitable for children due to people they may not know and some words that were questionable). We actually have both versions so sometimes we play the kids version with them only, and sometimes we use the adult version, but let the children use the taboo cards from the kids version. That works out well because they enjoy the buzzer from the adult version more than the skeaky toy in the kids version.

Austin has taken advantage of the current political climate to construct a tautly-written, first-rate adventure. This time around, Beauford's good deed, saving the lives of hundreds of innocent people, brings down the wrath of a vicious killer on both the detective himself and his loved ones. Now Beauford must struggle with his own personal demons and feelings of guilt in order to bring the villian to justice.Austin writes likes he directs, with carefully choreographed scenes, each designed to enhance the tension and drama of the moment. Definitely one of his best works."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Beauford Sloan. This is a page turner, until the last","review":"A good yarn populated with well-drawn characters.

Then I checked the publishing info and found it was written in Spain with photo credits from London, Milano, Paris....This is a European translation from the early 80's, don't make the mistake I did!I then randomly opened the book and ran a search on the mushroom on the page: Cortinarius Albovioceus My search led to a mushroom expert's site that said this mushroom is found in Scandinavia and no specimen to the expert's knowledge was ever been found in North America.But I should say that the book has great photos that could be used as a secondary verification of an identity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"I happen to love mushrooms and am very into identifying the ones that grow in my backyard.

Get it-it's a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Guide for North America","review":"I bought this book after someone showed it to me. After quickly looking at it and seeing the format I thought I would really like it, but I don't! I was surprised to open the book to the Pleurotus ostreatus and seeing it in the photo as a very dark brown mushroom. My four other field guides (and the only way I have seen it in the field) show it as a very pretty whitish mushroom like the one this book describes as the Pleurotus cornucopiae. I wonder were the descriptions mixed up or is this how they are in Italy where the book was first written and published. A very disappointing book! I should have read the copy right page and then I would have known that it was not a field guide for North America.

Serves as a \\"decent\\" but not \\"great\\" field guide.Don't expect to buy this, head into the woods, and start identifying mushrooms.

Not a very useful field guide for the southeast US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Particularly Helpful","review":"The book is slickly produced, with good photographs, and I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the information. But, I find it really hard to use. Mushrooms are organized by general type, but you still pretty much have to flip through tons of pages scanning for pictures that look close. Some of this is no doubt owing to our lack of knowledge, but... My wife and I have used this book to try to identify some of the hundreds of species of mushrooms growing on our property. So far, we've found two: the chanterelle and the morel, which we could have identified on our own without the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"stick to the 1960's version","review":"Stick to the older version of this book.

I loved the ideas of not living in a house and filling my bags with treasures. \\"We Were Tired of Living in a House\\" inspired most of my backyard adventures, especially the ones in my treehouse. This book delights me still and I am thrilled to find it back in print. I have looked for it for years, hoping that someday my own children would read this book and feel its magic. My old copy's spine broke and the pages fell out because I read it so much as a child. It spent the past 10 years in storage because of its delicate condition but I missed its simple and beautiful message.

But, I am SO GLAD I READ this book BEFORE I gave it to my little one. While it does show the little princess asking for her potty (a good message), it does not show encouragement or making the child feel better after her \\"accident\\". It has the poor child standing in a puddle, redfaced, emabrrassed, and with sad eyes. It shows the humiliation a child may feel if it doesn't get to the potty in time. And, may, make her afraid to go without the diaper for fear of not getting there in time. I was appalled. So much that I will not even donate this book or give it away. It is going into the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untapped talent from Seattle via Japan","review":"If you want something that's unique and powerful, purchase this. Aiko Shimada comes from Japan, but has made Seattle her home in the last few years. I came to her from a magazine clipping, which said she was \\"jazz with a Japanese voice\\". While there are some jazz stylings, her music is much more than that. If anyone remembers a band from the early 90's called Ether, this is what BLUE MARBLE sounds like. Relaxing, soothing music with an edge not found in today's popular music, which is good because I don't think the world is ready for someone as bright as Shimada. DJ Olive appears on this as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Tzadik record, but don't expect avantguarde","review":"It's a set of nice, very female, very personal songs. Usually, the japanese music series on Tzadik features artists, who want to break boundries, but Aiko Shimada doesn't want to break anything, she rather want's to build a gentle sound world of her own.

His vocals were over the top and his voice filled up the hall. The best way I can describe his sound would be that it was like hearing Howlin' Wolf backed by The Stooges. I raced out and bought everything he had in print. This disc contains many of the songs he played the night I saw him, and I REALLY wanted to like it, but after several listens I don't. Nathaniel Mayer's voice sounds shot on this disc, as opposed to the powerful delivery he possessed live. At times it's almost painful to listen to. Overall, the songs just seem to lack the energy of Mayer's live show. As an opening act on the night I saw him, Mayer literally stole the show and remains one of the most memorable performers I've ever seen in concert.

Through the use of personal experience and anecdote of herself and other women, Brem is able to apply the gifts given to women to the real world. From her journey, the reader is able to understand the ways in which women must apply themselves in order to succeed. I thought the book was very well written and conveyed a very important message. It emphasized certain characteristics of women that not many people focus on. Even though many of the attributes mentioned are obvious, the book does a good job of explaining how to utilize them. The fact that Brem relies on her personal experience is also very touching. Overall, the book was a good read and gave good advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge this one by its cover.","review":"Don't be fooled by the silly title or the droll cover of this book, for inside its pages is a real treat. There is a movie being made in the small town of Rosalie, MS and the owners of the three local bed and breakfasts are all vying to play host to the famous actress who will portray the starting role. As they each woo her in their own way over the course of one weekend, they are up agaist a band of conservative old bitties who form the \\"casserole patrol\\" to picket and protest against the film being made. In the end, each player gets their due and the Hollywood actress learns a thing a two about the way things really are in the South. This book pokes fun of the sterotypical Southern characters we often see and is all the more entertaining for it. I would recommend it as a quick and very light read to fans of Southern ficion."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to my intelligence","review":"I picked this up to read before heading to a B&B on vacation.I don't know what possessed this author to write this particular story, but it certainly wasn't any knowledge of the movie or hospitality industries.

You'd have to go a long way to find a heroine who is as spunky, yet refined as Charlotte Greenfield.

She'd a fabulous heroine, one I loved and cheered for from the first page to the last.Will Bondurant is her perfect match. Strong and sometimes taciturn, Will proves again and again that he is a hero worthy of the name. Watching Will and \\"Charlie\\" spar -- and make up -- is one of the most delightful things about this story. You just know that when you close the book that these two really are going to live happily ever after.With the feel of the west as strong as the smell of woodsmoke, this is a fast-paced and well written book.

In this one there was a \\"walk-through\\" (and a few tables) with little material about what was happening behind the scenes and what strategies there were to deal with it.

Like a B-grade SciFi movie and not a very good one at that. The author cannot seem to flesh out the characters and relies upon stereotypes for each one. His laughable attempt at making any of the female characters seem realistic falls flat totally. Honestly I don't see why anyone would give this story anything more than one star. This is supposed to be a first contact scenario with not one or two but multiple races but the humans just look at it as some pesky aliens that have to be dealt with instead. Sort of like how the main military jerk, I mean commander looks upon the Latino population there. The author loves to flag wave and Americanize everything. I guess just us Americans are going to populate the universe. Too many flaws to list them all but the story just leads to one amazingly bad ending after all the build up.

In a paperback you usually see **** and a paragraph break when switching characters and situations.

Tim Blake Nelson's shaggy dog caper spills them all on the dining room floor. He's clearly shooting for the humor, dread and sudden jolts of the Coen Brothers (right down to the extremely Carter Burwell-esque score), but like a fair number of the characters in this film, his aim is askew.

(spoiler alert)","review":"I'm sorry - - but I have to say that this was a painful movie to watch till the end.

I think, if so many reviewers weren't so bloody ignorant to GOOD music, there'd be more comparisons to Rush here. Musicaly it pales in comparison, but that vocal comparison you all have been searching for is Rush. It's crazy how much \\"man without skin\\" sounds like a Rush song. With shouting. And lack of intelegence. But hey, it's better than Adema."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell-outs","review":"Dude, man, I used to be a big fan of BoyHitsCar (henceforth referred to as Blue Oyster Cult (or BOC)) when they released The Day the Sun Went Out and After the Eulogy, which I thought were both great albums. Then they went and changed record labels from Victory to Wind-up, where they end up with bands like Creed (bleggh, Christian metal), Drowning Pool (yay!), and Finger Eleven (Chuck Chuck Chuck *and/or Chick Chick Chick or !!!*). That's not cool man. They sold out their indie roots for a buck. I give BOC one extra star because they remind me of the Nerve Agents. Yeah bro!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars","review":"2 stars, no more, no less. 2 stars because this stinks. 2 stars because it has some melody. 2 stars because I don't like music like this. 2 stars because the cd is only shouting."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste time or money","review":"I bought this album on the recommendation of The Pit magazine, which said that the album was brilliant, unique, innovative and that the vocals resembled those of System of a Down's. I was let down on all counts. the album is a repetive and dull pile of waste. The musicianship was mediocre, like many of their fellow nu-metal bands. The acoustic twelve string guitar that was supposed to be a significant element of the album was underemphasized and played unintelligently. Each song sounded the same, with Craig's obnoxious, whiny vocals unrelenting over the monotonous background noise of the same wimpy riffs. I tried to listen to it several times, but it was simply unbearable and I couldn't make it through. For anyone one considering buying this album I can't urge you enough not to do so. It is by far the worst album I have bought in along time. I only wish I could give it less stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD - when you give it a chance","review":"This is a very original & talented band!!I happened upon a bar in Albuquerque one night & these guys were playing a gig. I was impressed by them but thought they were upstaged by Simon Says. Nevertheless, I bought this CD at the show & wasn't too impressed the 1st couple of times I listened to it. Then, I REALLY listened to it & it started to grow on me - now I have listened to this CD probably close to a hundred times in the past 2 months. Another reviewer called it probably the best CD of 2001 - I gotta give that one to Coldplay, but this is a very close second place. The ten bucks for this CD is a bargain!

This really is a very good CD by a band who clearly has more to say than current bands out there, both musically and lyrically. Yeah, you get your standard rock rock fare of heavy guitars, drums, bass, and screaming, but listen a little closer. You'll soon find much more. 12 string acoustic guitar is played on every song on this CD, and it never sounds forced or contrived. Flutes and tabla add to the mix, and even the electric guitar shows a lot of Indian influence. Lyrics are good too - nice messages about finding who you really are and what matters most to you. It's a very emotional CD. My favorite tracks include The Rebirth, which is totally amazing, I'm a Cloud, Going to India, and Turning Inward."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEE THE LIVE SHOW","review":"i went to see a show and these guys happned to be on the Bill.

However, what I received is not what is pictured here, but rather a silver seal with a black monogram on it. Those seals are nice as well, but obviously aren't going to work on the gold embossed invitations. These are pretty cheap, and I figured it didn't make sense to spend the money on postage to return them, so I'll keep them and probably use them on another occasion.

The \\"tabs\\" that fit in the top of the table are versatile enough that I could clamp the 12\\" wide panels and then \\"rip\\" them length-wise with my circular saw for the first step in installing the flooring. For most of the project, I needed to use my miter (chop) saw and rather than set it on the floor, I put it on top of the project center and used clamps to hold it to the work top. It made a very stable base and kept me from having to kneel everytime I made a cut and made it easier to make sure I was cutting accurately. Having only used it briefly as a hand truck I can only say that it's a little wide, but would not trade the width of the worktop for a narrower hand truck. In short, couldn't be happier with this purchase; in my mind, paid for itself with just the one flooring project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"This item was very poorly made.

Mr. Balsekar's thought is not well enough developed to be placed in a book and presented to the public, especially at a cost. Mr. Balsekar spoke of not being a parrot of his guru, well being a parrot would have made a better book and perhaps helped lead him to the understanding that it is I that AM and it cannot be any other way. A rose is a rose - is a rose. Awareness is Awareness and it parrots itself through illusive expressions(Ramana, Maharshi,Me).

It fit perfectly, and my power step goes in and out smoothly and quietly. Actually, a little quieter than with the original motor!

My daughter thought one track was bit \\"scary\\", but she found the rest to be quite danceable. \\"Elements\\" is a great track, with a haunting voiceover. \\"The Staunton Lick,\\" which Amazon.com features as a free mp3 donload, is an example of the band at their finest - take a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uh Let's See I would say Interesting.....","review":"I bought this cd because of one song I heard on Radio Free Virgin. It's a very interesting cd. I would listen to this on like a long drive, during a hot bath, or if I was day dreaming. It gets your imagination going for sure and takes you off to another world.

It is now 5 stars. I agree with one of the other reviewers that I don't like \\"experiment 6\\", but maybe the duo likes to play with us a big (I suspect the sample for this tune is taken way out of context, they are humor boys).Their reliance on classic sounding English accents and a very well modulated English theme, happy go lucky silly British, is well done and extremly endearing. I think they have tapped into something, but I must say their cell-shading artwork is a bit too trendy and while I like the themes of the visual side of the album, I would rather they have used something a little less 'hip'.Thanks Lemon Jelly!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about some samples?","review":"Put some samples up there for us good little consumers to listen to.

Some great tracks and annoyingly catchy ones (\\"nice weather for ducks\\" for example). What Lemon Jelly do best is create an atmosphere. I feel this is overlooked when people criticise them for over using samples/ being to bland etc...I do however, feel this album falls short of the greatness of Lemonjelly.KY (the previous ep collection disc) with amazing songs such as \\"In The Bath\\" & \\"Page One\\". Worth buying if you're into happy down-beat atmospheric music."},{"rating":"2","title":"how to be original","review":"Yes, you could say lemon Jelly sound like the child of High Llamas and Kruder and Dorfmeister...but they are one of the few true originals on the music scene today.

Instead what I found was a tale of unrelenting torture. There is no 'submissive' in this story, only a 'victim'. There's no real discipline, because the young man isn't given any opportunity to behave properly. He's not being trained, he's just being hurt. There's never any indication that he enjoys what is happening to him in any way. There are some good descriptions of sexy women, and some hot scenes, but overall I found the story more disturbing than titilating. Think twice (or thrice) before buying this one. Sorry Titian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sirens","review":"Chantal has been jealous of her flirtatious sister, Aimee for a long time. But after being drawn to a statue of Lorelei at an art show by hearing a singing voice that no one else can hear, her life changes just like that. With the Lorelei in her possession, boys are drawn to her instead of her sister. But each boy meets a serious accident that is unexplainable. Chantal and her good friend Micah know that the statue has something to do with this. They go to the library to find all they can about the statue. They find out Lorelei is a Siren. A Siren is a mythical creature that has such beautiful voices that men went crazy and threw them-selves off cliffs over them. The Lorelei is using Chantal as a way to escape from the statue. Can they find out a way to break this spell before someone gets seriously hurt? Read this book to find out the bone-chilling ending of this fantasy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"By the Sword","review":"Great book about a girl who doesn't fit into the \\"proper\\" catagory and fights for a life that she does want. Lackey's books are always great...especially those about Valdamr and neighboring countries and cultures. A definite must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Misty Lackey's books","review":"I began reading Lackey's books with the first one out \\"Arrows of the Queen\\" and I loved it (I was about 14, probably the perfect age for that book). I have read all the rest as they came out. Generally I like them, but over the years I have grown impatient with the way her characters are almost always put-upon and almost always sort of emotionally fragile and sorry for themselves. Don't get me wrong, they are still good books! But I often wished the characters were a little more positive in outlook. I have grown to like this book best of all of the author's books - and that's saying a lot, because I like most of them a lot! And the reason I like this one best is because Kero is a character that has real inner strength and courage. Many of Lackey's characters could not function if they were not propped up by some Companion or other magical support. Kero stands on her own. A great character!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Standalone Read","review":"I enjoy some of Mercedes Lackey's books, and this is one of them.You don't have to have read others from the Arrows or Winds series to be able to read, enjoy and understand this one.I especially liked the main character, for her pluckiness and her unwillingness to quit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mercedes Lackey's \`Valdemar\` book series continued greatness","review":"Mercedes Lackey's \`Valdemar\` book series continues to meet and exceed my expectations. If you like medieval settings and/or seemingly ordinary people meeting extraordinary challenges this is a book for you.I would rate as a get and read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books Misty has writen!","review":"This is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read! I've been reading Misty Lackey since I was 8 or so and I have loved all of her Valdemar books! Kero is a lovable and very real character. I absolutely love the song \\"Kerowyn's Ride\\" which I have on a CD from Firebirdarts.com! Everything by Misty is really great, but this one is a marvel. I like it since it focus on people outside of Valdemar and the main character isn't a herald, which can get somewhat boring. Buy this book and you won't be disappointed, and pick up a copy of the song \\"Kerowyn's Ride\\" too. Both are great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Misty's best","review":"Of all of M. Lackey's Velgarth books, I do consider this one at the top of the list. It's the ONLY one of her books that I have definately re-read at least 20 times. Yes, 20 times or more. My current copy is falling apart, and that's some feat considering how carefully I treat my books.I rank this book over all the other books in the series--yes--even above the beginning trilogy. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a strong woman in a fantasy setting. Heck, the Arrow's trilogy was what got me hooked on fantasy as the young age of 12 or 13. Buy this book. It's not going to dissapoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"This book continues where the Vows and Honor books leave off. Kerowyn is Tarma and Kethry's granddaughter and true Heir. This is a truly satisfying book. It ties the previous books in with the modern Valdemar books and begins the new era of books concerning the heir of Valdemar. I really enjoyed the merging of the two storylines. The story was exciting and moved well. Once I started it I didn't want to stop. If you enjoy books by Anne McCaffrey,and Elizabeth Moon you'll love Mercedes Lackey."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I got this book a bit back but ever since then I have been rereading it. It is simply one of Misty's great books. Kero (or Kerowyn) is a strong female who can take care of herself. Thank you for that. She always stands up for what she believes in and doesn't let mn push her around or take advantage of her just because she is a woman. And even though she isn't exactly feminine, she still wants love. Or at least with Eldan. This book was a great one. I would recomend that you read it when you get a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ABSOLUTLEY LOVED THIS ENCHANTING BOOK!","review":"The plot and the characters were excellantly portrayed!I cried when Kero had(I hardly ever cry about things I know are fictional)to make an abrupt departure from Eldan. I bought this book a while ago but reread it often and I advise you do the same thing too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kero is a wonderful person.","review":"I just wanted to say that if you are a Valdemar fan, and you don't read this book, you'll never understand the Mage Winds Trilogy as well as you should. If you are new to the series, start with Arrows of the Queen, but definitely read By the Sword. I loved how the Companions kept staring at Kero. :) Read this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book. I loved it in paper, and I love it for Kindle.","review":"But as with so many of the books I am buying over again in Kindle format, it unfortunately does have some formatting flaws: the italics don't always come out the way they were in the paper edition, which is really irritating in a Lackey book, since she uses it to signify Mindspeech (telepathy) as well as the more usual usage for emphasis, and more annoying still, the program that converted it to Kindle format has a nasty tendency to read Tarma's mindmate the kyree's name as \\"Ward\\" rather than \\"Warrl\\". Worst of all, it doesn't even do it consistently, so I can't get used to it! I can only imagine how confusing that must be for someone reading it in the Kindle edition for the first time.But it is still the story of Captain Kero and I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-Rate Masterpiece","review":"By the Sword is a complex, yet amazing tale.It tells the tale of Kerowyn, a lady raised by a father that turns into a mercenary. By the Sword tells you exactly what Kerowyn is seeing, not always the most pleasant things, somwhow wihtout makeing it to grusome while still givng appropriate details.This happened to be the first Lackey book I read, and the plot, charaters, and overall story led me to read more of her books. It was interesting to know Kero's point of veiw, then going back and finding out how other characters fed nto the stoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"First read of Mercedes Lackey's works","review":"This was the first book I read of Mercede Lackey's books. I've since read all of them. Her stories are very involved and creative. They suck you in and won't let you stop till the book is consumed. I loved the way fate forced the heroin's hand to break away from her confined life and grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"This was the first of Misty's books that I read (and have since read pretty much EVERYTHING that she has put out), and this one is still my favorite. Kero is a compelling character, witty and caustic. It is a joy to watch her grow, feel for her in her gains and losses, and experience love with her.Misty's characters and descriptions are always vivid, to the point where her food descriptions leave you hungry, and you want to slap the petulent characters!This is an excellent book. I wish that it was available in hardback, as my paperback copy is getting dangerously close to destruction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Valdemar novel","review":"Fans of Tarma and Kethry will enjoy this. (I have not been able to 'get into' their stories.) It is an enjoyable read. I was engrossed in it, but at the same time, I didn't like it as much as the Herald-Mage trilogy.It is definitely worth reading for any Misty fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most entertaining and inspiring book I've ever read!","review":"Kerowyn is an unbelieveable woman, she inspired me to be all I can be, and that I am \\"destined for greatness\\" (Warrl) I wish I could live her life within my own. She is courageous, honest, loyal, trustworthy, etc. She is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorite of Lackey's.","review":"Seriously probably the best book in the entire series of books on Valdemar.

Loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dismal attempt to make fantasy more \\"correct. . . \\"","review":"It is fairly well written. . . but suffers from the syndrome inflicting modern fantasy that makes them look for a politically correct \\"lesson\\" to teach us all. If you like to be hectored by a writer, then by all means buy this book. If you think women could survive in a sword fighting culture as warriors for very long, then by all means get this book. Otherwise, reread \\"Lord of the Rings.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Impressed","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author, and I really enjoyed it. It does take a while to get into, but once I was in I could not put it down. The characters were well drawn and the plot was well paced and intresting. This is pretty standard fantasy, and yet Lackey made it enjoyable and great fun to read, and I hope to read more of her books in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watt Pottery","review":"A Wonderful Book that's packed full of Photos of this Lovely Pottery, as well as the History behind this Sweet Pottery! A Must Have if you collect Or Deal in Watt Pottery!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, an excellent album","review":"Singer Todd's vocal style references Kurt Cobain, but the music is more complex than Nirvana. It features moody, droning guitars and keyboards, often erupting into powerful choruses, and relies on Todd's ear for heart-wrenching melody. At times, the songs steer toward the style of the Flaming Lips' \\"Soft Bulletin\\": they frequently utilize effects on vocals and guitars to create a very unique mood, one that remains consistent and penetrates the listener's atmosphere throughout the entire record. From start to finish, \\"We're Sleeping Better Now\\" is an excellent album, one that you'll want to listen to repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monsoon","review":"I had to tie it down in addition to the Velcro because of the monsoon rains and winds here in the desert.The winds here can blow off the best of covers.

Battle scenes were OK, but the direction wasn't tight and the film sorely needed a good editor. A decent effort, but in addition to some of the dialogue not being able to be heard (as noted in another review) there were also scenes that went too long and honestly the \\"900\\" only went into action the last 30 minutes or so of the movie.

This book replaces Goraksha's book, the same yogi who brought us Hatha Yoga. Goraksha's writings were destroyed, and this book brings the occult topics back to light here in the west. The book emphasizes the path of the heart. I have tried the kundalini path, which I found to be too dangerous. Since the soul resides in the heart, the heart path places the soul in command. The soul can open a center, such as the third eye to peer into the future, or to open another chakra to help you with what you may be doing.

I personally enjoyed the film for its story, plot, art design, action set pieces, and of course it use of martial arts. I can not say a whole lot without spoiling it, but all in all this is a great film to watch with others or by yourself for nostalgic reasons. If I have any complaints it is just I wished Shaw Brothers continued on to make more of these B-movie classics or at least got a chance to created a television inspired by all their old products.

The index doesn't match the pages where the content is.

I do agree with the reviewer who wrote in saying that Hyatts and Yronwodes works are far better when one is looking for hoodoo, where this book falls short, however if you are looking for a collection of information, not hoodoo specific, then this is probably a good book for you, unfortuenantly I didnt find it necessary to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah Right.","review":"Sorry Ms Bird, this is just as bad as your first \\"book\\".

I am by no means a fan of these sappy romantic comedies, however I do sometimes go out of my comfort zone for a movie that has a great cast. Bruce Willis is easily one of my favorite actors and having seen almost everything he's done, I rented this. What can I say? It's the story about meeting your soul mate, getting married, and the ups & downs associated with family life. There are no surprises and there is nothing special here.

Unlike the 'pik, its more compact and less cluttersome, which means you might actually use the thing. Good for small apts like mine. I like the fact that it stores in itself, making it a great travel item too.You do have to fill it a couple of times to get thorough. I typicall fill it 3 to 4 times to ensure I work around each tooth. The pressure isn't too strong, but that's a good thing. You can actually damage your gums if the pressure is too strong.

Where that is impossible, such as a digital camera, go with a camera with a custom polymer battery. Since the product won't work without it they have to make it somewhat decent.

And with the spaces like that, there are lots of places for food to hide. With the Oral Irrigator, its a breeze to clean up between the teeth.

His other complaint is that it requires at least 5-6 refills of water or mouthwash to do a thorough job of cleaning his teeth.

Big tip: although unit works well with ordinary alkaline batteries (2 AA cells) invest a few dollars in rechargeable NiMH cells as used in digital cameras; they power the irrigator for a long time with top performance and can be easily recharged.

This book presents an excellent overview of ancient writers and key figures in church history who have defended the view that all men (or all intelligent creatures) will ultimately be saved, healed and reconciled with God. Although the period ranging from AD 100 to AD 550 is the main subject of the book, AD 550 to AD 1500 is discussed in an Appendix. In passing, Dr.Ballou shows that many opinions defended in (Ultra)-Dispensationalism were already propagated in mediaeval times (e.g., the view that water baptism and all other rites and ceremonies should have ceased after Messiah died on the cross and was raised from the dead).

Well, things for dating are about to change as geologists take on board \\"catastrophic\\" events. One such \\"catastrophic\\" event is the Mount St Helens explosion which occurerd in the 80's. Geologists have now been able to carefully document the changes that occured with the eruption of Mount St Helens. What they found will fundamentally change the way we look at geological dating. In this book on the events following the eruption of Mount St Helens, the authors carefully show how a catastrophic event can cause sedimentation and erosion previously only assumed as possible over very long time periods.

I'm sorry but we must be listening to different records. Stokes is the preeminent baritone of our generation... and if you can listen to him without getting goosebumps, then you must be dead.This album is a delight.. for those of us who are longtime fans of his Broadway work, it gives us a bit of that but also shows us how much more he can do and how versatile he is. It's beautifully produced and a treasure. I would highly recommend it to anyone with discerning musical tastes who will appreciate one of the most gorgeous voices of our time interpreting showtunes, standards, jazz, and pop. I only hope he puts out more of the same... and SOON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"such a pleasure!","review":"Thank you Mr. Mitchell for this gift of an album.

I listened to it for the first time wondering if he had channeled Barbra Streisand for the recording, since many of the songs are also on her 2 Broadway albums. I don't think she chose the absolute quintessential broadway tunes for her opera but she chose good ones for her voice. Stokes could have chosen so many other songs that would have been not just good, but GREAT for his voice. Having said that, I'm still giving the album 4 stars because I did enjoy many of the arrangements. The A-Train medley is especially enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"cd overproduced, voice underproducing","review":"I absolutely love Mr.Mitchell's voicein it's full, rich, vibrant force; sadly, I did not get to experience it on this cd. I am sure I was one of many many fans who eagerly awaited his first cd. It is so sad he decided to try to corral his beautiful voice to become a lounge-jazz singer and whisper his way through most of this effort. Most singers today HAVE to whisper through their songs, as they have no real power. How ironic, Mr. Mitchell Elects to to do this!! He should have let someone else produce this cd and really let his voice shine. Further, as is true of so many performers today, he has chosen to Over Embelish this cd with so much Nonsense background sound. This cd is ridiculously over produced. His voice is ALL that is necessary. I hope he makes another cd soon giving us what we hoped for in this one.

On first hearing, some of the negative comments made sense. However, this is a CD that is well worth multiple listenings--it does grow on you! His takes on Losing My Mind and Being Live stay in your head--these are different Sondheim but thoughtful and meaningful interpretations. How Glory Goes is a brilliant song very well sung here. Another Hundred People and Take the 'A' Train work so well together and make sense. And there are more songs worth hearing as you gain insight into the songs and his singing. It is a brave and inventive CD--and kudos to Stokes for showing us more sides of his marvelous voice and personality.

We were blown away by the immense power of his voice, and the rich baritone with which he sang songs like \\"This Nearly Was Mine\\" (a standout performance). I purchased his eponymous CD for more of the same, and was disappointed that there he sings in a tenor voice. It is still a good voice, and with interesting arrangements of the songs, but that deep baritone was so impressive, I hope that he will try another CD using that voice!There are very few really good baritones, but many good tenors.

But for those of us who favor the Broadway stylings we've come to appreciate from this great artist this first solo album that we've waited so long for is the ultimate disappointment.

The first arrangement of Something's Coming is very nice indeed but the CD goes downhill fast. I wanted to hear the Stokes I've enjoyed in so many stage shows and concerts with that rich baritone voice that is so rare nowadays. Instead what I got was a lackluster track listing and I don't think he goes below middle C in the whole album. The medley of Take the A Train/Another Hundred People is nice and Being Alive finally gets pretty good halfway through. But all this breathy, panting, gasping soul singer/Motown style proves to be annoying because, and I'll state this simply: YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE THE SINGER!!!

The up tempo arrangements do nothing to showcase Mitchell's excellent voice. He comes across very shallow and flat. A second-rate Mel Torme or Bobby Short.

His singing in Kiss Me Kate is unbelievably gorgeous, with his lustrous baritone nuancing every phrase and word. The singer on this CD is hardly recognizable as the same singer. The timbre of the voice is not the same, Mr. Mitchell is trying to sound like a lounge singer, not the magnificent Broadway star he is.I hope he does another album, the next time bringing to life great Broadway songs in the style of his Kiss Me Kate and Man Of La Mancha performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"It took me a few \\"listen to\\" sessions!","review":"I, too, didn't know of, or had heard Brian Stokes Mitchell, until the PBS \\"South Pacific\\" program.

The arrangements are awful... some of the song choices are uninspired, and Stokes is so determined to make each of these songs \\"his own\\" that I found myself repeating \\"just sing the damn song\\" repeatedly as I skipped through the CD.I fell in love with Stoke's voice in Ragtime, and even traveled from LA to DC to see him do Sweeney Todd.. .so I was pre-disposed to like this CD. Instead, I found it to be one of the most disappointing cds I've ever purchased.It's hard to believe, but Stokes doesn't seem to trust or understand his magnificent baritone, and really seems to need the guidance of a Director (or in the case of a CD, a Producer) to reassure him and guide him away from career-damaging projects like this self-indulgent CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Where is that powerful voice that I heard in South Pacific?

In my opinion this book will stand out to be one of the most important books of and about the romance genre. There has never been a book like this before. It represents a large stride forward in its contents and in what it represents to us as readers and aspiring writers (as I am). There are so many nuances and angles of intrepretation that I have no doubt people will be discussing and referring to this book for years. It is an instant classic-not just on personal judgement but for the entire genre. I thank her for writing it from the bottom of my heart. She has created the first paving stone and opened a new path for new writers like me to follow.

You are inmersed in the ideosyncracies of the people of Forus and in the deliciously sensual relationship between Green and Jorlan while they cope with their mystical connection to their planet and with universal issues as love, the search for equality, and trust. It has a refreshingly new and at the same time, enchantingly old and eternal feeling about it. I gave it 4 1/2 stars because of it slow begginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Dara Joy Book Ever","review":"...This book is the worse Joy has ever produced. The science and social stucture are cumbersome to describe and Joy's description of them lack imagination.She produced a society of women have developed very sexist and elitist atitudes. What a disappointment, I was hoping that the women would be more gentle leaders. Also her terms describing the various titles was confusing. She should have just stuck to the feminine version of a title e.g., \\"duchess\\" and labeled the male as \\"ducal consort\\" or something simple. She calls Claudine a \\"she-Count\\" and refers to another Top Slice member as an \\"Earlene\\". To my knowledge, both count and earl are equal titles. Call me a nit-picker but the title usage did bother me somewhat. Hopefully her next book will be an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, very, very bad","review":"This is the first book I've read by Dara Joy and it will most likely be the last. I read up to page 20 then skimmed the rest. I liked the concept of a women dominated society but this book is absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Role reversal rubbush!","review":"The story is a basic historical romance with the roles reversed - The man is the young, (in his 20s) unmarried, spirited character, and the woman is a sophisticated \\"marquelle\\" (get it?)in her mid-30s. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me. Men and women are not interchangeable when it comes to roles, however inequitable they are. I could deal with the females being the actual power and brains of the society, if the men had to defer to them because of some perceived weakness in their macho natures. To have them actually submissive and somewhat maidenly killed any sex appeal as far as I was concerned. There is the typical ballroom scene where the heroine, Green, sees the hero, Jorlan, and remembers him as a young spirited boy and decides he's grown up to be sexually interesting. I just couldn't buy into these two people. I gave the book back to the library, happy I didn't pay for it. Save yourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh my god this was painful","review":"Wooden dialogue, pallid descriptions and characters that would need an air pump to become even one-dimensional.If the author had made that idiot Jorlan the secret villain and gotten Green Tamryn together with her \`arch rival' Claudine(who makes a last minute rescue to save Green from the demented psychopathic Jorlan), that might have made a story.Unfortunately the author's apparent homophobia (or lack of ability) prevented that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything I expected. And that's bad.","review":"Unoriginal characters, rubbish dialogue and freakishly stupid 'descriptive' paragraphs. In some places, the gender roles are just reversed completely with no thought of logic. In other places, they aren't reversed far enough for logical thought.I consider this story to be Dara Joy's fantasies of controlling men, cunningly hidden behind a smokescreen of a struggle for equality. I mean, what other explanation is there for a story where the male protagonist is forced to all but swallow his own juices? By his new WIFE, no less!Either that, or it's one of those cunningly hidden feminist dogma things. By being billed as a reversal of the battle of the sexes, it's implanting into the minds of the readers that whatever men suffer in the book, women suffer in real life.Thus, more people are conditioned into railing against what women 'suffer'.Either way, this book belongs in the bin. Even as a parody, it doesn't even work right."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Dissapointment","review":"What a let down this new Dara Joy book is. I have read and loved all her other novels to date but could barely get through this one. I think that it was her whole idea that the woman would dominate the men sexually and in every other way. Missing are the strong male characters that we are used to from her. These main characters are what made her earlier books so appealing. I do hope that Dara Joy returns to her old style of writing soon as I have always considered her books as some of my very favorite romances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joy Less","review":"I have been a big fan of Dara Joy and have read all of her books. This book was a HUGE disappointment. I realized when I was half way through the book that it was actually getting me mad. If women ruled the world, I think we could do a better job of it then coming off as crass, rude, obnoxious, bitchy women. The men in the book were boring and wimpy. I'm not sure who should be more insulted over this book, men or women. It does not portray either gender in a positive light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's hope this isn't a trend.","review":"I bought this book because I love Dara Joy's writing and was very excited to see that she had a new one out. This was a horrible disappointment. It's a complete role reversal between male and female roles and comes across as ridiculous. If a man had done the things the heroine did in this book to the hero women readers would be crying foul. I hope this is not a sign of a new trend of stories.I would love to see Dara continue with the Matrix series as well as her High Energy and High Intensity series. Anything at all except for another one of these. I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their money on this book, try the library first."},{"rating":"2","title":"different but intriguing","review":"Dara Joy has really written a different type of romance. The heroine is 34 and the hero is 24(and a virgin),in a world where the woman rule. A flipflop from the usual romances. I read the book straight through and enjoyed it like I have all her other books. The only reason I rated it a 4 instead of 5 is Dara used so many made up words, expressions, ect, that it detracted from the story. In fact she needed a glossary for them all. When she finally stopped peppering every page with them and got down to the story it was great. I'm hoping she writes some more on this world as she introduced a couple of characters that deserve their own stories and if so I'll buy those as well"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me feeling icky","review":"I've only mildly enjoyed most of Ms Joy's previous novels except for \\"Mine To Take\\" which I loved (easily 5 out of 5), but this story kind of grossed me out. The fantasy world is kind of a Regency with male-female role reversal...the women are 'rakes' and the men should be virgins. But while I read the story, I couldn't help feeling it was like a 35 year old woman sleeping with an 17 year old boy. It kind of grossed me out. I can't remember what their actual ages were, but this is how it was reading to me. Don't get me wrong, it icks me out when its the other way as well...I don't like reading about guys in their 30s & 40s sleeping with teenage girls either. I couldn't get beyond that impression so I couldn't like the book. To each their own. Some people seem to have loved the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"how can i get to this wonderful world?","review":"Of all the books by this author that I've read, there is only one I didn't like. This newest title is one of the ones I loved. I literally couldn't put it down. Dara Joy has a way of making made up worlds seem so real and so, well, \\"yummy\\" for lack of a better word. Jorlan is absolutely wonderful and I love the surprise at the end. Just when I thought I knew what all was going on. My only \\"burning\\" question is: When will Dara Joy write the sequel to \\"Mine to Take\\" already. I've waited long enough. Come on Ms. Joy, I can only read Knight of a Trillion Stars, Rejar, and Mine to Take so many times before I just get tired of waiting for the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to love Dara Joy","review":"Will this book all senses are enriched and enticed. This is a must have and must read book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mis-step or a glimpse into the future?","review":"To begin, I enjoy the Matrix of Destiny series, and hope Dara Joy's problems with her publisher are resolved soon ... I want to read the rest of the series.But as to Ritual of Proof, I spent the entire reading experience waiting for the story to improve. However, it started out poorly and ended that way. I found it tedious, boring, and lacking imagination.She sets the book up as if it is a beginning to a series, but doesn't leave me wanting more.Following MOD, perhaps I expected too much. Would I have been as disappointed had another author written it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it.","review":"I am suprised at the negative reviews of this book. This was the first Dara Joy book i ever picked up and i loved it, I have defentaly read books by her that were far worse. I thought this book was unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell Flat","review":"I love Dara Joy, but ROP fell flat. Ms. Joy is capable of much better writing than this. I felt the book was rushed and very shallow. Hopefully, her next offering will return to her usual fantastic style."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you prefer alpha males do not bother","review":"I did not enjoy this book as I truly prefer alpha males. Even though the man in this book is trying to become more dominant there just wasn't enough testosterone in this book for me. I much prefer Dara Joy's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile . . .so utterly vile . . .","review":"Do I have to give it even one star? Where do I start with how bad this book was? Okay, first the weird language was definitely offputting, the characters were stereotypes, and instead of any kind of feminist vision, in creating her role reversal the author relied on the same old formulaic gender cliches that oppress everyone.Do not waste your time. Life is too short to read bad books. If you are new to Dara Joy, read the Matrix books instead--they are great fun and much more representative of the author's skills. I can't claim that they offer any kind of feminist world view, but then neither does Ritual of Proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only Dara Joy I haven't liked...","review":"This book was very disappointing! I had read so many gushing reviews that I almost bought this in hardback, but lucked into a library copy first (Thank God!) While the plot is wonderfully original, I could not make myself care about the characters. I disliked Green from the get-go: I know, she is supposed to be dominant, but she came across as too hard and unfeeling to me. And I found myself rooting for Jorlan to fight harder against the system, which I understand he really couldn't do but that didn't stop me from wishing he would. The futuristic vocabulary was way overdone and was a huge distraction. I'm going to try to forget that Ms. Joy ever wrote this book, and that I ever read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup Of Tea","review":"I have read several of Dara Joy's books (Tonight or Never, High Energy, High Intensity) and have always found them fun to read and very entertaining. I must admit that I am really not a sci-fi fan and this was my first foray into this genre and I only did that due to the name of the author on the cover. I loved the concept of the role reversal in this book but just was not able to let myself go and enjoy.If you love sci-fi fantasy then this is probably just the book for you. If you are not a huge fan of this genre pick up something else from this author. She is very talented and worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"I was really disappointed. For all of you who thought MOD, or even the \\"High\\" series, this comes nowhere near. The characters are flat. The story line had a lot of potential, but its one disjointed paragraph after the next. I am really looking forward to the next MOD book, but I hope that the writing improves substantially before that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish the book","review":"This book was a huge disappointment! All in all, it was just too boring to bother finishing. The characters didn't interest me at all, and the story line was entirely too predictable after a few pages. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Ridiculous","review":"I truly cannot think of a single redeeming quality of this story.Wait. No. I can think of one.By swapping the genders in the story, it highlights some of the least savory aspects of out of date 'bodice rippers'. It highlights just how repellent and sexist those stories were.Unfortunately, that leaves this story as being repellent in its own right.The characters are absurd and can be described by recalling every bad cliche in *bad* historical romances -- only in reverse! And, while the premise of the role reversal held the promise of a lot of fun, the reverse sexism turns out to be as unsavory as misogyny.It's the last Dara Joy I'll ever buy. It's just that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this one a skip !","review":"I normally look forward to Dara Joy's books. The characters and location are usually fantastic, BUT, what happened here? This story was just too much for me. Ms. Joy swings from women being totally in charge (read domininering) and the men as total wimps. Oh, except for this one - who later has to be so gifted as to make the story even more unbelievable. I should have stopped in the first few chapters, but bravely made it through the whole thing. Next time I'll stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even worth it","review":"This is one of the worst romance books I have ever read. I could barely get through the first couple chapters because the whole premise is so ridiculous, don't get me wrong I always love a strong and powerful female character but this book was so stupid that I want to call up the publisher and ask for my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Role Reversal Romance? Too Extreme","review":"I have been a great fan of Dara Joy and was eagerly awaiting the release of Ritual of Proof. What a disappointment! I was kind of hoping she would continue her previous series with Traed as the hero. I love her futuristic and/or paranormal stories. Ritual Of Proof is a backwards romance with very strong woman. OK, I dont have a problem with strong heriones. Making men the weaker sex does have some appeal, but it was too extreme. Making the men prove they are virgins! Kind of a backwards victorian historical. I really believe woman are the stronger sex mentally and emotionally, but physically, not really.True romance readers want strong heriones but even stronger heros. Atleast I do. Don't be discouraged by reading her other books. ie Knight of a Trillion Stars, Rejar, and others. They were great reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried very hard to finish this book...","review":"alas, I could not. I adored Dara Joy's \\"Matrix of Destiny\\" series and was looking forward to \\"Ritual of Proof\\". However, I will have to agree with most of the reviews stated here. Not worth reading. I read many, many romances (as well as other genres) and often find good things to say about even the most horrid of books. That is not the case here. The main characters were flat and uninteresting. The entire idea of the male being 'breached' in a painful ritual just did nothing for me. I really tried to finish this book, but just couldn't. I won't recap the plot here, as many reviewers already have. I just felt so strongly about NOT liking this book, I had to put in my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"The publisher had a hand in this one","review":"This book is obviously not a true Dara Joy book. From it's poor character development to the sketchy history, it's easy to tell the publisher had a hand in this one. It is not written with Dara's typical wit and attention to detail. Everything in this piece is a failure when compared to her other works. Compared to the average author, it rates slightly higher but I've come to expect a certain standard from Dara and this one falls far short, especially for hard cover. Shame on this publisher. Go away and let the authors write without hinderance so we can enjoy what they write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Weird","review":"Somehow, it went way beyond role reversal too the point of being a little too weird.Yes, women can definitley be financially and mentally superior to men, but not always physically and that is where it made me feel little uncomfortable.How can men lay around and not get fat and potbellied?Where's the men's movement? Even during the regular Regency period, there were groups of women always fighting for equal rights. Why not the men?To have only Jorlan thinking along those lines and prohibited to even speak along those line is going a bit to the extreme.I miss the light-hearted and sometimes raucous humor of Knight of a Trillion Stars and Rejar.Where's Triad's story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing","review":"I waited and waited for this book to be released and was highly disappointed. I have all of Dara Joys book and have often re-read them when i am alone at night. I was hoping this would have the same effect, I was wrong. After the first two chapters i was totally bored but felt I owed it to the author to finish it. never again will I spend the money on a hard cover with her name on it. Dara should stick with what she is good at and continue the story with Tread. In Ritual of Proof, the concept could have worked it the characters had more personality. Green was a cardboard copy of a tough guy that lacked the feelings needed to break though her mates insecurities. There was no climax that should have joined these two souls together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another devotee","review":"I absolutely adored this book -- reading it all in one sitting. I want more, more, more!!! This new world she created was very intriguing and not at all what I expected. I want to learn more about this society and watch GReen and Jorlan transform it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible Disappointment","review":"Dara Joy is one of my favorite authors and when I purchased this book it was with the hope that it would be as good as the MOD series. After two chapters I knew it wasn't, but continued reading. The charaters are not likeable and the story plot is not complete. There are to many unanswered questions in the story. Dara has tried to help the reader by giving us a glossary of terms (210 on 8 pages approximately) that left me feeling as though I had to keep leaving the story to refer to the glossary for definitions. I would rather a complete uninterrupted story. I hope that there is a second book to at least explain the first one, but I would rather have another Matrix of Destiny or Tyber and Zanita. Forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate disappointment","review":"I enjoy Dara Joy's writing but this book was a disappointment. This is the first book of hers that read slow for me and while this book was touted as a highly original turn-about of the gender roles, I have read this theme in many other books. (Marilyn Campbell comes to mind.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the intelligence","review":"Where to start... I felt personally offended and affronted by this book. The plot, while hailed by some as terribly inventive and clever was dull, trite, and not the least bit compelling. The 'role reversal' of the sexes was done in such a way I often wondered if it was written by a five year-old. Books like this are the reason women are still oppressed in half the world. Please, God, do not waste your money on this frivilous romp of fantasty garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Role Reversal Romance?

I loved all her books and couldn't wait for her new one. After reading 'Ritual of Proof',I was not disapointed.How refreshing is a story where the male/female roles are different than the norm.I was glad ,though,when Jorlan finally stood up to Green.Women do like a take charge man.The romance sizzles. This is certainly a no-loaner book. Can't wait for Rivers' story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read this year","review":"I don't know how she managed to write such a complex story but then that's Dara Joy. If you are a fan of hers or have ever read any of her books you know what I mean. She can take the impossible and draw you right into it. This story seems impossible to start, by the third page you have completely bought the it hook line and sinker. It's a wonderful book. I reccomend it very highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ritual of Proof","review":"I was really disappointed with the book. The characters were not fully developed, and the story was flat. There was nothing new done in terms of characterazion she just treated the female characters like they were men and the men like they were women. I almost did not finish this book, and I normally will read her books in one day. It was not up to par in reference to her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Where do I begin! This book was so bad I could barely finish it. I read each of the Matrix of Destiny books on pins and needles. I love them so much I own two copies of each, yet this book was something else entirely. Unfortunately I can't state it quite the way I would like to because I doubt if Amazon[.com] would post my comments then. The characters were flat and uninspiring, especially the main characters. The concept of the story is interesting, but I find it hard to feel any sexual tension with a male character who is completely dominated by women. I mean lets keep it real here. We read romance novels for the men. If there aren't hot then the story isn't going to work. Jorlan was cute, but he seemed more like a boy then a man and I simply do not get off on boys. I give this book one star because as a few have suggested there seems to be a veiled reference to the Matrix of Destiny series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Parody of Romance","review":"I was more than disappointed with this book. I have come to expect only the highest quality story from Dara Joy but this book seems to have been written to meet a deadline. The characters were poorly developed. The whole \\"women rule the world\\" premise came off as a parody and all the other-world slang was distracting. If I did not know any better I would think this was someone's first novel and certainly not worthy of being a hard back. Don't bother to buy it. If you have to read it, check it out from your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after all the hype...","review":"I loved the premise of this book but the actual book did not stand up to all it's pre-release hype. I was disappointed that the story was not fully developed and seemed to be rushed. The vocabulary that was invented was distracting as everytime I came across a new term (and there were lots of them) I had to go to the back of the book and look it up, it would have been easier to just use the standard lingo. I just wish there had been more \\"meat\\" to this story. If you must read it then wait for it in paperback, buy it used or borrow it from the library. It wasn't worthy of being HB in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid!!","review":"I cannot believe that I wasted money on this book.It is poorly written and incredibly stupid.If you feel you must read it, just check it out of the Library.Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unforgiveable","review":"After the captivating success of \\"Rejar\\" and \\"Mine To Take\\", this book was a real let-down. I have no problems letting my imagination run wild (read Mine to Take, and you'll see what I mean), but this is ridiculous!A man whose first introduction to sex is painful because of the \\"breaching\\" - his! A woman who owns the man, and a planet ruled by women where men are subservient and play the traditional role of the women. That is going too far. Call me old-fashioned, but I hate it when the man is weak, and the woman \\"breaches\\" the man, not the other way around. And to top it off, they have to go to a court-type trial to prove that the man was a untouched when she first breached him, or there would be a scandal!I expected better from Dara Joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointed Fan!!","review":"I am a huge fan of Dara Joy. I cannot put into words my disappointment with this book. The concept of a female dominant society was very interesting. Unfortunately, this story was ridiculous. The portrayal of men in this book left a LOT to be desired. I could not think of them as men. Which, I guess, was the purpose of this book;they were definitely a new breed of men. There was nothing appealing about the characters. In addition, the futuristic terminology used was hideous. In one sentence, you have the everyday word \\"sheets\\". In another you have the word \\"tasteslikerooster\\"???? I wish I had checked this out of the library instead of buying it based upon Ms. Joy's reputation.

As an American woman that lived and worked in Japan at the same time that she was there, I found her generalities and the stereotypes she portrayed very offensive. When you visit another country or culture you should be open to the fact that not everything will be done the way that you are used to. It doesn't mean that it is wrong, it is just different. The three years I spent in a small town near Hiroshima hold some of the fondest memories of my life. I did not go there with an us or them attitude which seems to have been the case with Ms. Backer. Yes, she does hit some cultural issues dead on, but she also seems to carry a bitterness about her time there. I am very distressed to read that many people believe that they now \\"know\\" Japan based on what she has written. I personally got some very unsettling feelings about Ms. Backer based on what she wrote. And, by the way, she misuses many Japanese terms in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double priced kindle book??","review":"I've been wanting to read this book (it's been on my wishlist for over a year), but how can the Kindle price be double that of the print price.

I feel this may be part due to the publisher of the title who publishes many other introductory books on various other topics for undergraduate usage. Whilst saying this, this book some may find ideal for high school graduates heading into higher education to complete a business degree for the first time and want to know what leadership is.Overall a good introduction to leadership, but for those who are looking for a more serious book on the topic, prehaps \\"The Leadership Challenge\\" by Kouzes & Posner will be found useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much common sense","review":"This book is a joke. It is written by a guy who has followed Colin Powell around and has taken a lot of notes on what he has said. He then put together a bunch of Powell's stories and comments into this book. The \\"secrets\\" are not secrets at all. They are common sense to most people. After the first couple of chapters I realized that I was wasting my time trying to read each word and just went to the summaries at the end of each chapter. It's all summed up there. Powell did not contribute to this book, he was merely a speaker who fed the author enough information to pull this book together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average book","review":"This is an average book at best.

Harari fleshes out many of Powell's ideas and gives memorable examples of what he believes Powell means when he says, for example, that \\"being responsible sometimes means pissing people off.\\" This book is a tribute to Powell and can at times come across as interpreting the teachings of the Messiah, but since Powell is one of the few leaders in today's world that is virtually universally respected, this is forgivable. The Leadership Secrets of Colin Powell is a valuable addition to any leadership library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting design but. . . .","review":"We purchased the Constellation because we have always had reliable service from our Hoover appliances and wanted to try the Constellation's novel \\"floating\\" feature, but this did not make up for its heavy weight and awkward shape. It is especially difficult to rewind the long cord around the base for storage; a retractable cord is almost a necessity with this design. The machine does have good suction and the metal parts will probably last forever, but if the floating capacity ever gives out it will be like dragging around a canon ball. We had to return it. We finally settled on a Panasonic MC-3920 which is tiny and lightweight and does a good job on our hard-finish floors. For carpets we use a Eureka upright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool in theory, but dumb in real life","review":"Like others, we had one of these when I was a kid. It was fun to play with but miserable for vacuuming.Its suction is not impressive--too much of that 12 amps go into keeping the thing aloft (and scattering dust).Worse, the hovercraft action only works well on a perfectly flat (and preferably hard) floor. Too easily, the base gets hung up on any change of level--tile-to-carpet, wood-to-rug, its own cord--and, as often as not, the machine tips over. You either have to go back and free or right the thing, or--out of exasperation--drag it across the floor on its side. It isn't especially good about moving around furniture and gets hung up or tips over, which is especially annoying in small rooms.There's a good reason this design never took off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimmick w/ bad ergonomics","review":"The float on air thing works okay, but if you are going over both rugs and flooring, it can get flummoxed and stuck. It also tends to get caught up in its own cord. The vacuum suction works well, but the handle ergonomics are pretty awful--no real grip/hold and it curves at an awkward angle, twisting your wrist. Finally the metal straight pole fits into the plastic part with just friction--it comes apart while you are vacuuming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Hoovercraft","review":"This vacuum seems very well built. Its minimalist elegant design greatly reduces the number of parts that can break. No wheels! No cord retractor! No electric cord attached to the wand! It puts all the other vacuum cleaners made of cheap plastic to shame - including maybe even the Miele units. So far it has done a great job around the house. I can do one floor and a staircase without unplugging it. The hose extends far enough to allow me to do the whole staircase without lifting the base once. I don't mind that it doesn't have auto-rewind. Other vacuums we've had with that feature eventually stripped the cord. We could never get our house this clean with our old upright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best vacuum I've ever owned!!!","review":"I've owned so many vacuums in the past ten years & they all have been nothing but trouble. I haven't owned this one long, but so far it is fabulous. Has amazing suction & is so easy to vacuum. It's not heavy at all & it just glides behind you. I would be careful with the on & off switch it seems like you need to be gentle. It flips up & down but doesn't feel very durable. Wrapping the cord is no big deal to me I just put it in the closet with cord piled on top. The cord is wonderful it's extra, extra long.

With my gentle touch and careful manipulation, I expect I can make this unit last for many years. The on-off switch is too cheaply made, Hoover needs to make the switch out of steel parts like they used to!

I spent more than 8 hours doing in-depth online research, and reading vacuum-cleaner customer reviews until I was ready to puke, before buying this unit.

It was produced by Jeffrey Katzenberg for DreamWorks Animation, and is distributed by Paramount Pictures, and was released in U.S. theaters on May 18, 2007 (exactly 6 years after the first Shrek).It was produced with the working title of Shrek 3, the name being changed to avoid potential confusion with Shrek 3-D. Like the first two Shrek films, the movie is significantly based on fairy tale themes. The film was rated PG by the MPAA for some crude humor, suggestive content and emotional subjects. It was nominated for Best Animated Movie at the Kids' Choice Awards 2008.Please buy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Failure","review":"This show fails to amuse in any way.

Then I tuned in...Somehow, the novelty wore off, and the cleverness disappeared. Was it just filler? Were they burnt out and wanting out of their contract? Instead of getting better a lot of bits were so poor in comparison. While watching this season I felt embarrassed for the comedians I normally enjoy.Looking into the dead eyes of the main stars, it seems like they sold their soul for a longer contract.

You aren't going to buy the DVD if you haven't already seen the show and made up your mind about it. The show isn't much different than the many odd 'reviews' already written here for this DVD. They are more of an attempt to be clever than funny.Let me say, as a fan of Monty Python, Kids in the Hall, SCTV, even Mr. Show, that Tim and Eric are not funny and they are not clever.Seriously guys, skip the 'meta comedy' and try to do something that is actually funny.

The atrocities that the Communist regime perpetrated against the Armed forces of Germany and innocent civilians are a chapter of history that the victors conveniently choose not to remember.

Yet the USSR's people were the main victims of his dictatorial policies. I do not know of any such murderous policies (although very repressive) against the countries occupied by the Soviet Union. Let us also consider the fact that 3.5 million out of 5.6 million Red Army POW's were murdered, 16 million Soviet civilians killed, a racial war of annhiliation launched. The Soviet Union perpretrated nothing of the sort on the German population. The limited rape, looting, and plunder on German soil was understandable though it was not deliberately perpetrated nor was it officially encouraged. This virulent anti-Soviet propaganda has become very popular with neo-Nazis and the crazy cold warriors but is somewhat tolerated unlike Holocaust revisionism.As Iosif Stalin said as early as 1942: \\"Hitler's come and go but the German people continue on\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't seem to reach its potential ....","review":"The Bride's Rescuer by Charlotte DouglasHarlequin Intrigue # 691 - December 2002Celia's about to walk down the aisle when a mysterious woman tells her an amazing story.

His findings are conclusive: the Italians of the immigrant generation may not have been literate, but they passed on a wealth of values that cannot be denied.If you are Italian American, you will happily digest Paolicelli's ruminations regarding his ethnicity; I guarantee they lend a hand in helping you formulate your own unanswered questions regarding your place in our pluralistic American society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Abruzzo????","review":"Mr Paolicelli needs to understand the geographical location and history of Italy before he ventures to write another book on the subject.

You have to depress the blade lock with one hand, pull the shield out of the way with another hand, and loosen the nut with a third hand.Overall, though, this is a fantastic miter saw. One might complain about the lack of a laser, but the Irwin $30 add-on works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent saw for the buck","review":"I wish now that I had bought a sliding compound miter saw because this thing has opened my eyes to a whole new way of doing things.You will need to \\"dial it in\\" yourself.

I like my teas plain and would prefer to add my own sweetener if I feel it's needed. This is a miss in my book and it's not surprising when the ingredients list 'natural orange flavor' before 'natural blueberry flavor' in the line up. Why not something more natural like actual blueberry? Right? Silly me. It doesn't taste like a berry of any kind by my standards. So, if berry and green tea are the taste you're looking for AND you like the multifaceted herbal taste of Yogi brand teas then try their Goji Berry instead, it's wonderful w/ no weird sweetener after taste and no orange spice!

I have also tried a few other flavors and many brands but this one still has the rest beat. No need to add anything but hot water and you're good to go.Also this gives a little energy boost, for me anyway, that I can feel and almost as much as an equivalent sized cup of coffee. The only warning I would give about this product is beware drinking a whole cup of this then some water, because you WILL have to pee soon and often.

Considering that it was not written first hand, it does not seem like much was missed in the story telling. In fact, it was interesting, fast paced, and yet did not omit important details.The two things that made the book an excellent read were the individual stories and the historical context. Lots of research went into weaving the complicated story of what happened in July 1943 into one cohesive story and including the individual histories as well.Secondly, Rugerro clarifies the issues and circumstances that made this a historically significant event and not just a few days of battle. As a person who has a love for WWII paratrooper history, this is a must-read book.A final thrill was seeing my uncle's picture both inside and on the back cover along with other paratroopers posing with a captured Tiger tank.

When I was 10, I played Mary Lennox in this musical, so that probably explains why I have so much passion for this music. When someone is 10 years old, it is hard to see the life behind the music, the meaning behind the lyrics, but I found it. \\"How Could I Ever Know\\" is the first song that had ever really made me cry. And the next night, I was crying backstage during \\"Race You To the Top of the Morning\\". Listening to the lyrics, and the beautiful soprano voices on this cd really give you a heart for the story. Most people think of this as a simple story, but there is so much depth and sadness and ultimately happiness, that it fills you up with so much emotion. I got out the cd today after 3 years, and I felt all those emotions all over again. That is why I am here writing this review! If you are a fan of music theater, there is no way you could resist buying this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is AMAZING!!!!!!","review":"This music is absolutely wonderful! These songs don't just stick with you for days, they carry you away! The song I HEARD SOMEONE CRYING is entrancing. The music is very touching and captures the emotions of the characters. The songs WICK, SHE'S A GIRL, and ITS MAZE lighten your mood and make you smile. All of the songs are varied and beautifully sung by the Broadway cast. This CD is a MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret of the Garden","review":"I knew of this musicals from my childhood, but I nev er bought the CD. I had seen this musical at my local theater, which mind you has stuck with me since I saw it, and I liked it,, but I was very young and could not appreciate it. My mom liked it but I have always remmembered the opening scene becasue all the adults sang ring around the rosy and then the mary song. Then they burnt a doll house. It was amazing. But it was this may when someone said I should check it out. I did and WOW!! I have never been moved to tears by a cd, but then I heard the finale and I balled. What a lovely musical! I think everyone should own this cd. It has childish elements and then it has very adult and scarry elemnts. Esp. the train song. WOW!!!!! I hope that you will buy this cd becasue it is one of THE BEST broadway musicals EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! now buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this musical...","review":"I saw this Broadway musical and love the sound track from the Secret Garden. Wonderful memorylots of beautiful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret Garden!","review":"I purchased this cd for my girlfriend as a birthday present because she really loves this musical I was surprised how fast it arrived I ordered the cd on Friday and it arrived on Monday. I was also surprised that the cd was brand new, however; a problem we had was the cd did have two minor scratches on it which caused the cd to skip. over all this is a great buy i would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Musical!","review":"This album is well worth getting. The songs are beautiful and an album for the entire family. It's a great piece of musical theatre. I highly reccomend it. The songs stay with you, espeially, \\"How Could I Ever Know.\\" The composer did a great job in making a children's book into a musical on broadway."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Fault","review":"That fault is the utterly disturbing operatic vocal talents of Mandy Patinkin. He is a wonderful performer, but for some reason I prefer Anthony Warlow ( Australian Cast ) to him. Oh well, get it anyway. Great score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairy tales in art & print","review":"I've bought several copies of this treasury in stores and on-line at Amazon. The latest were \\"used\\" but excellent. On the mark. I think they could have even been better with more careful packaging. The corners on both (separate sources) were a bit bent--avoidable. About the book--wow. The drawings are fantastic, literally that. They are colorful and full of imagination. I have a copy for myself of course, a \\"child\\" who remembers another treasury read to me by my mother many eons ago. For Xmas, I bought copies for my students who are parents. I wholeheartedly recommend the book and the editions available on Amazon. I know I'll buy more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous (not in a good way)","review":"I bought a used copy of this book based on the positive reviews I read on Amazon. I am all for satire and wit, but I just found this book to be inane, whether for grown-ups or children! It didn't even make me crack a smile...and I was wanting to like it. I don't take issue with the sarcasm or negative example it could set for children, I just didn't find anything redeeming about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for kids","review":"Yes, this book is amusing. Yes, the art is entertaining. Yes, I enjoyed it. If I were rating it for an older child (13+) or an adult, I probably would've given it four stars.The reason I gave it two stars is because it is wholly inappropriate for its intended audience. The book is dripping with sarcasm, rudeness and for a children's book, it's pretty darned impertinent.What really convinced me not to allow my 4-year old to have this book (after I purchased it at a going out of business sale with no returns) was the story entitled, \\"Henry's Bedtime Story.\\" If you want your children to have the fear of God instilled in them, by all means, read them this portion of the book. It begins, \\"...do you know the story of the MONSTER who comes to STEAL little children in the night?\\"This book is amusing- for the 13- and older crowed. Don't buy this for a young child. I feel safe in saying you'll likely regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I don't like this book. I ordered it based on customers' reviews and ended up giving it away to a book sale. Too bad. If you like \\"Stinky Cheese Man\\" you'll like this one. It's got a similar sense of humor. I see that sense of humor as a deadpan fascination with violence. The verbal style is flat \\"Dick and Jane.\\" But this verbal spoof is purely for adults. What kid reads \\"Dick and Jane\\" any more? The visual style is cute: humans have round heads with smily faces. It's hip. It's nasty. Hip and nasty. A grown-up version might be early Brett Easton Ellis. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"A recipe for insolence and irony","review":"This is a funny book as a parody of dopey children's literature. But as a book for actual children, I find it pernicious. If you want your kids to be sassy, caustic and sarcastic, why not just let them watch a lot of television? This book will teach children that it is okay to be obnoxious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not for young children","review":"My husband, my 2-year-old daughter, and I are huge fans of the sequel - \\"The Happy Hockey Family moves to the country.\\" So we were all very excited to get our hands on this book also. It is, as expected, a very funny, wry satire that is well-drawn and fun to read, BUT unlike the sequel it is really totally inappropriate for a small child. The book contains a segment about the very, very scary monsters that come in through the windows at night which is very frightening. So be warned that it is really a book for older kids (and parents) to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The happy Hocky Family","review":"My grandson introduced this book to his mother (he got it from his school library) who in turn shared it with me. She and I laughed throughout the reading of it. I love this book and have purchased 4 of them for the grandchildren and then purchased The Happy Hocky Family Moves to the Country which is also hysterical. My family in other parts of the country are sick of me reading this book to them over the phone. Earlier this week grandson Henry, who is 5 years old and in kndergarten, read it to me by himself and also laughed. Kids need to read books that are fun, but that also have a more subtle sense of humor. Buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud","review":"The FUNNIEST book I EVER read with my daughter.We laughed out loud at bedtime again and again (which, by the way, may really help with some young one's sleep).It's like an \\"inside joke book for kindergartners\\".When they are old enough to read, they are also at the age when they get to know other children's behaviors. Some not so good.These are some of their thoughts that they may not share openly, but secretly think.It's honest.Excellent illustrations are another twist and also a nod to Dick and Jane books.Too funny. A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"3905 Carhartt Boot","review":"Great Boot. It is not a steel toe boot, at least the 3905 is not. Unbelievable quality and construction. Owned by Red Wing. That says a LOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. What a lot of variety!","review":"This book has it all - super-hard connect-the-dots (up to 100 or 150...!), pages you rip or cut or fold, pages where you carefully poke through the dots with a pencil so on the OTHER side you can feel the goosebumps or stubby beard, pages just for coloring (including the Stroop test!), search-and-finds, jokes carefully written on the edges of every page, mazes... everything! Most of these activities take a long time of sustained attention to complete, which is just what you want to encourage on five hour plane trips.The pencil container should be cut off before you give it to your kidlet, though. It keeps the book from lying flat, and is therefore very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT live up to it's title.","review":"The contents of this activity book do not live up to the title. Many are not \\"on the go\\" activities, let alone easy for little kids to follow without supervision. As a teacher, this proved to be a poor investment of my time and money. You would be best to not make the same mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice piece of rock & roll history...","review":"The Inmates hit Top 40 radio in the U.S. when I was a kid with a great version of The Standells Dirty Water. They have since put out several really solid garage rock albums. This DVD (the 1st I've ever seen by this group) consists of portions of 2 shows in the UK from 1980. While the sound quality is pretty good and the video is ok, the band blasts through as aggregators of maximum r&b - great originals, neat covers. Classic rock indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Miller Before Success","review":"Miller had been a sought-after arranger and session player-- he had even fronted a band for Ray Noble (to help get around union rules) by the time he decided it was time to lead a band of his own. He put the band together-- and it failed. Yes, Miller's another one of those \\"overnight successes\\" who went through a series of failures to finally achieve what he was after. The tale of that first band is here, and the good news is that it was a darn good effort. You can hear Glenn the Arranger on display and catch some of the proto-Millerisms that would later become so well known. many of these charts really kick-- I'll put \\"I Got Rhythm\\" up against any hard-driving barn-burner of the period. You don't have to be a serious Miller completist to enjoy these recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!","review":"All though the actors were cast well, except for Nancy,the acting was ok, I hated this version of a classic Charles Dickens novel. There were too many liberites taken with the story line and the music was quite awful and distracting. I should have read more about the discription of who directed and produced this version. If you are a diehard Dickens fan you will be greatly disappointed with this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintelligible dialog","review":"I watched the first twenty minutes of this DVD on PBS and found far too much of the dialog unintelligible due to the extreme accents of the actors. This is not the case, for example, with the BBC production of David Copperfield where the speech is quite okay. I find it odd that given the desire to sell to the US public the producers would not make sure that the dialog was reasonably easy to understand. If they could do this with David Copperfield, why not with Oliver Twist? I would buy the DVD if it had English subtitles but I can't find this out, so I fear I won't be buying this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only . . .","review":"The item ordered (Oliver Twist) was great. However, it is such a shame I am forced to order it from Amazon.com. If only there were a better user friendly service to deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"i have lost faith in WGBH productions...","review":"...and i must admit that my view of the quality of the BBC brand is more than a bit tarnished by this version of Oliver Twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they read the book?","review":"The other reviewers have already listed some of the MANY liberties that this production has taken with Dickens' great work. Rather than elaborate, let me just say that it's what you might call the \\"Oliver Stone version\\" of Oliver Twist. Compared to many of Dickens' other works, Oliver Twist is not a particularly long or complex tale, and there's no excuse for the distortions and omissions in this latest Masterpiece Theater version. And as for casting the cheerful and enigmatic Spuds McKenzie as the evil Bullseye, gimme a break!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Twisted Oliver Twisted","review":"This BBC adaptation twists around all that is fundamental to the story. And the acting is stilted and over-dramatic. After watching 10 minutes, I could not stand it any more. I switched to watch a short feature about the making of the film.The director said she was tired of the usual way the characters were played. She choose to portray Oliver as a strong-willed boy who could stand-up up to Fagan & Sikes instead of a frightened and passive boy. She cast Fagan as a large man, not a skinny man. I'm sure she went on to explain more, but I had had all I could take.The problem with this 'interpretation' is that it is not what Dickens wrote. I am a fan of Dickens--I don't' want the director's version of Oliver Twist. I want Dickens's. Oliver is believable & interesting because of the way Dickens wrote him. If Oliver was strong-willed, the story wold have been different. Same goes for the other characters. Skip this and get a version that is more faithful to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even my kids liked this movie.","review":"I wasn't really sure what to expect but this movie was great. I originally bought it because my kids had a school project on Oliver Twist and they needed some help with comprehension. Although this movie does deviate from the original story in some respects, it is still a very entertaining and enjoyable movie. Not to mention that Tom Hardy is absolutely intimidating and creepy as Bill Sykes. Loved every minute of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unforgivably Medicore","review":"David Lean's epic simply cannot be beaten it is a tender , powerful portrayal of the great Dicken's classic because it stuck closely to the book . With character gaps and a weakening narrative this film failed to deliver . Handling literature and manipulating a great novel takes extreme skill and creative vision all of which was lacking in this adapatation ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good movie","review":"I'd seen a few different versions of the story over the years and this one was really good, I really enjoyed it. It was packed really well and the delivery was fast too. Thank you :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts are specifically intended to put Christians in a bad light. IMO","review":"I enjoyed this version up until the end when it was apparent that someone at the BBC specifically decided to portray Christians in a very poor light by adding dialog to the court scene and a jail scene that were not in the book. The Judge asks Fagan if he would like mercy. He then asks Fagan to accept Jesus as his Savior and Fagan says he cannot. So the Judge condemns him to death. No where in the book does this dialog exist.In an earlier scene the Dodger comes to visit Fagan and Fagan says the Jailors are feeding him bread soaked in Bacon. Again not in the book. Why add this kind of crap unless you have an agenda to denigrate Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaaarrrrgggghhhh","review":"I'm wondering if the script writer read the novel. This was a mishmash of a story. I kept watching because I thought it would get better, but it didn't. The most stupid rewrite--the end of Bill Sykes. Dickens gave us a wonderfully ironic scene which was eliminated for one that was emotionally sterile.It's just bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"FRESH AND VITAL","review":"The first reviewer, Mr. Raker, is right about one thing: it ain't exactly like the book. Purists and high school English teachers can go on showing David Lean's classic B&W; if fresh, creative vision offends them, but screenwriter Sarah Phelps has done something remarkable - she has given Dickens' impossibly precious title character a spine. This Oliver stands up to his tormentors, despite the cruel handicap of being young, and the result is that we no longer pity the lad, we actually care about him.It was unseemly to torpedo this excellent re-visioning of Oliver Twist, tautly directed by Coky Giedroyc, before it had been shown on PBS, for it clearly was made by intelligent artists who did not deviate from the original just to be different. They bring a creepy slumdog vitality to an old and well-loved story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Does Disservice to Charles Dickens' Work","review":"If you are expecting a recreation of Charles Dickens' classic story, you are in for a surprise! The screenwriter (Sarah Phelps?)almost created her own story while using the classic Oliver Twist as a template. Although bearing the same names, the characters in this movie were not ones created by Charles Dickens. They looked like someone born in the wrong century. It's bad! I wonder how such a script got made into a movie by BBC. There was no artistic value here. A total waste of public money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I got season one from a friend as a gift and loved it. I bought season two and was pretty dissappointed. The show just became vulgar and sacrificed the hilarity of season one. I loved the ideas for episodes, but didn't care much for how they played out. Bill got soft. Cuddles and Dan got mean. Buttons and Rocko stayed about the same, but it wasn't enough. Great show, but stick with season one."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Course...","review":"\\"My Brother's Keeper\\" is an edgy, realistic series that hits home (i.e., the heart/mind) where it counts. While some may consider the cinematographic or acting somewhat subpar, the diverse background of the characters reflect a more balanced interpretation of the targeted population. It addresses contemporary issues, challenges and triumphs that are thought provoking. The themes are inclusive and, at the same time, irrevelant. \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" has the potential of carrying on the torch where \\"Soul Food\\" left off. Forward movement Lamont Carswell..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible and Out of Date","review":"I rented this video expecting it to be from 2010 since that was release date, most of the stuff in the video is from 2004. The guy talking in the video spends 5-10 minutes on extremely stupid stuff. He spent that much time right away showing us how to change the \\"code\\" to make the first letter in your sales page bigger than the rest of the text. I didn't even finish the video but at the rate he was going there would have been very few tips and the things he was showing were almost completely worthless in the present. I wish there was an index of all the points he was going to cover somewhere so I could have decided if I would have been interested, ie, \\"Chapter 1: Increase first letter of your starting paragraph\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I got sold on the subject and rented this - it was bad from the very beginning - I could not watch for more than 10 mins. Please do not waste money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty interesting.","review":"It's so nice to find a good christian book like this. I have a hard time finding suitable things to read. I like how Vi is always turning to God for help. This story does start up pretty slow. But, around chapter three or four it stats to pick up. So far I'm only on chapter five. I'm really enjoying this book and can't wait to find out what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tolerant and Adopted?","review":"Where is tolerance? When he came back from England at the age of twenty-seven he had 285 slaves. In ten years the number grew to 386. And he and his father did not think twice about breaking up families.Where is adoption? His father is his father and his mother is his mother. He was a bastard but it took 27 years for his father to marry his mother although they lived together the entire time. Is that called an adoption?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carmen Electra's Amazing Aerobic Striptease Collection","review":"Carmen Electra is amazing and does an outstanding job in her Aerobic Striptease Collection.She really targets areas that help to tone and stretch the body; as you aerobically strip your way to becoming fit!I give her fitness collection a rate of ten stars!If you want to learn how to strip and get fit the right way; then you have to puchase Carmen Electra's Aerobic Striptease collection !Nicolette and Myrna \\"We are so glad we got this collection!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced Aerobic Striptease","review":"I have not really looked into this disc very much. But I know before you start you need to gather several props. Also Carmen preforms the begining of a lap dance, you are supposed to \\"imagine\\" someone in the seat. It through me a little off because the moves are so precise that there is no room for anyone else in the seat. Once again, Carmen does an excellent job of breaking down the routines so you can achieve accuracy in your striptease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carmen had nothing to do with this except smiling","review":"This DVD was a joke. There were two dance routines and in the end they lasted only about a minute each.The fit to strip one had some good workout moves, but the collection in general is a waste. Carmen looked bored doing the moves which didn't help and there wasn't much dancing involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"A joke","review":"I was looking for more of a striptease workout than being entertained... I could only get through the first 10 min of Carmen close-ups, giggles and cutesy smirks. I found myself rolling my eyes far too much. I dunno, I may try it again, and see if I can get through it to focus on the actual routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DVD Skipped after like 10 min","review":"I popped in the DVD and it started skipping over and over and eventually just turned off and went to the menu screen... The seller DID say that if it skipped he would refund it, but I feel like you would know if an item skipped and you shouldn't sell something if you know its busted... It only cost $5 total so I feel like sending it back would cost me more than just keeping it"},{"rating":"1","title":"I NEVER GOT THE ITEM I PAID FOR","review":"I just want what I paid for. I'm sure the item is great... I want the video or my money back... Help!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toning workout","review":"Overall, this DVD is fantastic for beginner to intermediate. (If you are already very toned, then this might be too easy for you.) It's a good mix of legs, abs, upper body, and rear end, with a little bit of cardio. I get the best results from the exercises for the rear and thighs. I'm working on making the abs section more difficult for myself because I don't usually feel sore in the midsection the next day. I supplement this with other cardio routines because there are only about 5-6 minutes of cardio at the beginning. The arms portion could be more difficult, but I sometimes add my own weights to get better results. I'm very happy with Michael's explanations of the exercises, and all of the moves are very safe. I usually do all five sections (about 55 minutes total) for a good full body toning workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Toning","review":"Not a bad workout. Most moves can be advanced with weights when they get too easy, which is good. A workout that stays with you. The cardio portion is not great. I would recommend doing this for toning and using some other video or exercise for cardio for a full workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv this workout!","review":"I don't have any of the other 'Strip' DVDs, so I don't know how their formats are, but this one ROCKS! It's about an hour long, but it honestly doesn't feel like an hour! Michael and Carmen transition between mat, weights, and chair workouts and work out each area of the body - abs, arms, back, and legs. It's a really great workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout","review":"I tried it for the first time last night and I can't wait to do it again! I thought that it was fun and flirty. I liked the last routine the best. It kept your heartrate up a bit, and it was really sexy. I can't wait to try disc 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Simple Routines","review":"I have been working out to Carmen Electra's Aerobic Striptease for about a month now and find it highly motivating to get up and move. I am not a very athletic person, but I do love to dance, so this was a great fit for me. Plus, the video breaks things down very well and repeats the moves several times, which helps with learning coordination. Whenever I do the workout, my heart is definitly pumping and I feel great! I would reccomend this to someone who is new to working out, but someone who is seeking a more advanced fitness program might be dissapointed. I also really liked Carmen Electra's guidance in the video. She displayed a lot of personality and femininity."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!!!","review":"well i just got this movie today popped it in and was kinda dissapointed but i quickly got over it. i was dissapointed bc it doesn't have to do with the strip tease it is all work out. and boy does it work you out. for an hour i was sweating, my heart reate up, and i was getting one of the best workouts i have had in a long time.it is all about getting your body in shape so you look good during the tease, as well as fit to get through it bc no one wants to huff and puff during the tease.i highly reccomend anyone who wants a good work out to get this movie. it is no to hard that someone out of shape (like me) can't do it and it is not so easy that you don't feel the burn. i feel that it is just right and i plan on getting the 1st one asap bc i also wanna learn the tease.i hope this helps your decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my style unfortunately","review":"The product is well done, it's just not my style.In short.. I could NOT see me getting my man excited if I were dancing most of these moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The collection consists of 5 DVD's. The material on the DVD's is presented in a very clear, easy to learn manner. So people with two left feet can easily learn to do the routines. The first DVD teaches a warm-up routine. DVD's 3-5 each teach a different type of routine with the warm-up of DVD 1 repeated. My biggest complaint is that each routine on DVD is only 3-4 minutes long. So you have to perform it over and over in order to get any kind of benefit from the exercise. DVD 2 is the best of the group in my opinion because it has a very good exercise routine that is 30 minutes in length. It combines elements of Pilates, low-impact aerobics, and general body toning routines. There needs to be a single DVD with all the material on it. You cannot use a single DVD (with the exception of DVD 2) and expect to get a decent workout without constantly playing with your DVD player and replaying one of the chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"The second video in the series is a good workout. I can feel it the next day. I haven't been doing it long enough to see any results, but it does work the muscles. It is also fun and easy to do. Each section has about 5 little workouts. You can do all of them or just pick and choose. I'd say it was worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUST ME IT WORKS!","review":"Wow, I've tried every workout every fab workout known to man and this has to be the greatest. Most workouts are filled with high energetic skinny people you just want to punch in their face, or workouts that just get too boring or make you go crazy (like billy blank's boot camp he just never shuts up). I loved this because even though Carmen is just following along I can look at her and be like, \\"Move over, I'm about to have that body\\" I've woken up with sore muscles that I never knew exsisted. I've been doing this for a while and OH MAN! I lost so many inches...my arms are so toned and my butt, wow, is just rock hard lol. I definitely recommend this. I know other reviewers have stated that there is not a high intensity factor but you don't need that for it to work. Do it everyday..it gets your body going..you'll be twsiting and turning and just having fun. I love every video. It just makes you feel sexy and like a woman no matter your age or weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Work Out!","review":"Carmen Electra's Fit to Strip is a great work out. It is primarily for toning and strengthening. If you are looking for something to boost your normal work out routine, this is it. You will use muscles that you didnt know you had. I felt results within 2 weeks of doing the DVD. If you want a cardio work out, I would suggest something else, but it is terrific for muscle work. I love it. It is fun, easy to follow, and not cheesy like some DVD work outs. I really enjoy it and will get great use out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Striptease Aerobics","review":"This video is not for the average person; unfortunately the workouts are not instructed like traditional workouts and you do have to be able to catchon pretty quickly.

It a must have box set. i told my friends about it and they are thinking about get the box set too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly an exercise video","review":"Thankfully, this DVD only cost me $2. Unfortunately, it is not worth 2 cents. This is strictly a striptease training video. In the first routine, you are walked through 8 steps, four more steps (on the 4th, you remove your glasses, turn, and place them in your mouth). After doing this 3 times, she says, \\"Okay, now let's try that with some music.\\" That's when I hit eject and put in a real workout video."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I was expecting","review":"It came as advertised but I was expecting a few more dances and longer dances than the disc had on them. They were still fun to learn but I am glad I didn't buy these at full price else where."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"Disc 2 has an actual workout, but this isn't really for people tryint to totally get in shape. However, if you want to learn some routines and have a little fun with your partner, she makes it fairly easy to learn"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aerobic--uh I don't think so","review":"The title of this DVD makes it sound like it's something really advanced (and aerobic). But actually the first two DVDs in Carmen's set are much more physically challenging than this one. This DVD is kind of a cheesy joke. It consists of two 10 minute strip routines which require dressing up. The first one is a \\"sexy librarian.\\" To do the routine as Carmen demonstrates you need some glasses and a scarf. The next routine is wearing men's clothing--a big button shirt, a tie, and a really stupid hat. Taking these items off is an integral part of the routine, although there is no actual nudity involved.The routines are too slow and short to actually count as aerobic. So this DVD is useful for one thing...learning some strip routines to act out for your significant other. Although I think I could make some up that wouldn't seem as embarassingly silly as parts of this DVD.I was looking for a fun dance routine that would get my heart pumping but this is definately not it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT WAS I THINKING???","review":"Why didn't I read the reviews before making this purchase?

I also found that Carmen doesn't always explain the moves properly and there is a lot of focus on her looking sexy but not a lot on teaching you the moves. I bought the discs separately but I really wish that I had purchased the box set because some of the discs' aren't worth it. It's fun to watch and it's not bad for you but not worth it if you are looking for an actual workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a workout","review":"This dvd does not provide any kind of aerobic workout whatsoever, only a couple of short routines that I will never use. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Instructor and good strength workout","review":"The Fit To Strip Disc 2 is a pretty darn good workout. I switched from Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred.. which is a great amazing workout, but she is so harsh. I loved this DVD Carmen is adorable, she's so pleasant and its actually kind of nice that she has trouble with some of the workouts just like me. The celebrity trainer is a really good instructor its super easy to follow along and he's really encouraging. I'm not a workout-aholic but I'm in shape and I definitely feel the burn today its a good solid hour long workout, all strength no cardio whatsoever in Disc 2. I am very pleased with my decision to purchase this set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun moves to dance for your man","review":"I didn't purchase this for a workout. I purchased this because I wanted to put some moves together and do a little dance for my boyfriend here and there. I thought it was great. She breaks everything down and goes over it again and again. It does get your heart rate up a bit but overall, it was fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of fun... a guilty pleasure ;)","review":"this DVD is kind of silly but it makes you feel ok about it, and is actually a lot of fun. it is perfectly cast with carmen electra. she is sexy but accessible and there are tactful references to/ acknowledgment of possible practical applications of these moves, which just makes you smile.as far as getting an actual workout, you might burn more calories going on a run...but you will have more fun and acquire, um, skills, with the video ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fit to Strip","review":"I love this disc! The workouts are challenging but not so hard that you dread doing them. The workouts are not related to stripping at all but rather make you stand up straighter and more able to do alot of the hip movements in the first disc. Micheal Carson is really informative and gives great tips while you are sweating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jury's still out...","review":"Compared to Carmen's first installment in this series, Fit to Strip is slightly less of a disappointment. The workouts are decent, the \\"quick fixes\\" are definitely good since the fact that they're only 5 minutes long makes it easier to go through. However, some of the exercises repeat themselves and the ab exercises could be much more intense. One thing I did not like was the fact that the cardio warm up and legs workout were edited very badly and in some sections you're doing one exercise on one leg and then without notice you're finishing a set on the other leg. I don't know whether I like it or not, but I know I definitely don't love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am so sore...WOOOOHOOOO","review":"I think that this DVD offers challenge and variety but you don't have to be a contorsionist to get a good workout. I have been doing Pilates for years and love it, but if you want something to really make you sweat and feel strong buy this DVD.Carmen was not annoying nor scantilly clad which was good and her trainer is down to earth and didn't talk a bunch of nonsense during the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be 2 disk series.........","review":"Disk 1 - 4 starsDisk 2 - 5 starsYou do not need the following:Disk 3 - 3 starsDisk 4 - 2 starsDisk 5 - 1 star"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I have all 5 of these \\"workout\\" DVDs let me tell you it is not worth it at all the only one worth buying is fit to strip. Its a workout. all of the DVDs could have fit onto one DVD they are lioke 15 min each. and she really doesn't teach you to strip. I couldnt wait to learn to lapdance and trust me this is not worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"So so...","review":"I run every other day and I was looking for something to do in-between running days. Carmen Electra's trainer gives you moves and tips throughout the whole DVD. This DVD just wasn't exactly what I was looking for. It wasn't as intense as I had hoped. The moves are slow and brief. I'll probably pass it on to my mom since she's been looking to start a workout regimen herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"shes not very camera friendly, and she wears ridiculous outfits, and overall i could not get into this dvd... went in the garage sale pile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping","review":"I was hoping this item would teach striptease moves. It only is a boring exercise video. I am getting rid of mine and I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok workout, Carmen is just too dumb","review":"The workout is pretty good, but at times the camera show her doing the wrong thing or once, in the middle of the workout it pans to her just standing there, so it throws off your own count.To me it is just annoying and not worth my money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"Intermediate and advanced exercisers beware! This routine is most appropriate for beginners. The workout is NOT intense, NOT heart-pumping, and NOT inspiring. Also, there's no dance to speak of, let alone strip-tease. I was very disappointed with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's this got to do with stripping?","review":"I am truely dispointed in this DVD. This is a plain, ok workout. It has absolutly nothing to do with any kind of dancing. And this is not a Carmen Electra DVD. Michael Carson is the instructor. Carmen is just there, doing the routine. The exercices are ok, especially for someone who is not in great shape, but this DVD will not show you anything that has to do with erotic dancing. This is just a workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"i need an opinion!","review":"i just recently ordered the 5 disc set on the internet, i was reading some of the comments everyone wrote. i am about 30 pounds over weight and want to change it. did this work for anyone that wanted to loose weight? most of the comments i read it sounded like they were already in shape, was anyone not and this actually helped them loose pounds? please let me know, cause now i am starting to feel stupid by ordering this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What workout?","review":"Ok, Here's my beef with this video:1. Not even a workout (didn't even sweat an ounce)2. They hardly show the exercise moves! They zoom in on Carmen's face,[...] or her two stripper friends.3. Most of the video is \\"practicing\\" for the dance moves. You go over the dance moves a ton of times before you can actually start moving. There is no constant workout pace in this video, so therefore, whoever is doing it is not getting a workout because you are not keeping a constant pace. You dance and stop, dance and stop. So if you think this is a 55 minute workout, your sadly mistaken....maybe about a 20 minute at the most!If you want a REAL workout video, go with the CRUNCH videos...They always make you break a sweat and keep you constantly moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"four or five stars","review":"I bought this set after I'd become incerdibly bored by workouts I had been trying. I was looking for something I could stick to. I love this set of DVDs! Having one without the others though seems a little useless. No it's no taebo or anything but it's fun and makes you feel good. I was a little worried that it would only make me feel worse about the weight I needed to lose but it has done the opposite. The first DVD is fun and gets you going but the meat of the actual workout is in the second video: Fit to Stip. I also pair this set with walking afterwards for 20 minutes. I bought it a little over a month ago and so far I've lost 11 pounds. Because I love it so much, I would give it five stars...but it drops down to four just because it should be less than 4 dvds. it could have easily been condensed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was better","review":"I read all the comments on this product and was very optimistic about it. I've done ballet, sports, body workouts, swimming, etc and wanted to give it a try on other kind/amusing workouts but these videos are just like choreographies that you have to learn (although you can mix those steps if you want to dance for example) but there's no training per sé part. I was really disappointed... I expected more of this video after all the reading. Anyway, I guess you can use it just to learn sexy/lap dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll make you sweat!","review":"Out of all the aerobic DVDs I own (10-minute pilates, the Bar Method, etc.) I feel this video (Fit To Strip - disc 2 in the set) has given me the best results. After doing at least 5 days a week for about a month and a half, I have really noticed my legs changing. I have lost nearly all excess on the back of my legs (hamstring area) and even the thigh area is becoming more defined. This DVD combines cardio work with strength training which uses your own body weight and gravity against you. There are lots of squat-type exercises that focus on the legs. I recommend this DVD by itself for anyone looking to tone up for the summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout!","review":"It's a great workout video that really does get you sweating! And it builds confidence once you learn the steps and put them together! So much fun alone or with girlfriends~!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"These DVDs are ok! The only DVD that I have done more than once and that I really liked, was DVD 2 fit to strip."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened to everyone else's review","review":"I recently bought this DVD and I would have to say that I should have listened to all the other reviews when I bought it. This DVD is VERY short. It's not very aroebic, and it's almost the same dance as the \\"lap dance\\" video on disc #5. The only difference really is it shows you how to take your clothes off while you're doing it, which I think most people could figure out anyway.So my advice is not to buy this DVD unless you get the entire set. There is no point, and you can learn almost the same dance in disc 5. You also barely get any exercise. They really messed up by calling this one \\"advanced\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like it","review":"The first CD was too easy. The other CDs were too difficult and too hard on my joints. I'm only 25 and found some movements too difficult for my joints. I stopped using the CDs. I am in good shape and wanted to use these workouts as something different to work out with. Carmen Electra acted a little too gitty when explaining movements. It is apparent that she is unaware of anatomy and physiology. She seemed to be unaware of what she was actually doing and did not do a good job explaining movements. I wish I had never wasted my money on the CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"A disappointment in all senses of the word. There are only two routines with a warm up that could possibly give you a neck injury. The actual filming of this dvd is frustrating, as while you are trying to see the moves they are performing they cut into a minute-long close-up of Carmen Electra's face. The angles are all wrong. It's not filmed as a work out video and it's therefore difficult to follow along. When the dvd ended I found myself exclaiming, \\"that's it?\\" Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"This is a complete waste of money. You can have mine!! It is not a decent workout nor will it teach you anything helpful. Your best bet is to find a class that teaches this type of stuff. I found one local in Long Beach, CA where I learned more in one class than this entire set could teach me. Save your money - buy something else!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even raise my pulse....","review":"This was a total waste of time and money. The \\"workouts\\" didn't raise my pulse at all. It felt like of bunch of girls messing around at a party. I know it's supposed to be fun, but that's about all it was. Work out it was not. If you want to get in shape, then don't get this. If you want some stripper moves to wow your guy, then maybe this would work although, the hair tossing and the hip rotating are things you can watch on TV for free...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Contents","review":"This video was not what I had expected...I was hoping to learn some great Striptease dances...the dances that Carmen Electra demostrates are just choreographed dances that you see cheerleaders perform...they are sexy dances, but are not really for stripping..I was disappointed in the content of this video.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Striptease for dummies","review":"This DVD is great for beginers. If you have any experience in dance (ballet, jazz, hip hop), you will find this DVD to be a joke. The routines are really easy, and they are repeated several times. If you've never done anything like this, get it, if you've danced, skip to Dvd #2"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple workout...but fun and effective!","review":"This DVD has nothing to do with striping, but it is a fast, fun and effective workout. You can customize the workout to suit your needs, for example, if you have limited time you can pick and chose the type of workout you want to do in the DVD menu. You can also customize the music track to workout with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm not so much","review":"If you are so out of shape this is a work out. If you are moderatly fit then this will do nothing for you. Not really my favorite. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"By no means is this a workout","review":"I'm sorry but this whole workout series is horrendous. I do not recommend under any circumstances. Carmen Electra is not a good teacher. She stumbles her words and her counts are off. I've seen her dancing and it's subpar. When giving the task of breaking down and teaching steps she absolutely unqualified. Furthermore, the workouts are incredibly slow paced. You don't feel a burn at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big let down","review":"This dvd - Carmen Electra's advanced aerobic striptease, is a big dissappointment. There's nothing aerobic about it, and it really doesn't teach you much. It's kinda dry and you only get two 3 minute routines!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Yourself!","review":"I do not recommend this dvd to anyone. It is the most annoying workout video I have ever tried. I can't even get 8 minutes into it. Carmen continually counts each 8-cout. One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight.., over and over again. Ok, we get it, stop already! Stick to crunch fitness videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!!!!","review":"I have two children that are only 14 months apart. My youngest is 5 and 1/2 weeks old. I started this workout series just to have fun and maybe get in a little better shape. I have lost 2 pant sizes thus far and am getting in great shape. This said, I'm very happy with the results. This dvd isn't cheesy and hard to pay attention to. The work outs are very comprehensive and really work. I highly reccomend this wonderful product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel the burn","review":"This is an excellent aerobics dvd for people who want to start a cardio workout at home. It gets your heart pumping and muscles warmed up without being overly hard to do. All exercises require you to use your own body with no equipment other than a chair on a few moves. If you prefer to workout alone without a gym membership or signing up for a class, you should consider this dvd.I really hope that you are here reading about this dvd before buying it. This is an additional fitness workout to the striptease dvds. There are NO dance rountines on this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best workout video!","review":"I looove this DVD. The instruction is clear, the pace is doable for nearly everyone, and the workout is just right. I can't say enough good things about this DVD. I am already toning up and have only had it for 2 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"strip to fitness","review":"I found the strip lap danse video to be fun and easy but the hip hop routine on the next tape was hard to follow and overall if you can run in place in your own living room well you'll get more of a workout than on that tape. If you're just looking to learn fun strip moves the strip tape good but dont count on getting a workout from that set of tapes unless youre really a beginner at fitness i mean the routine you learn overall takes like less than 5 min once you put it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a workout","review":"I was hoping this would be a better workout, but its not...its a very easy pace once you know the routine, and its certainly not long enough. I did learn a few cool moves though, but it didn't get my heart rate up."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I should have listened to the poor reviews and avoided this useless cd set. Watch MTV for 5 minutes and you can pick up these moves. Total waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"So fun!","review":"This is such a fun way to exercise and Carmen Electra is a good coach. I love this DVD, it's a good work out and your significant other will certainly love the new moves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Carmen's hot but the video was NOT","review":"The instructions were simple... too simple. Anyone can learn these moves just by going to a club and watching other people. I was really disappointed when I watched it. I thought she would add a lot of UMPF not just OOMPF. Her sensual expressions were a lot more effective than her moves imo."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a work out video","review":"I can't believe all the good reviews this DVD got. This is in no way a workout video. There's no way you can break a sweat. And the cameraman is terrible, you can't even see her feet and what she's doing. therefore i am lost at times not knowing what to do (I've never taking any dancing classes, so I might need more instruction than most). I do not recommend this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a workout. Good to learn moves.","review":"Not much a workout at all. It is a video for you if you want to learn the moves only. Good step by step instruction by Carmen though."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT","review":"I bought the bloody dvd set and it is the worst thing I have ever bought.

It looked like Electra put on 15 pounds since the last video, and her outfits were boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fun Fun","review":"These dvds are extremely fun to watch because of the beautiful people in the films. The exercises they are doing involve a lot of motion and exertion, and it makes for excellent viewing material. It is also fun to watch someone else doing the workouts along with the videos -- my wife really enjoys doing the workouts, and I enjoy watching her do them."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR","review":"THIS VIDEO WAS VERY MISLEADING.

This has to be THE CHEESIEST production ever made. Granted, she's no fitness guru, but come on! If you're absolutely clueless as to the art of striptease, it's a good introduction. But, it's NO workout and is so basic that it's almost insulting to those who can actually do a lap dance. Oh well, you live and learn. Anyone wanna buy mine? I have the 2nd video too. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"Don't let the DVD title fool you, this has absolutly nothing to do with stripping.

I reccomend this video for those who like aerobics and want easy moves in addition to a workout. As for me, I am looking for a video with a lot more moves that dive deeper into exotic dancing. It was also frustrating when the camera was closed in on Carmen's face, which doesn't help when trying to watch a move."},{"rating":"1","title":"So dissappointing","review":"I thought this would be a fun way to workout, but its very slow paced, and there is no challenge involved.

The dances are kinda cheesy (Definitely nothing I'd do out anywhere)..And in regards to a workout.... Oh... theres no workout here.

Go for Jane Fonda or the 8 minute workout series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pitiful gimic!","review":"I bought this video for my wife kind of as a joke, but figured hey we could have some fun with this. My hopes was to find something fun that would teach my wife some moves without being on the verge of pornographic. While it definitely was clean (no nudity or anything) it definitely lacked content. A few problems with it:1. Not sure how they pass it off as a work out video. Even just by watching it you can tell there is no \\"excercise\\" to it.2. I wasn't sure where the \\"strip\\" part of the video was either. It was all just a bunch of cheesy moves instead of sexy moves.My wife wtched this once and I am guessing we are going to put it up for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED","review":"Carmen Electra's Fit to Strip was not at all what I had expected.

Dancers have more moves than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UM, SKIP IT!","review":"OK, I guess if you get motivated by watching a thin beautiful girl to lose weight, then you will like this video, I have not touched the video in months, it's not worth much to me, it HARDLY has anything that would count as exercise, this woman is very narcissistic and loves being in front of the camera, she looks good, but that is the best part and all you will get from this, do some in place jogging and you will get ALOT more of a work out than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stripping here","review":"I just finished doing this workout video. If I had wanted a purely aerobic video, there are many much better ones I could have chosen. There were many distractions in this video. The music is an annoying elevator boppity-bop sound. Carmen Electra spends a lot of time watching the instructor as if she doesn't know the routines, and often she's slightly off tempo from him.I fell prey to marketing with this video. I guess I didn't read the reviews thoroughly, but I thought I would learn something about strip tease. Instead, I was just watching Carmen giggling at her balding, sleazy trainer. The only thing that impressed me: boy, is she in shape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fit, Fun and Sexy!","review":"Great workout and so much fun.....You start walking a little differently, more confident after trying it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Dissappointed","review":"This video was worthless.

I not only learned the sexy and easy to do moves btu also felt my muscles hurting the next day and after 2 weekks, I could notice a slimmer and toned tummy beginning to emerge. I was shocked. The moves are not even that hard and didn't feel like they took up that much energy but they do focus on working your muscles in a fun, dancing kind of way. Excellent DVD and Amazon provided the best price I could find with a free shipping option that arrived sooner than expected! I am completely satisfied with my purrchase and I'm sure anyone else who buys this DVD from amazon will be too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loves it.","review":"This dvd doesn't have any strip moves, but even if that is all your looking for, I would buy this anyway.

Well I'm not sure where this genre is going, it seems to be very popular, strippers are now part of the mainstream and so are their workouts. I can't believe in the past year how quick the stripper craze developed. I see it on Hope and Faith, Desperate Housewives, David Letterman, etc, it's all over the place. I see below people really like Stripilates which i just read about in Self magazine, seems to be doing well overall as a workout. The other one people like is the S Factor which I hadn't heard of or seen before searching it out on Amazon. Jeff Costa's Strip workout is good as well although it is a guy doing the workout. Ehhh. People seem to like those three the best. I will have to give them a try. Otherwise stay away from Carmen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun workout!","review":"I bought these DVDs because while I am active and used to dance professionally, I have no set workout routine and was wanting to do something other than going to the gym. This workout hooked me with the first DVD. The warm up itself is great for stretching and relieving the daily stresses of life, and the dance routines are easy to learn (even if you are not a dancer), and they really get you sweating. Other people who have made comments like, \\"not a hard enough workout\\" just blow my mind because I am pretty fit and thin but was really tired after just Disc one. This DVD also made me feel pretty sexy (just let loose and get into it) and the day after my first workout I was really sore. Also, Carmen is suprisingly charming and it is not annoying to be instructed by her, plus she doesnt look all skanky like I thought she might. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even sweat...","review":"Perhaps others will disagree but this video isn't all that great. As a dancer, I thought I'd try this video since the title is \\"fit to strip,\\" I assumed it would incorporate strengthening and a good workout. I was wrong. If you're wanting a very basic workout video then this may work for you. Also, some may not know that this doesn't have any \\"stripping,\\" in it--and Carmen isn't really the main focus of the video either. She and her trainer are walking you through the moves. To be honest, it's more like watching Carmen during a personal training session. For me it wasn't worth the time or money which is why I only gave it 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I am in agreement with previous reviewers who didn't appreciate the constant headshots of Carmen. It's hard to follow a routine where you can't see the moves.Two other negatives: 1st: Carmen doesn't seem to be on beat with the music part of the time. Initially I thought it was a soundtrack issue, but her assistants do keep the rhythm well.The \\"warm-up\\" routines were fair (hence the 2 stars), and I could pretty well figure out the steps. Slower-paced and cued, they made learning the steps tolerable.The second problem: Once you get past that 10 minute warm-up, it's assumed you remember all the moves. The music kicks in, the routine is at full speed, and Carmen's only cue is at the beginning: \\"5, 6, 7, 8!\\" Perhaps it's my own weakness I can't remember how many pliés to do before the relevés. Craning my head to see what step we were on was just too much for me.Not recommended for non-dancers, people with neck trouble, or individuals seriously looking to learn some exotic moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good source of enlightment","review":"Carmen's videos are very fun. They are not a high impact workout but they are great at toning the body and learning fun new things. Things you can expirement with and try on your significant other. I bought the DVD's in preparation for my 4th anniversary because I wanted to give my husband a spicy surprise. Needless to say he was speechless. You really learn alot with Carmen's videos and it is alot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was expecting more of an aerobic work out from this video. I found that the camera focussed on Carmen's face when it should have been focussing on her body. I couldn't tell which way her body was moving so for the most part I was completely lost when it came time to putting the moves together. There's a lot more talking than workout time. The video started out fun however it became frustrating when I couldn't tell which way her body was moving and all I saw was her head bobbing up and down to the music. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"no workout","review":"The workout in this is non existant, and the dance routine soon becomes boring and the same thing over and over again. And Carmens dumbness gets really annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good workout... but it doesn't involve stripping","review":"If you're looking to learn how to do a striptease, this volume is not the one you want (get volume 1). But if you're looking to tone up your body, then this is the DVD for you. I like that there are so many different programs to choose from--it prevents boredom, and you can target certain areas or combine your favorite workouts together. Also, you don't need any equipment except a chair to do all the routines. If you're already in great shape, it probably won't do too much except help maintain your fitness level, but if you're trying to get back into exercising regularly, this is a great segueway. Additionally, the instructor and Carmen are very low-key and unannoying compared to most workout programs where you are assaulted by \\"upbeat\\", overly cheerful exhortations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even My Husband Hates It!","review":"I bought this series expecting something that would be a fun work out. Carmen as a teacher she needs a lot to be desired... Counting the steps while learning is important but don't get crazy either! She basically non-stop counted during 90-95% of the steps, it got to where it was difficult to concentrate on what you were doing even. This is great if you have kids, or a parrot, needing to learn to count to 8 however. The Fit to Strip is taught by an instructor with her as a student and it is excellent however. I was very disappointed basically with this purchase overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"thumbs down","review":"i was very dissapointed.......i thought i was goin g to learn how to strip in this video.......the title is very misleading...i would have bought a reg workout vid if i wanted to to regular exercise.....derrr"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED it!","review":"First of all I have to say that I normally shy away from any workout that involves \\"dance\\" usually as I have not been blessed with any sort of coordination. I do have to tell you that I love these DVD's! First of all Carmen Electra is not annoying at all like I thought she would be, I would have to call her inspiring for lack of better term. The workout or \\"routine\\" itself is actually very easy to follow and she really makes sure that you learn it and have a really fun time doing it. In my opinion, this workout is the answer for a lot of people. It builds your confidence in a time where you may not feel so great about yourself, its a good workout (you wont be sweating buckets or anything) and it has certainly gotten the attention of all the men in my house including my boyfriend which is always pretty funny. I think this is totally worth every penny and will be totally worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Set","review":"I agree with many things that have been written. Disc #2 is my FAVORITE work out. Michael Carson does a great job of putting together a real workout that you will feel the next day if you took any time off!!The other discs are cute routines, but not great workouts, but make a good add-on to the work out here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm only on the second DVD. . .","review":"I am on my 4th week of using Carmen's striptease DVDs. Right now, I am only on the second DVD. After doing the first DVD for a week, I already knew the routines and didn't get much of a workout from them, so I started the second DVD. This one is a killer. It definitely is strengthening and toning my body. I am still out of breath after three weeks of doing the second DVD, so I haven't moved on to the 3rd. I am starting to see a flatter stomach and more toned legs. As for the other 3 DVDs, I hope I get in shape enough to use them soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"I bought this video specifically because it stated it had Spanish dubbing and Spanish subtitles, but it had neither.I give it 2 stars because the content in English was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recipes","review":"Outstanding recipes.

There is much to think about in this book, and it may trigger some healthy self-reflection. For those who believe in God, the references to \\"God/the Universe\\" may be unsettling, and are probably made to appeal to a wider audience. But the principles mentioned are universal in nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING","review":"Catherine totally out did herself with this book, if that was at all possible.With this book, you will learn things about your body and I.C. that you never would have imagined were connected.

Catherine has a true gift of understanding what an ICer goes through."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's still doing well!","review":"This is Catherine Simone's third book describing her battle with Interstitial Cystitis. In this one, she lets her readers know that she is still doing great but addresses spiritual, emotional, and mental issues that can attribute to/stem from the disease. Many people who have recovered are finding that although the physical symptoms are gone, the fear, anxiety, etc., tend to linger. This book perfectly complements her other two, bringing her work full circle. I am so thankful for this book...an excellent resource for every IC patient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift!","review":"I bought this as a gift, but was lucky enough to see them. Great value for the money & exactly what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough scholarship.","review":"This book is extremely well written, thoroughly researched and possessing the profound perspective of a wise and intelligent writer exercising his science and art with a passion that can be felt just beneath the surface of cool academic analysis.

Tall Paul does this on this cd....this was my first one by him that I bought, and I still haven't pulled it from my rotation.My particular fav's are The Virus, God's Love and of course, Funky Heroes.....He does an amazing job managing those craving techno, but underlacing it with bass undertones (and sometimes overtones for that matter)...this is a GREAT cd to listen to before going to a club....He's also very damn good live as I saw him about a month ago here at Buzz/Nation in Washington, D.C. and was not disappointed :)I'm primarily a trance/techno/breaks guy, and this cd is a combo of techno and breaks that you won't be able to put down....laters all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What better way to enter the party?","review":"This was the first Tall Paul CD I ever bought, but was pleasently surprised. The anthems remind me much of my old days of dancing until 5 in the morning and coming home to sleep until 3pm. This CD gives a genuine feel of the club atmosphere and flows flawlessly. Every one of my friends wanted a copy as soon as they heard it. I miss those days of yore, but the US doesn't seem to share my view. I hope the scene rises again soon. If not, there will always be underground parties and CDs like this to bring you back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm a big fan of the original film and was excited to learn of this digitized remake. The computer imaging and music were exceptional and fully satisfied my expectations for this type of film but the script and acting all but ruined the experience for me. The dialogue and plot seemed forced and fake. Daamen Krall (Caligari) and Doug Jones (Cesare) were wonderful in their roles yet I felt as if their talent was wasted on the weak script. The remaining actors were amateur at best seemed to be drowning in each other's over exaggerated dialogue and motions.Overall The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Remix) was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Lame.

Nothing compares to the original music from the motion picture soundtrack and Oscar Promo as it is so beautiful and touching. The short story, film, and the music have touched me deeply.

The music of the soundtrack, sounds as if it's being performed a quarter or a half step out of phase.It sounds terrible!

Skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tish, we hardly knew ye","review":"Yes, this book is a rehash of Diamonds and Diplomats but with one huge difference. In D&D Ms. Baldridge was not entirely frank. Since many of the people she wrote about in that book were still alive she had to sugar coat the truth considerably. Now, with Lady First she is free to set the record straight.She explains fully for the first time why she really left the White House and although she clearly adored Clare Booth Luce she's now free to show that working for her was no picnic.Also, we get a superior picture of the author herself. Bold or pushy, if you prefer she charted her own course and made her own dreams come true whether it was to get herself to Paris or into the CIA or to be the first American female tourist in Yugoslavia after WWII.If you think of Leticia Baldrige as just being the etiquette lady or you only remember her from her White House stint then this book will will show you an entirely different side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Class from the past!","review":"Oh! how I wish I had a life like Tish Baldridge's!

What if everyone decided to rewrite and recast their life. You should do it the way you want first go round. Also, it just seems that the author writes book after book after book based on the fact that she was Jackie's secretrary for two and a half years. It's obvious this book was also intended to be marketed as yet another Jackie book by the cover picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breezy and self-absorbed.","review":"Mrs. Baldrige wrote this in a light, 'skipping the surface' style that presented the events of her life in the Kennedy White House and the embassies of Paris and Rome without seriousness or substance. Surely Mrs. Baldrige has experienced more than being in the company of the 'best' people being served 'top notch' food and wine. Surely her life has held more interesting moments than the time she seated people incorrectly at an embassy dinner. Surely Mrs. Kennedy had more on her mind than being irritated that others thought she was 'so lucky to have Tish!' This book is only for those who are fascinated with titbits like the above.

I have every one of Ann's books, and I have not been dissapointed. The lady can tell a story. I purchased this book with seconds to spare before I had to board a plane from ATL to LAX. Oh what a sad story this is.. Bart Corbin(the villan) through his own admission, took two lives for absolutely no reason at all other than to satisfy his own pychotic, demented views: They were going to leave him, and he couldn't let that happen. Two families devasted, children left without a mother, and the senseless loss of a loved one, taken in an instant by a monster.

This is not her best or her worst, but as usual I pick out a few errors. Here is the biggest faux pas: (pg 354) MOST MEN IN JAIL AND PRISON DON'T HURT WOMEN AND TAKE A HARSH VIEW OF PRISONERS ACCUSED OF KILLING THEM. INMATES CHARGE WITH CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN OR CHILDREN WHO ARE HOUSED IN THE GENERAL POPULATION ARE PRONE TO ACCIDENTS FOR WHICH NO WITNESSES COME FORWARD. Where was Ann's editor when she submitted this? I worked at Montana State Prison and it is full of domestic offenders who have repeatedly hurt, abused and/or killed women. No that is not correct, a very LARGE percentage of men in prison hurt women. Typically other inmates don't like child molesters and target them, but so many inmates are guilty/convicted of domestic violence that those people are not typically a target. Give me a break, you have been writing crime novels for years, how could you have made such an ignorant statement?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me. one dimensional characters.","review":"Nearly perfect wife-victim and suspect-husband-dentist with no redeeming qualities other than being tall, good looking, and witty are the main characters!

I looked up his filmography and didn't even see the one I'd seen (if similar) listed. I'd love to know. I am fairly certain it was about a hot-shot dentist who killed two women (one a girlfriend from the past - he got away with that one - and his current wife).

His coldness and feelings of superiority are frightening.I also enjoyed reading the investigators' techniques especially being able to trace locations of the cell phone calls.

I got hooked when I read Stranger Beside Me, that was a cool book, this is not so. In her books, there are two kind of characters: the victim is always like an angel like creature, always smiling, always welcoming, always active in the church. The criminal is always bad, coming from broken families, doing all sort of bad things. Everybody, even the most savage killer has a good side, and even the most angelic victim has a bad side, this is not the case anymore in this book.

Some are just beautiful songs, like my favorite; \\"Hello My Friend\\", which is a beautifully lush, summer-in-the-park, lyin'-on-your-back-staring-at-the-clouds daydream.(most of my girlfriends like that song the best too)"},{"rating":"1","title":"soooo incredibly bad.","review":"Also gets my vote for \\"Worst Album of 2001\\". If you wanna get ridiculous about things, I'll add my two cents as well: Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music is better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it really is that bad.","review":"Not sure what else I can add to the on the money write ups for this CD already available here, other than the fact that the Beanweevils are one of the most immature groups I've heard in a long time. I consider myself to be pretty open minded about most humorous things, but this stuff just isn't even mildly funny. And they compare themselves to Frank Zappa? That's probably the funniest thing about this band. Other than that, their singing reminds me of really bad Manhattan Transfer (is there good M.T.?) and the music capable but nothing to write home about. I wish I could have given it no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless playground semantics.","review":"Lewd, crude, and outright obnoxious, the Beanweevils enjoy singing \\"comedic\\" songs about women's vaginas falling off (\\"Plak\\"), and women with hairy nipples (\\"Sherry\\"), while also exhibiting a boring need to put down the popular kids (\\"Notice Me\\" and \\"Sucker\\") and other groups that have been insulted by countless (and much better) bands (\\"Deadhead\\"). A completely pointless excursion that culminates into nothing more than a giant CD that comes off as one big fart joke. Trouble is, no one bothered to tell The Beanweevils that they weren't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than a migraine.","review":"A friend of mine purchased this one for me, knowing I liked humorous pop. I have to say that I wished she hadn't as nothing on here is very \\"funny\\". It's more than a little mean, often clueless, and forgettably dirty. \\"Plak!\\" is crude beyond comprehension and the rest of the album continues on a lewd streak that proves the band has nothing interesting to play or sing. Everyone should just give this one a wide berth. Hopefully the Beanweevils will go back into obscurity after this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is funny?","review":"I never thought I'd hear anything more pointless than a Jeff Foxworthy routine. Now I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does stuff like this get recorded in the first place?","review":"The Beanweevils. A few old dudes get together and attempt to be funny. A sense of humor is definitely not required for this disc because the jokes are about as laughable as Rip Taylor's toupee. In reality, these guys' \\"career\\" in music should last about two weeks. Unfortunately, they probably have a fan base of 13 year old kids who can push them into a third or fourth week. By all means, stay far away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply rotten.","review":"Arguably the worst album of the year. One listen to singer Kelly Amthor on here and you'll understand why she's depicted as the large-breasted cartoony character on the band's website; she certainly has no talent in the vocal department."},{"rating":"1","title":"I laughed so hard, no one heard it!","review":"This is what music is coming to these days? I found this disc in a local used store from a buck. What a waste! Granted, I should have probably opened up the booklet and read how stupid the lyrics were, which would have promptly caused me to put the disc back. It's not that the words are \\"shocking\\" so much as they are just simply immature. Come on, another song about making fun of deadheads? Yawn. \\"Dirty\\" tunes about peep shows, hairy breasts, and a ridculous idea about a woman's vagina falling off? Lame beyond all comprehension. The Beanweevils should grow up. Their music is a drag, too, sounding like a worse version of the Starland Vocal Band, if you can imagine such a thing. Save your money, even if it is only a dollar! I hope the band members didn't quit their day jobs to record this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good product","review":"We find this product to be good overall. It is a little complex to buckle the harness but other than that we are very happy. It is roomy and comfortable for my almost 2 year old. He likes the cup holder and mesh pocket to put small toys in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the quality we expected","review":"We ordered this seat online because it wasn't available at stores in our area. We received the seat today and I was not impressed at all. The seatbelt guides are attached to the fabric, not the actual seat and seem flimsy to me. Also, the padding for the seat is quite minimal- I couldn't imagine having to sit in it for more than a few minutes. The hard plastic is easily felt through the cover. I like the look of this seat, but in this case looks were deceiving. We will be returning this one for one that looks a little more sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy construction","review":"We bought this same seat in a different pattern 3 months ago. The guides for the harness keep coming out because they only pop into the seat thru the fabric. I can't count how many times I have looked back to see my son playing with them. When we had to remove the cover to wash it, it was very difficult to put back together. To top it all off, yesterday, I pulled the strap in the front to tighten the belts, and the lever you push down to adjust the straps broke free from the frame. Hardly what I would expect after only 3 months of use. It is a nice looking seat, but overall unimpressed with the poor construction. We're going to take it back and pay the extra money for the Britax. We have one of those that has made it through 2 kids and is still like new. Worth the $$$. Don't buy the Eddie Bauer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't look comfortable","review":"I purchased this seat for our second car after buying the Eddie Bauer High Back Booster in Glacier from a Babies R Us store. I liked that one, and I figured this one would be similar. I thought the price was less because maybe it was an older pattern. However, when I got this seat, I was surprised to find that the quality seemed to be much lower than my other seat. It was very hard without much padding. The cover didn't seem very secure and the seat belt guides seemed flimsy. I am returning this seat, and I guess I will just get another one in Glacier like my first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel and grandma & grandpa's car","review":"We chose this seat as a second car seat for our toddler. We use it on planes and when we visit my in-laws. The main attractions were the light weight and low cost. I also liked the wide range of weights and heights of children it can accomodate. It is much easier to have this simple seat on hand than having to move our large, heavy Britax out of one car and into another, let alone dragging it through an airport! I'm sure that it won't get the wear and tear that other reviewers describe, but for these limited purposes it is terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stereo!","review":"Good price, along with the Pioneer CD-i200 iPod Adapter Cable DEH-P4900iB and DEH-P5900iB Car Stereo and good speakers make a killer system."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to HTC?","review":"I received this mobile base a couple weeks ago after waiting ten days. Opened it and was surprised how lightweight it was. Upon inventorying the parts I discovered that the wheels were not a close match; one was a quarter inch larger than the other and 3/8\\" narrower. At Amazon's suggestion, I called HTC and was told they would send out a replacement. I received it ten days later.After assembling the base I carefully lowered my drill press onto it. The base, although specifically for this model, it almost 1 1/2\\" wider and 1 1/2\\" longer than the Delta drill press base. I have little faith in this base as it is just too wimpy for this 400 pound drill press. The front brake is a poorly designed device that has to be clamped onto the frame in a make-shift manner. The back brakes and axels are of equally poor quality. I expect to have problems.I have several older HTC products and I have been pleased with them. So far this one is off to a shakey start. Pun intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headed in the Wrong Direction","review":"While this album boasts some of Miles' alumni such as Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul, Miroslav Vitous and Airto Moreira it can't hold a candle to In A Silent Way, Bitches Brew or even Live-Evil. The pieces seem more like aimless sketches that are pleasent to listen to but ultimately go nowhere. It is a shame because of all of Shorter's albums with Miles and his solo albums before he joined Weather Report are hands down classics, after this he was just never the same. This was only the beginning of the end. After this, Weather Report descended into a bland jazz funk. For a more satisfying listen try any of Miles' 70's stuff or Wayne Shorter's Super Nova with a similar line up but far more adventurous sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cantore at his best","review":"Jim Cantore is the best weather report guy I've ever seen. This band is the perfect showcase for his talent. There have been many great weathermen in my lifetime. There's the great Tommy Bevacqua, Jim Flowers, Doc Sanguinary, and Tim Simpson. Cantore is in his own class. This guy doesn't just cover the weather, he goes out of the way to find the worst weather in the country to laugh at it. That's why this CD works. Cantore reading weather bulletins while riding an F5 tornado is just flat entertaining because you know the tornado won't phase him. He goes surfing in hurricanes because it makes him a better surfer. Tom Bevacqua would never do things like that and you shouldn't expect him to, get off his case. Cantore is just a cut above like I am in regards to picking up women. You may be able to get a date, but I can get 3. That's the essence of Cantore, he's always a step ahead of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the pain","review":"After dragging myself through the first book which was ponderous and hard to become interested in, I decided to give #2 a try. BIG MISTAKE! I should have read all of the reviews first, because I would have learned what a slow, poorly written mistake this book was. The hero is a bumbling hothead who gets himself into trouble, and his friends, through amazing leaps of logic, devise the trouble he is in and how to get him out of it without telling him first. The villan accidentally kills himself at the end as the hero lies dying... not much of a struggle, there. It was frustrating to go through all those pages only to find that the characters could have sat on their butts and got to the same conclusion without going through so much trouble. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the first Newcomb book I have read...","review":"...and it's also the last. Was Newcomb paid by the word on this novel? The rhetoric of his main wizard characters is distracting and downright annoying. Newcomb insults his readers by having his characters explain in great detail obvious plot points. The characters are stereotypical and flat. The story is predictable and slow. This book was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth it","review":"First I want to note that most of the reviews are either glowing, five star reviews, or they are very negative. It seems like Newcomb and his friends are at it again, writing false reviews. I mean give me a break! One so-called reviewer says, Goodkind's books don't hold a torch to these.\\" And another is counting the days until the next book! The worst thing is that I can even spot the repetitive grammar and poor English in these reviews that is a hallmark of Newcomb's writing! I read this book just to see if he'd improve. I was especially interested because I was personally acquainted with his bragging. I'd feel sorry for him if it weren't for this. Back to the book, the characters were flat and the story boring. The female characters are ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Del Rey should be ashamed","review":"Ok, even a publisher who has sunk a lot of money into a longshot author needs to know when to quit. With the tide of crappy books on the market these days, Robert Newcomb has made his mark as the worst of the worst. Yet here is his second book, carefully packaged despite the howls of protest from fantasy fans such as myself who believed the hype about the first one, then read it and wondered if we had purchased the same book.More of the same brutal and inconsisent nonsense fills this book, with dull characters and a stupid plot. Spare yourself! Skip this book. And ignore every piece of marketing from Del Rey from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Bad Ending","review":"In a nutshell, nothing the heros did or might have done made any difference. The bad guys lose on a technicality and the author spends 20 or so pages explaining what the technicality was. If the good guys stayed home talking about how hopeless the situation was for the entire book, instead of 90% of it, the result would have been the same.Don't waste your time on this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A near worthless effort","review":"This book is plodding and ponderous. The plot does not flow. Like the first book, Newcomb seems incapable of effectively linking plot elements. And the practice of displaying the thoughts of characters in italics, while unique and clever in the beginning of the first book, has long since become tedious and ridiculous in the second book. If the book was written well, the reader would \\"know\\" the thoughts of key characters at important junctures in the book. I feel sorry for those who bought the second book, after the disaster that was Newcomb's first effort. Not sure what Newcomb does for a living, but he should not give up his day job to write. His is most certainly a weak talent for writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Hopes Dashed","review":"I really liked the first book in this series, it gave me high hopes that I had finally found another author to put in my rotation of must-buy books. This second outing is much much less notable - the hero could have never gotten involved and things would hardly change at all. I don't intend to ruin the story for anyone so I won't talk about it, but this author will have to work awfully damned hard to make this series worth reading after this. The writing is not bad, but the storyline and resolution needs help."},{"rating":"1","title":"biggest load of trash","review":"I pushed through the TFS but halfway through this one I absolutely forfeit.

First he does a really great job with character development. Through building the characters, then the plot. the author leads you to keep on guessing what's coming next in the story is a great formula to produce a great read. What I love most about this book is that you don't have to be a wrestling fan to be able to enjoy this book. That is a very big compliment to Mr. Baum as he writes so well that it pleases both the hardcore wrestling fan and someone who has never watched pro wrestling. Thank you Spencer for writing such an enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy for wrestling fans","review":"I got this for free but honestly, I would pay money for it.

This book was referred to me by his Teacher and boy did she nail it! It is very challenging to get my son to read different genre books because he is only interested in 'Animal' books. I've tried to introduce many different books that did not hold his attention. If the book didn't have an animal in the title or a picture of an animal on the cover, he was generally not interested. Well, this book changed all of that! His instruction is 20 minutes of reading every night - well, he read this book in its entirety the first night! He didn't want to put it down because he was really enjoying the characters and the storyline. Since then, he's more apt to reading 'other' books and seems to enjoy them also.

I didn't have a vhs tape recorder in those days when his tv specials first aired. I stuck my little Panasonic cassette recorder up next to the television to record the shows, but sadly, mostly all I recorded was static noise from the TV, as well as dogs barking and whatever else was going on in the house at the time. I think the first show I video recorded was \\"Swingtime\\". But now I can enjoy all of them on DVD. He is truly a wonderful showman, just go to his Las Vegas show to see the packed seats and you'll know his popularity has never waned. I know he is planning to tour for a bit, hopefully make a live concert DVD of it! In the meantime, enjoy this set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Weak Effort From a Fine Writer","review":"Too long, too convoluted and too many characters. I enjoyed The Skull Mantra very much but the series may be played out. There are simply too many implausible turns in this book, too many coincidences to be believable. Plus, I'm a bit weary of having the cruelty and perfidy of the Chinese thrown at me on every page. I know it's all true and actually much worse than what is portrayed but the repitition is tiresome. I think I'll skip Beautiful Ghosts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mystery or a polemic, but not both","review":"I have read Mr. Patison's first two Tibetan mysteries and found them compelling and heartbreaking in terms of their portrayal of Tibetan culture under the Chinese occupation. Sadly, I could not finish Bone Mountain (over 200 pages in) because in this particular case, the political position Mr. Patison advances (one I am in agreement with, by the way) just swamps any attempt at creating a mystery novel. I would willingly read a non-fiction book by Mr. Patison regarding the Chinese occupation of Tibet and I would like to go on reading his mystery series, but in this case it was literally too painful to go on. More mystery, less politics in the next ones, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another lesson in Tibetan culture doubling as a political thriller and mystery","review":"I really enjoy Pattison's Inspector Shan series novels because they work on several levels. First, they educate the reader about Tibetan culture. Second, they are intriguing mysteries. And, third, they are a damning indictment of the Chinese oppression of Tibet. In all cases, Tibetan culture forms the backbone of the mystery. In order to accomplish this, Pattison displays a masterful understanding of Tibetan culture and Buddhism (which are one and the same)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A course in tibetan Buddhism wrapped inside an excellent mystery","review":"I've long been fascinated by Tibet and wished I could travel there, especially go back in time before the Chinese invaded and began \\"reclaiming\\" the country. This book became a virtual journey for me into that mystical buddhist culture. It also satisfied my need for a good mystery story. But it did even more important: it turned my attention to the ways the Chinese have brutalized the Tibet people, especially the Tibetan monks and nuns, and marginalized them to the point of near extinction. Whenever a novel can entertain and inform as this one did, I rate it as a book not only to read but one to keep and reread -- and recommend to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow-up from previous books","review":"This book, and the whole series is brilliant! Loved every moment of it and it is a good story, well told while describing the landscape and the people in detail. A must read in my own opinion.However I was also shocked to read what the Han are doing to the rest of the population and specific to the Tibetans. I did not know it was this bad, and further research confirmed it is. I think the Han have taken genocide and Nazism to a new height.

He captures the classroom perfectly and two friends in a nursing home with great depth of emotion. However, I would not even believe that Hometown was written by the same man!!! He has too many characters in this book and his plot jumps from one thing to another in order to give us a bird's eye view of small town life. I grew up in a small town and thought I would really enjoy his latest effort. Instead, I found it a real effort to get to the conclusion of the book. I was so glad when it was done!!! I would not even give this book to my worst enemy. I wish I could get my money back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to its promise","review":"This one was a disappointment. Unlike HOUSE, where Kidder was able to keep a strong narrative drive, here we are introduced to characters, brought into their lives and then left hanging. Julia, Alan, the Mayor, the stripper Alan had the affair with, they just don't serve the narrative drive of the book. The portrait of Tommy was unsatisfying as a result - every time he was absent, the story bogged down. There was so much more to know about him - for instance, for someone so attached to family and hometown, why was there no mention of his interactions with his siblings, other than one phone call from a brother. If he's estranged, I want to know, if they're tight, that's important too.What's more, I felt this tone throughout of an intellectual observer dropping in to a place and discovering that there is nobility and understanding in \\"real people\\". Rather than celebrating these people, the treatment felt condescending."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD ONLY BE A HOMETOWN FAVORITE","review":"There is no question about it -- if you live in or around Northampton, Massachusetts, you will probably enjoy this book more than others. To the outsider, this is a trip through Anytown, USA with some \\"real\\" characters who are all so borderline that you can't actually relate to any of them. Tommy O'Connor is the winner of the American dream award proving that if you dream it you can achieve it. It's hard not to be rooting for him all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real disappointment...","review":"There's no question that Northampton is a fastinating place. But this book fails to capture it or to sustain the reader's interest, probably because the author chooses an uninteresting central character. Some of the secondary characters provide a spark of interest, but ultimately the book disappoints in a major way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home Town is non-fiction that reads like fiction.","review":"\\"Home Town\\" is quite like the town of Northampton itself: It is non-fiction that reads like fiction. Or, maybe I should say the book FEELS like fiction.Kidder holds no punches when it comes to revealing the town's many characters. He has done a wonderful job of explaining to us that this is essentially the town's appeal, not its yuppie-induced reputation of \\"small-town utopia.\\" Kidder's honesty and attention to the human details is what makes reading this book a kind of mythic experience... almost like BEING in Northampton. I know not because I grew up in Northampton: I lived in another nearby town very briefly, and had frequently visited Northampton, the town-as-spectacle.Kidder's account is simply authentic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glossed Over","review":"A bit of an over-dramtic piece of work about an elitist, hyper-liberal, zero-tolerance community, known to normal working class people in the surrounding towns as a place to, \\"stay away from\\". Northampton is FAR from the typical New England town. As a matter of fact it's pretty much different than just about any other town you might come across, save Greenwich Village or SF's Gay Quarter. Kidder definitely de-emphasizes Northampton's \\"weirdness\\". It's one of the few towns in America where homosexuals have actually assaulted heterosexuals based on gender preference (it's in the police records). \\"Hometown\\" was an interesting read, but it seemed Tracy Kidder was viewing this community through rose colored glasses. I kept wondering if he had taken a certain amount of artistic license to make the characters and story line seem more rich and folky. In conclusion, this is an interesting book...if you've never been to Northampton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Boring","review":"I had high expectations for this book. However, I found myself skipping pages and feeling very disappointed. Kidder did not engage me at all, his writing was prosaic in the worse sense, and the pace of the book was plodding. Read \\"The Shipping News\\", \\"The Kite Runner\\", \\"Three Junes\\", \\"The Complete Short Stories of Flannery O'Connor\\". While I realize that these books are fiction and Kidder's book is non-fiction, I still felt that I was reading a bad \\"Dragnet\\" script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing insight, patience and humanity","review":"\\"Home Town\\" is a gem of a book that will probably not get the recognition it deserves because it touches on so many fields, ranging from religion to law enforcement to urban planning to romance. Tracy Kidder's portrait of Northampton, Mass. is nicely balanced between affectionate and warts-and-all, and it proves its point that there is an awful lot of life even in a (relatively) small city such as \\"Hamp.\\" Kidder focuses on several interesting people, but the main vehicle is policeman Tommy O'Connor. This book has a light touch, but some ultimately deep insights on the nature of a community and what makes it the way it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A series of disconnected anecdotes","review":"If I wanted a travelogue describing the life and history of Northampton, MA, this would fit the bill. But this is the only sense in which this book makes sense. It is a disjointed series of editorials about eccentric personalities, some of which are mildly entertaining or amusing or sad, but none of which seem to have any relevance to anything other than the fact that the people described are residents of Northampton. I thought there was going to be a continued storyline about a cop accused of child molestation, but even that did not have adequate follow-through, and the story as described (even if it was based on a true story) did not ring true, but that may have been due to the lack of continuity and the capsule style of writing in which each chapter is a little capsule of life in Northampton. I would have to be either very attached to or personally interested in the town of Northampton to have found this book worthy of my time and attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure that anyone can relate to","review":"I just finished reading Hometown and oved it.

I haven't seen either of these in awhile because I never bothered to watch them again.. Instead I found some more useful Sklansky DVD's, but prefer just reading and noting useful information...Recently I left my job to play poker full time.. I'd recommend Sklansky books...

This \\"New York\\" installment is particularly good. The book is broken down into sections like \\"History\\", \\"Culture\\", \\"Economy\\" etc., and each section is thoughtfully written and edited. The \\"History\\" section is especially good and is very inclusive.My only negative criticism has to do with the timeline at the end of the book; some things are included there that are very puzzling. For instance, it spotlights the election of Mario Cuomo to the governorship of New York. Why? Why did his election merit a spot on the timeline and not Nelson Rockefellor, FDR or the great Al Smith? Otherwise, this is a great book"},{"rating":"2","title":"In-depth, education with its own fallacies","review":"David Fischer's book is a good resource for any reader, specifically those in the discipline of history. It identifies and explains possible pitfalls with any type of investigative reporting. The book is divided into 3 sections: Inquiry, Explanation and Argument which cover the main areas these fallacies can occur. Since everything is relative, others have found fallacies in Fischer's work(s), this one is no different. I was assigned this book for a graduate course on historiography.

Example: don't use statistics unless you actually know what you are doing with them. It lost all hope for me when he broke his own rules when showing examples. Let he who is without sin...There may be something worthwhile in this book, but it is terribly pretentious, and reads like it was written in 1824. Badly in need of a decent editor to cut out the excess, and shrink it to a size comparible with the actual information in it.

One thing I can't stand is a lot of time wasted during a workout.

It is great that the workouts show different levels depending on where you are in the process - beginner, intermediate, advanced. Seeing the different options motivates you to work harder to move up to more challenging exercises. The option to mute the music is great too so you can have your own playlists in the background. I own and have attempted pretty much every workout video out there and have really connected with this one. I am seeing results and am excited to do the workouts each day.

I am consider myself a beginner for exercise level, and this series really made me feel successful at my level but challenges me to try harder. I can't imagine getting to level four - that looks HARD! Although I am not finished with the 12 week program, I am already seeing results and can't wait to see what the following weeks bring. This is an awesome workout and a must get for everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with this workout!","review":"This workout is neither hard nor challenging at all. This is an absolute beginner workout. I have been working out with DVDs for years now and was hoping for something to mix up my routine but this DVD series was a complete waste of money. Plus the instructor is so annoying it is really hard to not put it on mute. She talks too much and explains the moves between the reps far too detailed plus she takes water break all the time. This workout is not hard, I don't know why she needs to drink water all the time. This makes the breaks between the reps far too long. Plus the the people in the DVD, including the instructor, do not seem to be in a great shape. If this is the result of this workout than I'd rather skip this one. If you workout on an intermediate or advanced level then do not get this workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality filming!","review":"Such poor quality sound and video!

I thought maybe she was having an off day and the other DVD's would be better...so I used them all. Every one that is lead by the primary instructor has very same negative comments and some are quite odd and inappropriate.

I am now in week 2 of this program and I am starting to see changes in my body."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"Overall, this is a pretty good program. The instructor does a great job of giving all different levels of difficulty. I have done P90x, P90x2, insanity, chalean, insanity asylum etc and this is pretty much a step below P90X as far as strength training and no where near insanity with cardio. With that being said, it was still a good workout and I enjoyed it.the one negative I would say is the instructor repeating the same jokes on all the tapes. If i hear her say she is taking the guys man card one more time I might scream...anyways, it is a good workout and definitely worth the reasonable price. I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice supplement to Zumba videos","review":"Based on my past experience at the gym, the two classes I enjoyed the most are Zumba for cardio and Body Pump for strength. Since I decided I would rather work out at home according to my own schedule, I purchased this program for the weights portion while using Zumba videos for cardio. I did try the Cardio disc in this set but found it less motivating for me personally than Zumba. Although I may not be using this program the way it was originally intended, I can still recommend it for those who desire a complete exercise program at a price lower than one month of gym membership and much less than the cost of P90X. Not much equipment is required, only a set of dumbbells and/or resistance bands along with a mat. Stay healthy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I just started my third week.

In addition to the boring work out I caught a couple of other flaws such as the host tucking her shirt in her pants before doing the mountain climbers which in my opinion should have been properly clothed and prepared for the work outs, and even observed her pulling her \\"wedgie\\". I was appalled, this isnt a laughing matter, I was turned off and immediately returned the prodcut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading cover art","review":"I have nothing to do with this program, yet I've found my stock photo being used on the cover and website.

Not only do you get a complete training guide to help you mentally and physically prepare to get back in shape but you also have free downloads for additional tracking tools and online support. The 8 DVDs cover a total body workout and it is nice to see real people sweating it out showing it can be done by all levels of experience. I also love the idea of taking a before picture to have as a daily reminder and an after picture to show how far you have come along with the tracking tools. Definitely worth the money and would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I have done many of the beachbody videos - P90, P90X, turbojam, turbofire. I like to workout and have been doing it for 20 years. I just wanted a different workout that was more weight training and less cardio specifically designed for women. I couldnt get through the first video. I was so dissapointed in the music, the main trainer's personality (I like Tony Horton and Chalean a lot - they push you to do your best!) and the overall appearance of the video. It is probably good if you are looking at no frills, no extra basic workout and you have your own music. It just was not a cheaper version of a beachbody workout which is what I was looking for. Oh well, different people are looking for different things in a workout as the other reviews seemed like it really works for some!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of talking little action","review":"It's nothing like the cover.The women in the video don't have the strength or the shape portrayed in the misleading cover of this DVD.Once you are in front of the screen ready to sweat and give it your best, what you get is a lot of talking and explaining and joking and very little actual exercising. I was looking for a real challenging, result-producing workout, this was neither. I'm going to try Insanity next, I want to be pushed to my limit and not waste one minute of my designated work out time. X-TrainFit is not what it promises to be, don't judge a DVD by it's cover...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"This is a great program for the price. I am more of the gym type of person for cardio, so I really use this for the strength/sculpt workouts along with the Cardio/Circuit Training for days I can't make it to the gym. I can see that my body is toning and I am not really following the program by the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The camera angles in this DVD set were terrible.

Good for a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"The workout videos are fine but you will want to mute your tv after the second time around. The trainer seems to have forgotten that the people who buy the video will most likely be doing it over and over. Which means that you will have to hear Stephanie tease the men about having their \\"man cards\\" over and over and you will have to hear the same stories and comments which really have nothing to do with the workout. I found myself rolling my eyes and getting annoyed with the chit chat. If you want a good workout with motivational chit chat only, I would recommend Jeanette Jenkins. You will get a better workout, better music and much less silly commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"I am now entering my second week of this program and I think it's great! I have read through a lot of the reviews and yes, Stephanie can be a bit annoying, but so what. What do you expect from an at-home workout DVD? I think a lot of people are too sensitive, she's trying to be funny and sarcastic and get your butt in gear.I am really please that there are 3 versions for every exercise as I'm just getting back into the grove and need to start out slow. I'm really excited to see the results after my 12 weeks are over - so far, I'm really sore (good sore) and motivated to keep working! Once I've gotten used to the workouts I'll probably mute the videos and use my own music - but I'm completely happy with this product. It was worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I look forward to doing it","review":"First of all, I am so glad I found this DVD set. I was searching for something that would work me out, but not as expensive or insane as P90X yet still had a good programme and results. I've just been working with this for a couple of days and I am sore (and I've been following levels 1 and 2 - alternating between the two). I actually look forward to it - maybe that's because there are 'normal' people in it. Half of the success is down to committment and I feel committed. I'm not exactly sure why, but I feel like its realistic, yet demanding enough, and I feel hopeful. I am someone who walks regularly - 5 days a week so I'm not a stranger to exercise. It may be that this programme is down to earth and professional - I even recognise some moves with a trainer I used to have. I also like that I can progress to levels 3 and 4. I look forward to completing the 12 weeks and see what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - for really out of shape people","review":"I have been doing insanity and wanted a new weight oriented workout.

Although I traditionally like to use my imagination to determine what happens to the characters in the future. But, surprisingly enough, McFadden decided to tell us all that we wondered about. She brilliantly draws all of the character's lives together in one, neat ball. We see how each character was dependant, unbeknownst in them on each other. Their lives are intertwined and always would be. We even learn where those tiny pieces of paper that Sugar sent into the wind landed. This novel was breathtaking, intriguing, filled with symbolisms and depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Author","review":"This Bitter Earth, I loved it. I think she wrote the story the way it was supposed to go. It wasn't about healing. It was about how so much love can drive you to hatred and what happens when that hatred consume. I think sometimes you need a happy ending and she knew we needed it after the ending of Sugar. She had to show us that Sugars of the world can be whole, happy beings. That the world doesn't always get to tear us down. You mentioned that Sugar didn't love herself but this book shows us just how she came to love herself partially through knowing who she was and where she came from and having the love of the Taylors.

Caribe Atomico, their last release, was a stylistic breakthrough - a playful combination of traditional Latin and electronica. (Think Everything but the Girl with magic realist leanings.) Gozo Poderoso, their latest, while less experimental, is pure enjoyment. (The English title is Powerful Joy.) GP is darker and trippier than its predecessor, and more assured. On Caribe Atomica, multi-instrumentalist Hector Buitrago and vocalist/guitarist Andrea Echeverri were stretching their traditional roots. The results were thrilling while the strain was apparent. Here they glide though 13 tracks with all the buoyancy the title implies. Echeverri is a smooth chanteuse, and Buitrago's bag of sonic tricks elevate the songs to otherworldly places."},{"rating":"2","title":"mellowed out","review":"aterciopelados are a great band. i was disappointed that they turned in \\"el dorado\\"'s distortion pedal for \\"gozo poderoso\\"'s turntables. i suppose it comes with maturity. very good indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"They forgot to mention the album art!","review":"This is the first/only album of theirs that I have (yet) - so I don't know if this is their \\"style\\" - but the CD packaging is a beautiful trippy thing!

My two favourite songs are Luz Azul and El Album. Even my teenaged daughter likes the CD and is learning to sing along with the Spanish refrains. I am going to order the CD they made after this one and work my way forward.Edited to add that after 2 weeks of listening to Gozo Poderoso I love it even more. It gets better and better.

While this wasn't exactly a \\"great\\" deal, it most certainly introduced me to what has now become my favorite cologne of all time.I've tried them all and especially like fragrances such as Obsession. But the appeal to Insurrection is the pleasant, but not overwhelming smell. It's a sweet smell which I like a lot better than the powdery/perfumey ones. Blech!You still want to be cautious in the amount of Insurrection you put on, but they make it easy for you with a convenient spray.

However, like many readers I found the knowledge of Sebastian's future infidelity not only out of character but also contradictory to what (i thought) Laurens was trying to get at: the characters' eternal love. Personally, I thought Laurens would have used the prequel to explain (ADEQUATELY) Sebastian's infidelity. I think it would have been more in character if his little affair with Scandal's mother had occurred before he'd met Helena.Anyhow, as for the book itself. I found it boring and lacklustre. Instead of completing the Cynster circle, it only contradicted the 'fairy-tale' endings of the other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating, Sensual, Wonderful","review":"I have read all of Stephanie Laurens books and this was yet another great one. I could not put it down. Sebastion and Helena were intense and sensual. I am not surprised that Ms. Laurens books are being put in hardback now. Her writing is certainly good enough to deserve it.She knows how to please readers, going just far enough with her characters but not too far.

The story of Sebastian and Helena as young lovers was a typical Laurens story, paced well, interesting people, good story, passionate and powerful attraction and sex. It stands alone quite well. However, I didn't believe that these people -- Sebastian and Helena turned into the people described in Devil's Bride and the rest of the series.Young, beautiful, intelligent, captivating, so thoroughly loved by a powerful man, Helena would have still been beautiful and desirable as a woman in her late 50's, not the dowager described. The incredibly self-possessed, powerful Sebastian who kept a sprig of mistletoe under glass for seven years would never have fathered an illegitimate child with a lonely wife in Scotland in the first years of his marriage, if ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"honestly could not finish this book","review":"Honestly, it's been years, but this is one of very few romance novels that I started and could not finish. Like others, I was a devoted fan of the Cynster series and knew about the illegitimate child/affair that would occur later on (and I didn't buy the he-felt-sorry-for-this-Scottish-woman-and-had-sex-with-her story).I remember liking the book and the characters in general, but it was constantly nagging me in the back of my mind that the \\"hero\\" would have an affair down the line in derogation of the passionate love being proclaimed in this novel. Eventually I couldn't read anymore . . . I just felt horrible for Helena and couldn't view Sebastian with anything but doubt and skepticism (all I could think was LIAR).And I totally agree with others - I wish the hero and heroine had been any other couple rather than Helena and Sebastian (then I could have enjoyed it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bittersweet...","review":"Does Stephanie Laurens really have to write Sebastian and Helena's story? The other Cynster books already gave a preview to their marriage. It's quite a spoiler to know that Sebastian will die before his sons get married (That means he's going to leave Helena and he's not going to see his grandchilden. What decent grandparent wouldn't want to witness the birth of his first grandchild before he die?) then there's the infidelity thing (I mean, he could have fathered Richard against his free will but NO he still have his wits when he did it!). I could certainly rant and rave about this more and give it only 1 star. BUT the story's still good (if you don't know the Cynsters yet). So I gave it a 2 (I still could get over what I know will happen in the future. So I can't give it a 3)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Love Stephanie Laurens.

Knowing that Sebastian is going to be unfaithful to Helena in the future made me unable to get into the book. I mean how can you credit happily ever after when the hero has a child with someone else? That ruined the book for me. I'm with one of the other reveiwers who said that Stephanie Laurens should have had Richard's mother drug Sebastian as Catroina did Richard. That would at least had made the cheating understandable AND made this book something worth reading!

That means saying no to the gleaming stainless steel grills that are the size (and price) of my car. I like this one because it's as basic as they get. I start a fire, set the grill above the coals an hour later, and it's ready to go. No, it's not fancy, but it does a great job. My only complaint is that the rotisserie spit has only one skewer, which makes it hard to balance a whole chicken. If there were three or four spears, it would hold the fowl more firmly. For the price, it's a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Camp fire rings","review":"on temporary assignment in colorado and couldn't take the summer without bbq. so, i found this to fit my needs. the stand fits perfectly in the fire rings that we've encountered in the national park camp sites we've visited here in colorado. i have not experienced any issues balance, i've prepared full meals on the grill, beans (pot on grill), corn, steaks, and a full chicken, without worrying about the balance or having any issue with. the construction is durable it doesn't show any weaknesses at this point.the grill locks in by screw and pin, the rotisserie locks in by screw. i've cooked a large chicken with no issues or slippage.issues:1) only quarter turns on rotisserie2) rotisserie rod not 'locked' in (horizontally)so the rod may slip out when adjusting.

Maybe someone will take it and recycle it. Do not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding product!","review":"This is an excellent product and well made. I rated it only four stars instead of five, however, because in time the spit/rotisserie bracket (which is held in place with only thumb screws) may need to be drilled out and held in place with a pin. Other than that, the construction is outstanding, and very versatile. Those who say they object to the fact that the spit is not adjustable height have obviously not read the directions. Very easy to assemble, and will be easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great in Camp","review":"Perfect for any kinds of BBQ /rotisserie Chicken. Grill is great..! but keep in mind the rotisserie is meant for slow cooking. You may spent up to 4hrs or more on the chicken to be fully cook. Just a tip, if you getting bored, just put the fire wood or charcoal on top of the grill to make the cooking faster, because even if you put the rotisserie on the lowest level wont do it. The fire is too low and it takes awhile to really cook the chicken inside.. so put the fire wood on top of the grill!!! Easy to assemble, I just wished they put more holes on it to make it more secure.. Please..Please.. bring your pliers.. it will wobble if the screws are not tight. that's the most complaint i have seen on the other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint/Coating burnt off","review":"This item was easy to set up, but hard to re-adjust when in use, you have to unscrew the winged screws to lower the rotisserie which is not easy to do when its hot and a chicken is already on the spit (Two People Needed with gloves).The spit is one center pole and a secondary stabilizing pole, this didn't do a very good job holding the wobbly chicken steady. I would have rather had two of the 4 pronged holders.The grilling part had an issue with the coating burning off and flaking when heated by the fire, i had to scrape it real good before i put anything on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Poor Quality","review":"The Quickie Professional Mop model #020RM is terrible.

Whatever the truth might be, the authentic feel of this story will grab you and hold onto you until the end. Or is it the end?Is it possible to enjoy a story like this? You bet. N.L.

Here's what I mean. I was enthralled by the weather Belardes used so ably, almost in becoming another character in the story. In a place like Bakersfield where weather tends to be so singularly routine, the weather breathed its way into the story and I found myself I becoming more present to what was taking place as the characters lived and breathed the changing conditions.First the fog enveloped everything, and I could feel the cold, damp isolationist feel as I imagine Minstrel felt it settling onto his skin and into his lungs.... And into his psyche.The violence of an incredible valley dust storm foreshadowed destruction of a most insidious kind.The power of the natural force of weather, strong and almighty like the power of evil that blows throughout the captivating chapters of \\"Lords: Part one\\" and... does it continue to blow, today, too?Hmmm.

The incredible irony of John O'Neill's story is validation that truth can be stranger then fiction. To actually have the pioneer in the FBI, who first pointed out Osama ultimately die at the World Trade Center is an unbelievable twist of faith. Murray Weiss deserves all the credit in the world for writing such an outstanding book. He must have spent years researching all of the materials in this book. And in regards to Doug Hinkle from Washington, DC. It's extremely shortsighted of you to completely disregard all the information in this book. To find one date error in a 400 plus page book with countless names, dates, stories etc. and to use that one error as a reason not to enjoy such an incredible book is totally your loss.

Edgar Hoover was the director of the FBI, and in the photograph you can see Hoover standing in the front row. HOOVER DIED in 1972, he can't be director of anything, let alone the FBI in 1976. The guy identified in the photograph as John O'Neil is hard to see, he's in the back row, and is really just a blur. So my guess is, that this isn't John O'Neil FBI Class Photo. You'd think the editors of the book or Mr. Weiss would know when J. Edgar Hoover had died.

While the US did bomb Libya shortly after the German disco was bombed in 1996, the U.S. did not bomb Libya again after the Pan Am flight. Libya probably bombed Pan Am 103 in retaliation for the bombings on Libya in 1996.Considering that the topic of this book is terrorism, Weiss is either incompetent or deliberately misleading.

The war against terrorism will likely not be solved by cops with inflated egos who have a taste for expensive suits.Weiss is out of his depths when it comes to international affairs, and it shows. The book is full of bloopers like the following (which takes place in Aden, Yemen -- page 315) \\"As O'Neill stood in the hot Mediterranean sun examining the crime scene...\\" Aden is about as close to the Mediterranean as Los Angeles is to the Great Lakes.If you're interested, this is one item to check out of the public library rather than shell out bucks for.Balt Fosco, Queens NY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegetables","review":"My husband and I have decided to go vegan and this book is a life saver.I haven't ever bought a used book before and was very pleased as what good shape the book was in.

Cooking is something I'm passionate about as I make dinner 5-6 time a week, and I'm not talking mac'n cheese.The physical quality of the book is poor, the paper is the high acid type that will yellow and crumble quickly, and visually lacking. I feel sorry for the author because the few photos in the book look like something from a 70's Better Homes and Gardens, which my mom still has, which inspired me to cook beyond that stuff.I'd suggest the CIA books instead, as the recipes are better tasting and have some cred.Ruth Reichl's Gourmet cook book is a real winner, too, and never disappoints... good for the average kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything You Ever Wanted To Know ABout Vegetables.......","review":"James Peterson has put together a veritable encyclopedia about vegetables in this great book. It covers all the most common everyday vegetables, plus a large number of not so common vegetables. Recipes range from the very basic to the more complex, but there is certainly something for eveyone to be found in this book. One of my favorite recipes made from this book was Tomato Gratin With Bread, Cream And Bacon.

This is a well done expose (given the time and technology available) of the plight of the seasonal migrant worker (at the time, just about all Americans by birth; Caucasian and Black), and the difficulty of their life.I think what got me is that if Edward R Murrow thought this was a \\"Harvest of Shame\\" when this was made, he would have had a stroke if he knew what was going on now.. it was meant to be shocking and shameful, but it seemed quaint. That is not because of anything the makers did wrong, just on how times have changed so much.. if this had been produced today they wouldn't find a buyer, no one would care, too much apathy in the society, and suffering from empathy fatigue.. It is interesting that it caused such a stir when it came out.It is worth a watch to understand the different mindset that was there then, and how it is different now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required viewing","review":"Every school age child should watch this to gain a renewed apprecation for what they have now.

I didn't just unconsciously put it down and never pick it up again, I really couldn't read one more word. The characters are shallow as is the detail of the novel. Maybe that's the attraction for some readers, no important background information to bother with. This is definately the worst book I have ever read (or tried to read). Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Maintenance? Hardly.","review":"While this book had brights spots of solid writing, overall, the plot was largely boring and unrealistic and the protagonist insipid. Liv gets married when she is roughly 21 (what Manhattanite does that these days?), divorced at 26 and then immediately takes up with a crude, obnoxious, quasi-sadistic paramour with a penchant for biting. I oscillated between annoyance and indifference."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge waste of time!","review":"This book was bad but I thought I'd stick with it to the end anyway. Liv and Andrew are not very interesting characters, we hardly even get to know Liv throughout the book. The ending wasn't even very spectacular, I felt like I invested in my time with this book & got nothing in return. I would not read anything else by this author. Luckily, I came across a 5 star book, called ADDICTED, after this disaster...Thank god I didn't pay for it. I'll gladly return it to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange and stupid...but laughable","review":"This was the strangest and stupidest book I have ever read. Liv (the main character) does not in any way inspire a single woman, or recently divorced woman. Her life after divorcing her husband (Jack) gets more entangled and more ridiculous as you continue to read. I have a hard time putting down a book and not finishing it, and luckily this book did provide some laugh-out-loud moments as you realized just how stupid the story line is. The author seemed to ramble and the story jumped-around between flashbacks and current life entirely too much. I did not care that Liv remembered some strange smell from her childhood while looking at some pothole in front of her, and I did not care about her childhood at all in this story.I have read worse books, but not many, and will NOT recommend this book to anyone I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE THIS BOOK!!!

I did like Liv's sarcastic sense of humor but much of the book was so unrealistic that I couldn't relate. I prefer stronger female characters who do not stay with wierd unattactive married men who bite their ear's off! Also, the part about the gun seemed unrealistic even for Liv!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"When I bought this book, I was looking forward to it. When I finished it, I felt like I had lost two days of my life that I would never get back. It had potential, but after a while, I could not sympathize with the main character any longer. To anyone out there who is debating on whether or not to read this book, my recommendation is don't. It's not worth your time, trust me. I apologize to those who liked it, and cite a difference of opinion. :) Good luck to those who still brave a read after this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not my sense of humor","review":"I couldn't get into this book. I got maybe 30 pages and quit because I can't stand the main character's sense of humor. It may be called \\"gritty\\" or \\"edgy\\" but I think that it's immature and twisted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny or clever","review":"I read this book because somewhere it said it was the American version of Bridget Jones' Diary. All I can say is that this main character is really messed up. She was so frustrating, wimpy and whiny. I found it stange and stupid, but certainly not laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I am struggling through this book in an attempt to find out why it is a bestseller, and so far, I have no idea. The writing is stilted, silly, high school writing class material (ie. the \\"suitor\\" play on words on page 28, and the \\"jack\\" play on words on page 4). The character cries a lot in inappropriate settings, the writer tries in vain to beat humor out of a blind character (\\"I considered telling him there was a rainbow out his window even though there wasn't. When someone is blind you will do anything to make their world better.\\") Really distasteful stuff. The main character is mean and unappealing, and the writing can't save her. If you're looking for a humorous book about a single woman, try reading Jane Green. Her writing is much funnier and less self-indulgent than Jennifer Belle's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the Worst Book I Have Ever Read","review":"This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. With pathetic characters and unrealistic situations, the least you could hope for are a few good laughs. Unfortunately, Jennifer Belle does not even deliver that in &#65533;High Maintenance.&#65533; The stories the main character, Liv, tells are uninteresting and irrelevant (and she has uses a lot of curse words). The plot is stupid, and I do not think there was an appropriate closing to all the drama the novel involves. After reading this book, you are left feeling empty and are not the least bit amused. Plus, I was wondering, &#65533;Was this book 350 pages? It felt like 1,350.&#65533;"},{"rating":"1","title":"A True Disappointment","review":"A self-proclaimed aficianado of books told from a quriky single woman's perspective, I had high expectations for Jennifer Belle's sophmore effort. What I found instead were truly disagreeable characters strung together by a flimsy plot. A sad, mean-spirited novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, just dysfunctional","review":"This book portrays itself as a hilarious romp about a young NYC divorcee finding herself. Really all she finds is a spectacularly creepy boyfriend who is clearly in need of a restraining order. I found it more disturbing than entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself and get something better.","review":"I have slogged halfway through this book and stopped there. It really is that bad. The characters are indeed weird, the kind you wouldn't want to deal with. I thought this would be a funny book filled with hilarious mishaps and faux pas. Instead it drones on about Liv's messed up life on all levels and her basic dimwit approach to decisions. She goes from one bad decision to another and frankly you just want to smack her and tell her to pull it together. She surrounds herself with such weirdos that you would think it would be funny, but it ends up being pathetic. These are not Anne Tyler oddballs, these people make you want to cross the street!I couldn't figure out whether the author lost the bent of the story or meant for it to be so uncomfortable to read. I won't be sharing this one with any friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't even finish it","review":"Maybe it is unfair to review a book without having finished it, but sometimes life is not fair. This book (I am on page 190) is so boring! A few clever, witty, cute lines does not make a novel. Liv leaves her husband, gets into real estate, and makes three huge deals right away - how unrealistic. Her boyfriend is an uncouth moron and what she sees in him is curious to me. All she does is show apartments and see her boyfriend. BORING! Where is this book going anyway? Forget about plot- there isn't even a story! Boring characters. Who cares about Liv? I don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"high maintainance or low brow?","review":"The plot line is choppy and the author does little to provide any insight into any of the characters' personalities.

I really hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Rather Watch Michael Jackson's Home Videos","review":"By the time I finished this book, I wanted to bite my own ear off. The main character, Liv Kellerman, is a stuck-up, pathetic, stupid New Yorker who stays with a man after he chomps off her ear and then has the nerve to openly scoff at a sweet suitor purely because he has acne and is a cook. Belle shows a solipsistic New Yorker at her worst, and suddenly, in the last two chapters, the main character finally has some inner dialogue wherein she begins to evaluate her life. It's as if Belle remembered that her main character might need some depth, but, readers, don't dive into this book; you'll break your skull on its shallowness. When you're looking for a fun read in the Target book section, pass up High Maintenance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"Wonderful book - Belle has a way of describing the most intimate details (the heroine swallowing clue pieces to solve the mystery)that remained in my mind long after I had finished the book.

She gets into an abusive relationship with a psychopath. She finds a gun, but never pulls the trigger. I just couldn't relate to anyone in this book. So silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely enjoyable","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read \\"Going Down,\\" a couple of years ago and have been eagerly awaiting Jennifer Belle's new novel. I wasn't disappointed by this one-in fact, I actually laughed out loud in several parts. The story is compelling and fascinating, Liv is so real that it's painful (and embarrassing when you realize you have been in the same types of situations), and I just couldn't put it down. She's the kind of writer that makes you want to re-read her work several times because you always find something new to love. I was definitely sad to see it end and already looking forward to her next novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is just odd...","review":"I have read so many good books in the last year and this is just not one of them. The characters are not quirky, they're weird. Neither Andrew nor Liv are all that developed and I can't say that I like either one of them. The author doesn't give you any reason to like them. And what was the curtain stealing all about?This book is just odd. It was hard to get through and the end wasn't all that spectacular. If you still feel the need to read it, borrow it from the library or call me. You can definitely have my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read Belle's first book Going Down several years ago and really enjoyed it. I found it scuzzy, raunchy, and amusing. I definitely recommend that book in favor of this one though. This book fell flat.

Some parts were absolutely hilarious, especially when Liz overheard Jerome talking about her, and got so insaulted she picked out her gun, and when she signed up as Moses at the pilatesinstitute lol.

The main charachter Liv was just so strange and selfish. I did not feel sorry for her, nor did I care about what she was going through, since it seemed that she deserved to have no real friends or anyone to turn to... at the end it turned around a bit, but honestly, she was just so 'off'. I should have expected this, as I did read 'GOING DOWN' and found the heroine to be 'off'... but this was supposed to be funny, and the underlying storyline of the handgun just seemed so strange to me. The boyfriend Adam was just terrible in every way, I was glad when he was finally gone! I would not recommend this book, as I struggled through it myself- a quick read - but there are so many great books out there to read, this just was not one of them, I am surprised itw as a bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it 1/2 of a star instead of a full one?","review":"The characters were so ridiculously weird and the things that happened in this book were so, so bad.

How could ANYONE find this book amusing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable, readable book","review":"No kidding here: I picked this book up at a bookstore near the hospital where my dad is receiving cancer therapy, mainly because I could could not concentrate to do anything else but read. I bought it knowing nothing about it or the author.This book is terrific. It is endlessly funny, and its humor is sometimes slapstick, sometimes twisted and always insigtful. The characters are engaging and the writing reflects a gift on the part of the author - the ability to write cleanly and simply yet with flair.I am contemplating how many copies of High Maintenance to buy for my friends, and am eager to get a copy of Miss Belle's first book.

She learned to operate it on her own very quickly. Her favorite thing to do is attach it to the speakers that you can buy to accompany the FP3 and carry it to whatever room she is playing in so that she can sing along to the songs we have downloaded. I would highly recommend purchasing the speakers if you are buying the FP3. I found it easy to downlad music from Fisher Price's site as well as our own CD collection. I wish that you could use sites other than Fisher Price's for music downloading and that the Fisher Price site had a larger selection of childrens artists.

It's tough, and the headset operates at a modest level for little ears. But for the adults that have to support it, it's a nightmare!!Fisher-Price has made it very difficult and time consuming to copy your own music to this device. They actually expect you to burn a cd with your music, and then you can copy it to the player. Now, the CD's are not that expensive, but the time required to do this , especially for a large number of tunes, is horrible.To make matters even worse, and more frustrating, you can't even copy your own icons into the player. You can draw one, using their software - assuming that you can draw. But you can't import or copy an icon into the software for use on the player.All in all, this player is a huge disappointment, and has thoroughly ruined Fisher-Price's reputation for fune products, as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too quiet","review":"The idea behind this toy is great & ours has lived up to its durability claim. My husband did not complain about adding songs to it, so it could not have been too bad. Batteries: this eats through them like crazy - and we used Duracell. Volume: the idea of volume control is good, but the highest volume is way too low. I can't even hear anything until I get it to the mid-setting. My 5 yr old son takes his to wrestling matches to listen while he waits his turn, but the background noise of the gym drowns out the sound in his headphones. We probably should not have bought this until next year, maybe Fisher Price will have improved it by then."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality not good - replaced 2x without succes","review":"We had 2 of these products and had the same problem with both. It would shut down and hang often enough that it was simply not useable. We thought we had gotten a defective one the first time around, so we returned it for a new one - with the same problem! The battery indicator would jump all over the place from full to empty with no rhyme or reason. When it hung, you had to get out a mini screwdriver to remove and replace the batteries (with the same ones) for it to re-start. Although the concept was good, and it was nice for my 3 year old to pick music out by the icons (since she can't read), it was not of the quality we expected. Our daughter is very gentle with her toys, so this was not an issue of her beating on the player. It was not cheap for a kid's toy, and we expected more. My husband got so frustrated with it that he just threw it in the trash and we are now on the hunt for a new MP3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only compatible with FP accessories, downloads, VERY LIMITED","review":"Caution: The FP3 player is NOT compatible with anything BUT FP accessories. That means you cannot use an iDog or any other external sound devices except those made by FP (which are over priced and hard to find). Further, you cannot use music from your personal collection or CDs and you cannot use files downloaded from the Net EXCEPT those from the FP site. This is very limiting and expensive-- esp if your child likes variety. Skip the FP3 and get a Cool P3 player by Tek Nek, you won't be disappointed.

I have spent upward of 100 hours trying to load songs from CDs onto it.

My favorite thing about this player is the volume control never gets so high that it hurts his ears.There are a few things I found challenging, such as deleting the pre-loaded music and stories, which are not to our taste, but overall this player suits his needs and keeps him away from my i-pod.The one thing you have to remember is the player doesn't use an MP3 format so all imported cd's have to run through the Fisher Price software. If you're familiar with iTunes, this will be fairly easy for you to do, just be patient because it does take a few minutes to complete this.All is right with the world. Thank you Fisher Price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?!","review":"This did not work. I have Windows XP professional. The software was a real pain to get installed. And why FP3 for that matter? It's not like we need proprietary file format when MP3 works just fine.I think mine was defective from the beginning. The included songs on the FP3 only played for a few seconds and then froze like if the files were corrupted. I could not get the software to recognize my FP3 and so could not install new music to try to see if it works.I would skip on this. Look for a durable mp3 player that works with itunes or media player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This is just like the one my mother had when I was young. The floating on air feature works really great. I have a disability that makes vacuumming difficult at times. This moves easily and if it accidentally bumps my ankles, it doesn't even hurt. For me that matters a lot. It is also a nice looking machine so I don't feel so bad if it is sitting out when I have company. Actually it ends up being a conversation piece of sorts. I actually enjoy using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover S3345","review":"This vacuum will suck up everything. It works like a breeze and cleans deep leaving a clean air smell in the house. It does take time getting used to it and the floating effect. Make sure and buy the HEPA replacement bags. I purchased the wrong ones that are paper, it is recomended to use HEPA bags for cleaner air return and for better vacuum use.Hope this helps.UPDATE 5/18/2009: We still are using this machine and love the great job it does. It would be nice if it would do the work for us. On the important note, it is very quiet for a vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst vacuum I have ever owned.","review":"The carpet attachment is cheaply made and very expensive to replace.

It really floats, and you can pull it around with its long suction hose really nicely. Surprised me with both its suction and its quiet hum when working. It cleans my hard knap throw rugs, too (wool rugs with a short fiber, not a shag). The only problem I've found is the inconvenience of the cord winding, but I've gotten used to it. BUY IT FROM HOOVER'S WEB SITE...just $120 complete for the stainless version. In short, I love this thing for what it does great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"This vaccum works very well on our hardwood floor. I'm satisfied of that. But it has two vital faults : 1)There is no wire-tiding up system. One has to intertwine the wire manually on the bottom. This final job is very arduous. 2) It drifts too much when working. Sometimes it is difficult to control its direction. Finally, it is rather a problem instead of helping."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is really disappointment for me","review":"I am using this camcoder for about 5 months.

I've never written about a book before, but I think this one deserves five stars. This fabulous book is packed with wonderful wisdom. The author shares a series of interesting life stories that are enjoyable and convey a deep truth about the human experience. His writing leaves you renewed and inspired, providing a new perspective about the events and people that shape our lives. The main elements are the ten Paradoxical Commandments themselves. They combine to form a positive message about life and the human spirit. This enriching message frees you to be yourself, and give the world the best you have. The Commandments are so powerful that for years they have circled the entire globe, continually passed from person to person. Now, the original author takes you on his path of discovery. I urge you to read this book; it will refresh your soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Earth Shattering","review":"This is what I would label a \\"to feel good\\" book. Do these things and you will feel good about yourself. But do you really need a book to tell you how to act? In theory, they're lovely platitudes and you might have a brief period after reading them where you think of how you will put them into practice, if you're not already. A cynic by nature, I dare say that I don't believe all the little tales that went along with them but the tales in no way affect how you will feel toward the \\"commandments\\".

He is also not shy about noting the glories and failures of other branding efforts.If you are not responsible for branding, the book is still worth reading as it clearly illustrates what branding is, what brand is not, and how branding should evolve. If you are responsible for brand management, then this is required reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Average","review":"A disappointing book with no more real insight on how to build a brand than is available elsewhere. That Mr. Bedbury was instrumental in developing both Nike and Starbucks brands is beyond dispute. However I found little in the way of advice for small corporations that do not have the marketing spend that Mr. Bedbury obviously had at his disposal when heading up the marketing departments of said companies. Furthermore I found his frequent criticism of the second most respected company in the world (Microsoft) a little tiresome as the book went on.I agree with the previous reader - I thought the book was more aimed at a marketing tool for his consultancy business - i.e. give the readers (including prospective clients) some information but not so much as to enable them to act on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best album next to Piece of Mind","review":"Standout tracks: TELA, CANT STOP ME, BYE BYE HATER, PLAYBOY, DRUGS(Tela and Devin killed it), SHO NUFF 2000, TABLE DANCE millenium mix(way better than the superbland original), HELL NAW, SET ME FREE(talks about his problems with Suave House), THE WORLD AINT ENUFF(dope ending to this album).

Fool me twice, shame on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and a short life.","review":"I purchased one of these on amazon a while ago. Initially, it was great. But as others have noted, they are not well made. They do strip out after some use, making them worthless. I did not use this often, so its not like it was heavily used - or abused. This is in a rarely used hobby shop, so saw very little action. These would last a week in a shop where they were used with any regularity. There has to be a better quality featherboard out there. I would not recommend this one - not even for a very light duty shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another featherboard that has two hold downs in parallel slots!!!!","review":"These featherboards looked good so I bought. In use they are hard to adjust because the slots are not parallel and the bolts bind. Because the slots get closer as you move the fingers closer to the blade, the featherboard has more leverage on it and is not that stable. They should have kept the slots parallelAlso, featherboards only work when the fingertips are parallel to the fence and these are hard to adjust.The other problem is only one of the bolt knobs actually cause the miter track to expand to hold the featherboard in!! This is the biggest problem. The other bolt only pulls the orange plastic down to the track but does not expand in the slot. So there is always some rotational play in the featherboard.The bottom line is-- this is an expensive featherboard with two insurmontable problems, so keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"Similar complaints to other reviewers. Fingers are too stiff. Non-parallel slots are awkward to adjust. Miter slot bar only expands and tightens at one end and thus can pivot out of the slot. I bought some Kreg featherboards that are much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bench Dog Featherboard","review":"Take these back to the drawing board Bench Dog!Let me start by saying I love my Bench Dog router plate, but these featherboards are way too stiff. You usually can't even force the material past the featherboards. Back off slightly, and they offer no contact at all. I have used cheap plastic featherboards before, and really liked them. These are way too stiff. Every so often I take them to the band saw and cut off another plastic finger - still too stiff.Also the non-parallel slots are not well designed. This is minor compared with the stiff fingers.Two things I do like about these...1. They are plenty long, so they reach the router fence in any position.2. They indicate feed direction, so when your brother in law borrows your router table he won't hurt himself.Try another brand, these aren't any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"too stiff","review":"Same complaint as most everyone else. They seem fine at first but I quickly grew to hate the stiff fingers and you have to tighten them so hard in order to prevent them from slipping that you will eventually end up stripping the bolt/knob. The other thing that is really irritating is that you have to buy the miter slides separately! they end up costing way too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"40 yrs..Never saw a 1/4\\" T-Slot","review":"Never have I seen a 1/4\\" T-Slot.

They were not the portable kind but the ones that fit into a floor-level counter top.They were also pipeless with two motors in each spa. We've had to replace four motors to date.Two were replaced under the original warranty. We have now ordered two more and are checking our records to see if they were the ones that were replaced under the original warranty.The labor is not covered so the cost of installing the replacement motors is on us.Furthermore, the tubs themselves are susceptible to corrosion if you use bath salts, a practice done at many pedicure businesses. We were forced to resurface the units because they became severely discolored and gritty.We have a high volume business and require that the spas be reliable. We do not consider these units to be reliable. We don't think they are worth the $1999 either.If your business depends on the units, we would counsel you to look for a competing product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great artsy biography","review":"I watched this film for my central european literature class. I didn't expect it to be boring, but i was cetrainly thriled with the depth and talent displayed in this biography. THe DVD is set up very well, it has a section where you can listen to archival recordings of her work - arias and folk songs. It also has a photo gallery. Reading about someone on the internet is one thing, but you can not understand the magnitued of this woman or the effect she had on people until your hear someone describe her. They way the faces of these people lit up when they would talk about her music, shows just how talented she was. The biography portion isn't dull like many TV biographys are, they tie in enough of her work and intresting tidbits about Novotna to make this story really come alive. I reccomend this DVD to anyone intrested in Opera, the met, or Checkoslovakian history."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent ending","review":"The final book of the Door Within Trilogy is an excellent way to end the series. It leaves the readers feeling they have read a book written by a truly inspired author. In the final book we find Alleble under siege by Paragory. The final storm is among our heroes, will they prevail? I believe this to be perhaps one of the best trilogies ever written and would recommend it for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good conclusion","review":"The final book in the Door Within Trilogy has everything that the previous two had, and more! Picking up right where the last book left off, The Final Storm hurtles toward an exciting conclusion that may surprise you.

Again, as mentioned in reviews of previous books, try these if you like Brian Jacques, Wayne Thomas Batson has a similar style."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!","review":"This is the third, and final, book to The Door Within series, and it is every bit as fantastical, and compelling as the first two.

Unlike the other two books, it does not start kind of slow. It starts exciting right out of the gate and is impossible to put down.

I would highly reccommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good until the end","review":"I could not wait to get my hands on this book after reading the first two. From the beginning, the story catapults towards the climax of the saga - when Aidan, Antoinette, and Robby will have to face Paragor himself. Overall, the book was an excellent final installment of the Door Within trilogy, but what disappointed me was the somewhat insensitivity of the very end. At the very point of the climax, the point of view changes from the comfortable and engaging third person limited to third person omniscient, and from then on it becomes somewhat unrealistic. I do have to say I was disappointed with the way this otherwise excellent trilogy ended, but I would still recommend it to any fantasy fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Storm!","review":"This book is AMAZING!!! I was constantly staying up late and reading every spare minute I could find. It held my attention and sucked me in where I even forget I was reading.In this final adventure, Aiden, Robby and Antoinette all meet in the Realm. They must combine their courage and strength to defeat the dark knight. Wayne Thomas Batson does a great job writing this book. Everything has amazing detail, not so much it will make you fall asleep, but not too little where you don't know what's happening. A great read but, read it in order! This is the last book in a series of three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoops gone amuck","review":"This is the story of the largely forgotten but enormously significant series of events that almost destroyed college basketball as a major sport in America. In the early 1950s, a host of college basketball players who had fixed the outcome of college games by shaving points in order to beat the point spread and the gamblers who induced them to participate in the scheme were arrested. The resulting scandal revealed that numerous college games had not been on the up and up. Fewer things can destroy a sport faster than dishonest results.In this excellent, highly readable book, noted basketball historian and novelist, Charley Rosen, explains how the fixers got to the players, why the players went along and sold out the game they loved and what the results were for college basketball. For my money, Rosen's cautionary tale is a great place to start for anyone interested in the history of modern college basketball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm-hearted book.","review":"I didn't know much about Robert Schuller before I read this (he is a TV preacher who believes in the power of positive thinking), but I really liked his autobiography.

Starts off a little slow for my taste, covering, in detail, his family history. After those early chapters, the book picks up.While I understand there can be only so much covered in one book, I am still wondering why he chose not to discuss his educational background in a little more detail. He admits he earned Bachelors' degrees, but as you continue reading suddenly he starts calling himself \\"Doctor Schuller\\". Where did this come from? Wait ....I know...he dosen't have an earned degree, only an honorary doctorate. Funny how he dosen't mention that. In fact, I lost count of how many times he referred to himself as \\"Dr. Schuller\\". I was a bit much. I think he likes seeing his name in print.

I've found myself spending so much time researching the mistakes, that I feel I would have been better off just studying some other book. If you get it just be certain that you don't use it as your only reference, as I've found an average of 1 error every 10-15 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Really?","review":"The book was purchased based upon high ratings. My impression of the product is that little effort was made to insure accuracy. The book comes with a CD containing 200+ exam questions that barely relate to the book’s content and often the answers contradict the book. The New Riders Web site contains an errata file containing 6 pages of reported errors and few of the errors I found were listed. If you buy this book, play to spend time cross referencing everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"Overall the book is decent. It needs to be revised to eliminate the obvious errors it has, however if you're familar with NT4, the errors aren't a problem since they will be very obvious. (MakeBoot, not MakeDisk, etc). I mainly wanted a Win2K Pro book to fill in information that is new to Win2K... and this book did just that. For the price, it's rather good... thought another round of error checking by the tech editor would help! If you're looking for a book to fill in the gaps between WinNT4 WS and Win2K Pro, get this! If you want something to learn from scratch, this book 'probably' won't be enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Every chapter was informative and well written, as well as easy to read. At the end of each chapter were multiple types of questions including scenario, labs, and simple general knowledge questions.

I have the privilege of having Ms. Riegelman as a teacher this quarter, and although I do find her book to be helpful, it cannot replace the guidance of an actual instructor. The book is a great reference, but if you're very serious about learning fashion illustration, I think it's important to take formal classes, where you'll have a teacher to critique your work. And of course, you won't get anywhere without practice. If you have an opportunity to take her class, Ms. Riegelman is an excellent illustrator, and she's very helpful. With that said, it's hard for me to imagine any book out there being sufficient without any formal instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"I do have to apologize.

The unit is not high precision, nor does it have rapid settling times, but if you need that, you should get an expensive model instead. However, for casual use it works well. The MS8268 is larger than many other multimeters, but you can still hold it in your hand. The construction quality is good, and should put up with typical use (and even abuse) for many years. The MS8260 is just complex enough that you may need to peruse the user manual to figure out how to do various measurements. Battery installation and access requires a phillips screwdriver.If you need a inexpensive yet good quality digital multimeter, you will be hard pressed to find one better than the MS8268."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Multimeter works as expected for the price","review":"the reading may be a bit slow but it works, the readings are +/- 1~3 in variance but still very usable once you get used to it. can beat it at the price, and i am happy with the product"},{"rating":"1","title":"got defective unit","review":"The display of the multimeter I received did not show anything. Some of the buttons made sounds, so there was some \\"life\\" in the unit.In addition, two of the three included AAA batteries were dead. They looked deformed(!) and gave low voltages on a battery tester.Since there were two issues, I got an Extech EX330 instead, which works fine.PS: since this review is getting a low \\"helpful\\" percentage, I want to explain why I would have found it helpful. (I had been contemplating whether to write it before I did.) First, the two issues indicate quite poor final quality control. This may have no bearing on reliability or lifetime of working units, but it made me concerned. Second, I find it a hassle to return defective products, so a warning seemed in order to offset the many positive reviews. Finally, while one star is clearly harsh for the *product*, I could talk only about the *unit* I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Proverbial Lemon","review":"This meter currently resides in a waste-basket. It did operate, but sporadically. The cable contacts were unreliable. The Range button played dumb. I advise purchasing another brand. Amazon's pricing obviates the aggravation of pursuing repair/replacement. I believe I hit a lemon, but be aware you're taking a chance with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought it would be for a sub $40 meter","review":"I'm always skeptical about buying something like this online where I have no way of trying it or no one who can tell me their experiences.The reviews were good so for less than $40 I figured I would buy it and go from there.This meter is solid and has a nice, clear display; the back light is awesome. It's a little large but that's OK. The auto-ranging scales are clear and easily understood. It does not have a low enough scale for micro-amps but I knew that before I purchased it and didn't expect to find any meter for this price that would read around 10 micro-amps.In conclusion; if you need a home or general work meter with a decent range that is rugged, the MS8268 fits the bill very well. The only advise I would give is to get yourself a padded case for some protection while not in use, don't just throw it in the bottom of your toolbox, no meter will last very long if you do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check all ranges on your new meter","review":"I failed to check all functions on my new meter when I got it.

I am sure it is a coincidence that two similar books came out the same month, but of the two, I much prefer The Menopause Survival Guide by Donna Rogers, which I purchased.

At the least, when you cannot get enough time or answers from your doctor, this book will serve that purpose, providing a complete explanation both physiologically and from a practical point of view.

Compared to everything else I ordered online at the same time, all free shipping by the way, this was absolutely the worst!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE -- Omits Many Hits!","review":"I was appalled to find out that, despite including 86 songs in this 4-disc collection, it excludes more than 30 of Mathis' charted hits, including dozens that made the Top 40.Given that he only had 19 Top 40 hits (plus another 33 that made the Top 100), it's appalling that a career-spanning collection like this could leave so much out. To me, for a collection like this, you start with all the A-side hit singles, then add some interesting album tracks, some favorites by the artist, and then sprinkle in some rarities and live performances. And preferably remix the stuff for stereo, when formerly only mono tracks have been released, and the master tapes are available. But to omit nearly 3 dozen charted singles (many of them Top 40 hits) is unforgiveable.You gotta wonder who's running the show at Legacy to screw something up like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnny and I, Together Again","review":"Two yesrs ago, thanks to a Black Mold Catastrophe, I lost just about everything in my cabin. That included tapes and CD's of Johnny Mathis that I had treasured for years. When, finally, I began to miss them so much that my ears ached, I decided to replace as much as I could on a limited budget. So I ordered the Personal Collection, mainly because one disk had \\"99 Miles From LA\\" on it, my personal favorite. Since the collection arrived, I have been swimming in a glorious sea of nostalga and loving every cut on the four disks. At last, Johnny and I can sing together again while I wash dishes! This is a great collection; it gives me an ear-gasm every time I listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheryl Crow","review":"My family loves this performer and enjoyed seeing and hearing with such quality!

As a poet, I recognize the difficulty in translating poetry, but even so, and with an incredibly limited knowledge of French, it's clear that these translations are not at all accurate, but mostly just based on the whimsical wishes of the translator, who seems to have intentionally disregarded many straightforward French words and phrases that could have easily be put into English, without damaging the poem as a whole.I felt scammed, and would return this if it weren't for my laziness. I never expected to complain about poetry translations because the process really is an art form and one that is very difficult, but this is simply too much.Go to A. S. Kline's FREE Poetry Archive instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Poet, Less Than Great Translator.","review":"The downside to translation is that we always loose, in some amount, something of what the author(poet)is expressing.

The game comes with an editor, and is styled after World War 2 (no nukes, however). You have a full range of units, from naval (Battleships, Subs, Transports), air (fighters, bombers) and land (infantry, tanks) units to choose from.The goal is to destroy you opponents, there is no diplomacy. You can have up to 6 players (human or AI), and the AI is smart and agressive (3 AI levels). The AI does not cheat as in some other modern games. You are able to give it (or yourself) handicaps, if you want.A very fun classic war game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even with a Live Drummer it's still Godflesh","review":"With the addition of Ted Parsons Godflesh has reached a new high in their career. The Hip Hop beats of Us and Them and Songs of Love and Hate have been replaced by a more straight ahead rock metal sound. Very Heavy and intense but with a more emotional feel. The songs are extremely groovy and well paced no 20plus minute epic but nothing to short either.So Godflesh fans will not be disapointed, and this CD could expand their fanbase. It is just another great piece of music from JK Broadrick, now all we have to do is pray for the US tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful brutality","review":"Came home, put this on very loud - a Godflesh ritual for me. A couple songs made me squirm, in that invigorating something-is-about-to-kill-me way. One song bashed me so hard with its beauty that my eyes teared up. If you like your music powerful, intense and brutally emotional, you need this... I first heard Godflesh via the Slavestate video, on Headbangers Ball way back when - instantly converted. Scooped up Streetcleaner, which lived in my car's tape deck, crushing skulls on a daily basis... Y'know, I LOVE Hymns. For me, their most affecting album since Pure. Mesmerizing, beautiful and often frightening, this one's got it all. If you're looking for STREETCLEANER part 2, keep looking. One of the things I love about Gflesh (and all of Broadrick's other work) is that you never get the same thing twice.

Cleopatra WAS NOT African. I'm sorry to those of you who believe she was, but she wasn't. Like others have said before, she was GREEK. No one is trying to say that many Egyptians weren't black (they were in fact a range of colors), but the Ptolemies were Greek, not Egyptian. The Ptolemies were left over from Alexander's empire and had ruled Egypt since his death. While they adopted many Egyptian customs, they were in thought and deed, Greek. Personally, I don't think it matters what she looked like, the important thing is what she managed to accomplish for so young a queen, especially in the period in which she lived. I would also venture to say that Caesar and Antony loved her for her unique personality, not only for her beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleopatra Queen of the Nile","review":"I thought this book was VERY good gave an insight veiw oh who cleopatra was and her descendants who were not of the black skin colour.

When it comes to around the house projects these organizers are GREAT. I have never found it so easy to move from project to project and know where my most used tools are. I can easily see using either two of these or one of their other (bags) products in combination. The hardest things I found about using this product was the initial fitting to the bucket (tight, snug, had to wrestle with it) and figuring out which pockets work best for which tools. Long screwdrivers, pry bars, etc. are still somewhat of a mystery yet they do fit. Heck, you can always place them free in the center . . .

Is it just me or do they sound suspiciously like Rhino Records employees in disguise, trying to boost sales?This album shows no respect for a deceased legend and music icon. It represents the ugly side of the music industry--the make a quick buck on others' coattails side of the industry... Many of the tracks were not only recorded when Ray was not present, but some of the people never met him! That's what I call karaoke. And I wonder why the record label decided not share any music clips from the album on Amazon?I have actually heard the album.

Other alleged songwriters represented include Harold Arlen, Johnny Mercer, Harry Warren, Jule Styne, Sammy Cahn and Shearing himself.

I think two years of playing live together has benefited the band. Songs like \\"The Rat\\" bring in a more new wave feel. But others like \\"No Christmas While I'm talking\\" show more of the exciting heroic range of the band. I took a friend to see them recently. He is one of those people who believe that little has been done in music since Jimi Hendrix. I couldn't believe that he was able to keep quiet and watch the band play for a full hour.

There is a classic aspect to their sound that I find hard to place -- maybe it's all the reverb on the guitars.....but I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect soundtrack to a winter's night out","review":"With a magnificent slow burn of a sound featuring dense textures and crackling vocals, this NYC quartet prove to be desperate, sentimental, and assuredly intoxicated, often all at once. \\"What's In It For Me\\" opens with supple organ and drifts along lightly before giving way to the rousing and superbly vitriolic \\"The Rat.\\" With its shouts, groans, pulsing guitar and rhythm, it swiftly sets the album tumbling into motion and likely serves as the album's most emphatic moment. Thereafter the band manages to create a musical landscape that's always rigid around the edges, yet that always flirts with a subtle beauty. By the time you've passed through \\"Hang On Siobhan\\" and \\"138th Street\\" you can literally feel the piercing New York wind and smell the whiskey in the air. A great sophomore effort and a convincing musical backdrop for a winter's night out and the hangover that's sure to follow. Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"second album slump","review":"Dissapointing after the excellent first album \\"Everyone who pretended to like me is gone\\". The sound is too raw and jangly with no bass to be heard. After a while it just sound like one big noisey song. The Walkmen crafted something highly original and beautiful on their first album but they lost their way a bit with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Day, You Will Ache Like I Ache...","review":"Sad that their \`fame' came from a Saturn commercial, because how The Walkmen distinguish themselves is how fresh and charming they are - they are the anti-New York garage scene while embodying it's ideal...to make beautiful, raw, emotional, gut-wrenching neo-standards. Hamilton Leithauser possesses something the so-called purveyors of Garage Rock like The Strokes lack - endurance and passion - which will inevitably land him on \`The O.C.' Atmospheric, aching, rocking and haunting all juxtaposed to create the most gorgeous collage and the NYC CD of this year. And maybe next. My grade: A-"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD!","review":"This is better than their first album.

This machine is a highly polished piece of junk which is very difficult to use. The blades are so dull that they often stop midway through the food that is being sliced. To use the machine safely, the food must be cut into very small pieces which often don't suit my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"also have problems","review":"I just got this mandolin and was very excited to use it. After reading the reviews, I read the manual, examined the whole thing and carefully put it together. I got mushy slices when I was able to get a slice. I tried a lime, a bell pepper and a sweet potato. The blades do seem a little dull. I took it out and tried slicing paper with it - it sliced it but not as easily as I expect brand new 'very sharp' blades to do. But I think there's a problem with the safety handle: how do I hold the food down so it makes a firm slice? The pins won't hold the food. I tried it without the safety handle (not recommended) and was able to slice the items. Maybe mine is defective, maybe I'm not using it correctly, I don't know. But if I can't figure it out, I'm returning it.By the way, the product is made in China, not France."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT waste your time","review":"The angle of the blade makes it very hard to get an even cut. Basic slices, like potato, were thicker on one end than the other no matter what technique or effore was made. Waffle fries are NOT happening with this thing. The depth of the serated blade was too shallow to allow for a real waffle cut, and the 'thicker on one end' symptom described above makes it extra impossible.I promptly returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Having Fun in the kitchen!","review":"Purchased this Mandoline as a birthday gift for my boyfriend. Blades were sharp, metal stand is sturdy, and blade case is really handy for keeping the blades clean and undamaged.He is having a great time learning how to make waffle fries, and many other great food designs.He loves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality control problems","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this mandoline is poorly designed. I think there must also be quality-control problems at the factory. That is the only explanation I can come up with for the range of comments about this product. I was able to use the waffle blade just fine, but not the straight blade. The waffle blade should be technically harder to use, so I don't think user error can explain away all the problems reported.The saying that a sharp knife is safer than a dull one seems like a contradiction. We know however that when you have to use excessive force to cut something bad things happen. The unit I received came with a dull straight blade made of metal that is difficult to sharpen by hand and doesn't fit in my knife sharpening station. Because I had to use a lot of force to try to get potatoes through the blade area the plastic around the blade is now coming apart.I suggest buying a V-slicer instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you're really into food shavings","review":"I had the same experience as many of the reviewers here. This \\"slicer\\" is totally useless. If you put ANY kind of pressure down on the item to be sliced it will not cut through; otherwise you just get shavings. I have tried an onion, a green pepper, and a sweet potato; none of them were cut. The video from the company demonstrating this product (up on a certain popular tube site) is a gross misrepresentation, this thing just got tossed into the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and not as good as cheaper models","review":"I have a cheap plastic mandoline that I have used for a while, and thought I would step up to a \\"pro\\" model. So far I have had nothing but disappointment with this mandoline. The hand guard has broken or malfunctioned twice, and it tends to make a mess of slicing, say, zucchini. While it looks great in theory, it's not as good (or as easy to use (as the $13 plastic one I bought at a grocery store. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIU does not stand behind their product.","review":"I got this and was very impressed by the look and feel of it. I didn't get around to actually trying it out for a while, however. Like many others, I found when I did try to use it that the blades themselves were dull and of very poor quality. It tears the food instead of cutting it. Unfortunately it was past the 30 day return period and MIU has ignored my emails. I would not buy another of their products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"This mandoline is extremly sturdy, the functionality and ease of use with this product was as expected. My only disappointment is that the case that is designed to hold the various blades doesn't have enough slots to hold all of them. As to why I would give this a product a 4 out of 5 stars. I just do not feel comfortable leaving a blade in the mandoline at all times."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIU very dull blades","review":"Where are the good reviews coming from? This is dullest tool in my kitchen. I have a couple of Japanese mandolins which are very sharp but this thing is useless. It appears that they put some energy into the design but gave up on providing a sharp blade. I contacted the company once and they sent me another dull replacement blade. This thing won't slice anything. Yes this unit is less expensive but it does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a Borner V-slicer instead","review":"I purchased this model of mandoline at Costco to replace a 10 year old Borner V-slicer. The blade is incredibly dull. The food guide/holder requires a great deal of force to be applied to hold the food down on the mandoline. It is a setup that is almost guaranteed to cause a major kitchen accident. The Borner V-slicer is a better buy -- much cheaper and a joy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to get consistent cuts","review":"The thickness of slices is regulated by a lever under a slanted platform. When you put needed pressure on the food to push it through the blade, it causes the platform to move, which in turn changes the thickness of the slices. The julienne blade does not stay in place, but moves out of its slot while in use unless you hold it with one finger. The safety pusher will not hold thinner pieces and tends to bounce up. This makes it not only hard to use, but also can pinch fingers. Ditto the comment about blades being so-so; this works best on foods like zucchini with a similar overall texture, rather than tomatoes (hard to cut skin) or potatoes (overall too firm)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product, Poor Amazon Customer Service","review":"My husband purchased this mandoline for me for Christmas, unfortunately he bought it in mid December and when I used it for the first time we had passed Amazon's \\"30 day return\\" rule. This item does not work well; it makes mush out of softer foods and shreds more sturdy foods. It is worthless to me; I can slice things better with a cheap knife. I have tried to use it 2 or 3 times and the cap of the food pusher has already fallen apart - the cap fell off. I am very disappointed with this product and even more disappointed in Amazon's customer service. They would not let me return this defective item. They suggested that I try to sell it on their web site! I could not in good conscience sell this to anyone.

I felt confident in my purchase after reading the reviews on amazon. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. We followed the instructions and the advice on amazon, but could not get this thing to work. Every food item we tried, hard or soft, big or small, got jammed. My wife has gone back to using her v-slicer, which functions well, but lacks the stainless appeal of this mandoline. Needless to say, I returned this item to amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"This thing has 2 speeds, slow and dissapointment\\"","review":"I was really excited to get this Mandoline this Xmas, bummer the blades were so dull. This looks like a terrific product, however the blade design is very poor. There is a plastic ridge that gets in the way of food being sliced. The Blades came very dull, not even close to razor sharp. You have to use way too much force to slice anything. I tried slicing carrots and the dullness of the blade would force the slice into curved halfmoon sized chips. Have to agree with other previous negative reviews.."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can use a mandoline . . . and this one is not good","review":"I received this mandoline for Christmas and immediately put it to work cutting an apple. I could not slice with it, and it was a mess. The next day I tried potatoes, and little plastic bits chipped off in my slices (actually, chunks) as I tried to get it to work. Then last night at a cooking class, I used a simple, cheaper, plastic V-slicer, and it cut potatoes like they were made of cotton candy. Several cooks at my table, all first time mandoline users, had no problem slicing apples and potatoes with that mandoline. My conclusion - my technique was not crappy, this MIU mandoline is. Luckily I could return at no charge and pick up a Borner V-slicer Pro just like the one we used in the cooking class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much trouble! Dull blades!","review":"This slicer is terrible. My sister gave it to me for Christmas and so I gave her my old cheap one...Now I'm stuck with this thing that can't cut anything very well. I tried a simple julienne (this was no problem on my old cheap-o slicer) and ended up with a pile of uneven and broken carrots! It's too bad they didn't put better blades on this since everything else (thickness adjustment, fold out legs) is really well designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective blade","review":"This mandoline looked nice and solid. Trying to use it was another story. I only used it one time to slice sweet potatoes very thinly to make chips. The slicing blade has a plastic bottom with a steel blade.

Worthless after 3rd use.","review":"Received this mandoline as a gift. After the 3rd use the knob for the safety holder fell apart, plastic holding the knob broke. Blades chop, do not cut.

Except the one area that is most important. The cutting edge. It is made of bad quality metal. The blades dull very verry fast, making it difficult to cut with. My attempts to sharpen the blades show the blades are not made to sharpen. The metal is too soft. When using dull cutting blades user can get more hurt than sharp blades. When using dull cutting blades, more pressure must be applied to cut things resulting in an uncontrolled jerk movement then the item finally cuts which could result in user getting cut.It is amazing this item was not forced to be recalled.

I was going to return it but I live abroad.The main and fatal problem with this mandolin is the blades. They don't simply cut properly (sometime at all), no matter how hard they are. It's much better to use a long, sharp knife but it's surely not the same thing as a good mandoline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blades don't cut. Period.","review":"Title say it all. Blades are also pretty much impossible to sharpen by hand. I tried with sharpening stones, even with a Dremel and could not get these things to cut. Add the two hours wasted in sharpening time to the 80 bucks wasted for the mandolin and you can see why I wish that I bought a piece of crap for [...] bucks rather than a piece of crap for [...] bucks. In fact the old $[...] mandolin cut much better than this.Oh yeah, don't read the French name and think the mandolin is French made. It's Chinese garbage just like everything else that comes out of that country.

The story is a very well written s tory, for the plot, characters which are almost real, the setting are so real it is amazing. When I first read this exciting book my mind traveled to the mansion of the artist. I also shared his pain, along with the cat's pain and sadness while reading this story.

It worked fine for about a month, and then my brand-new television blew out. The television is a quality set, so I thought that was strange. I brought it in for warranty work and the repair guy said their had been a surge that fried the power adapter.After my television was repaired I put it back on a normal surge protector and I haven't had a problem since. That was over a year ago.The only culprit for this is this stupid power strip. It blew out my brand-new television and I'm sure it has done the same to others.

Normally, I'd call, but this close to the holidays I figure I'd opt for the more low-key e-mail attempt first.Update: The manufacturer (Bits Limited) got back to me pretty quickly with an RMA number to return the strip. I shipped it back to them, they repaired it, upgraded it with the latest fixes, and returned it. Overall pretty good customer service, I would have liked it if they paid shipping back to them, but it wasn't too expensive (FL, USA)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Strip","review":"This works great for turning on Antec cooling fan for AVR.

It was especially good for hotels/restaurants in Montevideo; the region around Igauzu Falls (including Foz de Iguacu and Ciudad del Este); and Bariloche. Travellers going exclusively to Buenos Aires might want to get a more cosmopolitan book (it is impossible to distinguish good hotels from bad, good cultural events, etc. using this book).

Though LP prides itself on offering this kind of information, this edition has little that allows travelers to discover the city's uniqueness. Instead, I used this guide to find museums and other basic info that I could have gleaned from ANY guide. It's hard to believe that LP included hardly any information about Palermo, one of the city's most charming neighborhoods, or failed to mention the tradition of Milongas, which are \\"local\\" dances in venues such as community centers where everyday Portenos dance the tango with more grace and passion than you will find in the expensive, touristy shows.

I honestly can say I prefer this Peter to either James Barrie's story (with its dark psychology) or Disney's. This Peter is rather a romantic extension of the Disney version, with such non-boyish traits as a highly developed sense of responsibility and compassion (the very opposite of Barrie's milk-toothed and very selfish boy) to go along with his courage and daring. He can plan and (usually) foresee the consequences of his actions, though his boyishness can still get him in trouble. The girls aren't left out in this one, either, as Tink and Molly are wonderful characters.

They have Helped him learn more words and he gets such a thrill being able to name and identify the different pictures (verbally and by pointing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first words!","review":"We got these books for our 20 month old son. He picked up on all the words pretty fast. He loves to take the books and read them! Although he loves the truck book, the words are just too big for him at this time. I would say buy these books for your little ones. It has one picture one word per page instead of many on one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very inspiring, good advice!!!","review":"This book is soooo delightful and inspiring. The way it is written is very friendly and the content was really helpful to me. It's a great gift book - I'm giving it to several friends now. It was a quick book for me to read and I came away from it wanting to read it again just so that I could savor the information. I liked the layout of the book, the short chapters and the way that the author tells BOTH her failures and successes in life - and applies the lessons learned to reveal ways to enrich your life.My favorite aspect of the book is that I was able to figure out my purpose in life by using Valorie's instructions about how to write a personal mission statement.I HIGHLY recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Minds, Rich Rewards: 52 Ways to Empower and Enrich your","review":"This book was EXCELLENT!!! The author is very young, yet filled with wisdom. The mini chapters are very easy to read, and when reading the book, you get the feeling that the author is talking directly to you.

You get the feeling that she was truly inspired by God to write this book.I am looking forward to her next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice things come in small packages!","review":"What a gem! Goodwin took what has been described as one of the most difficult languages to learn and created a slim, appealing book that will give a reader who has absolutely no knowledge of Russian enough of a grounding to feel brave enough to go on with further study, as well as enough of a foundation to decipher some of the background signs on the broadcast news. The text itself is visually appealing, inviting the reader to continue. The author's tone is conversational, not pedantic. This book is a delight to read. It is about as close to a page-turned as an introductory foreign grammar can get and has deservedly become a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"What tunes?","review":"Watched 20 minutes and said to hell with it. Maybe it got better, I'll never know. Production was fine. So what. I didn't hear anything I would call a melody. Love Tchaikovsky's symphonies (4,5,6) and ballets and VC and 1st PC. Great tunes. Really didn't expect tunes - never yet ran across an operatic composer (no, not even Rossini, don't like his operas either) who could write orchestral music or vice verse. Was talked into buying it. Bleah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance, Not Reality","review":"Finally, this glorious production of this largely unknown opera by Tchaikovsky is available. Having had a (dare I say it?) bad \\"pirate\\" print for some time, I am so looking forward to seeing it for the first time all over again. The work has some of Pyotr Ilyich's most romantic music--the Act I Finale with Joan hearing her voices is wonderous. Historic liberties are taken as Joan has a romance with an enemy soldier, thus leading to her imprisonment. The production is elaborate yet not realistic. Joan's end at the stake is something to be seen to be believed. Now that we've gotten 'Mlada' and 'The Maid of Orleans', isn't it about time for Philips to release the DVD of 'The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya'?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a great production","review":"The music's great of course, and the director, the orchestra and the singers are at their best. The production on the whole, however, is ruined by a totally unexplicable mixture of different centuries, represented by the chorus in ridiculous 19th century outfits. The angels look as if they had just been dragged out of an elementary school play. It's not clear, how such an outstanding stage director as Boris Pokrovsky could come up with this immature performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable ending","review":"Readable novel about four cobras at loose in a high rise; predictable ending.

However, of the 3 units that were shipped, 2 of them were defective -- one unit had a faulty lamp, and the other had a nonfunctional ballast. These are pretty simple units, so it's a shame that the quality is so low they are dead on arrival.

He turned a book about secret, hidden ancient treasures and spies into a script for a 1980's Chuck Norris movie. What a waste. I expected so much more from a story with so much potential. There were plenty of inconsistencies, too. One minute the central character is a badass former special ops hero, beating up two chinese henchmen, and the next he's a helpless victim of an aged grandfather. Really? It was hard to believe. I did enjoy the backdrop. It was a fascinating look into the politics and failures of communist China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I'm a big fan of Carl Hiaasen because of his humor, but bought this book fully aware that it isn't his usual style. I was not disappointed. Just goes to prove that a good writer isn't limited to one style of writing. I found the book well written, as expected, interesting, and an easy read. The characters were engaging, the plot easy to follow, the story line warm (without being simply \\"feel good\\")and yet filled with intrigue. Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmemorable","review":"Hiassen fans will be disappointed. This book has none of the characteristic twisted, insane humor of most of his work. In fact, it is a rather formulaic spy/action/thriller book. If it were a movie, it would star Jean-Claude VanDamme. This is not to say that it is a bad book, per say, but it is very predictable. It has all of the usual elements, and though it does have some interesting bits here and there, it is ultimately just another predictable spy/action/thriller book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"This story is not among Hiaasen's best, or even his mediocre works.

The author understands why so many of us procrastinate when it comes to buying a long-term care policy. He really helped me break through the \\"paralysis of analysis.\\"I imagine a few long-term care insurance agents won't like the book, because the author tells some war stories from his experience in helping consumers while working for a state insurance department. In fact, the author is a proponent of long-term care insurance and believes that most agents are extremely concerned about the welfare of their clients.Because he's objective and doesn't work in the insurance industry, I trust his conclusion that long-term care insurance is a very important policy to have, as long as you buy it from someone who is looking out for your best interests. He also offers many ways to save money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than nothing, but not by much","review":"This book is too long to provide such a brief overview of long-term care. The message of the book seems to be: you need long-term care insurance. That's it. There is little useful information on how to choose one policy over another and the attempts at financial planning advice would have been better left to someone else. Save the ten dollars.

Other electricians have told me the next pouch they buy will be a Bucket Boss. The tools do not fall out even under some extreme conditions. It carries all the tools you will ever need to do the job as an electrician. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the chain that holds the electrical tape is just a little to short and it would be nice to have a place to hang a pick hammer. But in actuality a real electrician wouldn't need them because they know how to get the maximum work from the tools they have. I bought this pouch because of the reviews it received. Now, I'm telling the next person that they will not be disappointed when THEY buy it. Their review will be the same as mine guaranteed. After saying that I think I will give it 5 stars.

The strongest aspect of \\"Winterheim\\" has to be the character development. Characters such as Bruni the large Arktos woman, Mouse the Arktos warrior, and even Grimwar Bane the ogre king grow. The relationship between Moreen and Kerrick evolves and even a certain elusive kender makes an appearance or two. There are also a few new characters added to the mix. While it's certainly not the greatest book, it does make a worthy conclusion to the series. I definitely enjoyed reading it, but I have to admit the ending kind of annoyed me. (A tad too convenient and sappy for my tastes.) Douglas Niles once again proves his writing prowess and I sincerely hope that this isn't the last of his Dragonlance novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ending to terrific trilogy","review":"This is an excellent finish to a really entertaining trilogy. Fans of fantasty fiction who have no prior exposure to the Dragonlance world can still enjoy these books (the first two are The Messenger and The Golden Orb).This book basically ends to tale of the characters introduced at the beginning of the trilogy. There are plenty of epic battles, narrow escapes, and character development. A couple of nagging questions (e.g. is Coraltop the kender real?) that are finally answered.The only qualm I have with this book is that the ending seems a bit rushed and a little too convenient. But it is not at all unbelievable, and the epilogue is very nice.Overall, a very good novel, but when taken in conjunction with the other parts of the trilogy, it is really excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good read","review":"Douglas Niles completes the telling of the Icewall Trilogy story. There is a brave (or crazy) rescue attempt made by the Arktos and Highlanders that brings them into the heart of the Ogre Kingdom. Another good book filled with difficult choices and fast paced action - and a slave revolt! See also: The Messenger and The Golden Orb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this trilogy","review":"While Winterheim gives the reader more suspense than the first book (The Messenger), I'd recommend avoiding this entire trilogy. I'll go a step further and advise fans of Dragonlance to \\"test drive\\" anything newly written by Douglas Niles before buying it. When fantasy writing lacks creativity, what's the point of reading it?

Not only are the books on the market the same on metal clay, but do all of the authors have to word their instructions on every single move that their hands make?

I could not, so decided the cost was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I got this book from Borders yesterday, and I already love it. I had flipped through it a few times in the store, and as soon as I saw that parody of American Gothic with Death and Ms. Flitworth (Reaper Man is my favorite book in the series) I was sold. Rincewind is very nearly like I imagined him, and the Death of Rats is just adorable. Not to mention the stunning picture of Great A'Tuin near the beginning of the book.My only annoyance is that I couldn't see Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler anywhere, but the pictures makes up for that with the Wee Free Men. Not-As-Big-As-Medium-Sized-Jock-But-Bigger-Than-Wee-Jock-Jock was definitely not as I had pictured him in the past, but Rob Anybody was nearly perfect.All-in-all, this is an awesome book for any Discworld fan. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool","review":"As another reviewer mentioned, in the US the artwork differs from the British novels. Since I had never had the chance read the British versions of the Discworld books this compendium of artwork was very fresh while not exactly what I had pictured in my mind while reading through the novels.

Therefore, I was interested in this particular book since the reviews suggested that it was clear, entertaining, and respectful.

The tone was condescending and unfortunately far too similar to what I see on sites that seek to REFUTE Catholic teachings with Scripture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disrespectful","review":"I received a copy of The Catholic Verses from Sophia Institute Press to review and I have to say that only within a few pages did I truly feel disappointed. Yet again, Mr. Armstrong seems to have a debate within the covers of this book about Catholics and Protestants and actually includes dialogue of his conversations. Not only did this offend me but also I thought this was unnecessary to be included in this book. For this reason I give this book 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Catholic verses....","review":"Never read this book and never will - the whole Bible was written by Jews, in the Hebrew language.

Beck, who can speak to animals, gets in the middle of a turf war between the hummingbirds and chipmunks, practicing shuttle diplomacy as they critters pelt one another with berries. The anti-war message is simple, but soft -- no blood is shed, but everyone in Neverland is shocked by the bad behavior on each side. Although this isn't the best dramatic narrative in the Pixie Hollow series, it could be a good springboard for conflict resolution-oriented discussions, and talking about how misunderstandings can lead to big problems if left unchecked.

I traded out the batteries and the toy still didn't work. Perhaps there is a bulb inside that needs replacement but sure seems like a lot of trouble to have to fix the toy on the first day! My grandson is most disappointed as it, when it was working, was a cool toy for a little kid with a great light throughout the body and a vibration and little fan. Pretty expensive for a toy that only lasted hours though. After the first one, I gave the manufacturers the benefit of the doubt that I had gotten the one defective one but after giving the boy the second one and it doing the same thing (quitting completely!) I realize the toy is just junk. Darn it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog loved it...smells like a dead animal","review":"Yes, my dog loved this thing for the day we let him have it.

The characters blended well together and the love interest was deep and with morals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very tender, loving story with wonderful characters","review":"The book began a bit slowly, but even at first I really liked the two characters, Evangeline and Scully.

I was sorry to come to the end of the book and look forward to reading Rachael, the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just an OK","review":"The story premise was OK, but the book should have been just a short story like the rest of the series. I skimmed at least 1/3 of the book. There was too much \\"I want to touch, can't touch\\" \\"I want to speak, can't speak.\\" That was the middle 1/3 of the book. Abigail's fever tried to slow me down a little, but I wanted to just get to the end & see how it worked out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Keeps you interested, the characters come to life. Miller always writes a great story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disapointing","review":"This book just never got going.

I have read all of Millers' earlier books and I really feel that this one doesn't even come close to the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Focus on Romance, more focus on the mundane","review":"I do declare this is probably one of the worst books I've ever read. It's so boring I couldn't even finish it, and it's short in comparison to some other novels. I never even got the feeling that Evangeline and Scully were atracted to each other. They were just suddenly in love. But what bothered me the most was that every two pages some is either using the chamber pot, or the outhouse, or needs to \\"twiddle\\" as it was put. I've never read a romance that took such interest in bodily functions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring!!!","review":"This book was boring beyond words. It seems as though the author threw words in this just to fill up the book.... What's was the authors' point of putting this in the book! We all know we're human, but really do you want to read about other people twiddling all the time!Scully was likeable enough, but Eve was never really developed and I didn't get a real sense of her. There was no real romance.In all a terrible book! Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Imaginative","review":"First, I must say that romance novels are not my usual genre, but thought I would give this a read. I found this story very predictable and lacking in imagination. I was able to guess the ending about halfway through the book, and would have liked to have seen a few more twists in the plot, or at least a few that weren't so easily resolved. This struck me as a book that almost anyone who has read a romance or two could have written."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't ever really get into this...","review":"I had to watch this movie to write a paper about it for my music course. We had to watch a few other musical productions like South Pacific, King Creol, Les Miserables, The Magic Flute, etc., and this was my least favorite of the bunchI'm not sure if I didn't like it because of *this* particular production or if I didn't like the musical in general. I just could not really get into the work. I really enjoyed A Little Night Music, so I don't think it's the fault of Sondheim. It's probably a tremendous piece if it can be experienced the right way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great :(","review":"I was really disappointed by this book, especially given the price. When I opened it up and sat down with my boys, the book literally fell apart the first time we looked at it. The foam pages came completely loose from the binding simply from opening the book all the way to look at the pictures. There are only 4-5 pages, too, and one of the, is the same as the cover.

But Ms Bomersbach's book has far more information, much of it new and some culled from personal interviews with Winnie Ruth Judd herself! The author is a top notch researcher to be sure, but not a great storyteller. This book works best as a supplement to its predecessor; I think of them as a set, and with Amazon's used book section, they will both be available for years to come for only a couple of dollars each. Note: Get the Sanctuary paperback reprint of this book--updated after Winnie's death, it has more pictures than the hardcover and an expanded text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I can't believe somebody would invest so much time and energy simply to display some bad opposition to authority.

If you spent a quarter of the time and energy it takes to fight the Police to actually help them and yourself in the process, you would be amazed at the results. But, since there will always be ridiculously stupid people in the world who must villify the men and women who spend, and lose their lives to help these very authors, I guess these books will always be around.

What this book does contain are plenty of typos and too much reliance on outside reviews and articles. This is not so much a biography by Wilkerson, as it is of a collection of concert reviews and previously published articles with a large perentage of the material coming from \\"The Who Concert File\\".In fact, do yourself a favor and save the $34 bucks (expensive for a paperback) and purchase \\"The Who Concert File\\" or continue to wait for the real thing from Townshend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, will be getting more!","review":"A friend turned me on to this CD and I REALLY like it.

It was very obvious how talented Mitchell was. I only regret that parts of the stories were missing. I think this book is more for fans of Margaret Mitchell rather than fans of Gone With the Wind as the stories aren't nearly as sophisticated and deal with completely different subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than GWTW","review":"Everyone thinks of Margaret Mitchell only in terms of GWTW and there is so much more. Through several biographies and letter collections in recent years I have learned that she was a very intriguing woman in ways that would surprise many. Now, this book shows an amazing talent, demonstrated at such a young age. Most charming, perhaps, is her very own insecurity about being good at anything, seemingly, when in fact she was very gifted. What a treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed a better editor","review":"What a disappointment that this book did not have a better editor writing the introductions to the pieces. It could have been greatly improved by having an expert in Mitchell write about her instead of Eskridge.

Yet it is a disappointing book as Taylor seems to get lost in endless erudite arguments about Shakespeare. The book needs far more context than supplied here to explain to the reader what is occurring.The general problem with the reputational school is that hey seem to think that the debate caused by the work, is more important than the work itself. In the end, the quality of Shakespeare's writing and ideas are what continues to encourage study.I am not convinced by the central argument that Shakespeare's reputation is not fully deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle drug","review":"Ever since I had my prostate cancer surgery last year, I have been taking it.

This is probably their worst one. It has like one good song. Nobody Hears. That's their best song on here. I'm am really sorry to say that I want my money back but I can't get it. Oh well. The music on this CD is strange and isn't like ST Punk Rock. And Mike's voice! I hate it! I thought this would be a great album. But it isn't. If you are looking for Mike's original voice and their punk rock and all of that hard stuff and not this girly voice with mellow music, don't buy this! Get something like Freedumb (see my review by Aaron) or another one. Just disappointing....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Collins had no right to produce this album","review":"He just plain ruined it. The magic that Collins has with Queensrhyche he just doesn't have it with Suicidal Tendencies. I knew that this was going to be a terrible album after hearing \\"We Call This Mutha Revenge\\" The guitars are not as dominant here as they were on the classic \\"Lights...Camera...Revolution\\", and that was the one thing that turned me onto Suicidal Tendencies was their sonic-angry guitars. Here it sounds like the group is trying to wax metal with rap, and not succeeding. To me Suicidal Tendencies should've taken the risk, and produced this album themselves, or stuck with the guy who produced \\"Lights...Camera...Revolution\\". None of these songs are good, and I would not buy this album. It's a long way down from being nominated for a grammy with \\"Lights...Camera...Revolution\\", but perhaps that was the problem. Maybe Suicidal Tendencies wasn't destined for being commercial. They just lucked out with \\"Lights...Camera...Revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good comeback after \\"Lights\\"","review":"This album is more like \\"Lights\\" than \\"How Will I Laugh\\" in it's song writing style but done way better. The tunes are good, not dry like \\"Lights\\" and the album feels well-produced. You'll find the songs high in content and quality but not that fast or thrashy. This is NOTHING like early S.T.'s but it is a good album nonetheless. I regard this as Suicidal's last good album. Trust me, after this, it's completely downhill in the worst way."},{"rating":"2","title":"these guys got some skills","review":"lo and behold, these guys can bring it. rather than just put out the chops on the guitar that any 2 year old can do, this is an album with some premeir muscicianship.

Though i like some of their earlier work ('how can i laugh tommorow...' and 'waking the dead' come to mind), i always found these guys to be somewhat amateur and i dont care what the die hards say. Well, they've gone pro now. Thats not to say they've sold out people,it simply means they've finally decided to stop ripping off people with albums with 1 or 2 good songs and put together a solid full album effort here.

Anyone think to run this through a spell-checker before releasing it?) After watching it, I couldn't even recall any of the characters' names because of the lack of plot/character development.

I first encounterd Nhat hanh in a jewel of a book, THE RAFT IS NOT THE SHORE,a dialogue with Daniel Berrigan,S.J.[soon to be reprinted]Sine then, i have read as much of Thich hat hanh as I can.This book is a group of essays and statements to the press covering a period form early in the vietnam war{Nhat Hanh has been in exile since the mid 1960's]up to the gulf war. The opening is a play {a short one] that takes place in vietnam. The other essays[very well written] cover like minded subjects: Buddhism in Vietnam, on simplicity,refugees{boat people,specifically] and the title piece.Along with Maha Ghosananda,{called the Gandhi of cambodia, the patriarch of Cambodian buddhism] nhat hanh is a boddhitsatva,a living saint. we are graced by his presence,and his writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it as a SuperSaver Shipping Filler, very happy I did.","review":"I eventually used this to put a 6 port multi-input outlet on my wall.

I consider it to be \\"top shelf\\" because not only does it protect the inside of my firearms, but the outside as well, by creating a protective barrier from rust and corrosion, which is cause by certain gunpowders, but also from your fingerprints when handling. The oils in you skin can cause the pitting on the surface of the gun barrel. G-96 \\"leaves no gummy residue\\" Fireams are very expensive, so it is important to keep them clean,so whether you're a hunter, collector, or just enjoy plinking,G-96 should be your choice.

I thought it would be a sweeping love story between Clara and Robert, but the only love revealed is the one between Landis and his typewriter. His writing was not only tedious to slog through, but I came away from this book disliking the author. Pages, chapters could be slashed. It was ridiculously overlong (to the point of tears) and gave no insight into love between these two remarkable individuals. I recommend reading the primary sources instead of this drivel. Landis gets one star for his immense research (I think ALL of it is discussed in the book.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"LONG WINDED","review":"IF I KNEW IT WAS WRITTEN LIKE A TEXTBOOK, LONG WINDED, OVERLY DESCRIPTIVE, TIRESOMELY LONG, AND FULL OF FOREIGN VOCABULARY, THEN I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT LONGING FOR PLEASURABLE READING. IT TOOK ME NEARLY THREE WEEKS TO COMPLETE BECAUSE I READ FOR ENJOYMENT AND LONGING WAS AN ORDEAL. THE BIBLIOGRAPHY ALONE WAS A SHORT BOOK IN ITSELF. GRANTED THE AUTHOR WAS VERY THOROUGH IN THIS BIOGRAPHY, BUT IT WASN'T A NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDER OR A KATHERINE GRAHAM TYPE OF READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen while you read","review":"\\"Longing\\" inspired me to play every CD of Robert and Clara Schumann's music that I could find. What a way to add another layer of beauty to a compelling and satisfying reading experience! I listened while I read, and played the music written in the year of the sections, then I listened some more when I wasn't reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearls in Slime","review":"The author of this book can be thanked for sparking my interest in looking up Clara Wieck and Robert Schumann and finding out the real facts of their lives. The book itself treats important aspects of their lives with an ambiguous shimmer that shouldn't be acceptable when writing of historically real people.For music lovers, the details of Clara's playing technique, the quality of various pianos, the contemporary view of Schumann's work as avant-garde, are fascinating tidbits despite the prose through which they must struggle to find them.My own view of this process is of fishing pearls out of slime. The author's archly prurient style casts an unpleasant light over the whole story.To be more charitable (possibly) I quote from the author himself in answer to a question about the style: \\"Maybe it's a bit of Henry James meets Thomas Mann, and the two of them go to bed with Edith Wharton.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Schumannesque","review":"I wish this book possessed the Romantic genius of Robert Schumann's best music rather than collecting the literal facts of his life. A biography in the guise of fiction, complete with scholarly footnotes, all this books needs is an index - that, and a perfervid imagination. I wanted to enjoy Longing, but it was so slow and meandering, I only longed for it to be over. The minutiae of scholarship defeated me. There is invented dialogue amidst all the factual detail, but it does not transport, much less convince. If you want true fantasy, choose Schumann's Fantasy in C - Longing is far too literal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xbox 360 Pro Gamer Case.","review":"This case is great for the price! I love the way it is made for the 360 and everything fits in it perfect! Its not heavy at all. The only bad thing i found about it was that the clamps to lock lock it dont always match up perfect. Sometimes you have to push down on it to close it all the way. But other than that I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latches broke after two days","review":"This case is very cheaply made. One of the latches broke after using it only twice...the other did not seem far behind. I ordered a replacement from Amazon and the SAME THING happened again.

Stay away from this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A word on stability. ..","review":"The main component of this product is Pressed cardboard glued together that is about 1/8 of an inch thick.

Everything Fits Easily!","review":"This case is perfect. Everything easily fits into it. The controllers, Power Brick, Power cords, MAin system etc. There is even room to spare. I don't know what the people were doing that say it doesn't have room, but I can fit everything and still have room to spare. It also holds several games with cases and has two places for Memory units. It easily has room for more than one set of video cables. Definitely a good deal for someone who wants to carry their 360 to different locations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gamers Case for 360.","review":"I bought this case for my 360 so I could move and not worry. It fits 4 X-box and/or 360 games and 2 Memory Cards that are protected with a hard lined flap with velcrow straps. The case is lined with soft foam to protect your 360. There are 3 slots for the Consol, AC Adapter and AV cords. The outside is hard as a rock! Best protection you can buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pro Gamers Case drops to minor league","review":"Looks nice and shiny. Good inner cushions and design. 'Just enough' to limited space. The thinness of the aluminum case, makes it fairly light, but provides minor league protection, and sturdiness. The frail single hinge on one side does not allow the case to open and shut by simply raising and lowering the top lid. I have to hold and adjust the hinge while closing to keep it from bending. I bought it with rewards points, so am not dissappointed, but probably would opt for something more strong and dependable if paying face value."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"When I got this product, I was incredibly excited because I've been really worried about taking my system to college and it getting damaged along the way.This product made me worry even more because when it arrived, the interior was in pieces. Yes, pieces. Considering that the case was only thirty bucks, I guess I got what I paid for. While I would say that it probably happened in transit, I don't really know how the inside could have gotten so torn up unless it was poorly constructed in the first place..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It.","review":"The xbox case was money well spent. However, this case for the 360 is useless. The reason why is that there is no room for the powerbrick. To me the purpose of this case is to be able to protect your investment (all of it) when you are traveling with it. If you have to get something else to put the powerbrick in, then you really have defeated the purpose. Avoid this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can i say.","review":"I just read what everyone else wrote. I have no problem with all items fitting in mine.

So, naturally I had to buy seasons 1 & 3, then 4.This is one stand-out series."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really investigation","review":"The original CSI series is FANTASTIC because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence. This series uses the CSI name without the investigating that makes the original so good. It is mainly a mellow-drama surrounding the lives of the characters. Some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor, but there's no mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"We have alot of Vtech toys and love their nursery farm. We bought this because my husband liked the idea of a \\"joystick toy\\" and thought our son might too. Honestly, he is not really interested at all. When you press the buttons it saysthings like A is for Ape - but you are pressing a green triangle. It has a small pictures outline in white of an ape, but I am not sure it is clear enough to have any learning value for a child. Anyway, my son has never been interested in this toy and that's OK, as beyond cause and effect - which many other toys do a better job teaching - we find it has little value. Try the move and crawl ball for a 9+ month-old or nursery farm for 0-3yrs. There are just better options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not engaging","review":"For the price, I thought this would be a great buy, but my son hasn't really bothered with it, from 4 mos. on up to his age now, 15 months. The joystick was fun for a minute or two - it makes really cute noises and moves easily - but that was about it. This toy also has some buttons with shapes, etc., but they're not attention-grabbing, and there might be too much going on to help the little ones \\"get it.\\" He's learned more from books, shape sorters, etc. Also, the \\"left brain,\\" \\"right brain\\" toy concept was intriguing, but in hindsight, it seems a little silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"The flag arrived quite quickly after I purchased it. Though it was inexpensive and my expectations were not high as far as the quality was concerned, the face of one of the figures (Prosperity) is so distorted that she seems to be winking. Worth the amount spent, but not sure I'd actually want to fly this version publicly. If you actually want to fly a NJ State Flag, you're better off purchasing a higher quality version without distortions and more accurate in its depictions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading product description doesn't fit 52\\" waist","review":"Nice looking belt.

Dehkes and Ballet Shoes and Theatre Shoes by Noel Streatfeild. However, as others have commented, The Wind on the Moon is the one I've reread the most. My old hardcover edition is well-loved, and it is probably no coincidence that my all-time favorite book also is about two sisters: The Old Wives' Tale by Arnold Bennett. It is wonderful to see The Wind on the Moon back in print and to give it as a gift for today's children to discover and enjoy. It is absolutely magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"certainly one of the best books I have ever read","review":"This book kept me gripped as I waited to find the latest twist in the tale and I was never disappointed; it containedg everything from sorcery to high adventure.

I was worried that a compilation this large, and with such an extravagent title, would be B-side offerings, but that's not the case at all.This isn't an album if you are looking for something \\"fresh and new.\\" The arrangements are traditional, and even newer carols are done in a fairly conservative style. But that said, some of the pieces provide the best orchestration and voice arrangement I have ever heard. This is like the pinnacle of the classic English Christmas carol; clean, precise, glorious and celebratory."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful collection","review":"I bought one piece (See amid the winter snow) then ended up purchasing the album to add to my Christmas music collection.
