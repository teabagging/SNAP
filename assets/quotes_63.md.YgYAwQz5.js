He made everything look terribly simple. Well the blessed event finally occurred and I did everything according to textbook. I've had trouble with my colt since. He doesn't respect me, no matter how hard I am with him. I've never seen him submit, obey after a big fight, but never submit. Submit = licking and chewing behavior. He still fights me with the feet occasionally. In fact almost broke my arm the other day after a war with the back hoof. Most will say it works with fillies but not with colts. It could just be my colt, but it sure has been an ongoing battle. I don't recommend the method or the book. Yes handle your foals, but I wouldn't overwhelm them with 45 minutes of stimuli. I would gently do each stimulas as the day progresses and as the weeks progress. One thing at a session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imprinting really makes a difference!","review":"We bought this book for the 2000 foal season and were amazed at the difference it has made in our babies this year! I have been breeding Tennessee Walkers for 7 years and had heard that imprinting made a significant impact with new foals - so I deceided to try a little experiment. Our first foal, came unexpectedly in the night - three weeks early - we didn't find her until the next morning. The next mare, we watched every minute until the foal finally came. We used the methods in the book and have a truely happy and socialized stud colt. I had a customer come to view the two babies, and he commented on the difference in behavior of the two foals. The non-imprinted filly, acted scarey and distrusting - the imprinted foal walked right up to him. It is like day and night. The bonding that occurs with the foal is unbelievable. Anyone who breeds should buy this book and used the well explained method that I know have changed our babies for the better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WORKS!!!","review":"I bought this book when my mare was five months preg. I read hundreds of times. When my foal came I did exactly what was in it, and my foal loads, ties, is good for the farrier, leads, ponies, EVERYTHING!

I highly recommend this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Wow, this cd is just so beautiful, I don't know where to start. Maybe you should just listen to the samples and decide for yourself. The musical style is calm but never boring, thoughtful but never depressing. And there are dozens of creative twists. For example, the music for Crimson is actually a classical piece by Chopin.But it is Nichole's lyrics, as always, which really take center stage. For example, the song Hold On, which is about God's love and how He can redeem and love even the worst of sinners, made me cry the first time I heard it. Other songs, like Live, really challenged me.I highly recommend this album for anyone who wants music that rises above the predictable, cheesy, \\"Jesus is my girlfriend\\" fluff that, sadly, is most Christian music today."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Music Fumbles, The Words Mumble, & The Message is Jumbled!","review":"I was very disappointed with this CD.The lyrics seemed to be written in a hurry.The music overwhelmed Nicole's voice and was actually annoying at times.Simply put: This is one of those Christian CD's that is unremarkable in every way, and will be in the bargain bin in a matter of months. Don't waste your money.Skip this one if you are looking for deep spiritual lyrics, passionate vocals, and stirring music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"I love the song, Brave, every time I hear it on the radio, but after sampling all the other songs it isn't an album worth buying. It's also the only song you hear on the radio--for obvious reasons. It's pretty much the same saga with all of her albums. Her previous album had about 3 or 4 songs that I could listen to, but I mainly bought it because of the song Holy. Soon I hope to get an MP3 player, so I will be downloading Brave. Maybe next time Nichole Nordeman will seek to make a better album with more likeable songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"made me cry","review":"i don't actually have this cd yet, but today i heard the song \\"what if\\" and it made me cry. it was one of those songs that come along at the perfect moment, and become that much more meaningful to you because of it. i will be going out and buying this tomorrow - cant afford next day shipping, and cant wait to hear this song again. it was that moving! i am instantly a nichole nordeman fan, and the rest of her music is this wonderful... i will be buying all her other cds at some point, i'm sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I absolutely love Nichole's previous 3 albums and give them my highest rating so I was expecting the same with this.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brave-Nicole Nordeman","review":"I personally only like one song on this album and that is the first one. The rest of the songs I think are boring.

I was worried about the thin gauge of the wire but my house didn't burn down so I guess it was OK. I am not excited about the quality of the workmanship but the product worked and didn't cause a problem so I had to give it four stars. I can't give it 5 stars because the poor construction made me nervous about it causing a fire the whole time it was in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buzz buzz buzz!","review":"This cord buzzed the minute I hooked it up to my amp. It wasn't terribly bothersome at first, and since I only intended to practice with it, I thought I could live with it. But within a week, it went from a low hum to a loud crackling static that was unbearable. I could hardly hear the guitar over the noise.I have since replaced the cord with a different brand and have had no issues. I won't be buying this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm very happy with this LCD TV","review":"As mentioned by others, the HD picture quality is spectacular.One great feature this TV has, that most others don't, is two separate antenna inputs. This allows you to use both an antenna/rabbit ears for over-the-air HD and also regular cable TV. With most sets, you'd have to use an A-B splitter to switch between the two. So if you have such a setup in mind, or just want to see HD before you commit to expensive digital cable, this set is ideal.This TV has a very nice menu system, good sound, case looks great, lots of inputs.Only flaws, the remote is a bit busy with lots of buttons, and I've found the ON timer sometimes doesn't work on my set. Don't rely on it as an alarm clock.Overall, a terrific set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first HD","review":"The ideal economy HD set. It's chock full of features and has a handsome, non-reflective console. The default picture mode can be a little dim for me, but you can adjust the brightness. It also seems to run a little hot, but that's probably the case for all flat panel TVs. Antenna strength could be better, but heck, at least it has one.Full disclosure, mine broke down after 5 months. But Samsung service has been pretty good. Customer service was pleasant. They sent a repairman out to my home that same week. After replacing some components in the back, it still wasn't working, so they sent me a new set the following week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good product","review":"Before purchsing this TV, we did a little research on the similar products. Samsung finally stood out among our choices. We have been watching this 32 inch TV for almost a month to date. Except for the not great speaker and slow start-up, the TV meets our expectation for a stylish LCD HDTV with good quality at an entry-level price. We like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GReat TV","review":"This TV was amazing, picked it up for just over $800 and i love it.

I almost paid additional for the LNS3251D to get that, and I'm glad I didn't.Haven't had the unit long enough to evaluate anything else, but wanted to mention these before I forgot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine died :(","review":"I purchased this tv in Oct 2006 (not from Amazon) so it's currently 3 1/2 years old. As of today the picture no longer works and trust me, I've checked all the connections and all other \\"duh!\\" issues that I could, as did my husband. I liked it up until today but dh insisted from day one that the picture was not as good as the other brands that his friends have. This is now a discontinued model as per my recent internet search. If you're looking for longevity, choose another one. I'd hate to think that these newer televisions are only made to last a few years what with how much they cost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good HDTV, but not perfect.","review":"This was our second HDTV, the first being an excellent Samsung DLP. Overall, I've been very pleased with the performance of the display. What keeps it from being perfect are its dearth of inputs. With a playstation, tivo, vcr and coax cable attached all the inputs are used -- including the side inputs. The second, and perhaps more unfortunate issue is a slight ghosting effect during rapidly moving sports programs. Not intolerable, but noticeable under close scrutiny. These two issues keep this television from being a 5 star item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Please do yourself a favor and search the internet for problems with this TV and other Samsung televisions. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture Distortion","review":"In the correct wide screen sizing of 16X9 the picture is very stretched to the point of being distorted. In a zoom picture size the picture appears more realistic but the tops of peoples heads are very often cut off. Do not buy this TV sight unseen as we did. Make sure you see it in person before wasting a thousand dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Unsatisfied","review":"I ordered a TV that I never ended up receving due to a problem with the condition and not enough in stock. The only way I would have even knew that information was because I called up to find out. If I had not called then I would never have knew why besides the refund.

The quality is also excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story continues...","review":"The second book in Walter Jon Williams' Dread Empire's Fall series, The Sundering, resumes exactly where The Praxis left off. It continues the story of Gareth Martinez and Caroline Sula as they battle to retake the Shaa empire from the Naxid rebels. The writing and characterization continue to be top notch so if you enjoyed the first book you will definitely like the second. Although the second book was good, I felt that it put a lot of pressure on the third book to determine whether the series will be great or not. In other words, after reading about these people and their war for two volumes, I need the third book to be truly spectacular in order to make the first two books pay off. Therefore, I will withhold judgement on the entire series until I finish the third book, but if the first two books are any indication, I don't think I'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I suffered through the first book in this series, hoping that Book 2 would be better. It is painfully boring. There is not a single space battle in either book, just people floating around in space guessing what might be happening on the various planets.Sula's character is completely unbelievable (the \\"Sula\\" that is pretending to be Sula). You get to learn very little about the alien species in these books. If you want a real space opera, read Saga of Seven Suns or the Night's Dawn. This book sucked so bad that I returned it and the rest of the series. Boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one!","review":"This \\"Authorized Biography\\" is nothing but quotes from the \\"Diary\\" -- which is EXCELLENT.

The other actors are just okay, and it is hard to care much about anyone or anything in this film. The creature effects are also rather cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCREAM IS MERELY A WHIMPER","review":"I really enjoyed the previous entries in the AFTER DARK ORIGINALS so I'm a little disappointed in SCREAM OF THE BANSHEE. Production values are more direct-to-DVD level and the performances far below expectations. Maybe the SyFy channel is focusing more on quantity rather than quality.The premise of the Irish banshee folklore has possibilities but a poorly written script and weak performances result in a sloppy execution. Lauren Holly seems totally disinterested in her role as does the venerable Lance Henriksen who seems to do anything for a paycheck. The lesser known actors are just awful. There are a couple of jolts in the movie but nothing truly terrifying. Also the sound mixing is terrible. The sound effects blare out even making the banshee's scream more annoying than frightening and the dialogue obnoxiously soft. Keep your remote handy.Hopefully After Dark originals coming up (AREA 51 and THE TASK) are better than this misfire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screaming for it to end","review":"I gave this movie two stars for the first 20 minutes. After that it seemed to me to become a mish-mosh into unoriginal horror fluff. Feh."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horror film???","review":"This was an embarrassment to the horror film industry. I completely understand that \\"After Dark Originals\\" are \\"a new brand of fear\\", but this one is an old brand of junk. I had a hard time keeping my eyes open, but when I realized I should give it a chance, I found myself laughing at some of the so-called gore scenes. The cranberry juice they must have used as blood, looked more like an aged Cabernet or Merlot. The banshee makeup looked like it was make of Play Dough. This is really bad. I couldn't find an actor/actress in the flick. Don't waste your time or money. Let the banshee scream. Save yourself the screams of disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie!","review":"Okay, This is NOT Syfy garbage, like someone mentioned. It is really good, Well thought out, horror. It has some really creepy Scenes in the movie. Although, It Doesn't Come across as a B Movie, it is still a really good movie. All the Actor's were really good, Except one. The Young Guy. I Reccomend That you check this movie out."},{"rating":"2","title":"SLAUGHTER ON TENTH AVE- Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops","review":"On this album, recorded in 1958, Fiedler is at its best. \\"Slaughter on Tenth Ave\\" is a great musical score and a famous black and white, gangster film was made of it back in 1951 and released in 1952, starring Richard Egan.This album is another reason why the Boston Pops is my favorite classical orchestra and the late maestro Arthur Fiedler was a true master of his profession. His work will never be forgotten. Having lived in Boston for nearly 17 years, made the Boston Pops my favorite of the genre.I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS BAD","review":"I THOUGHT THIS CD WAS VERY BAD.

It has proved to be a very useful resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive collection of maps and information!","review":"If you have every other book on Baja, you might as well add this to your collection. I found the information about areas of Baja which I have personally been to both accurate and interesting, which leads me to believe the best about the many other areas which I have not been to yet.

Baja is an amazing place and this book will provide you with useful new information for both the first time traveler and seasoned explorer alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing! :(","review":"I bought this book hoping to get some insights for my up coming trip to the Cabo/Baja area. I was very disappointed. The book is FAR MORE a campers guide than a fishing guide. Inspite of being a 3rd edition the pictures look VERY OLD! And judging by the tackle, lures, boats and vehicles in the pics they all seem to have been taken in the 70's. As to fishing info, very general at best. Very little on specific tackle, riggings etc. And the \\"best times to fish\\" calendars conflict completely with just about all other guides (at least for the areas I was interested in). If you plan to trailer a camper or camp out it seems to have a lot of info on camp sites.

This film, I'm sad to say, is merely a shadow of what it could have been.The basic plot -- an elderly (yet charming) con-man tricks his recently widowed brother-in-law into taking a cruise. Enormous humor could have been derived from this basic premise -- but unfortunately, enormous humor was NOT the result. The plot was shallow and predictable, and the humor muted. While there were a few points at which I laughed, it is certainly not the comedy classic \\"Grumpy Old Men\\" was.I can't imagine ever caring to see this film again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim in NC","review":"Great Movie!!!

This time around Matthau plays Charlie a gambler who decides to take his friend/brother in law on cruise to hide from a bookie to whom he owes money and to meet women. Lemmon plays Charlies friend Herb. But there is one problem, to get passage free, Charlie signed the two up as dance hosts on the cruise. Once on the cruise they meet the tight ass cruise director Gil Godwyn who is always out through the whole movie to get the two in trouble. Lots of great fun, and comedy! And even a little romance. Its great! Definletly see if you are a fan of the two. Its very funny and worothy to watch over and over. Great performances by the two, and Golden Girl's Rue McClanhan. A MUST SEE.

This is the beginning, of course. Whenever the book starts to talk about a specific type of pedal, or another piece of gear, you are sure confused, because there is no picture.There is only one good about this book, which gives the names of good kayak books!

I've read two books by Marsh. I hurried through the end of both to get rid of the \\"oh so boring\\" characters not because I was so excited over who the killer was.

There're enough plot twists to keep the viewer on his/her toes (yes, men will enjoy it too). The acting, cinematography, settings and music combine to make this a lovely viewing experience. I became an even bigger fan of Stephen Dillane (check him out in \\"Welcome to Sarajevo\\") and Sophie Marceau (why waste her in something as silly as \\"Lost & found\\"?) after seeing this.

The acting is just superb and you can feel every little emotion (and passion!) from actors, Sophie Marceau and Stephen Dillane.

And Stephen Dillane (so good in the HBO-produced \\"John Adams\\" mini-series) is near-perfect as the man who falls in love with her...and tries desperately to forget her after she bears his child (a paid arrangement - she receives money, most desperately needed, in exchange for their baby). Without giving away any plot-points, there are many obstacles in their path of happiness and shared devotion to their child, and both of them are tested in severe measure.

Yes, this movie was well done and is incredibly well acted but it is pushing a message and a gross agenda. From the very beginning when the two come together to make love for the sake of having a child, to when Dillane and Marceau again make love to satisfy their lust while Dillane's poor wife lies in her bed upstairs, to when Dillane kills his wife because he wants to be with Marceau, to when Marceau and Dillane decide that what they did was okay because they wanted to. Disgusting. Dillane's father (his name escapes me) talks of living life only for simple pleasures... we are meant to frown upon him and smile at Dillane for being so much more of a man for living life for deep pleasure. What an irony. Crazy that nobody else thinks this movie is a shame...

The plot is a tad predictable, but so are many classic themes, and the real test is how well they are done. This one has few false notes, and re notes, the score is so lovely I went to considerable trouble to find it and purchase it. This movie does have a bit of a Jane Eyre feel. The only slightly false note is the daughter is hard to warm up to, because her part is written so that she is really obnoxious, just a hair of jumping the shark here. But Sophie and the score are so wonderful you can ignore any minor hitches. This one is worth buying, and so is the score, if you can find either one.

I thought it was good. It was more like The Karate Kid and Last Action Hero. Because it's talking about a kid who learns Karate and he has a movie hero friend with him. It's about a boy named Barry (Jonathan Brandis) who is picked on all the time by a bunch of bullies and he is going through some difficult times with his life. He has an imaginery movie hero friend named (Chuck Norris) who tries to save him from the bullies. Then, later on his friend teaches him Karate and he starts to defend himself. I can't tell you the rest because I don't want to ruin the whole movie for you. But anyways it's a great movie if ya'll hadn't seen it go rent it first before buying it because it may be boring for the first time you see it.

It would seem that upon receiving this script, Chuck Norris was badly in need of work and it was either this or tossing burgers.

Sarah may have the house, the clothes and all the becessities of life but what she does not have is the passion. Easily solved, the young gardener in a flash is on Sarah faster than stink on a donkey, and that is where the problem lays with this book. The gardener is hardly anything close to either a romanic, intelligent or erotic... he is what he is ... a gardener. Hey I might like real life erotica but you know this 'affair' between the gardner and our heroine is tawdry, and boring.Trust me the picture that the author paints in the eye of the reader is not pretty .....

I gave the current Organic version a try and Lo, and Behold, it is the pure nutty fruity sweet taste I recall! Hurray!

Once the aliens fire the first shot, all hell brakes loose as the action becomes rapid and intense between the good and bad. After very beautiful patriotic music, the battle continues for the final time, ending with victorious and extremely patriotic music. Listening to it makes you proud to be an American and human.

I recoiled at spending over $20 for a can opener, but I didn't want something that wasn't going to do the job; then I found this little beauty on clearance at my local grocery store. What a great product! It certainly fills the bill, in that it's black, and it opens cans! I haven't tried the knife sharpener yet, but this unit does a great job opening cans. It's much quieter than its predecessor, and I have had no problems whatsoever opening large, tall cans.

The entire album is filled with wonderful covers, such as Cat Stevens' \\"Oh Very Young\\" and the funny \\"Where in the World Is My Prince\\" from Jerry Herman; some unrecorded jems, including \\"I Can't Believe My Heart\\" which was cut from Disney's \\"Hercules;\\" and lesser-known songs such as the quietly beautiful \\"There Are No Words\\" and the comical \\"Taylor, the Latte Boy.\\" Egan uses her magnificent voice to inject each song with just the right amount of emotion, be it humor or tenderness.

His candor regarding his painful divorce and coming home to a dark, empty house at the end of the day was moving.The past few years I have read many stories of corporate executives taking advantage of their power and stealing from the companies they are entrusted with. Kiril's dedication to integrity, honesty and compassion helps restore my faith in the corporate world.After reading this book I wanted to learn more about Kiril. My research found he is genuine in his message of courage and compassion.

You can adjust the voice/music up and down and it even has a switch in the battery compartment that keeps the volume low no matter how high they turn it up that you need a screw driver to get to but I found it too quiet with this on. Would be nice for a car ride to turn down. Takes batteries but there is a slip for 5 dollars you can send in for the AC adapter. The only thing I don't get is the 2nd microphone is a headset and is kind of hard to figure out how to put on, even for adults.

And shortly after we received the spy glass (we bought 2), one broke apart (the eye piece that telescopes down into the spyglass came unglued). If you are looking for a spy glass your child may get to enjoy for a while, I would suggest you keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Very disappointed with the quality of this item.

The field of view is tiny, and it can only focus on objects quite far away-- nothing within the same room. It is difficult to focus even on distant objects; my 4-year-old will not be able to use it. Disappointing. Save yourself the hassle of having to ship it back and choose a better-rated spyglass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Live Up To The Hype","review":"I found this product to be easy to install, but clumsy to use do to the continued reliance on both the CD and a set of applications installed by the product on my PC. I also found it to have limited applicability to my needs - it turned out to be oriented more toward basic conversational Dutch (the kind you might use standing outside a coffee shop in Amsterdam) rather than the words and phrasings that would be commonly found in business communications (which is what I was looking for). Perhaps this comes up in later Levels of the product, but given the price I paid for Level 1 Dutch, I'm not throwing good money after bad to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I used this product a month before studying abroad in Belgium for 4 months and after I was there. It allowed me to understand some basic Dutch and to survive in a foreign country. I really enjoyed clicking through the software and learning the new vocabulary. Knowing some basic Dutch really added to my international student exchange experience. I had no previous knowledge of Dutch or German before using the software. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Funny today","review":"Funny how you can hear something as a kid and it was funny and then you play it as an adult and it is still as funny now as it was then.

With a familiarity of only the basics of bookbinding and only a few bindings under my belt I was able to follow the instructions in this book to produce some lovely and remarkable books. This book is unique in that it answers the problem of how to get single page bindings to lie flat, a problem that vexed me until I happened upon SSSS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy for mixed media artists!","review":"This is a great book for printmakers or visual artists using heavy paper stock or mixed media.

In point of fact, this book is more social service that index of genteel habits. It is the perfect gift for the frustrated women of our age, a not-so-subtle hint to their woefully unaware, hirsute counterparts.

Maybe the instructor was getting a kick back or royalites from the sale of the book, I don't know, but I could have saved my money.

It is, without a doubt, the worst recording of Company ever. Adrian Lester is so bad as Bobby; lifeless and monotonous. For the life of me I can't understand what anyone sees in him. The rest of the cast is pretty bad too, and the recording sounds like it was made in a stadium with odd acoustics that go in and out. The original Broadway cast is still the best, followed by the 1995 Broadway revival (Boyd Gaines is great), and then the bizarre 2006 Broadway revival (am I the only one who detests John Doyle's minimalist approach with the cast members playing the instruments???)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indescribably bad","review":"Perhaps the best things to be said about this debacle are that the orchestration recaptures the sound of the premiere production (unlike the tinny little band in the '95 Roundabout recording) and that Harry is an exceptionally strong vocal presence. The \\"Noo Yawk\\" accents are crassly overdone and Sheila Gish's tremulous, overinflected Joanne is like someone's notion of an Elaine Strich parody. Worst of all is Adrian Lester, the world's dullest actor and an inexplicable choice for Bobby. His thin, whiny non-voice is like fingernails on chalkboard and sinks this recording single-handed. Only for Sondheim completists and incurable masochists."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather act it out myself.","review":"I've seen Company performed by the 95 cast and a recent Pittsburgh cast this year (2001).

In 96 a cd was released that puts the brilliant show to shame. Sheila Gish [borrows from] Elaine Stritch as Joanne. The man who plays Bobby sounds like an infant with a nasal problem. The girl who plays Amy makes Amy into a caricature of the character. I have heard people say that this revival is comparable to the original... while I must admit I have never seen this production I must say that I find the cd version aweful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinky Friedman meets Neil Gaiman! Cool!","review":"The back cover blurb of this book led me to think that this would be either the coolest book ever, or one of the worst. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised. Roberson has created a whole new thing: a supernatural murder mystery. I think that fans of both mysteries and sf/fantasy would like it. Mostly it's just a very interesting story about a freelance journalist who gets caught up in a web of intrigue surrounding a mysterious ancient artifact. The book digresses into faithful reproductions of pulp crime stories, western tales, even a \\"lost\\" greek tragedy. I recommend this to anyone who likes mysteries with a little something different thrown in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked, Wicked, Wicked!!","review":"This is House at its best. DJ Garth's track selection is superb as usual. Dub House, Tech House, Jazzy House. My favorite tracks were Nectar-Bellz (wicked beat, with some dubbed out, creepy sounding bells), Solomonic Sound-Children of Israel (great dub track with reggae vocals), 2 Utes-Up All Night (Dj Buck remixes this track with a beat that makes me want to get up and dance every time I here it), Shuffle Inc.-Remember Chicago (Where were you when you first heard House?). The only problem I had with this CD is that it left me wanting more. 70 minutes just isn't enough. Also check out Garth's Cisco System CD if you can find it. It's a great CD showcasing tracks from Garth's own label, Grayhound Records (and it includes his international underground hit, 20 minutes of Disco Glory). San Francisco Sessions Vol. 3 - DJ Garth is another excellent CD. If you're a true househead, you can't go wrong with Garth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little practice book","review":"This book is nothing special, just a bunch of very simple crossword puzzles.

It's mostly in English, with bits of Spanish and French. I don't care for the English parts of the CD and I do hope Cirque Du Soleil will cut some singles of the original version sung by the talented Audrey Jutras.

I should know better, but this POWDER sounded different than any other. Well, I got it home, and patted it on, just a tiny bit; INSTANT WRINKLES!! I looked 10 years older. The first ingredient is Talc, so there you go. I don't know how it is possible that other women with lines under their eyes do not have this product settle in them. I am so disappointed, now I have to return the powder, wasting more time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, don't see much difference","review":"I had a giftcard, so I bought this to set my Laura Mercier under eye concealer which is great for coverage, but a little sticky. Honestly, I don't really see much difference. I could use loose powder and it would look almost the same. It's super expensive. It will probably last me forever though. I love the Laura Mercier concealers and tinted moisturizer, but this just seems like a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"brightens yes but accentuates fine lines too","review":"I have used this brightening powder for at least a year and began to see its flaws over time. Yes it does lighten dark circles under the eyes since the powder is very white, (apply it over your concealer) which was really great at the start, but i then realized that it also accentuates fine lines under the eyes as well, making them more pronounced than had i gone without it. So as much as i still have a jar and a half left, i havent touched it or used it in over a year. I'd rather just use my concealer and go without this powder (since we all use concealers anyway which can be enough) than have my eyes looking old and lined and wrinkled underneath."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's does a little brigtening but not worth $22","review":"It's ok. I do see a little brightening effect when I apply it over concealer under my eyes and along the sides of my nose. I think it's way too expensive for what it does though."},{"rating":"1","title":"No noticeable difference","review":"I had high hopes for this product, but I really didn't see any difference when I put it on. I have dark circles, and this didn't do any brightening at all. It really seemed more like any regular translucent powder. I guess I was expecting some sort of shimmer or something. I don't really have any lines yet, so I can't comment on it settling there. Honestly, I ended up using it as an all-over face powder once my regular powder ran out, just so I could use it up. I wanted to love it, but it just didn't do anything special for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great powder!","review":"This is the perfect under eye brightener, it brightens the area enough without looking obvious, if I ever run out of this I would purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful product","review":"I use this every time I put on concealer.

To read a story about a woman making through, with her family, to CA for the gold rush was amazing. Specially since it was historically accurate, using real diaries for it's story line.

Most notable cuts occur in the songs 'Ridiculous Thoughts' where the haunting opening bars by Dolores are completely cut out and the 'Hollywood' track had the opening shortened as well. If you're a stickler for the original versions of the songs, then this \\"Best Of\\" may not be agreeable with you.

The Japanese version of Rosetta stone had English phonetics with the Japanese audio, and that was ten years ago. I don't know why they didn't stick with that approach for Hindi.

Personal taste I know but pop \\"Desert Song\\" in for \\"Dancer\\" and you've just about got the best of the first four albums in one hit. Great place then to start an MSG collection if you've just discovered the best heavy rock guitarist of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant and Provocative","review":"The Dazzle of the Light is a poignant and provocative tale of one man's journey after the death of his older brother. The main character refuses to accept the platitudes of others and wants to face his grief head on. The book reminds me of early Hermann Hesse, a bildungsroman in which we follow the progress of one character over the course of the novel. Lyrical, funny, bittersweet, eventually uplifting. The Dazzle of the Light is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid","review":"this album is very solid. Its got some great tracks and only a couple that I wasnt feeling.

I have for awhile now. This is an EP, and as such, it is pretty short. I haven't heard everything that they did in the past, but judging from what I know, this EP is like EARTH 2 junior. Not as monolithic and friggin' crazy as EARTH 2, but not as \\"poppy\\" as Pentastar. I enjoy Carlson's riffin. I guess that is all I have to say about it. If you enjoy the sonic stylings of EARTH, than why not buy this one too? I mean, come on. It is only 9 bucks or whatever. What the hell else would you do with that money? Spend it on fast food? Or maybe a couple packs of smokes? Buy the CD, and then take your Lim' Bizkut and Deftone CDs to the used store, sell them and then go buy your smokes.

It also provides other details such as popularity and information about owner's likes and dislikes regarding available features. There are LOTS of color photos to look at throughout the book.

The material has been sturdy and the pockets are a nice size. I like how the apron feels around the shoulders and was easy to adjust to fit. I'm 5ft 11\\" about 195lbs. If I were a few inches taller it may be on the short side. But it's a perfect size for the average height and build man or woman for that matter. It is much better than wearing a tool belt for woodworking which I can't stand. I would classify it more for woodworking than carpentry though I could see a finish carpenter using an apron such as this.

Wild as it may sound, it works beautifully. It makes for an original, non-traditional approach to celtic strains that serves only to delight the listener. The contributions of Galician piper Carlos Nunez, as well as that of Linda Ronstadt and Los Lobos, further enriches this innovative CD. The liner gives a full explanation as to how this project evolved, as well as the origins of its music, and grounds it in a historical perspective. It is a CD well worth having in one's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointed","review":"First, the biggest downside with the product is that you MUST use the language disk whenever you want to use the program. There is no way to copy lessons to the hard disk, and a copy protection scheme very effectively prevents you from creating a disk image for use with CD-ROM emulation software. So if you want to use it on an ultralight with no built-in optical drive, you have to connect an external drive.Beyond that, the system, even with the entry level course, provides no explanation or instruction. You start by matching pictures to phrases. I already know a bit of the language, so I could get through the first lesson by guessing the words I don't already know. For a total beginner, however, this program would be completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"no to price and to northern vietnamese","review":"i give this software one star because who in the world speaks northen vietnamese in the United States that are predominantly Southern Vietnamese immigrants. sounds fatuous and who in their right mind will pay $171.60 for something that not useful for someone looking to speak southern vietnamese. seems like the prices has risen sharply since speak now! has dissappeared. i can't believe with so much knowledge out there, there's no software or book where i can learn the language i want to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great compact resource","review":"Although it's stated that the book is not for beginners, I needed to get a grasp on C# and quickly. My exposure to OOP made the reading less daunting.

The authors use EBNF to show syntax when two or three examples would have sufficed.

There also seems to be two continental maps, a 0.9gb less detailed US and Canada map, and more detailed 1.3gb North America map with more POIs and richer map features. I think the US & Canada map was stripped down so it would fit on the pre-installed SD cards they are selling. It didn't seem to me that TomTom support had a clue as to what was supposed to be on the DVD.Maybe TomTom will straighten this out but I would sure avoid Navigator 6 for now.

This musical will encourage you, inspire you, and let you know that no matter what tomorrow holds we must continue fight and search for our \\"world\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"I'll start by saying that I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE Mr. Brown's \\"Parade.\\" But there's only about 6 songs that are listenable on this CD, and I wouldn't really recommend it. A lot of the songs have the same feel to them, and the stories a lot of them tell seem misdirected and unclear. I do think that Brown is bursting with talent and I can't wait for his next show, but this CD just isn't that great. The performers voices didn't move me, and I prefer a bigger orchestra and not a small band. Perhaps the strongest part of this recording is the piano orchestrations, which are very good. Most of the songs rely on the piano, and if you like the piano (which I do) that is a plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"This recording is amazing","review":"I love it! I absolutely love it! Flawless music, lyrics, cast...everything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brown composer for a New Broadway","review":"In a time where Sondheim is reaching the end of his career, all eyes are looking for the composer to take his place. All hipe aside, Jason Robert Brown is it. His score for 'Parade' proves he has a vast music vocabulary and has the talent to write clever, intelligent, powerful lyrics while staying true to character. With his debut album 'Songs..' he proves he has a gift for melody unlike any other composer out there now. His use of mixed meter, mixed styles and simple but very accurate orchestrations(which he did himself for many of the songs!) give the impression that he's only going to get better. For those of you who scoff, listen to Saturday Night and Sondheim's genius in it's fledgling stage. BUY THIS NOW! You will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Theatre should all sound this way","review":"Although I am not a big fan of \\"PARADE\\", I think \\"SONGS...\\" is some of the most brilliant music ever written.

Jason Robert Brown IS the new king of broadway, no matter what any of those overly critical know-it-alls think."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Hope for Musicals","review":"Songs for a New World is a totally worthwhile recording.

As soon as I first heard it I had to run out and get it. Jason Robert Brown, in my opinion, is the sucessor to the throne that will soon be vacated by Sondheim, Webber, Schwartz, etc. I Love the songs: I'd give it all for You, King of the World, Star's and Moon (but I do think that Audra McDonald sings it better), She Cries, I'm not Afraid, and the title song. This music is written in brilliance and dirctly from the heart. I like Parade very much but this CD is #1 on my list now and probably will be for years to come! I would pay twice as much for it! The best unknown B-Way CD of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Precursor to Parade","review":"I hesitate to only give four stars to my favortie new composer for his shimmering debut album...however I feel a distinction must be made from this first work and his positively transcendent Parade score. This is an enjoyable, inspirational & intelligently written group of songs masterfully performed by four soaring vocalists. There are one or two tracks that tend to be long-winded and a little weak...but this is most definitley the exception on this largely delightful disc. But for those of you who didn't get to experience Brown's Parade during it's sadly short Broadway run...you simply must acqurire a copy of the stunningly produced cast album...nothing can match the thrill of seeing it live...but this album comes as close as heaven will allow."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to like it...","review":"I wanted to like Jason Robert Brown's music, but I really find it uninspiring and bland.

BUT what does the author do? Attack the Christian faith with a conspiracy theory not even worth considering. NO factual basis what so ever. The vehement atheist was spousing his hate and religion to the point of ad nauseum. If the author had an axe to grind about GOD well then write a book about that and title it so. Dont decieve with one title a preach something else.I did not read the book because if his factual gathering was indicated by his Christian/Roman creation conspiracy well then i have better things to do than to read someones malevolent fantasy.Sorry, but that is my review the first chapter and its erroneous theories were all i needed to shelve this one for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakthrough book on the Tesla-UFO connection","review":"Lyne's book is THE most important book published to date on the origin of \\"saucers\\" as man-made craft using stolen Tesla technology. Although Pentagon Aliens and its author are seldom mentioned by others, they have had a major impact on the UFO field. In fact, I believe all other UFO books need to be compared to Lyne's Pentagon Aliens to see whether they can hold up to Lyne's information on Tesla, ether propulsion and military disinformation.Previous reviewers mention 2 weak points of the book, namely a strong pro-atheist position and a circuitous writing style. In fact that is why I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5. But come on, no book is perfect. Think of Pentagon Aliens as a gold mine and you'll have to do some digging to find the many great nuggets of information throughout its pages. For example, his expose on the military's ad hoc Roswell hoax alone is worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pentagon Aliens","review":"William Lyne seems extremely knowledgeable about the Government's use of energy extracted from space and anti-gravity technology discovered by Nicola Tesla, working on the shoulders of Michael Faraday's and other's discoveries. His photos of an actual polar slave compass apparently used by a German Flying saucer is amazing. His book is also very extensive on apparent Government attempts to keep the technology hidden from the public, but his accounts are excessive and detailed and it would be nice if these can be summarized and shortened somewhat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much ranting","review":"This could have been a thought provoking book but the author's rantish writing style gets in the way. He mentions some interesting things and makes claims about German saucers. The idea that the government has and is using some advanced propulsion technology, taken from the work of Tesla or the Germans, is not new. Yet his comments about IllumiNazis and InterNaziism, along with a New World Order, puts him into a category that is too extremist. You will not find a calm, reasoned argument here. Is it possible that the US government has such technology and is using it in total secrecy, as oppposed to blaming its existence on aliens? It is possible. I recommend Flying Saucer Aircraft by Bill Rose for those looking for a few more details and a more reasonable tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and poignant...a great read","review":"As I read the series of stories about Fay, Bonnie, the dogs, 'their son the actor', and the various cohorts that they run with in Rehobeth Beach and beyond, I can't help but be drawn in by Fay Jacob's commentary not only on her life, but our lives as Americans, and the struggles and wonders that we experience on grand and small scales.Each story, whether it means to or not, forces me to look at part of my life in a different way, whether its my fascination with garden machinery (go Bonnie!), or how we, as a group, reacted to the tragedy of 9/11/01. And the whole time, I find something to laugh about.Who knew that I, a white guy in a big city, had so much in couple with a lesbian couple in Delaware. I hope Fay keeps writing.

Of course, it being a Mosley book I got hooked immediately and ended up buying it despite the bad press. I'm glad I did because it's actually one of his better efforts. Also, it delivers exactly what it promises: Lots of sex and plenty of emotional introspection. Some of the situations are certainly over-the-top but so what, it's fiction.

I loved this book because, Mr. Mosley wrote a story that captures the \\"inside head fantasies\\" ( Murder, Revenge,quitting your job, multiple lovers,being \\"FREE\\").

And it starts off well enough---Cordell Carmel walks in on his long time girlfriend coupling with a man, one he knows, and later he learns had sex with her the first day they met. He snaps. He is both revolted and intrigued. He goes on a one man sex binge. And the book then spirals out of control with a hodegpode plot involving the sex industry; a prono movie; silly musings on desire; and repetitive and boring sex passages which, like the book, start out well written and compelling but morph into eye glazing and poinless . The last sentance:\\"I try to tell myself there's always time for redemption and that sometimes even the worst decisions turn out to be just fine.\\" For all the world you'd think he is talikng more about writing this ill advised book than the silly adventures of Cordell Carmell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Know devo, they are not men!","review":"Good stuff, if you are looking for some good tunes with a comment on the world around you.

I was 14 when this came out, and it really got to me: I remember staying up all hours to get a chance to film (not record, film) DEVO's early films and videos on Don Kirshner's. Just the perfect antidote to Foreigner.Yes, it is a real grounbreaker of an album and, strangely, has an original flavor that DEVO shed as quickly as they recorded their second album. The Akron anarchy still shines through on this one, though: the sense that these guys were having such a great time playing their joke on the spudboys at Warner Bros, and disbelieving they were getting the chance. 'Course, having Eno -- while he could still take a joke -- and Connie Planck involved in the production was a big help, too. For this album, it all REALLY worked. And the album got (for 1978, when, remember, Foreigner still reigned) kind of big, at least among the colllege and art school kids. Too bad that after this, the Smart Patrol really did have nowhere to go except into Noo Wave parody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album, Great Vinyl","review":"Fantastic Album, definitely Devo's Punkiest release. The album is great, no question. I specifically want to review the Vinyl LP. It feels great! This re release is on a thick 140gram clear/yellow vinyl. The sound quality is incredible and the record feels very sturdy. The packaging is the same as it was when the album was released and looks as good as it did 25 years ago. The insert is pretty standard, covered with interesting pictures and lyrics.Excellent release!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it the same?

If you have the original disc and you're not a hard core fan, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"No comparison!","review":"O.K. I'd like to start off by pointing out that this record was the end result of DEVO's long and complicated de-evolution from multi-media project to major label \\"pop\\" band. The reviewer that wrote something about DEVO ripping off some idiotic Euro-dweebs has no idea that almost all of the songs on this perfect album were being developed since 1974-75. Lookie here spud, DEVO were WAY head of \\"new wave\\", \\"electro\\" or whatever pretentious label you wanna give it. Yeah, Kraftwerk were around before DEVO but man, those guys took themselves SO seriously! DEVO created a kind of glorious primitive futurism that is complex while being darkly funny. DEVO are part freak show, part futurist, part goon and 100% pure godhead. That said, \\"Are We Not Men\\" is a blistering manifesto and a great record."},{"rating":"1","title":"devo ...","review":"I enjoy both the Romones and the Talking Heads.

As a lover of travel fiction and as someone with an abiding interest in Japan (and a frequent traveller there), I must say that this is among the very worst books I have ever read. As travel literature, it strikes me as the product of someone who's never actually been to the place he's writing about. As erotica or as humour, it falls completely flat. The overriding tone it left me with was that of an author who wrote a novel in a weekend on a dare. Zero attempt at involving the reader. Zero attempt at character or plot development. The characters are just put through their paces and then abandoned. Even had I paid 78 cents for the book I would have felt cheated at the time I wasted on it (and I spend a lot of time reading). Do yourself a favour and stay away, or at the very least, don't let this book help you form any opinions whatsoever on the country of Japan."},{"rating":"2","title":"use the clip!","review":"I wasnt using the clip as someone suggested, use it press the film with the nail using the tape at the end of the film inside the clip of the reel all the way and it should roll pretty nicely"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big","review":"Way too big for common sized developing tank.

As we took them out of the box and began assembling them(which was very simple), he started building and three of us could hardly work fast enough for him. The blocks have been cut in a way that they have interior support when put together so they are sturdy enough to withstand the testing of a 3-year-old and his 2-year-old brother. Not a lot of the largest size, but enough for a toddler to handle. I bought them on sale through Amazon, so I couldn't even have gotten a different brand(which we had checked out and weren't satisfied with) for the price. Tremendous creativity value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"I purchased these blocks for my 3 year old nephew. When he first opened the box, he wasn't sure what they were as they come unassembled. But, as we starting creating them, he became more and more excited to build with them. He did not ask to open other Christmas presents after he began playing with these blocks. Based on other reviews, I considered buying extra red blocks. I am glad I did not as my nephew preferred the blue.Assembly: With a team of four, it took 15 minutes to assemble all the blocks. Blocks are sturdy if assembled correctly. Note, fold all creases before trying to put together. That made the task easier and the finished product more sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"Ok we looked At Toys-R-US and they had one kinda like this but not the big box blocks.

Lying there unassembled, they did not look at all sturdy. But when we had them all put together, the fun began. My granddaughter is very active 3 year old with an active imagination. We have built roads, walls, beds, tables, chairs, and some things that only she knows what they are. They are very sturdy and I believe they are helpful in developing fine motor skills. She is getting very good at stacking them \\"to the sky\\". We made a very good choice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic Toy","review":"Great product! I bought for my nephews, ages 2 & 5.

Well worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slippery to stack properly","review":"I really like the idea of the big cardboard blocks.

This state lasts between one and five hours, depending on a father's digital dexterity and ability to follow instructions (and previous experience with Ikea furniture and/or Cuban sweatshops). Still, when the last red block was finished (a little large for my hand----really, I preferred the yellows), I found myself missing the assembly line...just another couple packs and I think I really would've had an efficient system. Next, I'm hoping for a home cigar rolling kit, maybe with moving conveyor belt. It'd be just like Laverne and Shirley.Oh, and I my two-and-a-half year old seems to like them.

A+ for the seller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Hit","review":"These blocks were bought for my 2 1/2 year old grandson. He loves them!

This Gran highly recommends them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boxes, a kid's best friend","review":"My daughter fell in love with these boxes as she played with them at a children's play place. I knew I had to get her a set of her own and I was glad to easily find them online. The price is kind of high but the boxes are of good sturdy material. As for the complains others have on the amount of bigger boxes vs. small ones, it's true. In my case though it doesn't affect me because my kids are so young right now. Maybe later on I will also complain about the lack of big boxes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good purchase!","review":"My grandkids, just 3 and under 2, love these big blocks. They're a nice change from wood blocks. They're easy and fun to stack, and this set has enough to keep them busy. For serious building I'd buy another set.

After all, 40 blocks sounds like a lot. But 24 of those blocks are small yellow ones that aren't very useful. So far, my kids (ages 5-1/2 and almost 3) have only built tall towers with the blocks and don't seem very interested after some initial playing.

When Phil Elvrum decides to put songs together, they're good -- the opening few tracks, especially \\"The Moon,\\" are fantastic, expansive little slices of lo-fi psychedelia, the universe crammed into a 4-minute pop song. But once those songs end, I'm left with 45 minutes of unfocused recording, almost ambient sounds. When songs fragments do coalesce into something, it reminds me of a Neutral Milk Hotel recording, without the melody. I think Phil's reaching for something unifying, trying to make this a monumental experience, not just another lo-fi pop record; but I can't see what it is he's after"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Right","review":"This CD was a gift to my brother for Christmas.

What I have found is that more often than not the products for these pets are over priced and of poor quality . Since boiling water is the preferred method of cleaning crabitat accessories I have often worried about the safety of reusing plastics. In response to this concern I started using small porcelain bowls .

I was a little disapointed because they didn't go into more deatail about what happened to Stivie and Alex after the party. There was nothing written about what their mom's had done to them. Also, I didn't think that Alex and Lisa would make up in the same night that they broke up when the trust they had had between them was broken so hard. It just didn't seem realistic.The book just seemed to end as a cliffhanger as is the characteristic of all of these Pine Hollow books, and I am not sure I like that.

The whole thing was based around one stupid party that in real life, probably lasted for all of two hours. I was disgusted with all the crazy stuff going on in everyone's lives. Lisa's 40 year old mother needs to get rid of her 24 year old boyfriend, and Lisa wouldn't be too bad off without her overprotective, posessive boyfriend, Alex. I mean, if Lisa even makes eye contact with some one who's cuter (and older) than Alex, he throws a fit and acts like a baby. I was also really mad at how everyone got so drunk. Most teenagers know when to say no, and I think that Bonnie Bryant was trying to use the fact that because two or three people were depressed, everyone got drunk. I really don't like how she writes teenagers off in this book as being depressed, terrible people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"Just got this disc after getting just about all the EMI remasters. Those remasters are some of the best, and this remaster is probably the absolute worst I've ever heard.

It has that epic plot, where families move in, their children go off to War, lots of mention of current events and fads.

I considered returning, but for a book that was only $10, the shipping costs didn't really make it worth it. The seller did say they were willing to take the product back but they offered no other apology in regards to the misrepresented condition of the book. In fact, I think it was a standard auto-reply and not even written personally to me.I would not buy from this dealer again strictly because online vendors need to be really honest in representing their products.

Two of the songs, \\"Puppets & Dolls\\" and \\"Knowledge is a Knife,\\" were edited down to radio-friendly lengths for this disc, as the full-length versions which appear on \\"Yibe!\\" were a little on the long side.A fun trio of songs that show off the versatility of a band whose chief criticism was that they couldn't be categorized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor recorded sound and lack of idiomatic feel!","review":"Very four square Mozart out here...rather bland and lacking vitality.

That's what sold me. The main problem I found was this: You need to squeeze the grip perpendicular to the way you exert pressure on the lid. This results in having to put pressure on your wrist sideways and squeezing at the same time. Anyone that has used a pair of pliers knows that it's easier to squeeze in the direction you have to turn the pliers. So, for me at least, it's back to the drawingboard.

When I was growing up we had one something like this one, and I have never seen one since. As soon as I saw it, I wanted it. The benefits: works for any size jar and gets a good grip on the lid. Yes you still need some force but not as much as you would need without it, and it doesn't slip.

And, it is awkward to use because when the end is placed at the lip of the lid the handle does not slide back easy since a notch on the handle is automatically struck in one of the many slots above it. When you raise the handle to get the notch out of the slot, the end you put on the edge of lip comes off.I tried it on a lid I had already opened and put back on tightly and it worked fine once I finagled the handle back.

The Amco Swing-A-Way Comfort Grip Jar Opener works well as it provides a good grasp on the lid and with little effort twists it off in one try. This handy device fits small screw tops to large pickle or applesauce jars. I am disappointed, though, that Swing-A-Way products are no longer made in the USA.

And the picture/sound quality isn't as bad as some reviewers indicate; this is like watching TV back in the 1960s, no better, no worse. The Doors play well, the newsreel stuff provides a context for this political band, and I don't regret buying this at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"This video shows the Doors at their peak","review":"The Doors are Open is a documentary of the Doors performance at the Roundhouse Theatre in September '68. Filmed in black and white, this video has the Doors performing their best songs at the top of their game. Morrison's grunts and spews his poetry throughout. Originally this documentary was filmed for English television, interspersed with the music are scenes from Vietnam and riots back in the states. Although the Doors were not a politically motivated band, this video really puts into context the tumultuous times they were living in. Anyone interested in Morrison or the Doors would serve themselves well to own this video. There are only a few filmed Doors concerts out there, and this is about as good as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely a must purchase for any Doors fan","review":"Yeah, I know, the sound quality is muddled, and the interspliced documentary footage can get in the way, but to me, these flaws pale in comparison to the incredible performance. For live concert footage, I haven't seen anything else that captures the intensity of The Doors when they were ON like this documentary does!! The band is just great in this concert...Morrison is mesmerizing, Manzarek's organ is haunting, Densmore's chops are blistering, and the true unsung hero of the day just might be Robbie Krieger on guitar.(the flamenco intro to Spanish Caravan is stunning)!!If you are a fan of The Doors, this has to be in your collection. I've never seen anything that captures the true spirit of the group like this show.

It's not so much about the mental side of tennis as a collection of tennis television commercials that every now and then touch upon the mental side of the game. So it goes alongside my people magazine (Vic is a marvelous rambler!) into the bathroom. And even when it covers the mental side, it is not very practical.

Sort of best practice, using which, you will get much better results.Example. If you are about to buy, say, 8 of these reels, $7.99 each plus quite not cheap shipping, than take four or five (depending on how far you are) 20-bucks billets and 8 undeveloped films with your best shots. Put this all in a plastic bag, take it with your right hand if you are right-handed or with your left hand if you are left-handed, come to a window, open it, and chuck the bag out to the window. This is much more effective way of using these reels, believe me. It will save a lot of time and nerves for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It will probably work","review":"This type of reel will do the job, and it will work the same way every time and stand up to a lifetime of use. The only problem is that stainless reels are not made to the most exacting mechanical standards, and you will rarely find one that works well out of the box. If the reel is deformed by a few hundredths of an inch, it can be maddeningly difficult to wind film on it in the dark without the film jumping tracks and doubling over.The reel I purchased works fine for twelve-exposure reels, but not for anything larger.If you get one that's not bent, or if you take the time to straighten a bent one, it will work every time.

The recipes are all structured for a 9 inch pie, which is really a blessing in disguise, since that lets you plan on cooking two or three different pizzas for your friends in the course of one magnificent evening of Italian pastry.Note, however, two shortcomings--first, the book only considers 9\\" pies with the thin, crisp crust characteristic of Naples, and it really doesn't want to talk to you if you don't have a pizza stone to bake them on. So, you won't find guidelines for making thicker, softer crusts, nor will you find advice for making a good pizza on those ancient metal sheets you use for the frozen pizzas from the supermarket.

I was never able to start a drill lesson in the middle by skipping pages. If I returned to a prior lesson, I had to click on answers in order to advance, instead of being able to move forward as the interface supposedly should work.2) Much more importantly, there were grammar mistakes in the product. My wife is native Korean. During the first lesson, the product tries to teach you the words/concept of \\"above\\" and \\"underneath\\". My wife and 4 of her friends who are also native Koreans all listened to the drill and they all said that the phraseology would never ever be spoken by a Korean. They said that the phrasehology was actually incorrect.Other than that, while I echo the other comments about the navigation being unclear, I did think that the drills would help one learn vocabulary words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal Interface and Hard copy Materials","review":"This program completely lacks a structured approach to learning the Hangul alphabet and completely lacks the ability to teach ANY Hangul using the keyboard.

Now I can access it at home online and use any set of lessons I want, for the cost of a library card, which I had anyway.

Glenn Gould gives me a headache. I enjoy both Schiff's recording and Serkin's and I think Serkin captures the beauty of these rather spare and if you will spacey works. This is a different Bach from the Goldberg Variations and the Partitas etc. I've listened to several recordings of the Goldberg Variations and I am investing a lot of time and money exploring various artists interpretations. Just had a unfortunate encounter with Jao Carlos Martin's Goldberg. Hopefully, Murray Perahia will record the Inventions soon but at this time I think it's a toss up between Serkin and Schiff reviled by others though they may be. I find it ironic that one could be outstanding enough to play Bach and yet still impress people as lackluster. Apparently it takes a lot of talent to be disappointing too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serkin - why would anyone buy this one?","review":"Serkin falls short of both vigor and elegance and presents a bland and bloodless Bach.

The arrangements are terrific, Sally is in excellent voice, and her trademark humor and warmth are evident throughout.

This is a real shame and doesn't make sense why they would leave this last episode out?? It's basically the ONLY Walker episode that is NOT included in this box set. I LOVE the Walker series, but I can only rate this box set 2 stars, because it simply isn't the COMPLETE collection as others on here have falsely stated. The ONLY official release of the last episode, Trial By Fire was place separately on an import DVD only in Europe, not in the US, and isn't compatible with US DVD players. Maybe one day, they will release it as a separate DVD in the US. The box set didn't come out til 2010, so I guess there's still hope.

He believes in the law and justice. He does whatever it takes to bring in the bad guys. He also is very well known and feared by villians and run when he comes their way. Walker is very active in the community helping children stay away from drugs through a program he helped to create for the kids. He also helps anyone who wants to change from being a bad guy to a good guy. Walker even learns that love is the most important thing and living without it makes life less interesting. He gets married and learns the challenges of marriage. He also loses a very close friend but he uses it to reach out to people.

Nothing which was recorded before or after can hold a candle to it. This was the pinnacle of their musical prowess and creativity. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love all the Ozzy stuff, and I even love all the later Sabbath stuff, namely the albums recorded in the late 80's and early 90's with Tony Martin on vocals. But there is something about this album that is different. Perhaps it just found me at the right moment of my jaded youth when it could speak to me with a voice that I was perfectly in tune with, and which I perfectly understood. Either way, Dio was not simply a replacement for Ozzy. He took the band to a level of genius that was impossible in the earlier days. If you haven't heard this one yet, do so. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Match made in Heaven...","review":"There is no denying all the Sabbath albums with Ozzy on are great, But so is this album with Ronnie James Dio. We all hated to see Ozzy go at the time, but now I am glad he did. We fans got a bunch of super good albums out of Sabbath and Ozzy's divorce. \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\", Diary of a Madman\\", \\"Heaven and Hell\\", and Mob Rules, are all some of the best albums ever written. The songs are all upbeat and rockin. I love the bass on this album. Geezer is in top form. My favorite songs are \\"Neon Nights\\", \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Lady Evil\\", and \\"Children of the Sea.\\" Dio and Sabbath a match made in \\"Heaven and Hell\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best record of the Dio years","review":"When this record was released in 1980, a new life was begin with a new singer: Ronnie James Dio.Some people says: Sabbath is dead since that album,but some other people says: That album was giving a new life for Black Sabbath. For me, Black sabbath still rock forever, with or whitout Ozzy, Sabbath rules. I have listen this record some times to give him 5 stars. Dio give a more heavy sound than Ozzy (just listen Dehumanizer also and you will think that!). My favorites tracks on this album is: Neon Knights (very heavy), Children Of The Sea (very good,but not better than Children of The Grave),Lady Evil,Heaven And Hell (the best track of this album) and Die Young (a very good Iommi solo on this song). I suggest to the Sabbath fans who like only the old sound of Black Sabbath: go to buy it, this album is more hard rock than the modern music, you won't regret it, it's a big classic masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive Metal album","review":"There will come a time when all metal albums are lined up, and one will stand out, as it does today. No one will care who sung for Sabbath first or last, because time erodes the relevance of such issues. The music will be rated for what it is, not what it was, and the dissaffected post-hippy, pro-Ozzy dinosaurs will have been been absorbed into either society or back into the earth itself. For those with an unclouded judgement and open mind, listen to this CD not as an arbitrator of the machinations of a 35 year old metal vehicle, but a lover of the music that it created. You will be rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"an album for a pleasant sleep","review":"It's Dio's voice, man. And it' s Geezer's bass. And it's Iommi's guitar. And it's Ward's thundering drums. I just love this album, what else do i have to say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Sabbath rocks !","review":"The band enters the 80's with their new signer, Ronnie James Dio and achieved a really great rock album.Great guitars, a loud rythm section and one of the best rock'n'roll vocalist is all you need to producea fisrt class rock album. That's what they did with this one. Favorites tracks are Neon Knights, Children of the sea, Lady Evil, Heaven and Hell and Lonely is the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Strongest DIO Era Sabbath","review":"This one rocks. Period.Children of the Sea is as good as anything the original line-up ever did, but it stands on its own.Heaven and Hell, Neon Knights and Die Young are also classic.The second side sags a little at the end, but this is definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest albums ever","review":"I've bought this album 3 times, it is that good.Once on vinyl back in the day. Later I bought it on CD, somehow it got lost in a move, and finally bought the MP3.I was never a Black Sabbath fan, but Sabbath and Ronnie James Dio were a perfect match. I think it is safe to say that this album is legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Sabbath But.......","review":"Face it,Ozzy is really not a great singer,he just has a sound,and that sound is as much Black Sabbath as Iommi's classic riffs,Butler's mighty bass fills , and Ward's thundering drums. While musically there are a lot of good things on this album. It's too much the Ronnie James Dio and his back-up band album.Another big part of Sabbath is that Terry \\"Geezer\\" Butler was always the band's lyricist until this album.This is really only about half a decent album,the second side seemed like a lot of filler and outtakes.Dehumanizer was their best with Dio because it wasn't so typical of the silly garbage that he has masqueraded as music for his whole career,and Butler sounds more interested on that album too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black sabbath?","review":"What happened to black sabbath here? Without ozzy, sabbath is not rhe same. Black sabbath was about the apocalypse, revenge, drugs, and war. This new black sabbath is about dragons and nights. What is up with that? Dio is an okay singer, but he lacks that feel that ozzy had. If you want the real sabbath, get the early to mid 70's stuff. At least this is not as embarrasing as never say die or rtechnical extasy! Sabbath was a good stoner rock band, not this almost glam rock band. this gets 2 stars cause the only good song in neon nights (preatty gay name but good track, the rest sucks!) Ozzy rules. Black sabbath died in 1978."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes me back to the eightees!!!","review":"Love the eightees!!! Yes, Yes, Yes!!! Bananarama is the best, best, best!!! Go back to the eightees!!!

Black Sabbath really broke up when they kicked out Ozzie. They just dno't sound like they uses to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pale shadow.","review":"Black Sabbath were groundbreaking. They didn't invent metal, but helped define the genre - a very important band that spawned thousands of imitators. This album sounds like it's the work of one of those imitators. The songs are very light - generic metal pop. The power has been taken out of Iommi's guitar - there isn't a single good riff on the entire record. And the lyrics are, well, just plain stupid. Black Sabbath never really recovered from this. How the mighty have fallen. Children of the Sea versus Children of the Grave? No contest."},{"rating":"1","title":"She' s a magical, mystical woman. Indeed.","review":"This is truly Black Sabbath at their worst. Ronnie James is a horrible singer. He also has an ego that really got in the way during his years with Sabbath, ultimately leading to his being dismissed. \\"Look at me, I'm the new Ozzy!\\" \\"I'm the god of heavy metal, worship me!\\" Gimme a break, Ronnie. The lyrics to some of these songs here(written by RJD)are so juvinile, so pathetic, you would think a fourteen year old child on his first acid trip wrote them. Sure, Tony's guitar playing shines as usual, but it doesn't rescue this awful album from the infestation of that rat Dio. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life After Ozzy","review":"Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne are often synonomous. Yet, with this album the remaining members attempted to show that life can go on even after Ozzy left. HEaven and Hell is an awesome record, displaying that the Sabbath can still rock. It Opens up furiously and never really lets you go - until the end. Hence, four stars. Still, there is no denying the power from the title track and Neon Knights. Dio proves to be a worthy successor to Ozzy, even though he is not as popular. Many fans like to think Sabbath was nothing after 1978. That's not true! A lot of great music came afterwards. Personally, i feel Sabbath's last real album was Born Again, since all of them afterward are basically Iommi Solo Projects (Though good ones at that). It's time to get acquainted with Heaven and Hell. Give it a try! You may be pleasantly surprised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bass players, on your knees: Here comes the bass god Geezer","review":"If all songs here were not great, If Dio wasn't easily the best rock singer of all-times, If the production wasn't perfect, Still you should buy this one to hear Geezer Butler fly all over his bass neck."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Dio effort in Black Sabbath","review":"Heaven and Hell is really the only worthwhile record of Sabbath's Dio phase. It's much better than \\" Mob Rules\\" and \\"Live Evil\\" and its eight tracks are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you own only one SABBATH album, it should be this one!!!","review":"From the in-your-face Neon Knights, to the melodic then Hell-Raising beauty of Children Of The Sea, and the hauntingly wonderful Heaven And Hell, this is Rock at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sabbath returns!!!","review":"This was the best Sabbath album since \\"Sabotage\\". Ozzy was so wrapped up in his substance abuse, he couldn't even sing worth a damn. Enter Ronnie James Dio. The legend behind Elf, Rainbow, and his own classic band. This was the tightest Sabbath slab in ages. Dio used his song writing to bring this band back from the grave. His lyrics were way better then Geezer Butler's ever were.Dio sings circles around Ozzy. Classic songs. This was the album that restored Sabbath. Sadly, the band would slump lower then ever after RJD left in '82."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the rest....4.5 stars","review":"I usually don't bother with post-Ozzy Sabbath, but when the fans stopped giving Dio the finger long enough to listen to this in 1980, they realized they had a masterpeice on their hands. Unlike it's successor, the overblown \\"Mob Rules\\", Heaven and Hell still had a good amount of '70's hard rock style to keep it out of the '80's excess department. That's not to say the songs are just average. Indeed, these are classics in their own right and go down with the best Ozzy and company had to offer in the '70's. Dio is in top form, and provided a fresh new sound for the rest of the band to use as a springboard to launch these new songs. Later releases would build on and recycle \\"Heaven and Hell\\", but ultimately Sabbath would never be this good again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dio + Sabbath = KILLER!","review":"While this comeback album doesn't hold a candle to the best of the original line-up, 1980's Heaven And Hell features a (surprisingly?) revitalized Black Sabbath taking new singer Ronnie James Dio (fresh from Rainbow) through his paces. Amazingly, Dio & Sabbath fit well, joining the tried-and-true doom with the diminuitive frontman's Dungeons & Dragons writing-style in a way that felt refreshing. Little surprise that this album went Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic. Unfortunately, this perfect combo would last only one more studio album and a live disc before parting ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tunes, riffs and vocals","review":"After I bought my ticket to go see the 2007 Heaven and Hell tour, I ordered the cd of the same name. I am a big hard rock / metal fan, but I never actualy bought a Black Sabbath cd. I heard some of their stuff and Dio too. In short, this cd rocks. Great guitar riffs, catchy tunes and great vocals. Heaven and Hell is my favorite tune on it. I highly recommend this classic. I should kick myself for not knowing about this cd sooner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Up There with Stormcock","review":"Stormcock is Roy's masterpiece but \\"Valentine\\" is almost as good - and quite a bit more accessible. A collection of love songs, yes, but there is nothing predictable or sloppy here: these songs have truth, tenderness, anger, frustration, humour - and loads of bittersweet twists and turns to keep you interested. Some of the tracks rock out very nicely with assistance from Roy's \\"heavy\\" friends, but mostly the feel of this album is gentle, acoustic (very fine guitar as always from Roy)...quite seductive in its way. A favourite of mine for unwinding. The reviewer who suggested playing this and \\"Stormcock\\" one after the other has definitely got it right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with items","review":"I live in europe and my items came in with in 1 week...

Thank You"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent when recording facts, but otherwise very biased.","review":"Christine Brennan does a good job of relating historical events and telling a skaters story. However, it is obvious to readers that she is biased. Her descriptions and stories vary greatly from positive to negative depending on the skater. Her obvious bias and prejudice shows clearly. She does not appear objective at all. It is fascinating to read about the lives and events in the world of figure skating. But the critisms and the sutle slams are obnoxious. She makes inferences and judgements about skaters that she obviously does not like. It is difficult to enjoy this book. It has the potential to be wonderful, however, Ms. Brennan's lack of objectivity ruins the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very biased; Not Objective; Irresponsible Journalism","review":"Ms Brennan is obviously biased towards Michelle Kwan and should not have access to major newspapers like USA Today.

Her work epitomizes irresponsible journalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"The National Enquirer of Sports Journalists","review":"Ms. Brennan is nothing but a gossip mongerer who delights in hearsay and inuendo. She also likes to set herself up as judge and jury of these skaters, and her trite assumptions and declarations about them are incorrect about 90% of the time. She has proven time and again to these skaters that she is not worthy of their trust. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vindictive, ill-informed, one-sided","review":"This book is even more biased and tabloid-esque than her last! Don't waste your money or your time, reading this blatant promotion of Ms. Brennan's personal favorites at the expense of everyone else. Believe me, I'm not a Lipinski fan, but Ms. Brennan has gone beyond the bounds of good taste and sensitivity with many of her remarks about the Lipinski entourage. A little vindication for their refusal to grant her an interview?? Just remember, Christine, it isn't necessary to blow out one person's flame just so another's will APPEAR brighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brennan is excellent and well-informed","review":"Brennan is well-known for her wonderful writing on figure-skating. I for one like Brennan because she always has great things to say about Michelle Kwan and this book is no exception. I learned so much about some figure skaters from this book, especially on the men's side. It's truthful and very informative and written superbly. It is obviously non-fiction, yet at times it tells like a story, including dialogue between characters. I like that because it was entertaining to read it as if it were a story, but you know that all of it is true. I also enjoyed how Brennan didn't write about one skater, then move onto the next, then next, etc, like a chapter per skater. All the skaters' stories were intertwined so the book wasn't predictable at all. Instead, the chapters were divided by time periods-- before 1998, on the road to 1998, etc... Every die-hard figure skating fan should get their hands on this, esp die-hard Michelle Kwan fans like myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! I do wish she had waited til Worlds were over, tho.","review":"I loved the inside track on one of the greatest sports in the world. Brennan is clear and concise. She has a genuine love for this sport and is genuinely concerned about the direction it is going in and all of that is clear in her writing. She also manages to bring the thrill of the competition to the printed page. I just wish she had waited until the Worlds were over with to write it, that's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"HASTILY WRITTEN BUT WORTHWHILE","review":"I have to agree that this book is not as smoothly constructed as INSIDE EDGE, but, as a figure skating fan, I found much of interest. I particularly liked the chapters on the less \\"visible\\" contenders like Scott Davis and Tonia Kwiatkowski (who did just great later at the 1998 Worlds). Although, the bias was there--I am also a little dismayed at the trend towards younger and younger figure skating champions. Even Michelle Kwan could profit from a few more unpressured years to develop artistically. I would like these athletes to be able to attend regular school as Brian Boitano did. I felt that this book did address these issues. I would love to see similar books on earlier figure skaters!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough, lively, very well written account!","review":"Ms. Brennan does a super job of gather a large number of very interesting facts about some of the world's most admired skaters. She then weaves those facts into a story that is very entertaining to read. The style is lively and flows easily, which is so characteristic of Ms. Brennan's writing. I especially enjoyed getting an inside peak at the preparations of the Russian skaters, and I enjoyed feeling like I was \\"backstage\\" at the Olympics.Although I'm not a HUGE figure skating fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

I think if it wasn't for my attraction to the two aunts and the cat, I may not have been a fan of the show. The 7th and last season is a real downer with the aunts only appearing once or twice in the whole season. Another drawback to Sabrina is the laugh track, laughing at stuff that just is not funny. But if families are looking for wholesome entertainment, this would be the show for them. I'm in it for the supporting cast rather than the star."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last good season","review":"This really is the last season I really enjoy.

Illustrated with period pictures and photographs of the young people wherever possible, it also provides eyewitness quotations.It appears aimed at older elementary students and middle school students, offering readers a wealth of inspiring stories of how children and teenagers have made a positive difference in U.S. history. A nice additional detail is that information is also provided on what happened to that young person after his or her pivotal role played out. Since each story is a complete narrative in itself, this book can be read chronologically from cover to cover or opened and enjoyed at random."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great comic and a wonderful ending","review":"This is the fourth book in the series of Pokemon Graphic Novels, based on the newer episodes of the TV cartoon. Ash is competing in the Orange League, and eventually challenges the Supreme Gym Leader! Can Ash defeat him?I\`m pleased to say this comic is just as good as the other three. The artwork is good, and the story and dialogue are amusing with some funny jokes. There are six chapters here instead of four.This is a good ending to the series (though its sad to see it go) and it could hold clues as to how the TV show might be wrapped up. If you believe in Jessie and James\` love, you will like one of the pictures near the end... There are also some cute scenes featuring Ash and Misty.At the front of the comic, there are pictures and a mini comic strip drawn by Toshihiro Ono, which are funny.I really enjoyed reading this comic. Its nice to see the story of Pokemon in a different way, and it will appeal to Pokemon and comic book fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great ending to a great series!","review":"This is the final installment of Toshihiro Ono's Pokemon manga series, and it's also my personal favorite! I'm a die-hard Rocketshipper, and the epilogue with the scene from Jessie and James's future is quite possibly the best picture in existence! I sincerely hope that the anime has a similar ending to the manga...not just with the Rocketshippy element, but the message of friendship and cooperation as well. Toshihiro Ono's artwork and storytelling are both brilliant and humorous, and this manga series is a class-act all the way! ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wide... can't use it with Nikon lens cases.","review":"I've bought it to use it with Nikon cases, as the CL-M2 for my 70-200 or the cases that comes with the 24-70, 14-24, and SB900.... but none of them can be attached on this belt.I love my Domke bags, great materials, but this belt it's not very intelligent built.

In response to the previous review complaining that the author doesn't teach the Holbein stitch (which looks the same on the front and back), yes, she does, but she doesn't tell you that it looks the same front and back (I happen to know from other materials I've read).The author also assumes that you have some blackwork/embroidery skills, so it isn't for rank beginners. I also wish that it had more on the history of blackwork, instead of just trotting out that Katherine of Aragon stuff (which no one seems to ever actually document). I really appreciated the info on how to frame my work.I appreciated the number of charts, from small and easy to large and complex, that are included. I have picked out several to attempt soon.

Unless I missed that even being mentioned, I'm still trying to figure out who actually did it. Who carried through with that??This had been my first Siegal novel and again, it was good but if the author wanted to leave the reader hanging so that we could come up with our own theories outside of the suicide note, he did a good job and perhaps....... that's precisely what he wanted to do.I'd STILL like to know who duck taped the victims nose. Maybe I'll never know after all. Good book nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know why I finished this book","review":"First of all, this book has an introduction to each chapter that doesn't have to do anything with the main story, those introductions together are at least 100 pages. Everything that happens at the investigation is written at least three times, (when Michael Daley discovers it, when he tell his ex wife and at the trial), this takes off about 40 pages, and at the end, when one of the suspects kill his/herself and wrote a letter and with that letter everybody knows who was the killer, and after that nobody could do nothing to catch him, is really pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of the same thing","review":"I agree with other reviewers who state this book is just too similar to the first one.

However, the maps apparently are not updated as frequently as Garmin would like you to believe. We were directed to driving directly into the wall of a store that was built a few years ago. Also, directions on freeway splits aren't obvious or accurate at all. Buyer beware, if you need to return to Amazon because of these reasons, they will charge you about $60 for doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"I bought my i3 in Europe and enjoyed it very much until time came to upgrade it. The upgrade that I bought and paid $75 for will not work with my unit, even though the people at Garmin say it will.

What more can I ask?","review":"Exactly what I needed!The Garmin i3 does pretty much what big expensive systems do: provides voice navigation, shows color maps, recalculates directions when you make a wrong turn or exit the highway due to traffic, and directs you to nearby places like supermarkets and gas stations. Except the i3 is dead simple and a tremendous value. Sure there is no touch screen and there don't seem to be any sophisticated features, but, based on my 2 weeks of use, I don't need that stuff in the first place. I do wish some of the selections were easier to configure (e.g., shortest distance vs. quickest route) but that issue does not diminish the brilliance of this product.I plan on buying two more as gifts in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good things come in small packages.","review":"I'm a Realtor in Los Angeles so needless to say this device changed my life (it's my 1st GPS).The good: The size is wonderful.

The display aslo changes colors at night so it easier on your eyes.The bad: A little slow to acquire satelites under cloudy weather. The inscructions say this problem can be aleviated by putting batteries inside instead of just using the car power outlet. A little slow to calculate complex or long itineraries. The unit occasionally freezes and the only way to unblock it is to unplug it. I order to accelerate the entering of addresses I wanted to limit the maps to just Southern California, but I was not able to do that.

The screen looks small but is fie in a driving situation. The voice prompts are clear and quite loud, if required. I've got mine mounted on the center of the dash. Be sure to wipe the surface clean with alcohol before applying the permanent dashboard mount disc. The transflash isn't a problem at all. I was able to load up several states. As an upgrade you could get a bigger card if you had to travel through a LOT of states. The POI information is pretty good, but it's funny how it misses some restaurants in my area. The map data is sometimes a bit off when it comes to addresses. It'll get you there fine but I noticed sometimes the target address could be either 200 feet further down the road or behind you.

There are times when the voice does not match the map or reality. Just keep an open mind and know if you made a wrong turn, it will re-calculate and get you there.

The fact that it has been discontinued speaks for itself. This [pricey] unit was marketed as state-of-the-art at its inception, but basically it is a glorified address book. And its exterior design has proved not to be so great - the flip cover is inconvienent, the hard case is not a protection, the springboard module adapter system simply does not work, and the battery has to be recharged every day.

This is no different in operation from any other Visor and PalmOS based handheld.My only complaint is the part that connects to the stylus fell off, although, the stylus still manages to stay on. It could probably use a better design.For more power, more storage, and a color screen, you might consider the Clie.

The last one lasted 2 1/2 years until I ended up breaking the face on it.This particular clip watched fits on my belt loops very well and there are no split rings to pull apart and lose the important part.The only thing I dont care for is the light. I prefer an light that lights up the face not a light to shine at someone or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems with watch's function...","review":"Bought the item a little late for Christmas, but it arrived on 23rd, as promised. I got it for a friend who's only real issue between the items pictured was the color. He wanted the light tan metallic color of the one marked 'brown' in the ad. He liked the green also but the tan metallic just looked nicer. Since it arrived a little early, I decided to take a look before wrapping, and guess what, it's BROWN. Not tan, or even metallic(as shown), but plain flat brown. I told my friend who asked if it could be exchanged after Christmas, neither of us are fans of plain brown so the green will work. I realize the ad states 'brown', but I've found that, usually, the picture/color shown tends to be more accurate. Will be returning for 'green' after Christmas. Please Amazon, show a more accurate picture, buyers if the description doesn't fit picture, even slightly, ask first. My mistake is causing a lot of unnecessary holiday chaos that could have been easily avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I am so satisfied with my purchase of the Dakota Mini Microlight Clip Watch!

It wasn't, and when I called Amazon for help, a man from India, basically laughed at me and told me that there was nothing that he was going to do, nor was there anything that I could do. In the middle of all of this, I had asked for a refund of the difference between overnight shipping and ground. I thought that it was a resonable request, since Amazon did not ship the day they were supposed to, making the shipment to me later than expected.

Though written in prose, there was so much written UNDERNEATH all of the words it was like reading poetry. It was beautifully elequent and the way she tied all three generations together was excellent. The women in this story were so intense and full of spirit, and selfish too. Both sexually liberated and aware, and intent on getting what they want out of life. These were not women to give in to anyone.

Rosario does not resort to caramelized stereotypes like so many mediocre writers who have found fame and fortune by explaning Latinoness to white readers via degrading and flat fictional recreations of their family's experiences in this country.Instead, she digs into the rich history of the Dominican Republic to explore the complex and intertwined relationships that defined the island nation at the turn of the century when the U.S. invaded. Vibrant and determined women leap off the page as full characters, not leftovers from their men's or family's imposed notions of who they are.A truly gifted writer, Rosario is assured a significant place in literarture for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"The song of the immigrant Dominican Women","review":"I think this is a mesmerizing story. Any Latin women, especially Dominican women, must have this book! I hope it gets translated into Spanish soon. I believe Rosario is a great storyteller. She shows how complex is to live in two worlds: from the Dominican Republic to Manhattan. She tells the story and struggles of three generations of Dominican women.She is new in this novel writing world, but she is good. Her book is full of feelings, emotions, passion and adventure. As a Dominican, I feel identified with her story. I'm truly waiting for her next novel, and I have trying to make all my friends to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"I had a difficult time putting this book down, it's been a while since I've read a novel where I could actually empathize with the charachters.

I've always been a blues fan with tendencies toward harder rock kind of stuff--so, when I heard Rickie for the first time I didn't know what to make of any of it. Her voice is so mellow and cool. This cd just winds everything down, especially tracks like \\"Last Chance Texaco\\" and \\"Coolsville\\". I also like the lighter tracks like \\"Danny's all star joint\\" and \\"Easy Money\\". \\"Weasel's\\" pretty good too, and \\"Night Train\\"--it's all good. All in all, this is quite different from what I'm used to and much more than I expected. Though I didn't get it the first time, I kept listening. It'll grow on you. She's classy, soulful, mellow, poetic and unlike anything I've ever heard (but then again, I'm just some punk kid from Texas). Don't just take my word for it--this is quite an experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Each song paints a picture of a world worth visiting.","review":"Ms. Jones places her strong voice in a wide range throughout the tracks with a memorable effect. Her somewhat slurred delivery and powerful word pictures emphasize the dreamy quality that each song evokes. The song \\"Company\\" makes the album a worthwhile purchase on its own. Each time the song is played, you are transported to a place in life with a lost love, awkward moments and a heartfelt longing for things to be different. The opening guitar sounds on Chuck E's in Love are instantly recongnizalbe and easily draw you into the world of relationships wondering if this one is real. \\"Coolsville\\" showcases the wide range of Ms. Jones' vocal capabilities, experimenting with voice as a true instrument. Although the result can be odd, the song is memorable. Overall, the collection is one that will remain in your CD changer for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction to RLJ and contemporary music.","review":"For an album that was released in 1979, this album is amazingly modern. The only tracks that don't work for me are Company, which I can see lip-synced on Travolta-era Bandstand, and After Hours, the obligatory end-of-albu ballad. You can also hear the influence Tom Waits had on her music, although I don't know to what extent he actually contributed to the album, if at all. Great album, though, a must if you like RLJ, or want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rickie Lee is the best...and this is her best music","review":"I first saw Rickie Lee Jones on Saturday Night Live, playing the song Coolsville from this CD. It was interesting to me that Chuck E's In Love was the hit but she deliberately did another song. I thought then (and think now) that she picked a better song than the hit and that seems to be the way she manages her career.Rather than go for the easy commercial songs, Rickie really seems to prefer to go with better, higher quality music.

She was, however, a true revolutionary who would only become increasingly experimental as her career progressed. Her music featured a distinct idiosyncratic style which often included free-verse beat poetry, jazz flourishes, torchy balladry and bohemian, streetwise subject matter - and sometimes all in the same song. It was this, her eponymous debut, which started it all and laid the groundwork for what Jones would evolve into."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Song: The Last Chance Texaco","review":"It's hard to believe Ricki Lee Jones was only 23 when she recorded this album (according to the Amazon review). I suppose I was in a similar space when I was that age, slumming. But I never wrote a song this good (I checked the ASCAP database, and yes, she did write it). This guitar-driven, Doppler-effected, blues inflected, spoken-word dejected hymn to the American highway is flat-out brilliant. Here's how it ends:\\"But this one ain't fuel-injectedHer plugs disconnectedShe gets scared and she stallsShe just needs a man, that's allIt's her last chanceHer timing's all wrongHer last chanceShe can't idle this longHer last chanceTurn her over and goPullin' out of the last chance TexacoThe last chance\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should own this disc!","review":"I know she continues to have her followers and rightfully so. I always give her recordings a chance because of how much I like this first one. \\"The Horses\\" is also great but this one simply gets the most air time in my household. All of the songs have a deeply personal tone sung from the heart. My favorite is \\"Young Blood\\" and the lyrics to \\"Last Chance Texaco\\" is brilliant.

He calls on some fine musicians to help him out (Wes Hampton of the Gaither Vocal Band steps in on vocals for a tune or two), and plays tastefully and skillfully. George's strengths lie not only in his ability to play extremely well, but his heart to use music to reach people.

It's riddled with typos, in particular when it comes to numbers. Things like 1 1/2 (one-and-a-half) have been scanned as 1/2, so you always need to be on your toes when following the directions. These typos would be fine in a novel, but are the worst mistakes possible in a cookbook. Lack of an index and a complete recipe list also make the kindle edition very difficult to use--you have to flip many pages one by one to get to the recipe you want, which, with e-ink refresh speeds, is ridiculous.That said, there is a lot of recipes here, and the writing style is to my liking: assumes that you know your way around the kitchen, doesn't baby you, leaves room for improvisation and substitution of ingredients, and displays solid knowledge of the cuisine.

The climax was boring, there was no mystery, and a lot of filler. The characters were uninspired. I did not connect with any of the characters and did not care what happened to them. This book is not written well. It seemed rushed. I will think twice about reading anything by Paul Thompson. Dragonlance was looking for a way to sell a book...instead they sold me crap....."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the most boring books ever","review":"I've read a lot of books in my life and this is one of the worst.The Dragonlance novels tend to vary a lot in quality depending on which author it is, but this one is terrible.I tried and tried to finish it but I couldn't do it because the combination of the writing and the pacing of the plot conspired to put me in a coma.

It arrived damaged but could be repaired with some scrap wood and wood glue. Overall for the money, the table is flimsy and not well made at all. I would gladly have paid more money for something similar and of better quality, but I could find nothing comparable. I'm using it, but the minute I find something nicer, it's going out with the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor workmanship but hideable and fits the purpose","review":"When I first started to put the table together, I thought that the legs had some decorative beveling on them, but a slightly closer inspection revealed that one leg had one corner shaved off along most of the length. I also discovered a crack in another leg. Both of these could be faced to the back of the unit though, so it looks fine. I'd have to say that I'm rather disappointed overall, but it does fit the purpose and the problems can't be easily seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT!

It is the perfect size and simple style that meets my needs, but believe what you read...this is a very low quality item. The product I received was missing parts the pre-drilled holes did not match up, so the construction is very loose. The finishing covers for the screw holes were not included and the company is virtually unreachable. After calling 3 numbers that were \\"out of service\\", I finally got someone on the phone who promptly hung up on me!

I managed to even find a boutique tissue box from another site to match--pending delivery. Aside from that, I don't mind the legs shown in two pieces at all.

I'd never heard or the Aachen Symphony or Marcus Bosch, nor even the label Coviello Classics. Maestro Bosch and his orchestra are close to a complete set of Bruckner and I decided to try a couple of them. The sound quality is excelent, stereo or SACD, the brass instruments form a strong bottom end, and I can only criticize a thinness in the strings in a few spots. The interpretation is mainstream with good dynamic range and no 'start/stops' in tempo ala Jochum. I would probably give this 3 stars for interpretation and 4.5 for sound. I have two more of these performances to listen to and am especially interested to see what these artists do with symphonies 5 and 6, as I feel those are the two most problematic of Bruckner's symphonies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Very good quality product.

This book is a clear illustration of why 50 year old authors shouldn't write books about teenagers. Would average teenagers freak out because they found a beer in the fridge? It was like they were scared of it. And then the next minute totally turn around and get drunk, and EVERYONE was drunk. At highschool parties there is always alcohol, but that doesn't mean that everyone gets totally drunk. By describing how teenagers will get completely trashed when in the presence of alcohol Bonnie Bryant isn't giving teenagers much credit;it's like she is saying we have no idea about right and wrong, nor does she show an understanding of real teenage issues. i suggest the author stick to horses, (isn't that what the book is supposed to be about?) and not something she is obvioiusly clueless about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alaskan adventure","review":"Hank McCloskey is a man torn between his love of the sea and fishing with the love of his family. His wife Jody fished the seas with him until they started their family. Three children later, Hank feels a distance growing between them and his desire to be at sea. Trouble comes in patches, Hank over extends their finances by buying a new boat and building a new house. Suddenly their baby boy becomes ill on the heels of a devasting season of crabbing. Faced with mounting debts and pressures, Hank must decide whether to join forces with the Japanese knowing this will strain friendships with other skippers or facing the possible loss of his boat. He is put to the test business wise and personal wise. This book did a great job of getting you to feel and experience the love of the sea fisherman have. I liked the depth and exploration into Hank and Jody's relationship. I'm a land locked Midwesterner who fell in love with this book. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Next Best Thing To Being There!","review":"An excellent story, well written and done in a manner that allows the reader to 'experience' the moment. Accurately describes the Asian attitude and gives good insight as to how and why the Japanese in particular do business in a way that is certainly foreign to most Americans.

They must be joking! 'Because They're Young', for one, has never sounded WORSE. I don't know what they've done to this classic track which has always sounded great in stereo on other CDs. The mix is barely recognisable here against the original single release. Same thing goes for 'Forty Miles Of Bad Road'...horrible. I could also have done without the fake stereo on 'Rebel Rouser', a track which was only ever recorded in mono. Avoid this CD and get the Bear Family comp instead. They are streets apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Moulton Mix?","review":"Used to be that a Tom Moulton Mix was the ultimate.

If you plan to get a CD version of Tchaikovsky's violin concerto, I recommend this XRCD version. The sound quality and the playing blew me away. Heifetz plays it with intense fire and his tempo is fast but seems so natural that I can't listen to the slower tempos found on every other recording I've heard.According to Wikipedia, he plays on a violin with a silver wound gut g-string, 2 gut middle strings, and a steel top string."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff","review":"I have been using this before they even changed the flavor.

It won't teach you how to select or buy foreign equities, bonds, real estate, etc.The book advises you to buy mutual funds containing stocks of foreign companies without having any clue which companies, what the business and economic climates are like in their home countries, how well they are run, who runs the mutual fund that buys them, etc... One is essentially supposed to buy random assets. The sole purpose in buying them is to buy assets that are supposed to enhance \\"diversification\\" because they're performance doesn't correlate particularly well with US markets."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one of the best Trek books!","review":"This book introduced a plot that tied a few lose ends to some of the original series episodes. It seemed to get a little boring in the middle, but there's a lot of action. You get to see Data do things he normally wouldn't do (like falling in love or meeting other androids, even if they were paranoid). It also has parts in it about Dr. Noonien Soong, which fit into the story perfectly. It's a must for a TNG fan. I've read it four times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book overall","review":"I read this one a while ago, and would have to say that it's a great trek novel. I'm a fan of tng, and was unsure of a few tos things, but you figured it all out in the end like you should. I really liked the flashbacks to Dr.Soong. They were like another short story going on at the same time.This book was written for Star Trek fans, and it might be a little more confusing if you're not."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Trek novels I've ever read!","review":"Before reading Immortal Coil, you need to do the following: get your copy of the Star Trek Encyclopedia out, give yourself a day to read in peace, and write your letter to the author begging for a sequel! Lang does an excellent job of portraying Data as a being struggling with new found emotions. His protrayals of the myriad cast of characters are also excellent, and each character gets just enough time in the book. The story is gripping from the beginning and it does a nice job of tying in many good STOS and STTNG episodes. A solid buy for fans of Data or Star Trek in general!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Well Written Star Trek Novel","review":"Jeffrey Lang did a good job writing this book. I think he wove the various sub-plots together quite nicely. He certainly is an author I will look for in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book dangles the possiblity of completely explaining Data's origin, including why there are no other androids made. Instead, it confuses things further by entangling him in complex plot with three different factions fighting over a new android.There is just too much that you have to accept on faith in this story. E.g. that Data would have the authority to shut down an entire planet's computer network, or that life pods would have warp drives, or that two people could infiltrate changeling-paranoid Starfleet that easily. People keep popping out of the woodwork and explaining what's going on in huge expository chunks.We also get the Trek cliche of a new crewmember a regular character falls in love with, but must leave at the end of the story. It could also do with being at least 20 per cent shorter to speed up the pace and get rid of extraneous stuff.Data deserves a better story than this. And for that matter, what's the story behind Mudd's androids?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated","review":"Many die hard Trek book fans loved this book. Well, I think you need to be a die hard fan to love it. While I enjoy references to past episodes in Trek books, I felt I was often missing half of the story by not being intimatly familiar with every episode from the different Trek series referenced here. Further, some stilted writing, gob-smaking stupid plot sequences, and some rather poor proof-reading took away from the enjoyment value of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"This CD single has three remixes of the song \\"Danger! High Voltage\\". The first track is the Soulchild 12\\" Blitz Mix. This the best remix and is easily worth the whole CD. It's pretty much an extended version of the original song with dance interludes thrown in. The second remix is the Thin White Duke Mix. This one is good, even though it sounds nothing like the original \\"Danger! High Voltage\\". It's has a catchy tune and powerful beat that still goes with the lyrics. The third track is the Kilogram Remix. This one is my least favorite of the three. It's basically a combination of the tune of \\"Danger! High Voltage\\" with an 80's rap beat. The two may sound okay by themselves, but they don't go good together. Overall, this is a decent single. I would get it just for the awesome Soulchild remix, if nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little lacking","review":"This was fun for my son to put together. I had fun watching.

Excellent quality and well thought out design.Unfortunately, you're not going to want to wear it very long if you're anywhere near a 6' 240lb build. The shoulder straps dug into me just under the armpits and got uncomfortable after a couple hours. I suspect most women and smaller or thinner men would be fine with it.

I do get several telephoto lenses, an 18-55mm lens, items previously mentioned, and more into it.

The manufacturer replaces the pack without any problems; however, do you really want to deal with this? In addition, while zippers are waterproof, they are hard to handle; some people ended up just ripping them out when attempting to open or close them. No recommendation to buy this item. Go and talk to your local dealer, especially if you are living in an area that is prone for harsh conditions, and ask them about what they think about the pack before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality videocassette","review":"I first saw this film in the early 1960's at the cinema in Lambertville, New Jersey. I next saw it in the mid 1960's at the Fillmore East Theater in Greenwich Village. I concur with all the reviewers that it is a magnificent film. The unique reason for my two star rating is that the Kultur videocasssette is of miserable quality. In particular the intentionally surreal visual aspects of the film, as Rouleau explicity says in the printed introduction, are ruined by the cropping of the film in this videocassette release. It was released as a wide screen film and in some scenes, specifically the one of the eerie man circling her on his bicycle as he spits cigarette buts at her, has its visual impact ruined, because one can not see him repeatedly making the full circle.

The Physician was a work of literary merit. It had all the hallmarks of a classic, in the same genre as Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett. The historical research in The Physician was thorough and well explained. This book had none of that, although it was a readable story. Quite disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Disappointment","review":"If this had been Noah Gordon's first novel, I don't think he would have sold it. Poor plotting, worn-out rhetoric, lame characterization. Coming as it does on the heels of such masterpieces as \\"The Physician\\" and \\"Shaman,\\" this book is a complete let-down. I agree with the reviewers who said that he really hits his stride much better with historical fiction. He just doesn't seem comfortable in a present-day story, and it is too bad, because he is a very gifted storyteller.If you were enthralled by \\"The Physician\\"and \\"Shaman,\\" spare yourself the disappointment of \\"Choices.\\" Remember Noah Gordon's storytelling as it used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matters of Choice (cole)","review":"After reading The Physician and Shaman, and absolutely loving them, I could not have been more disappointed in Matters of Choice, it was weak and entirely too political. I had so much invested emotionally in the first two and I couldn't relate at all to anyone in the third."},{"rating":"1","title":"A trilogy of two books","review":"Wow, how disapointed I found myself today with a book, that I need to write an online review. XDI like the Cole family trilogy because Noah's way of writing, no lose endings, very well written chapters and parts of a book. Matters of Choice even had a lose ending.* Noah Failed to develop a good female character. Hiding behind the mask of a hard woman, R.J.Cole in many ways fails to be a well written Female, he misses a lot of good oportunities in this book to create a Rich, first R.J Female cole.* It fails to follow the spirit of the other 2 books, as part of a trilogy, this book fails incredible when following the past two, not only because it doesn't have the epic taste of the previews two, but because the main dilema of the book: a woman caught in the abortion dilema, does nothing but fill space on the book.* In many ways this book is \\"A Romantic Novel\\" - Love + Sick relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Mr. Gordon' s usual standards","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I loved The Physician and Shaman, and looked forward to the final \\"chapter\\" in this trilogy. But I found this book did not \\"fill the bill\\". The character of Roberta Cole was, I felt, poorly developed -- I could not identify nor sympathize with her. I mostly just found her annoying. In fact, I didn't learn enough about any of the characters to feel I \\"knew\\" them by the end of the book. The most interesting part of the whole book was when David was relating his experiences with the Jewish scholars at Kidron. Mr. Gordon was infinitely more interesting writing about the past than about modern medicine, and perhaps more accurate. As a nurse with an obstetrical background, I found the childbirth sequence unrealistic ---- I have never seen anyone scream with the contractions that occur while the placenta is being delivered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This trilogy was highly enjoyable!","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy. As a healthcare professional, the history of the practice of medicine during these periods in time were fascinating and thought provoking - how far we've come! And yet, it's still about the money, which is too sad. These characters had a \\"calling\\" for medicine. If only more providers were similarly moved to practice their profession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matters of Choice","review":"This is the 2nd book I have read by Noah Gordon. Absolutely fabulous writer. The first book was The Physician, and I cannot say that I have ever read a better book. I just ordered his book, the \\"The Windmaker,\\" and expect the same wonderful writing, and storyline that I have grown very fond of. Keep it up Noah Gordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a deception compared to the first two books","review":"The first two books of the Cole trilogy are awesome compared to the last one. This last book has no real adventure, not much historical background and little to the plot. The main character is constantly embroiled in life torments and finds refuge in her garden or forest. In the first books, Cole (the ancestors) are winner. In this book Cole (she) is a bit of a think small, affected by controversy about abortion rights, lost in the meanders of unrealistic love relationship. The book ends weird with her getting pregnant. I really enjoyed the first two books. They are really awesome much of the same class as ken follett or even Zola. Not this last one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This book did not live up to his other books. It was a romance novel with no connection with the other two books of the Cole Trilogy. It was a great disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hats off to Noah Gordon - He has done it again!","review":"Unfortunately, most of the people writing the other reviews missed the point of the book, or did not comprehend the full meaning of this book. It is very well written and keeps your interest at all times. It is many things all coming together to a beautiful ending. I can not imagine what more anyone would want in a book. The more-than-adequate development of the characters made for easy reading. Frankly, I found this to be the perfect ending for two such strong prior books as \\"The Physician\\" and \\"Shaman\\".Anyone that enjoys the wonderful writing of Noah Gordon will also love this book. Don't be midled by the less than glowing reviews of other readers. I very nearly did not read this book because of the reviews. I'm so very glad I read the book and made up my own mind as to its value. I found it very entertaining and so glad I got to know Dr. R.J. Cole. Try it - you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I am a real Noah Gordon fan. The Physician (Cole) and Shaman (Cole) were wonderful. This is drivel. I can't believe it was written by Gordon. The characters are thin and unlikeable. The plot is implausible. The interjection of medical terminology is gratuitous, and the attempts to tie current events into a sappy love story fail miserably. I wish I hadn't purchased this book, and I am very disappointed in Gordon's writing. It lacks the depth and color of The Physician and Shaman, which kept me riveted to the story and the characters. I honestly think Gordon just felt he should write something about a woman physician for a change, so he created this debacle. He obviously doesn't understand women's motivations, and certainly can't write about women's feelings. It was melodrama all the way. I hesitated to give it even one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential for a really great sequel wasted.","review":"I own and have reread Physician and Shaman several times, and fully expected another great read in the series. Instead, all the right ingredients appeared to suborn themselves to a politically correct agenda. Each of the first two novels left me with a profound feeling of satisfaction and respect for a wonderful tale, well told. Matters of Choice seems to go nowhere, portraying episodes in sequence while merely reflecting current social unrest and dwindling off to a very unsatisfactory conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevant","review":"This leap forward in time from \\"Shaman\\" addresses a more modern medical reference while continuing the Cole family line. Issues are pertinent, fairly current, and relevant to modern life. I enjoyed the feminine twist.

The Physician and Shaman were two fantastic books and the tryology of Cole's family deserved a better final book.... Choices is boring..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few more dollars down the drain.","review":"The one thing I would have liked to know before purchasing this book is that it is Choices with a different title. Both books had different copyright dates, so I thought maybe Mr. Gordon decided to continue his story with a 4th book. Well wasn't I surprised when I started reading Matters of Choice?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soapbox","review":"I found this book to be a real letdown. After reading The Physician and Shaman I was really excited to read Matter of Choice, but felt as though Mr. Gordon was just ranting on and on about liberal politics that didn't go along with the rest of set.I thought it rather interesting that Dr Cole didn't like performing abortions but did it anyway.She also had a problem with hunting and killing animals and ate it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeling Very Disappointed........","review":"With disappointment, I finished reading Matters of Choice. Gordon's third in his triology of the Cole family, definitely is not in the same league as The Physician and Shaman. As happens to so many modern-day novels today, the depth of the plot and characters were lost in the publisher's dumbing down of number of words.I grew tired of reading R.J.'s reasons to justify to herself why she performed abortions. Where was the Cole dynasty of trying to save lives instead of taking life? Even Sarah's death could not convince her of the truth. Why weren't alternatives to abortion, such as adoption, discussed by the characters? The reports of attacks on abortion clinics was like a broken record, as well as using the label anti-abortion instead of pro-life.Matters seemed more like a political statement to me than the grand, historical fiction I had come to expect from Gordon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!!","review":"One of the reasons I chose this book was based on having read the first two of this trilogy, which I found to be two of the best books I have ever read, and subsequently gave them Five Stars each.Another reason was the very poor review by one of your readers who made comment that it was barely worth reading and not even worthy of a one star rating.I was very curious that this book would receive such mediocre reviews following two brilliant books (The Physician and Sharman) and decided to read it to find out why.The characters were poorly developed, too many sideline stories which had no conclusion, far too much uninteresting detail, and a story line that went no where.In summary I struggled to finish it, and on many occasions I asked myself why did the author write this book? I certainly have no idea!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Cole","review":"While the others in the Cole series are excellent reads, this one isn't even so-so.

This is especially true of \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover,\\" \\"Stil Waiting,\\" \\"When We're Dancing Close and Slow,\\" and the original version of \\"I Feel For You.\\" \\"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad\\" is also quite wonderful.

This album to me is just the beginning of a raw Prince and what his future had to hold. Especially on \\"Bambi\\". I had no idea what the song meant at the time, but I loved the instruments in this song. \\"Sexy Dancer\\" and \\"I Feel For YOu\\" are still my favorites because it keeps me in the disco mode. \\"Still Waiting\\" and \\"When We're Dancing Close and Slow\\" really puts me over the edge. They say so much about Prince as an artist. Just the simple fact that he can go from rocking us with the guitar to being sensual. Not too many artist can do that.

Sailing is another great acoustic song. I Dont' Want to Talk About It, Tonight's the Night, I Was Only Joking, and The First Cut is the Deepest, are slower songs, and Rod pulls them off good. Tonight's the Night, was originally banned from radio, because the lyrics were considered suggestive, but by today's standards they are rather tame. THe background singers in Gerogie make the song.

However, there's one particular cut of his that I've really taken a liking to: the disco-riffic \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\" After many fruitless attempts to find this song on CD single (I'm not into that MP3 download technology yet), I was forced to grab a full album that had this particular cut on it. As you may've guessed, this offering is the one I selected. Of course, I had to shell out quite a few more shekels for all those other cuts I didn't really care for. Fortunately, I've found one way to maximize the value of this purchase: I use the CD case as a coaster for my drink.

This requiem is unique in that it is not a piece meant to instill fear and the terror of death into the listener. Fauré, as a church organist, was tired of hearing and performing masses that were dark, heavy, and macabre. Thus, he created here a requiem mass not focused on the dark aspects of death but rather the beauty and calm of the pending afterlife. This work is one of the most exquisite jewels in the entirety of music. The moving power of the Requiem mass is truly heavenly.Ozawa gives a very good reading of the Requiem.

Sounds somewhat borderline of traditional black metal and neo-black metal style. Some songs boast some ripping guitar rythems and solos. Drums sounded typical of any black metal.

This CD would likely be enjoyed by any typicaly BM fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed","review":"This is the fourth Old Mans Child album that I have come across and as much black metal as I'v heard, this album gave me something new and fresh that I have never heard before. Half the songs on the album very computerized, which is a much different style that used on previous discs. The melotic, creepy black songs that were on \\"In Defiance Of Existance\\" just dont excist on this album. This disc has obviously shown how OMC studio work, and effects are maturing and improving, but musically I think this is a weaker album.

On Vermin Galder does everything (Guitar, Bass, keyboards, and Vocals) on the record besides drums which is done by Reno Kiilerich (Dimmu Borgir, Exmortem) which totally kicks ass on drums. the best songs on the album are Enslaved and Condemned, The Plague of Sorrow, War of Fidelity, In Torment's Orbit, Black Marvels of Death, and Twilight Damnation.

The fact that she didn't makes you wonder if even those who made the movie were under her spell!Susan Lucci is NOT a good actress. Her helpless, wide-eyed sugary sweet smile (inflicted on everyone, even her daughter) is overdone, and her every gesture, every look, conveys her absorption with her own beauty. (And I do think she has the kind of glamor needed to play a seductress). I realize she was supposed to be \\"putting on an act\\" in the movie, but I got the impression that all this phony \\"over-acting\\" came a bit too naturally for her!This could have been a good movie if they had changed the ending and used an actress with a little more spice and a little less sugar.I have only myself to blame for getting sucked into it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Susan Lucci as she can play best","review":"Considering I only have seen the first half hour of this film (some of us have to work), I agree with the first reviewer who said Susan Lucci's acting is soap opera-ish at best. Susan seems past her heyday in this movie, and it's a role I thought would've been played better by a somewhat younger actress like Diane Lane or even Angelina Jolie. Susan looks old and haggard - makes me wonder what a guy like her lover actually sees in her, or why he would go to such extremes to attempt killing her rich husband. Here's a thought that crossed my mind - why do so many women married to wealthy men think their lives are so bad that they have to cheat? If I was married to someone with money I would just appreciate that I don't have to work and can spend my days looking pretty and shopping. So much for marrying for love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second times the charm!","review":"Van Halen II is every bit the classic their debut was. David Lee Roth's talent really shows here. From what I hear this album was recorded in less than a week! You wouldn't know it, as the songs sound masterfully crafted. Not one second seems rushed.Another fine cover tune opens the album,\\"You're no good\\" and gets things going in full throttle. \\"Dance the night away\\" with it's pleasant harmony reached the top 20. The feel-good chorus of \\"Bottoms up\\" never disappoints. Eddie showcases his acoustic chops on \\"Spanish fly\\" followed by the all-out rocker \\"Dead or alive\\". \\"Women in love\\" will lift you up during the dog days of summer.

VH II is a great balance that outdistances sophomore slump and makes one forget about an asskicking freshman effort. For my money, D.O.A. is one of the best hard rock songs to hit the pike. \\"We were broke and hungry, on a summer day...They sent the sheriff down to try and drive us away...\\" I mean, come on!! This is lyric styling and loud Eddie gi-tarr at its best possible combination. Take that song, and the album (which, by the way, starts out with a Linda Ronstadt song! And what a lyricist she is/was???!!! ). This effort kept the party going. And it did a good job, at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"You could call this album Van Halen I Part II","review":"Some of the greatest American Rock and Roll ever!

Eddie Van Halen possesses an immense talent with the axe which makes him fun to listen to in the right situation. However, all the intensity, the drive, the focus that made their debut what it was, had already been drained out and watered down by their follow up. \\"Beautiful Girls\\" succeeds where most of the tracks on here don't, it is restrained, catchy, and smooth. Yet that fire that made song's like \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love\\" and \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\" on the debut so good was no longer there. It's not like this stopped them from getting more popular, but we don't have to pretend decades later like it's not overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong but not Van Halen's best [4.5 stars]","review":"Van Halen II is a really good rock album. There's not a bad song on it. It's straight-forward rock with a pinch of funk in spots. The problem, for me, has always been that it was the follow-up to one of the best rock albums ever made. Several other albums in the Roth era were much stronger, particularly Fair Warning and 1984. VHII is certainly a worthy effort, it's just bookended by much better albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Swinging Rock-N-Roll....Simply the Best of the Best","review":"Just too much.

This music makes me want to live fast and die young, and do it before the album finishes.If you haven't heard \\"D.O.A.\\" or \\"Light Up the Sky\\", buy this album today!! So damn catchy.Van Halen's first 5 or 6 albums are technical masterpieces, yet paradoxically soulful, and wild, and swinging and reckless, (...). The fans of this band are probably responsible for the wave of teen-pregnancies during the 1980's.I wish I had more words, but the only ones left are four-letter exclaimations at the brilliance and seductiveness of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome follw up album","review":"Another album from the seventies that was again well ahead of its time.

While I thought this would not be as good as Van Halen I, it is just as good. It is no less heavier, no less catchy. David Lee Roth is just as good a singer as ever, and Eddie is just as good a guitar player. I feel this album is very underrrated, being as good as it is. Nobody really goes nuts over it the way they do 1984, which is not half as good as this. Some of the best Van Halen songs are on this album. I just don't get it.

Be warned that Lowell never heard anything close to the final version of these songs.

When the album was released on vinyl the track \\"Front Page News\\" was sung by Lowell George and lasted an entire minute longer. The backing track is also very different and sped up. I am very dissappointed because I have looked for his version of the song(far superior to Payne's version) and have not been able to find it.

From beginning to end, Life will never disappoint.It should also be noted that Andy Hunter has retained his amazing Christian message, not selling out one bit. He is truly a blessing to world of electronica... Don't even hesitate, buy this CD now. The sooner you own it, the sooner you can experience this heaven-on-a-disc.Its one and only downside?

There is a lot of terrific, well-researched info on these four, but I wanted more options. More options is what Countdown provides. The bulk of the large book is taken up by thorough, detailed descriptions of more organizations, much like the ones in the original book.

And there's no real \\"lame duck\\" tracks present, which can often mar an otherwise fantastic album.

Sure enough, Galde Press authors \\"share\\" the costs of printing and production. Beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Back Again!","review":"A littel soul, R&B rap all blended in. Jon B surprised us just when we thought he wasn't coming back. The CD is really mellow and nonchalant, it let's you feel a little cool and relaxed. I give it to Jon B because alot of people didn't think he could do it but he came back with this CD and he came back strong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gamble That Paid Off","review":"This is an artist that i have never really heard that much about. but he kept coming up as a recommendation for me so i decided to give it a go to see if Amazon were right, they were. This album is very good, with my favourite tracks being Dont Talk, Sof'n Sweet, Pleasures U Like, Lonely Girl and Cocoa Brown. If anyone is unsure about buying this album then i will have to say buy it as im glad i did"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"This album is off the hook. Jon delivers yet another blazin' album. For those of you who have not coped this album you are definitely missing out. Jon is back. This album is definitely a must have for real R&B lovers. I love the entire album, but my favorite cuts would have to be Layaway (featuring AZ), Finer Things (featuring Nas), Now that I'm with You, Overjoyed (featuring Faith Evan), Boy is not a Man, Do it all Again and All I want is U (featuring Cuban Link). The other tracks are banging too. This is the kind of album that you can listen to over and over again. I love Jon I just hope his fans don't have to wait another 3 years for his next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jon. B is always constient","review":"A cool, nighttime dance club vibe flows through the album. Not every song is a dance track; there are also a number of appealing ballads. The catchy mid-tempo \\"Don't Talk\\" glides along every smooth The chugging \\"Sof'n Sweet\\" says \\"Don't just stand there/Break it down.\\" The bass-heavy ballad \\"Overjoyed\\" is a duet between the singer and Faith Evans. Babyface co-wrote the languid, muted-trumpet-sprinkled \\"Lonely Girl.\\" Other highlights are the acoustic guitar-laced \\"Tell Me,\\" as well as the deliciously languid slow jams Do It All Again,Now That I'm With You \\"Calling on You\\" and \\"Inside.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Soul","review":"Jon B has a genuine love for soul music, and this album proves it. It's one of those albums that you can listen to all the way through. His voice is beautiful, and his ballads really let you know why you loved him in the fist place. It's soulful and sultry. I couldn't ask for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Los","review":"What in the world happened with this cd?! I have \\"Bonafide\\" and \\"Cool Relax\\" and love them both. But this cd is nineteen elevator songs and only ONE good one (\\"Layaway\\" with AZ). It's like he left his soul at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jon b. needs better editing to avoid quantity over quality","review":"Jon B. needs better editing on his latest. This is the third release, however the first jon b. that failed to knock me off my feet. Don't get me wrong, Jon shows hints of his earlier talent, but it falls too wide and far in between. He's hidden pleasureable parts amongst goobles of junk that only a sanford listener could enjoy. Most discouraging is that Jon has traded in his babyfacique falsetto and boy band soft tenor and replaced it with a slick pursue the young lady in the club mumble which comes up short more often than not. He has done ballads better than the boy groups who command hundreds of reviews on this site. With consistency with quality over quantity (over 13 tracks this time out), he might eventually garner the same kind of attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak!","review":"I don't have a Lot to say about as I gave It away after the first time I listed to It except come up with some fresh material.Its not even worth the used price they have on IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bonafed up","review":"another whiteboy acting black n sync, and backstreet can sure learn a lot from jon b especially when it comes to how to trteat a sista."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Michael Lite","review":"not only from the Album Cover which is just like George Michael's Older Cover but also from His Musical Style.Jon B.is Cool&His Style Passes through but as with His Other Material it is Hit&Miss&aside from a few songs there isn't much there to wanna listen to say a year later.all the duets hurt His Project as with many other projects out over the last few years.when I hear most of His Material it's like George Michael Left-overs except George Michael still matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Piece of Art","review":"What can i really say about this album. I could say its tight, I could say its bomb, i could say its off the hook, but those words don't due this CD its justice. This piece of art, is beautiful... by far his best. He's got slow jams, relaxing ballads, upbeat cuts, and tracks to just listen to while chillin' with you homies. Some of my favorite tracks are Finer Things w/ Nas, Sof'n Sweet, Overjoyed w/ Faith Evans, Boy is not a man, Cocoa Brown, All I want is You w/ Cuban Link, Layaway w/ AZ ( I love the latin sound it has), Now That I 'm with you.... I could go on forever. What I appreciate about the album the most is that its such high quality... the vocals, lyrics, beats, collaborations, etc... Its been a long time, but it was worth the wait, so everyone go buy this album \\"Pleasures U Like\\" cuz everyone should have something this beautiful to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I'll keep this short and to the point. This is the best R&B album I've heard released in 2001. Jon. B.'s last album was excellent and he has exceeded that production with his current effort. This man is a very talented (see the album credits and his creative input) and fast rising star. Keep an eye on him in the future. Kudos to Tracy Edmonds for development. Jon B.'s album is considerably better than her famous husband's new project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just cool, relax....here comes bonafide \\"Pleasures U Like\\"","review":"\\"Pleasures U Like\\" finds Jon once again in the zone. It could easily be \\"Cool Relax\\", the sequel.A star studded affair with guest appearances from Nas, Faith Evans, Az U and The Cuban Link.Despite a Gold single in \\"Don't Talk\\", Epic only released one single from this cornucopia of great songs.It plays with long term endurance as you realize overtime how simply Jon's road to success had been.Epic's lack of focus caused Jon to jump ship and create an even greater pending masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"almost a total joke","review":"This book would be more aptly named \\"How to talk to anyone: some gimmicks to make you think your improving your social skills.\\" While there were a few (about ten)tips that would be considered useful, most could make someone seem creepy.

If I could give it a 0 rating, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are you kidding?","review":"So I wonder why people write books like this and why people find it useful.Why can't people just be authentic and genuine instead of trying to win people through their heads/brain? People who wants to connect with people should go through spirituality and look inside themselves instead of trying to fake, manipulate, and trick people into believing them to be confident and sincere.Exactly as the title of the book - \\"tricks\\" - only to perpetuate the lies and manipulation of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"This book might be alright if you are truly a complete social reject. The advice is so commonplace and mundane that it's insulting. These are BASIC social skills kids learn when they are young. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you really do not understand people","review":"Not a bad book, but really only useful if you have never dealt with social situations. Talking to people about things they are interested in, facing them when you talk, body language, it's all pretty simple stuff. If you have never considered any of this, the book may help, but it's a bit disturbing to think that some people never consider the basics of human communication and need a book to tell them to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks.","review":"This book sucks. It's written by a four year old. For example, one sentence reads 'Are there data correct?' They meant, 'Is their data correct?' Also, they don't really have any tricks, it's total B.S."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly worse than useless","review":"If you have ever been annoyed by excessive triteness, glibness, superficial charm, grandiosity, or alliteration, this is not the book for you.I find it deeply troubling that a person with such a strong undercurrent of snobbery and contempt for people in general would tout themselves as a communications expert.I checked this out of the library on CD in my efforts to advance my business communication, and I have no intention of accepting advice from someone like this author.Except yes, I probably *should* evaluate my smiles and other facial expressions in the mirror.And yes, I suppose I shouldn't smile too big too soon and give away the store all at once.But the sound of this woman's voice fills my throat with bile and I honestly consider her in more contempt than the author of \\"How to Marry the Rich,\\" which I received as a gag gift from my husband.If you really want a primer on talking with people, \\"The Fine Art of Small Talk\\" by Debra Fine is a better first step."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly simple and instantly effective -a truly great book","review":"After reading just the first chapter of \\"How to Talk to Anyone,\\" I was astounded!! I have been researching this field (I am 24 years old, and a developmental trainer) for almost 7 years and I have never seen, heard or read such stuff. Leil's technique about the \\"Flooding Smile\\" is in itself worth the price of the whole book, many times over. I feel a sense of excitement on having discovered her material that I felt when I first read about NLP - which was a life-changing experience for me. Really, Leil's book is AWESOME!! and if I could, I would shout it out and jump up and down and tell everyone about it in the voice of a kid who just found out where his favorite toy was all this while, after all! I can't wait to start living these techniques and scream these techniques out in my training sessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!!","review":"This book is truly great!! I am not very good at small talk and being a room full of people I do not know. This book gave me great ideas on how to be more comfortable in these situations. The tips seem so common sense but some of us just don't know them!! This book is also easy to read and quick to get through. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful book","review":"I enjoyed this book. I haven't tried out the tips yet, but they already make me feel more confident and more prepared for social situations. I read this book to both help me make friends easier and to help me get a job. I can see it helping with both, though I doubt the effects will be too spectacular. I definitely enjoyed reading it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, Very helpful","review":"I am an entreprenuer who often has to meet and impress strangers.

If you want to improve your relationships, this book is highly recommended to you. Everyone can pick up something from this little book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and Insightful","review":"I can't imagine being a successful salesperson without using these skills. Reading \\"How to talk to anyone\\" is easy to fit into your busy schedule because it is written in short, categorized snippets. The chapter titles are enticing. I appreciate the ideas for people who want to ask questions without insulting someone or seeming ignorant. I was especially pleased with the phrase, \\"How do you spend most of your time?\\" instead of a question like \\"Where do you work?\\" because of its sensitivity to the overworked, stressed stay-at-home mom or the recently downsized professional. Alas, I am no salesperson, but I am a teacher. Earning the trust of the parents and the students will be easier if I keep a few of these tidbits in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a great book that will help you put your best foot forward when dealing with people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"I love this book, I keep it handy as a reference guide to all my encounters with strangers.

It is laid out in easy to understand tips and outlines many things that we use daily without being conscious of. The tips are easy to implement in your day to day actions and things that you feel comfortable incorporating. It creates a self awareness of interactions.Great book to read like a reference book, a few chapters when you have a few moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't knock Dale Carnagie","review":"I lost all respect for this book when the author started knocking Dale Carnagie's principles. I took the Dale Carnagie courses, and they are not like this guy says. Apparently he is speaking out of heresy, and I can hear he has not idea what he's talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay book","review":"This book provides some interesting tricks on how to get along with people, but some of them are kind of crazy (hence why I knocked off one star). For example, \\"How to use your eyes to make someone fall in love with you\\" is not something I would have put in this book. However, some tricks are actually very useful (e.g, Parroting, how to make \\"where are you from\\" sound exciting).Overall I would say this book is worth a read, but if you do then don't take everything you read seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same book, different cover - Talking the Winner's Way","review":"I'll repeat what an August 5th reviewer of Talking the Winner's Way stated : If you've already bought the book How To Talk To Anyone - 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships by the same author then don't buy this book as it is the same. I bought both of them together and was really annoyed when I discovered they were the same. How can someone re-write a book under a different title without any mention of this fact on the book cover ?You'll also note that Editorial review of both books is the same and have the same quotes from Larry King and McKay. Shame on Amazon for not giving me a full refund!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good for networking and dating situations","review":"Got this book not knowing what to expect, but I find books with lists like this easy to read and quick to go through, so I took a shot. Got some good information from it. Some things most people will know and some you haven't thought of. Was valuable to me in that I can use it for my work and relationship situations. The same skills apply to both. I am in a business where one relationship can make your or break you. Because of this, even one tip could mean a big bump in my income. For that reason, I give it 5-stars, since a little can go a long way here. Of course, this works for personal/romantic relationships also. You don't need all 92 of these tips to get 5-star value out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much needed","review":"This book should be used in schools and businesses. Simple skills we all can grasp and make our own. I've used these tips over the holidays at parties and had successfully engaged many in conversation. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't follow all the tips","review":"This book seems to encourage insincerity. The author tells the readers to fake a lot of things, like fake listening to a person into talking passionately, or giving them a compliment right away even though they \\"bombed\\" it.With that said, this book does point out some good points. One of my favorite tips is to not give out a naked thank you to someone who does you a great favor, instead, make it \\"thank you for insert action\\". I like this tip because many times when a person is particularly helpful to me, I feel awkward just saying a plain thank you.Overall, this book will help you brush up some of your communication skills. But be do be careful using some of the tips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book title is misnamed","review":"The title of this book should have been The Fine Art of Manipulation, because that's all it's about. So if you prefer pretending and manipulating, instead of genuinity and honesty in relationships, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book","review":"I am presently using this book to teach a course on Hinduism. It is absolutely of the lowest quality imaginable. Much of the book is extensive quotations from other introductory books on Hinduism. Sharma often does not even elaborate the quotations. All of the difficult distinctions and concepts are left unexplained. I would never use this book again. I am frustrated every time I open it, and my sense is that my students do not like it. A cursory glance at the book will reveal to anyone at all familiar with Hinduism that this book was thrown together in a very short time for the sake of a book contract, and is not a legitimate teaching tool. I give it one star only because I the system will not accept no stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"I finally traded my giant 1980's speakers for the TSS 450s. Totally different experience. Movies and music sound great. The only reason I did not give it five stars is the sound is a bit weak at lower volume, which with two kids is where my system stays. What I really liked is the fact that these speakers came with wire and wall mounting brackets so unlike so many other electronics items this speaker set is ready to go out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glosses over evrything important. Not enough information","review":"I ordered several DVD's as i read mixed reviews on almost all. After watching this one I was very dissappointed. The video is like 40 minutes long and glosses over several important newborn care concerns. I also bought Bringing Baby Home: The Ultimate Baby Care DVD (2005) and i quickly realized that this DVD was much more hearty and spent more time explaining and showing you then ABC's did. Get that one instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for watching with dads who don't have time to read baby books","review":"The basics of newborn baby care are in this video. It's extremely helpful to receive the lessons visually as it's not always easy to understand from books. I would definitely recommend watching this with new dads who are too busy to read baby books. The drawback I would give to this video is that the nurse and the mother in the video speak in very annoying, staged voices and the discussion on breastfeeding is just that - discussion and no demonstration! Seriously, I think a pregnant woman and an expectant father can handle an image of a woman breastfeeding without being scandalized..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful at all","review":"Maybe if you've never held a baby or truly are clueless about ANYTHING involving baby care it'll be tolerable for you. But those who need that much help will need something that actually goes into detail. For instance, the nursing part of the program is so short and only talks about a few things and doesn't even show a baby nursing. They actually even go through the steps of picking up a baby! It's pretty irritating and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a First Choice","review":"I purchased \\"ABC's of Newborn Baby Care\\" and another video called \\"Bringing Baby Home\\". The \\"ABC's\\" video uses a baby who is not a newborn. The umbilical cord is healed and the baby is at least three weeks old. The video does go over basic care of how to hold, change, dress a baby, bottle cleaning and baths, but skips over the details I would have found useful. \\"Bringing Baby Home\\" by the Liandrea Company is a much more complete video that uses actual newborns and parents (no actors)and covers a wider range of information. I do not recomment ABC's of Newborn Baby Care as anything but a suppliment to another video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for what it is","review":"Not everybody has experience with babies. We haven't all had the opportunity to 'practice' with the children of friends and family. Some of us have never even touched a baby before, let lone changed, bathed or fed one. While I think this DVD is probably far too simplistic for the kind of woman who has spent her life cooing over baby pictures in magazines, for men like me who know NOTHING and are scared to death, it provides invaluable reassurance. Of course it can't replace in-depth books and pre-natal classes, but as an easy visual guide, I can't imagine how it could have been done any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a book","review":"A wonderful way to learn what to do for my newborn son. It was more helpful than my pre-natal visit to the hospital, as I could reference the answers in my home, and easily encourage my couch-potato husband to do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful addition","review":"What a wonderful new, informative addition to the overwhelming experience of care for newborns. It is a must for your own personal collection as well as gifts for new expecting families."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Healthier World","review":"ABC's DVD should be a mandatory part of every high school health class. Every expectant parent should be given ABC's DVD through their doctor or medical facility and the world would have a healthier and happier place. ABC's is professionally produced, easy to understand, and can be seen over and over. Why has ABC'c DVD taken so long to be produced? A total thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money...too basic to be useful","review":"Good intentions, but no depth of information.

This, on the other hand, is a waste of time and money unless you've never seen a baby before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic even for a new mom","review":"There are about 18 chapters of information on basic newborn baby care. Each chapter is covered in brief one to three minute sessions and there's no depth in the information. Each content just scratches the surface of newborn care without detail information. If you've already read books or magazine articles on newborn baby care, this DVD is not worth the money. If you have not ready anything about newborn care (books or magazine articles), maybe this DVD can get you started with basic information as a new mom. I have found that some information differs with information found in newborn care books and magazines (and from prepared childbirth classes)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious?","review":"I bought this DVD for my sister who is expecting. I see that this DVD won awards but I don't know how. This video is cheesy and hard to watch. I would not recommend this video, it was not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nervous Fathers-to-be...listen up","review":"Nervous Fathers and Father's-to-be listen up. If you only watch one video... make it this one ! Forget all the cutesy girly books and dry 70's medical videos. This video cuts to the chase and gives you the fundamentals of what you need to know when little Jr gets home from the hospital and there is no nurse to bail you out at 3:30 am. A lifesaver for the first-time Dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roll-over Magnum, here comes Matt...","review":"Finally, \\"the powers that be\\" have chosen to release this show on DVD. I was a big fan of Matt Houston back in the 80's when it came out, at least the first two season's. Not only because Lee Horsely is SO FINE, but I also had a huge crush on Pamela Hensley. In fact she was the main reason I started watching the show to begin with. I followed her from Buck Rogers to this show and really enjoyed the chemistry she had with Mr. Horsely. Anyway, I can't wait to purchase this DVD when it comes out in a couple of months. If you haven't seen this show but enjoyed other 80's detective shows such as Magnum P.I. or Simon and Simon, then you'll like this one too. Go MATT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable bit of fluff from the 80s","review":"I enjoyed this first season of Matt Houston. For us females, just looking at Lee Horsley sells the series. Some of the plots are a bit boiler plate, while some are really good. The series is typical of the early 80s, lots of glamour, rich folks living it up, cool cars, beautiful women in bikinis and evening gowns; handsome guys in three piece suits and tuxedos. Interesting selection of stars of that time period like Sonny Bono and Chuck Connors. It you are into really rich complicated drama, this series is not for you. If you want a little escapist fluff that you don't have to think too hard about, this is it. It's just fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Show From The 1980's","review":"This is one of the best shows from the 1980's. I am finally glad to see it finally released onto DVD. I just hope that Seasons 2 and 3 will be released soon after it. I am still waiting for seasons 3, 4 , and 5 to be released of T J Hooker. All I have seen and have is seasons 1 and 2.

The quality visually has held up pretty well, and I forgot how much just good, sometimes silly adventure this show contained. Still think Lee Horsley was way hotter than Selleck... that hasn't changed since the 80s... and still think Pamela Hensley totally kicks butt. I really hope we get the other two seasons, preferably with some extras since Lee, Pam and several of the other actors are around to contribute. That's the only thing I miss on this first season, though I did like seeing the promos... it's funny how straightforward promos used to be compared to now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matt Houston Season 1","review":"One of my all time favorite characters. I don't believe anyone other than Lee Horsley could have portrayed the millionaire oil man with a heart of gold.

Thanks for all the hard work from the cast and crew - it is appreciated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good detective series","review":"If you like Lee Horsley, you will like this series.

The reason why I remember this is because I DVD -r'd a copy from a beta tape about ten years ago and remember why I liked that Pilot so much.For me this is a major Paramount screwup. Why can't they just leave things alone and why do the idiot's have to make demands on the music that keeps us from enjoying these great shows.On the back of this package in microscopic print it says that the versions of the episodes are \\"Edited\\" and \\"Some music has been changed\\"I am personally disappointed for that reason.. We have waited 28 years for this debacle?? very disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THE SHOW","review":"I LOVE THE SHOW. I ALWAYS WATCH IT WHEN IT CAME ON. I WISH IT WOULD COME BACK ON.

Originally intended as yet another \\"Magnum P.I.\\" look-a-like, this amusing, entertaining trip into super 80's cool gave its leading man a tremendous following, and gave his fan following his ruggedly handsome looks and winning personality for three seasons.

As of right now this band is almost totally unknown as this album is pretty new and they are merely a sideproject consisting of Henry and Speed from Soilwork and the two guitarists from Darkane. The result is a work of no bull[...], brutal melodic thrash metal much like The Haunted, Medulla Nocte and The Crown. The guitar playing is sickeningly frentic and fans of Soilwork I'm sure know that Speed is an excellent vocalist. If you've heard The Chainheart Machine as well then you'd also know that Henry can annhilate a drum kit like few others. Being a massive fan of The Haunted, their first album especially, I almost had to change my underwear the first time I heard this. If you want some fast as [...] metal that just destroys time after time then you want Terror 2000's album."},{"rating":"1","title":"great music / bad mastering","review":"First of all the track listings shown for this album correspond to the new remaster not this cd.

The music is so-so tolerable with a few whispy brilliant moments but too few and far between.

Her mother, sister Nell, and Auntie Claire are suffragists, fighting for voting rights for women, to the disapproval of her Uncle Bayard and the worry of her father. Kat and her cousin Alma, who are the exact same age, want to help, but they are too young to join the picket line. As it begins to seem more and more likely that the United States will enter the war, life begins to change in other ways.

She is frank, candid, anointed and mandated to give a Word that will 'set the captive free'.It is a tremendous blessing and a source of deliverance!!!The revelation knowledge that she writes in this book along with her personal testimonies gave the reader the HUNGER to want to follow Christ in every sense of the term.She deals with masturbation, the homosexual, what we do in the spirit realm we when engage in relations outside the marriage covenant.

And according to Juanita Bynum, she started acting \\"less lady-like\\" and started dressing unclassy when she began masturbating. How does being a woman have anything to do with dressing nicely?This book is damaging to a woman's identity. To all the women out there: there's nothing wrong with having sexual feelings.

The writing is simple but not captivating. Don't expect to be drawn in by any amazing character development in this sci-fi adventure novel. There are no real original twists or turns. I feel overall this story is nothing new for the sci-fi world. Those of you giving this book 4-5 stars could only hold this book to such high esteem due to its star wars roots. If this were a book not titled star wars the rating would be much lower trust me.Final thoughts: If you're a star wars fan you'll enjoy this one especially if you're a less mature reader. If you're looking for a good Star wars book check out anything written by Timothy Zahn (the man an artist to say the least).

Crispin does an excellent job of characterizing Solo in the way that Star Wars fans would expect and his history of being a self-concerned smuggler is the main reason behind everything that happens in this book and the following ones. We meet some new and interesting aliens, learn about an interesting planet where a rare substance catches Solo's attention, and we learn that Solo has interests in women before The Princess but I think we all could have guessed at that. A good read and a bit better than most of the Star Wars novels I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Backstory","review":"I\`ve read this series twice, and it\`s still good.

It starts with Han trying to escape from his employers. As it unfols in the book, he wants to follow his dream and destiny in an adventure that has drama and plots. The characters in the book are played very well by A.C. Crispin. Especially the backdrop of the story about pligrims working for the T-landa Til who are distant cousin of the Hutts. Teroenza who is the religious leader of the pligrims is a very intersting character, for he manipulates them to his advantage. Han Solo works for the T-landa Til and this is where the story really takes off. I found this book very well paced and designed. I am looking forward to book 2 of the Han Solo trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important tip for new Star Wars authors...","review":"For some reason the author feels like she has to prove that this character is the Han Solo! She keeps making references to Han not wanting to look scruffy, just because in \\"The Empire\\" there was one tiny reference to Han being mock-offended by being called scruffy by Leia. I mean from the time Han was six years old when the book starts, he keeps being concerned about his appearance because he doesn't want to look scruffy.And that's just one example. I also feel like if you took any sentence that Han ever said in any of the movies, chances are, you would find that exact same sentence in this trilogy. For example: \\"I have a bad feeling about this.\\" That sentence was used once in Star Wars, but in this first book in the Han Solo trilogy it has already been used about a dozen times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start to the trilogy","review":"A.C Crispin manages to capture Han Solo's character very well. His dreams of escaping the vicious pirate Garris Shrike, and joining the Imperial Navy, make you care about him for more than you did in the trilogy. Also the plot is very inventive, and Muuurgh, although intially a replacement Chewbacca figure, actually becomes an important, and very well developed character. If you are a Star Wars fan, definitely buy this book, and if you are new to the series, start here, as it's brilliantly done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bria...Leia","review":"I liked this book a lot but did anyone else notice how alike Bria and Leia were? Just by looking at their names BrIA and LeIA, and they are both 4 letters. Also the way they behave at first Bria doesn't like Han same with Leia. Then when Han goes to touch her she pulls away just like Leia did. They both evev say \\"Stop that\\" and Han replies \\"Stop what?\\" They are also both very stubborn women. I must admit though Leia has more willpower but other than that they are very similar. No wonder Han falls for Leia."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally know what happened to Solo before he met Obi-wan","review":"I never was much interested in reading the Star Wars books because so many authors had come in to work on the same set of books.

Some viewers complain about the footage quality, or lack of technical prowess in shooting some venues, but they're missing the point of the compilation.

If you have the opportunity to listen to both, you will see an amazing difference. While Britney's CD consists of bland bubble gum song that dont require any long notes, Christina's songs always allow her to belt out those beautiful keys that she hits so well. I wouldn't be so obsessed with her if I didn't think she was an amazing singer. my personal favorite is What A Girl Wants, because this sing got me hooked on her. But If you want an example of at her most amazing, try I Turn to You and at this one moment in the song you might be taken to tears as I was. It's incredible and I listen to it every day at least once.

Genuine Metaphysics","review":"Of the many 1000s of books on Indian and Greek metaphysics I own, this is the only one written within the past 40 years thats intelligent and insightful. The author has the better part of a grasp upon the Monistic ontology of Greek and Indian metaphysics and the \\"ascent to the One\\" (epistrophe). Noticeably those greats such as Dr. A.K. Coomaraswamy and S. Radhakrishnan loved both Neoplatonism and Indian Advaita metaphysics equally, and in the same par as them is the author of this, Mr. McEvilley. From someone that despises nearly all books as profane trash written by simpleminded fools, let me say this book is not one of them; which is an incredible exception to the rule of modern sophistry and existentialist empiricism.Recommending only 10 books out of over many 1000s I own on being a genuine book upon Metaphysics, this is one of those very few 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaping a Thoughtful Review of This Book","review":"Will result in the use of superlatives.

I was so immensely disappointed with this book that Entertainment Weekly called one of the top books of 2004. The story fell apart mid-way when lazy, bad-intentioned and sloppy American secret service, FBI appeared. The story broke in two -- a story about the immigrants here and their reaction to the US officials -- and a story about the Algerian war. The point of view and story lines became a confused mess. I was SO let down when I realized I was learning less and less about the characters until they simply disappeared. Perhaps the point of the story, but immensely unsatisfying and bewildering to me in so far as established critics raved about the book. I vastly preferred KITE RUNNER -- which I read immediately after this book --on a similiar topic (new Muslim immigrants) but beautifully told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Get Into It","review":"While the first 20 or so pages of Loraine Adams' \\"Harbor\\" had me on the edge of my easy chair, the story seemed to ramble after that and I found it harder and harder to pick up the book. At the start we are enthralled by the story of Aziz, an Algerian illegal immigrant, as he leaps off the boat he stowed away on and swims to the Boston harbor. The tale of his first few days is compelling...after that it seems a miasma of a story of living with characters that we can't really care about. For me, the promise of the beginning was not fulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"Harbor by Lorraine Adams is a mediocre novel that, based on the reviews, appeals to those who believe the government is inept and that illegal immigrants are heroes. The story line jumps around more than a hop scotch player. A similiar effect can be achieved by just taking a handful of words, throwing them up in the air, and letting them fall haphazardly on blank pages. The book has no ending, none whatsoever. The main character, Aziz, just fades into the nowhere like a gunslinger in a spaghetti western. I read this entire trash pile for only one reason and that is to be able write this review in good faith and that requires finishing this snoozer to its miserable end regardless of how painful the experience. Don't believe the hype unless you are a bleeding heart bed wetter. This book is bad, really, really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blindsided","review":"Perhaps it's my age - sixties - but I found this book excessively violent and crude. Many horrendous details were surely not required to give us a \\"true\\" account of the characters' inner lives. I recoiled from the killing by shovel, for example, narrated with gruesome precision. Have we come to this? Am I the only one repelled by such literal trash talk? Is it a form of art or sophistication to think up new ways to write dirty? Are we all so coarsened as to not even comment on the extremes gone to by this author? My copy is in the garbage, as I could not bring myself to donate it to my local public library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I was moved by this novel. I really liked Aziz, the main character, who is a good person who has accidentally lived through awful circumstances. I admire how the illegal (versus the legal) immigrants had to struggle to get to Boston, to live \\"underground\\" and live in basically an alien (to them) world. What strong people, to be able to work long hours, learn English on their own (no cushy ESL classes), and find friendship. I was disappointed to learn about the FBI trailing them, although it made sense. I wanted Aziz to succeed. I wanted Aziz to become a US citizen, because he's a good, hard-working person who deserves it. This is a view into a world that most natural-born Americans do not get to see. It's easy to scoff at people who are not like us, or to wish ill on illegal residents -- but this novel showed me that really, they are much like us and maybe they deserve our consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"This book was difficult to get through - or at least to finish. With such a well written first half it was a shame to see it falter and stutter to its finish (where it sank). Adams seems to have great control of the story of Arab immigrants having a difficult go of life in the U.S., but as soon as the story begins to progress you notice that what you're reading has evolved into an Op Ed piece of sorts.The characters become two dimensional in their actions; and as a reader, I had to read back from the beginning to see if they were fully fleshed out in the first place, (sorry to say they were not). Add bad plotting and shoddy narration and a great story just can't be sustained.Such a shame, this book had such potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and True","review":"I suppose this book really hit home with me in part because I used to know a group of Morrocan immigrants in Boston, and I remember how I felt as an American among them. The author so much captures the actual experiences of these Algerian men in the book that it is stunning, I mean how could she know so much? She must have known some people really well. And the feelings of the American woman living among them also seemed honest and true. The ending is devastating, and seems only too possible in this paranoid age. I can't believe some people didn't give this book five stars. It's the best novel I've read in a long, long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"I won't go into the plot or characters because others have done that already. What I found out, as I was reading HARBOR, is that the author used grammar, syntax and format to brilliantly illustrate cultural differences and the confusion that ensues. Those who want a simple thriller will want to go elsewhere, but those who want a difficult joy should get this book. Please pay attention to the fact (reality) that there are no heroes in this novel. This is what it makes one of the best books I have read in the last year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very moving novel along the lines of kite runner","review":"This novel explores life in Algeria through the eyes of a young refugee who stows away shipboard to seek the American dream. And his experiences in Boston. Intrigue, suspense, really insightful views of our world through the eyes of someone from an alien culture. Our post nine eleven world and reactions to those from an islamic background. How inadequate our understanding of other worlds and cultures is in combating terrorism. I thought it was a totally compelling read and you want to read throuhg to the last page in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book with a Compassionate Message","review":"Harbor begins with an Algerian man who jumps ship in order to live in the United States. He receives help from the local mosque which brings him safety and medical care but also brings him into contact with what could be a terrorist cell. Whether it is true or not, doesn't change the circumstances of what happens. A man who escapes horrible experiences in Algeria finds that the United States is no refuge and he is not treated well. This is a compassionate view of an illegal immigrant who has legitimate reasons to need refuge but finds an unwelcoming US leaves him to others who may not be as friendly as they seem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pauly gives biologists too much credit.","review":"Pauly tries to assign an historical importance to American biologists that simply doesn't exists. He claims that they have significantly influenced American culture, but his examples are narrow in scope and unconvincing. Pauly is a champion of biologists, as you would expect from a historian of biology, but he goes too far. Biologists have largely been a tool in shaping American culture, rather than a motive force as Pauly claims.(The above review was written in 2000. Four years later, I have revised my judgement on Pauly's thesis; biologists have been a force in some significant ways, though perhaps not to the extent Pauly argues. However, this book is too broad to be convincing in its examples, unless the reader already has a moderate grasp of the history of biology in America.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok general reading","review":"This volume is interesting but it tries to cover too much.

Like others, I hope Cross can recapture some of the magic that is so evident in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feel Good Set","review":"If there is one song to buy this album for, it is SAILING. What a haunting, beautiful song. I bought this album on vinyl years ago and it still remains one of my favourites. His career seemed short-lived after rumours of poor concert performances. Who cares, he had some good radio hits. His last hit single in Australia was 'Arthur's Theme' in 1981. You wont find that song on this 1980 album, but you will find other great songs including RIDE LIKE THE WIND and NEVER BE THE SAME. I even love the cover, it has lasted in my mind. Worth adding to any CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut From A Soulful Soft-Rock Artist","review":"Christopher Cross' self-titled debut is a great album, and easily his best. Unlike the ballad-heavy follow-up, ANOTHER PAGE, and the more hard-rock-oriented third album, EVERY TURN OF THE WORLD, this CD is musically varied, moving from the rocker \\"Ride Like The Wind\\", which still gets airplay on some classic rock radio stations, to the dreamy ballad \\"Sailing\\", this album is great for people like myself who are moving away from hard rock towards more melodic sounds. This album may not have been hip, but it's memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best of All Time","review":"Simply put, one of the great pop albums of all time.

The other tracks are good pop tunes and Cross has an A-list of background vocalists including Michael McDonald, Valerie Carter, Don Henley and JD Souther, and quality studio musicians.I enjoy this album but its not a regular on my playlist, but still has merit in the transitional move from disco to melodic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very relaxing and enlightening","review":"Christopher Cross has such a soothing voice, he puts me right to ease in my new Pathfinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured; costs too much","review":"Out of all the available retractable lanyards, I chose this particular gear-retractor because it is shown without split-rings.

It seemed more durable and better made than any other badge reel I had tried. However, the internal spring loaded retention reel started sticking after about 60 days of daily use. Eventually, my ID would hang with more slack than I would like if I weren't careful. One day, I had about 6 inches of unnoticed slack, and my id hooked on a seat belt. When I got out of my car, the ID stuck and the cable popped out of the reel with no way to reinstall it.I have give up on badge reels, and I now just keep my ID in my pocket. I have tried everything and I can't find anything I can wear with business clothes that is in any way durable.

I won't say that it [isn't good at all] because there's a few decent beats throughout the cd. However, the first flaw is that there's only 10 f'in songs and not enough quality to make up for lack of quantity. Second of all, I haven't been a fan of Cappa's lyrics since his appearances on Ghost's first album. I don't know what happened to him but since then he just lost his flow. Unfortunately, it seems that he still hasn't found it. In fact, most of the guests he had on the album (excluding J.D. and Da Brat) sounded better than he did and quite frankly made him sound worse than he already does.

Cappa has been digressing gradually since his show-stealing verses on Ice Cream and Winter Warz. The Pillage was good, but only because of great production from the RZA, not because of the mc rocking the tracks. The Yin and the Yang is not blessed with that production.

You know what to expect as far as production goes on a DT album, and here it gets even rawer and more low-fi...which is kinda cool for me...it sounds like a good demo, maybe recorded with just one or two room mics...cool artwork and packaging as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their most Sinister album","review":"Somewhere between Death metal and Black metal we have Goatlord. High, Low, and utterly bizzare vocals accompany this album. Fenriz's drumming is inventive and while working with other instruments, also ventures on its own and really speaks with it's own voice. Guitarwork is very odd at times, and plays high and low end riffs. The bad production is an advantage I think. It adds to the atmosphere.More playful and experimental than other albums, this is not their best work, which is probably \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" or \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\", but attacks more openly than those two previous albums, that are more subliminal in approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Required reading for a course...now a dust collector","review":"I wouldn't have bought this after skimming it prior to the course.

The reader can access information about signal acquisition, and techniques of signal-averaging and filtering. The most important studies regarding the follow-up of ventricular late potentials in post-acute myocardial infarction, comparisons with EP invasive tests and other diagnostic methods are extensively explored and illustrated. The authors invite experts in cardiology-related areas of HRECG to compose each chapter and dissect the subject thoroughly. I strongly recommend this book to practitioners who wants to learn about the subject as well as those who needs information about diagnostic importance of this method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite happy.","review":"The product received is new as stated.

Your basic manga. Nanako Momoi may have been cute on the outside, but she is anything but cute on the inside. And once inside Akira Uehara's body it turns out she prefers being a boy! And what's worse is she seems to be better at being a boy than she was at being a girl.Akira Uehara is also having mixed feelings. On one hand he is now trapped in her body. On the other hand he is trapped in the body of a petite and adorable girl he had a crush on. And it seems he is ALSO better at being a girl than HE was being a boy.Things get WEIRD after that, but you'll have to buy the book to figure it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Gender Bender","review":"Your and My Secret is a great manga. It's some of the best gender bending I've seen in a manga and it features a truly unique plot with interesting characters. Of all the manga I've read, this is one of the few titles that actually makes me laugh out loud over and over again. It's just that funny.My original review erroneously rated this manga low, because of ADV Manga's dropping of the title. To me, that rendered the one volume they had published to be a bad purchase, over all. I mean, who wants to buy the first volume of a series they'll never see the rest of?That said, the title has since been picked up by Tokyopop... Who released a few more volumes and then closed their doors. Is this series cursed or something? Will it EVER see a conclusion? Who knows?So keep that in mind if you buy this - There may never be an ending to this series in the US. However, if you can get your hands on the volumes that HAVE been released, I promise you'll enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better than The Herbfarm Cookbook","review":"I have both of Traunfeld's cookbooks. I have had great success with the Herbfarm Cookbook, and did not think that there could be a better effort, but the Herbal Kitchen is even better. They are different books and I will use both, but the Herbal Kitchen includes more fabulous dishes that you can put together on a weeknight. The Herbfarm Cookbook is a much more thorough compendium of recipies and herb growing/properties information. Get them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best cookbooks published with simple recipes!","review":"I have a bookcase full of great cook books. This is one of the best I have ever used because the recipes are simple and so full of flavor and one is better the next.

Nevertheless, I have borrowed this book (old edition/hardcover) from the University library and I thought that buying it was worthwile.When I ordered the book I found out that the book quality was even worse than expected. The typesetting is worse than a photocopied book; I even thought that this was not an authentic copy but a cheap one from a Banana country. Nevertheless, when you open to read the book pages are coming out. The hardcover edition price -$300$- is ridiculous. I am a postoctoral fellow in engineering and I cannot afford more than $100 for a book. The $80 dollar price is not justified for that bad typesetting. This is a very helpful book for a graduate engineering student but I doubt that I will recommend it for buying. I will have to think seriously about buying another book from Wiley piblishers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!

If you have seen the series from start to finish I'm sure you have just as I have grown to truly care what happens to Kiba and the rest like Tsume, Toboe, Hige, Blue, and some of the other characters of the series. The few episodes to the finale are some of the most heart-aching scenes to watch and made me want to punch some of the people who decided this finale for the series. I don't want to give to much away for first time viewers of the series but I can tell you that even watching the final episodes over again you'll still shed a tear for what happens. That said the series regardless would be a great collection to any anime fans library and for the price well worth it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strained, Not Funny","review":"I love funny books. I enjoy satire. What a disappointment this one is. The author really tries but consistently misses. Add to that, there is not one sympathetic character in it. Even a little sympathetic. I wanted to laugh, but the laughs were not there."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way to treat your intelligent audience","review":"Big disappointment. It reads as if the author, having gotten this great IDEA for a novel--and it IS a great idea--spent a few days jotting it down and sold it. If the plot were brilliant, you might forgive the implausible characters. If the characterizations were illuminating, you might forgive the implausible plot. If the prose were fantastically witty you might forgive everything. But *No Way* falls short by every measure. I picked it up because Buckley's essays in *Wry Martinis* are funny and smart. Wish I'd stuck to his essays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Any first lady deserves better","review":"Technically well written. Tightly crafted sentences, good vocabulary, good grammer. I'm sorry I can't think of any more kind words. I was vastly disappointed. The characters, while easily identifiable, were card board cutouts without a whiff of the complexity of the characters they were based upon. The writing style is cynical, vulgar, crass. I love well written, compassionate, mysteries of life in Washington, the nuances of political life, and legal thrillers. I couldn't get beyond chapter two of this unfortunate parody. Which is too bad, as the basic premise is exceedingly good. In the right hands it would make a hilarious, charming, fascinating mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way to Treat a Reader","review":"Vulgar-filled story about a First Lady accused of assassinating her adulterous husband.

I'm a big fan of Christopher Buckley- he takes witty political satire and turns it into an engaging novel. I highly recommend No Way To Treat a First Lady in addition to Little Green Men and Thank You for Not Smoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grab your tin pan & chisel!!","review":"I eagerly bought this novel expecting his well-worded wit to keep me laughing from beginning to end. Not so. I gave up somewhere around chapter 21. There is only so much a man can take. I now know what gold-miners went through in the 1800's! Tedious, laborious work that only produces a few nuggets. Life is too short. For example, Christopher's use of the word \\"delicious\\" to describe a scene was hilarious the first time around. The second time, the word lost its original luster. The third time, I wished he hadn't used it the first time.Another reason I quit reading the book is that the plot is not strong enough to hold my interest without his steady dose of barbs...Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and fun","review":"The ridiculous spectacle of the \\"trial-of-the-millennium\\" is not far from today's reality. Its easy to be jaded these days, so it's quite refreshing to step back and laugh a bit. Laugh-out-loud funny and a fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"political satire at its funniest","review":"Political Satire is always a difficult genre to shine in. Too often have I found myself in the midst of a medicre, boring plot. Not so with \\"No Way to Treat a First Lady\\". The combination Political Satire/Thriller is not only laugh out loud funny, but goes far deeper than what's on the page.Buckley exploits our deep-seated cynicism for today's political leaders with a character base that is at once seriously funny and strangely familiar-- from the lecherous president to the assertive first lady (dubbed Lady Bethmac), to the lovably seedy lawyer, Boyce Baylor.Not only is this novel funny, but engaging; once started, it is difficult to put down. I found myself eager to find out--- was she *really* guilty of murder?To give away anymore would be to spoil a brilliant book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I enjoyed this fast-paced send-up of the Washington establishment, the media, and the legal profession. Buckley's satire is sharp and on-target as he follows the \\"trial of the century\\" and makes this book somewhat of a legal thriller. It kept me guessing.The political humor is terrific but I did find that some of it was repetitive. I do not need to be hit over the head repeatedly to \\"get\\" something. I also think that the book could have been just as funny had he not made so many errors of fact regarding the workings of the law.The dialogue is really funny and the plot is plausible even as it went over the top and ventured into absurdity. It's a smallish book with not a lot of unnecessary padding.Buckley kept me laughing and engaged. I love the way he coins words, such as \\"credibilobotomy\\". He is a very clever writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"But A Great Way To Treat A Reader","review":"Mr. Buckley's book is an exercise in political absurdity. The author has a knack for taking urban myths and stepping them up to the next level of ridiculousness. As usual, Washington D.C. is the setting and morally challenged characters are sprinkled throughout. The reader knows almost from page one that the likeable protagonists will probably go scot-free, but how Mr. Buckley resolves this issue is the major reason I like reading his work. There were enough twists and turns to keep me guessing until the end. A mixture of brainy satire and street-smart shenanigans makes it a comical and satisfying read. This is not Shakespeare, but simply great fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot outline, poorly executed","review":"The plot outline is good, but it's poorly executed.Once the author thinks he has a funny idea, he repeats it several times since we weren't bright enough to get it the first time.The trial is out of order -- Buckley has the prosecution and defense call witnesses almost in random order. Judges would not need to recuse themselves because they were appointed by the victim's predecessor. The Perry Mason TV series didn't have \\"trials,\\" but preliminary hearings.The characters are largely one-dimensional, and the writing style is a bit silly.These might be overlooked, but in his Acknowledgements, Buckley claims he had the help of several \\"distinguished attorneys,\\" plus \\"a peerless editor,\\" and \\"the keen eyes of Gregory Zorthian and William F. Buckley Jr.,\\" AND a relentless and superb fact checker. In other words, Christopher Buckley had to work fairly hard to produce the merely-mediocre execution of what could have been a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Not Quite Sure Why I Enjoyed This Book","review":"I have greatly enjoyed Christopher Buckley's books, particularly God Is My Broker, which I consider his best. This book did not have the same lethal wit. The humor seemed downright subdued, so I'm not really quite sure why I enjoyed the book. I am an attorney, and there was something very true-to-life about the book's details---minutely scrutinizing the jury's reactions, making the events fit into a predetermined theory, the legal plotting and strategy. Plus, every time you think you know what is going to happen, the author throws in a 180 degree plot turn. It made the book very hard to put down, if not a little annoying. Overall, it was amusing, but light-weight reading, better than the works of many authors, but not his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitting for the Film!","review":"The score in and of itself is very unique in that it blends the rythem of the time (1692 Salem, Mass.) and the feel of the culture into one pot. Its a very acceptional score and Fenton's work fits the film amazingly! If you like period scores this is a must buy as it will remind much of 17th century New England with a little bit of an erie side to it. I give it a thumbs up as it is a well composed score and AN EVEN MORE AWESOME PLAY/MOVIE! Check that out too.

It was the first time that we had used this product and I found the smell to be very strong. After I sprayed him down he was drooling very badly, was very lethargic and couldn't seem to control his bladder. I consulted our vet who advised me to immediately wash him with Dawn dishsoap and next time to use any other product besides this one.

The puzzles range from easy to challenging and I am sure there are still some things I did not figure to do the first time I played!GRAPHICS/MUSICThe graphics are pretty good, though most of the action is seen in cartoon drawings rather than in actual action.

My girls are all grown up, in their 30's and I'm 58. I still like the music, am getting the cd for my nephew who doesn't have a turntable or cassette player in his house. I made cassette copies for my children when they were young so they could play without touching the \\"off-limits\\" turntable. The music is timeless and enjoyable for adults. The engineering is far better than most engineering of any but classical recordings today, and the sound is rich. Most children's music is poorly engineered, only adequately performed and woefully un-inspired. \\"In Harmony\\" is a notable exception. If I could only have one children's record in my collection, this would be the one. By the way, I think I paid more than this for the LP, and I think gasoline was 32 cents at the time, so this is a real value."},{"rating":"2","title":"some VERY good tracks, some VERY bad tracks","review":"This is a strange album in that \\"when it is good, it is very very good, and when it is bad, it is horrid\\".I absolutely love tracks 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 11, and 12.

And the Doobies are heavenly on track 1.That said, I absolutely hate tracks 4, 7, and 10.

When my father was cleaning out the record shelves he handed it over to me, knowing that I would cherish it. I still do to this day. I'd have to say the Doobie Brothers did an excellent job with my favorite children's story. All in all this album is one you'll keep picking up. If you were a child listening to it, you'll still listen to it to this day like I do. If you're a first time parent and want great songs that don't sound cutesy-wootsy this is it.

It is definitely music for the entire family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational Sesame Street","review":"I first found this album when I was a college student in the late 80's, and I loved it. I even took it in to one of my classes (children' lit.) because we had read the \\"Pajamas\\" storybook, and I wanted to share the song! The CD was stolen from me when my apartment was broken into, and it is one of the few that I made sure to replace. My favorite song - although it's hard to pick just one - is \\"Share\\" with Ernie and Cookie Monster. How funny is that when Ernie says, \\"What do you think we've been singing about?\\" and Cookie Monster says, \\"Me don't know...me no listen!\\" This is a great CD for kids of all ages that I'm positive you'll enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"When I was younger I had the casette recording of this album. I listened to it so many times I actually wore the tape so thin you could hear both sides (A and B) at the same time. I've been looking at second hand shops for this album ever since, I never imagined it was still being made. Every single song on this album is bound to become a family favorite. Just because songs are safe for kids to listen to doesn't mean they have no use for adults. There are some beautiful love songs on this album. Stereotypical children's songs get old fast.

Good orchestras and soloists perform the nineteen well-chosen chamber works, ranging from the deceptively simple \\"Prelude in C\\" from \\"The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1\\" (Sviatoslav Richter, piano) to selections from the powerful Brandenburg Concertos.This is Bach in his most serene, mathematically perfect form. None of his mighty organ or choral works will disturb your contemplative mood as you drift through the sixty-eight minutes of this CD.I'm usually asleep by track fifteen, the adagio from \\"Concerto for Flute, Violin & Harpsichord BWV 1044.\\"Another very good CD in this 'relaxation' series from BMG RCAVictor is \\"Cello for Relaxation.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best effort","review":"I didn't fall in love with this effort by Jobim. The orchestral arrangements are a tad cliche and more than a tad predictable. The mix is off throughout much of the album and jobim's tired scatting gets swallowed up in the constant over-dramatized string crescendos.

This record is one of the gemstones of all kinds of music , this is the record that should be protected and kept in MOMa or Washington or better in Taj Mahal because this monument of love is similar to this record. I have all jobim records, but this one.... Two kites on the sky and you'll feel like a high school boy, double rainbow and literally you,ll find the treasure but not on one side but on both sides.

I bought some 5 1/8 by 5 1/8 inch very smooth, inside and out, like with a sheen that repels dirt and (crucial!) the edge where the CD is inserted has no roughness, no roughness at all. Now where did I get these sleeves? That's the question. Been using and reusing them for years. But these? Maybe to give with a CD or DVD enclosed to someone who will then download CD and toss the cover. But no use if needed for regular storage. The first sleeve I bought scratched the first CD I put in it the very first time. All those firsts added up to one big last time I buy this size!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Call","review":"This book frustrated me. The heroine, Emma, is constantly jumping to negative conclusions about the hero, even though she is represented as a level-headed person not given to listening to gossip. She is constantly scolding him for imagined faults and I honestly couldn't read a few of the conversations between them, because she looks so rude and foolish. I couldn't imagine what he saw in her.To be fair, he does seem awfully coarse in the first chapter, but this is completely at odds with his character throughout the rest of the book and with his apparently chivalrous nature.It is one of the old-fashioned style novels in which there is misunderstanding and tension until three pages from the end of the book when suddenly new information is revealed, declarations are made and all is well."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I love this product.

Wanting to explore the \\"punk rock\\" and 80s synth-rock scenes is no crime, but her selection of songs is erratic and her vocals are really disappointing, especially her imitation of Janis Joplin on the interminably long IN PAIN. THEM sounds like a Devo reject and THE DESERT rips off her own \\"Memorial Day\\" from her far superior SPY.Her big hit, JESSE, is passable but nowhere near the quality of previous or future singles. COME UPSTAIRS is an engaging opener, but there are no real WOW moments.Producer Mike Manieri should've examined the material more carefully.

It is a fast read, it is also cartoonish, and the legal parts of it are stuff and nonsense.It is extraordinarily difficult to write a legal thriller and a sitcom at the same time, and Levine proves the difficulty by failing to pull it off.The fact that it is popular is no surprise. Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the public. Of course, being a solo practitioner in the field of criminal and divorce law, my viewpoint might be somewhat different.Kreeger is a watered down Hannibal Lecter, (all fava beans no chianti), and the plot isn't Cape Fear,it's more like Cape Feh! Solomon's father is a borscht belt sketch, and his love interest is more Victor than Victoria.If you're waiting at the imaging center for a colonoscopy, this will help pass the time.

The book is listed for 4 to 6 year olds, but it uses words like hopeless, drastic, astonished, ridiculous, and dwindled. The language used just seems a little advanced. She also was bothered by the monsters calling the \\"paci\\" a \\"noo-noo\\".The thing that really bothered me about the book was the granny was so negative! She says, \\"he (Marlon) looks ridiculous with that STUPID big thing stuck in this mouth all the time.\\" I don't know about you, but we try not to call anything stupid in our home.

However, it's censored a little, which can be a bad thing at some times. Its censorship doesn't completely take away from the overall story, though. In fact it is censored very little. There's nothing wrong with it. In fact, if you've seen the videos of the original Dragon Ball, this is much better in that it isn't censored even half as much, as the videos were heavily edited. This is a great book, and a must-have for Dragon Ball or DBZ fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"How it all began","review":"If you love the DBZ series and wish to know more about how it all began, this is a book to get. The book tells you how they all met each other. It seems that the original DB is more comical than the DBZ series. The book contains minor sexist language, so it isn't a good idea to buy this, if you intend to purchase it for a very young audience. Other than that, it is better to read the manga than watching the MAJOR edited version of the DVD boxed-set.I am looking forward to obtaining the whole DB manga once all comes out.The book reads from back to front.

I don't know anything about Dragon Ball, other than what they show on TV (Nick & Cartoon Network). The show seems to be harmless so I assumed the book would be, too. Since I'm unfamiliar with the original series I was unaware that the book is for ages 13 & up. Plus, the picture posted doesn't show this on the cover. Thumbing through I found references to touching breasts (34-C specifically) & taking off girls panties. While this is fine for an older audience, I don't feel it's appropriate for a 9 year old.

Lee has many friends in the music business and has collected in this album some real gems from artists who, while not exactly mainstream, will mostly be familiar to blues afficianados. The basis for the selections is, first and foremost, the quality of the recordings, as the intended purpose of these discs was to demonstrate high-end audio systems. For this reason, most of the recordings feature somewhat simple arrangements that are recorded without a lot of processing or dubbing. The sound from this disc, especially on a nice system, is rich, detailed, and three-dimensional, making it a nice addition to any collection, and an especially good disc for showing off a system's timbral balance and depth.

If you want to be moved by poetry, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating topic ruined by lousy writing","review":"The situations and people discussed in the book are really fascinating, if you can get past the irritating writing. The author seems more interested in making the reader believe how smart he is (a chunk of the first chapter is about how he's written other books) than in informing the reader about this complex topic. That said, if you can tolerate the writing style the topic is very interesting and it's worth reading for the a neat peek into the largely-unknown world of pediatric cardiac surgery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great without the vulgar profanity","review":"I found the book extremely interesting but could not get past the horrible swearing. It wasn't the occasional d word, but much worse and vulgar swear words that I found very offensive. For me it really took away from the story. Reality doesn't need to be peppered with vulgarity to be effective, it doesn't make it any more intense or scary. It was interesting to see another family's journey with TGA, ours was much different, unfortunately I gave up trying to wade through the muck and quit reading after the 3rd chapter. So for those of you who find profanity offensive, watch out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This book is a must read for everyone, especially those parents, friends, and family of children/adults that were born with a congenital heart defect.

My daughter is treated at the Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital and while Dr. Mee is no longer there, she is in great hands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bittersweet","review":"This was the most beautiful book that I have ever read. This is a book that anyone can appreciate. Even those people without a child with a CHD. I would encourage everyone to read it. Dr Mee, his fellow Dr's, and his staff did so much good for people. Even if, in the end, the child didn't make it. I laughed, I cried, This book has it all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No divine powers, just attention to detail","review":"Roger Mee, the surgeon profiled in this very well-researched and well-written book, would be the first to tell you that he possesses no divine powers. As he stresses, and author Ruhlman emphasizes, the craft of surgery is in attention to detail. An interesting contrast is drawn between Mee, who strikes the reader as very down-to-earth, and a brilliant but difficult intern, who (after this book was published) took his own life.The book also contains excellent portraits of Mee's surgical nurse, the difficulties facing anesthesiologists when working with 5-pound neonates, and is very sensitive to the awful, gut-wrenching torment suffered by the new parents, who would rather be anywhere than inside a pediatric ICU.Ruhlman is at his best when writing about how difficult it is to do things right, as in his other great book \\"Wooden Boats.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"took me back","review":"I had a personal stake in reading the book: Dr. Mee did surgery on my son several years ago. Anyone who has been through serious health experiences with their children will find this book gripping. I daresay even thouse who haven't been through such an experience will find the book hard to put down due to the excellent portraits of both medical personnel and families of patients."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously funny, dark comedy","review":"Seems to be a very true-to-life portrayal of life in a body rub parlor. The movie tries not to be judgemental about the work these women do, but does present it from their point of view. A lot of daily challenges, of going far enough without going too far, keeping it legal, etc.Don McKellar was brilliant as the nerdy manager of the parlor, who seemed to be in way over his head with this job. He gradually got very good at this job in a big way.There's a very twisted humorous ending that came out of nowhere. Extremely imaginative. It sort of kept true to the nature of these people, where nothing is as it seems on the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah...","review":"Okay, I typed into the search engine on Amazon, \\"Massage Therapy Ethics.\\" This popped up (no pun intended). I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I'm sure it's a fabulous b-movie semi-soft core production. However, as a licensed massage therapist--I want to scream, \\"Nooooooooooo!\\" I guess, take it for what it is, but don't ever schedule an appointment with me or any other licensed professional and expect those outfits, or that behavior. To the filmaker--do a little research that doesn't involve prostitutes or pimps, and you might actually learn something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"One of the best books I've read in years.Simonton does a great job of linking old and new ideas into something meaningful. He references many known and reliable studies to prove out his points. He also assumes that the reader has a good background knowledge on related issues, so he doesn't belabor things that we already know.Due to the complexity of the topic, it is very detailed. I wouldn't really describe it as a recreational read, but it is well work the effort. You'll be surprised and challenged by the things you'll learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book, Limited Scope But Thorough","review":"I recently have read several books on this topic. This was quite thorough. Any topic he covered, he covered in detail. You will here learn a lot about the subject of the genius and the various strategies that are used by them. You learn that the most successful approach is to create many work products instead of nurturing a few ones to absolute perfection.This book is quite interesting and a good read but it's not a great read because it does not really give you that many \\"a-hah\\" moments. A lot of the insights are pretty pedestrian and you will not feel when you are done that you have really made any breakthroughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and boring","review":"The subject matter is quite interesting, but no tangible Darwinian perspective of creativity emerges from this book. Apart from that, this stuff is so interesting that one could make the book a real page-turner (think Dawkins or Simon Singh). While this work is slow, repetitive and ultimately dissatisfying. And inconclusive, too: all these lists of geniuses do not supply any real, verifyable statistic data.Worth to leaf through, but not much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical and to the point","review":"I came upon this book after making 23 drama videos for autistic teenagers. Recently we looked at producing a day-in-the-life type documentary with cutaways of professionals commenting on the activities. I honestly found this book to be a mine of information. Almost any question I found myself raising was addressed in some form in this book. Consequently structuring the doucmentary in terms of narrative, visual arrangement, verisimilitude, camera and sound has become clearer.I would have liked the chapters on the Documentary Idea and Writing the Documentary to be longer. Personally, I would have benefited more from extending the discussions here. Also the author tends to drive the book along at a fiercely anecdotal rate which is great if you can imagine yourself in the author's shoes, but may not suit everyone's style.Overall I found this to be a most useful manual and certainly find myself returning to it for advice. What better recommendation can I offer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Confidence","review":"This is a very useful and also a very practical book. It goes into all details you would like to know more about. And it is very easy to read and understand (for someone from the continent). We never did any documentary work (we always did animation) but our first documentary is one of more than an hour. That doesn't say much of the quality of the documentary but this book gave us atleast the confidence to undertake such a task."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall. Could have been shorter.","review":"Overall, this book is really great. One of the best things about this book is that it offers valuable insight for every reader--no matter how involved with video production they may be. If I take one thing from this book, its the importance of keeping the documentary VISUAL. After devoting an entire chapter on the subject, Hampe continues to drill that fact into the reader's mind. It really stresses the importance of having visual \\"evidence\\" to show instead of the dreadful \\"talking heads\\" telling you about the visuals you should be seeing.Overall a great book. I give it a 4 out of 5 simply because it could have been a little shorter making it less repetitive towards the end.Still, a great read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All over the place","review":"I felt like I was back at UNCA in a Theory class. This guy was all over the place with his ideas and often repeated them. This book is old, refering to high 8 video as the best available. He wrote this before the boom of reality on TV. There's no good outlines of what to do and not do, how to set up interveiws, shots or anything of that matter. It's full of ludicrous examples that extend to great, uneccessary links. I hate this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend this seller.","review":"I ordered the book \\"Making Documentary Films and Reality Videos\\" and I never received it. I contacted the seller a week after it was supposed to arrive and then again a few days after that. The seller never even replied. The least they could have done was writte a simple 2-sentence reply to pretend as if they were going to try and fix the problem. If you have other choices, don't pick this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written verbose book","review":"This book has very little content. The author spends more time discussing the cosmetics of documentary filmmaking than content. It is repetitive, random and disorganized. There are a few gems of wisdom, but they are hard to find.

Of course, the icing on the cake was when he re-created the role on the new H5) in 2012."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five-O Starting To Show Its Age","review":"The 8th season of Five-O is pretty good but is starting to slip, compared to the earlier years.There's a great double-length episode featuring Wo Fat to kick off the set but there are also several rather silly, implausible stories.One in particular, 'The Case Against McGarrett', has an inane plot and worse acting, particularly by the absurdly miscast Harold Gould reprising his role as a crime boss.On the plus side, the video quality is excellent.Five-O fans should enjoy this set but casual viewers should probably stick to the earlier seasons, especially Season One."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Actor and Series","review":"I am a Huge fan of Jack Lord and Hawaii 5-0. I can't wait for season 9 thru 12 to come out. I am enjoying all eight seasons I have so much. So if you are a fan of either Jack Lord or Hawaii 5-0 you have got to get this. The dvd's are great, picture color great, sound great. This is a 5 star, so if you are buying this I know you will enjoy it.

Whilst I expected import tax I also expected Amazon to pay the correct postage but they didn't and I was charged about 9 or 15 dollars by the Royal Mail. Very shoddy service from Amazon. Will not buy from them again.That said after watching earlier series (seasons) of Hawaii five-o I thought the quality might have lessened. However, the US Coast Guard is involved showing spectacular scenery. With regard to the film used even the first season looks like it was filmed yesterday unlike the grainy black and white rubbish from the UK.

Other than that, a great, attention-grabbing timepiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic watch, indestructibility on your wrist!","review":"I looked at a lot of divers watches, but the Citizen is the one I took home. Yes, it's large and a little heavy, but that just adds to the air of being a professional dive watch ... almost old school like the deep sea divers emblem on the rear of the case. The lume is great and you can see every number clearly. My lume glows all night long. Accuracy? What can I say? I average plus 1 second a month or 12 seconds a year! Take that mechanical watches.

I wish I had bought it sooner ! The cons are minor at best and the watch just works. It will partially charge under flourescent lights as well (in the office) All in all, a real bargain!

Absence of noise does not equal good sound quality! Poorly done noise filtering also removes a part of the original signal and distorts piano sound, which becomes thin, tinny, nuanceless, and unrealistic. This undercuts Schnabel's achievement. Much better quality versions are available.Good labels for historical recordings: Pearl (noisy, but preserves piano sound), Naxos (less noisy), ...

The tale twists and weaves a lot due to a mulitude of characters introduced. Many of the characters are implausible and the book has to contrive various unconvincing vignettes around them to knit them into the story. My general reaction was that the reader was introduced to too many points of view which weren't prioritised and as the book draws to a conclusion I began asking myself who cares? Also there is an annoying habit throughout of introducing the criminals in short conversatiosn without their identifying names. They usually hint at violence to come, but at the end of the book I wondered why they were there at all, since their roles are both thin and thinly described. I agree entirely with the reviewers who wrote that the book took too long to read. It is not a page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"something is missing","review":"This book has brilliant and beautiful moments. It has all the ingredients to make it a book I could love: art, history, Italy, mystery, small towns. Writing is very good. Yet, it just did not all come together for me. There was just nothing to hold it all. I was having hard time identifying with any of the characters - they all seemed sketchy and remote. They lacked warmth of real people. Art and history provided just some fragments of the background, never being explored enough to become interesting.Given all that, the plot itself was not interesting enough, and mystery not much of a mystery. I did not find myself wanting to go back to reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waking Raphael","review":"This book got such high reviews from everyone else, that I was really excited to read it.

There is just enough history and spirit sightings noted to spark curiosity. The chapter on Jack the Ripper describes exact locations, and short descriptions of his murders. There are well drawn maps for each tour. I'm the type that likes to read before sleep, and have a variety of books I am halfway thru to pick from depending on my mood.

The other is by show writer Jane Espenson, set in 6th season there is some time travel back to late third season and it is better than some of the episodes that actually were aired.

The progression of the grammar points leaves a lot to be desired. Basically it is a poor or rather frustrating course if you are an absolute beginner.I am glad I didn't buy this book but rather rented it from the library.But I would say that it would be great for someone with previous knowledge of Swedish because the dialogs would be good listening practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"To advance","review":"This is far to advance for a beginners level.

The supposed \\"Digital Remaster\\" is less than spectacular, probably refering to the fact that any DVD is a digital format. Still an okay value for the dollar I paid for it. Prirates of the Black Hawk is certainly rare, but the detail is below average, color is faded, and the sound recieved no restoration.

Clark and Lex falls for this Spanish teacher (although there is nothing really amazing like special powers through kryptonite to get everyone to fall for her), and have Clark (who is hopelessly in love with Lana) fall for her is unbelievable. Having built up Clark's strength of character to have him go after his Spanish teacher, despite the way he feels about Lana, is unbelievable.

Fourteen out of the eighteen numbers are fronted by the underrated Mr. Eberle, showing off why he was voted #1 vocalist in the early 1940's, even beating out Frank Sinatra. This disc has good \\"realistic\\" sound quality, and a great selection of mellow classics. Except for one, \\"Moonlight Becomes You\\" which is sung by Skip Nelson. Yikes!!! Blow your nose before you sing man! Well let's just say, he's no Ray. Anyway, why can't these compilations of old 78's have a few more seconds between them? Essentially we have a bunch of singles all crammed together, so why not let them have some breathing room. As I recall, the UK Beatles albums from 1963-1966 had a seven second break between songs.

I've never been a \\"Lincoln Portrait\\" fan, or enamored of any symphonic works with spoken voice. But Schwantner's piece is an unforgettable exception. The ratio of music to words (about 5/1) is about right. Vernon Jordon's rendition of King's immortal words is profoundly moving, ten times better than Raymond Bazemore's attempt with James DePreist and the Oregon Symphony on Koch. I played Jordon's version, with reverence, as my own private ceremony for this 4th of July, 1999. This piece of Schwantner's should be played in every school.As for the percussion concerto, it is very good and well played, but hard to get into. The slow movement is a bit overextended.

The reason I am rating this CD low is because of the horrendous editing job on \\"Velocities.\\" But that's also a good reason to listen to it! If you do a lot of recording and editing, this is a great example of how not to edit. If you listen with headphones, you can hear a lot of jumpy cuts (maybe all of them). Since the piece is very repetitive in spots, you can even hear where they looped passages several times. Now I'm not against editing, just make sure you do a good job so no one notices! Shame on either the producer or editor, or engineer or Evelyn. I'm not sure who is responsible for this hack job.

It's in this Soundtrack","review":"I am a broadway musical/theater buff and was fortunate enough to see Chicago in previews (a friend who's a publicist got me the tickets). I was blown away by the visual and audio greatness of this musical and rushed out to buy the CD. I was not disappointed. This is one instance where the actors complimented the work being performed, the actor's voices were absolutely right for the roles they were playing and the CD was a symphonic completion of the experience. At night, I drop the CD in the player, hit the repeat button and is immediately carried away to a place where \\"piano's hot\\" and Bebe's voice is at its most expressive. Buy this CD! It's a keeper!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"I have never heard any other version. I was staying with my Aunt in Phoenix, Arizona and she took me to Chicago. My very first musical. From then on I have fallen in love with musicals, they are spectacular! I love this CD. As I said I haven't heard any other version but I am totally satified with this cd and would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"bebe neuwirth razzle dazzles 'em","review":"After seeing the show in London, I bought the 1996 Broadway revival recording because I am large fan of Bebe Neuwirth. She absolutely shines on this recording and was well deserving of her Tony Award for her portrayal of Velma Kelly.As for Ann Reinking, well...the casting directors could have done better. MUCH better. I don't care for her voice too much, but after awhile it grew on you, whether you liked it or not. However, it was her presence that made me give this CD four stars instead of five.James Naughton and Joel Grey lend good support to a talented ensemble. My personal favorites were \\"Cell Block Tango\\", \\"I Can't Do It Alone\\", \\"When Velma Takes The Stand\\", and one of the best opening numbers in the history of musical theatre: \\"All That Jazz\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 1997 Tony Award Winning revival","review":"The whole cast is sensational, and even in 1975 this was a hot, tough, cynical show. It was a hit then but these days its a smash. The Kander and Ebb songs are great and generally well-performed by the cast. It's a much more complete reading of the score than the 1975 Original Broadway cast (on Arista, with Gwen Verdon & Chita Rivera) but the earlier recording has just a tad more spark to it. Either way you can't go wrong with this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHICAGO VOCALLY DISSAPPOINTING!!!!","review":"After listening to this soundtrack, I thought one thing. That is that the dancing in this show must be amazing because the singing sure isn't. Just goes to show that much like movies today, broadway is willing to award accolades based on production values rather than content. I believe that it is vitally important that Ann Reinking pass on the Fosse style to another generation of dancers, but whoever is letting her sing should be shot!Bebe Newirth is fantastic as always, but after hearing her on other recordings, one has to wonder whether the affectations she uses to make her voice sound 'sexy' are helping or hindering the cause.If your looking for great singing and a tuneful broadway score try Candide (1997), Sideshow (1997), or even Titanic (1997). These are all feast for the ears.....Chicago is merely an appetizer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the MOVIE soundtrack instead","review":"I was introduced to this exceptional musical thanks to the incredible film version currently in theatres... I purchased this to hear the cut songs... which are interesting - but it really isn't worth it.This wreck features the worst vocals i have ever heard on a CAST RECORDING. The chorus is a joke. This stands out on the destroyed \\"Cell Block Tango\\" amongst other group numbers. As Velma, Bebe is a cute novelty - she's just okay. As Roxie - Anne Reinking is tragic - she destroys the show, and at the age of at least 90 Joel Grey is a pathetic choice for Roxie's husband. Stay far away from this album (just download the cut songs) and purchase the beautiful Chicago FILM soundtrack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar and degrading to the human soul","review":"I found it shocking that music like this could ever become so popular. Saw the show on broadway, finding it very distasteful and wondering how low American popular culture can get in its taste and class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orginal or Crispy","review":"Having seen the orginal Broadway production 24 years ago, I am a little partial to that recording. However, after hearing the merits of this new recording I can see merits in both recordings. Going to see the new production in June so maybe that will change my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST!!!","review":"I won 2 free tickets to Chicago the musical and now i realise how lucky i was. I wouldn't go if it wasn't for those tickets, as i'm not a real musicals fan.But i fell in love with it when i heard the first words of\\"All that jazz\\".It truly is the greatest musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be so harsh on Ann","review":"I understand that many of you who have bought this CD will be Broadway lovers (and I am one myself)and you will be used to the lead roles having amazing powerful voices. But just as important as good singing is good acting. I think that Ann interpreted Roxie as a wannabe who had the enthusiasm but lacked the talent, which makes her raspy tones and sing-speak completely plausible. It also supports the theme that you can use other things than talent to get yourself to the top This may not be the way you like Roxie played, but you shouldn't shun Ann's interpretation. It's a good thing if there is more than one way of having a character played, I think so anyway.Personally I love the Miramax film, but I enjoy comparing these 2 and seeing the differences."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"My first time in New York (a couple of days ago)...I saw 'Chicago' on Broadway - it was great ... I bought the soundtrack there for [price] ... much more expensive than anywhere else -- but it was definitely worth it! I have been listening to it every day since...'All That Jazz' of course is a classic ... 'We Both Reached For the Gun' is a great song to sing along with ... 'Razzle Dazzle 'Em' is another ... I love them all!If you're ever in New York ... SEE THE SHOW ... if not -- BUY THE SOUNDTRACK!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think that this is a killer cd, it remindes me of new york","review":"this cd is so cabaret.its great,its wild,stunning, dangerous, and hilarious all at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"To start: I DETEST MUSICAL THEATER. When my friend dragged me kicking and screaming to the West Coast premiere of \\"CHICAGO,\\" I looked for any excuse not to go. Man, I was more than a little surprised at how much I actually enjoyed myself. Jasmine Guy gave a terrific performance and I found myself during intermission purchasing this CD. THIS CD IS DEFINATELY A WISE PURCHASE FOR ANYONE WHO HAS SEEN THE PRODUCTION OR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO. My favorites, just for the heck of it, is \\"Cell Block Tango,\\" \\"All That Jazz,\\" and \\"Razzle Dazzle.\\" (Admittedly, the three most famous songs from \\"CHICAGO.\\") I even catch myself humming them while I am stuck in traffic on the 405, in spite of myself. One more bit of praise, Bebe Neuwirth's singing will have you looking at \\"CHEERS'\\" Lilith in a whole new light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply The Best!","review":"This recording of Chicago is by far the best of all recordings! I personally have never seen the musical, but was intrigued by the story and so bought this album. I have never heard anything so fantastic in my life!The music is amazing, with the lyrics telling the entire story - very useful if you haven't seen the production!The cast is spectacular: Bebe Neuwrith does a fantastic job of Velma, with excellent perfomances from everyone - however, the best performance is obviously from the amazingly talented Ann Reinking, who shines as Roxie Hart. Ann's intriguing voice tops off the whole album, as always!I DEFINATELY recommend this album to EVERYONE! You will love all the songs, especially I think 'Cell Block Tango', 'All That Jazz', We Both Reached For The Gun' and, above all, thanks to Ann Reinking, 'Roxie'. 5 Stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicago Shot Down!","review":"I bought this CD in hopes of an awesome recording of Kander and Ebb's \\"Chicago\\", but what I got was less than mediocre. When I hear Bebe Neuwirth as Velma, I don't picture the sexy night club singer/murderess, but Bebe singing like Bebe. Ann Reinking plays Roxie Hart....She tends to speak (quite gravely and breathy) throughout many of the songs which is very disappointing. On the other hand, James Naughton is perfect as Billy Flynn and Joel Grey is great as Amos Hart. Mr. Grey doesn't over do the singing as he usually does, but is perfectly in character. The orchestra is good as are the orchestrations/arrangements. I would have rated this CD higher (based on the performances of Naughton and Grey), but Bebe and Ann sing so many of the songs that I couldn't find much enjoyment in it. I actaully gave this recording away, hoping to find a better one... wish me luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having just recently seen chicago and liked it, I decided to buy the cd.

But it is good none the less.Bebe Nuewirth is fun to listen to on the recording, but Ann Reinking is HORRIBLE! She can't sing and she can't act as well as Ms. Nuewirth.I recomend this recording to all Chicago and Kander and Ebb fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I ever wanted","review":"This is one of my favorite possessions.

A must have concert for any CURE fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"It IS perfect","review":"There is ONE reason this is DVD is perfect. It is the ONLY time you will ever hear these three albums played back-to-back-to-back live at the same time. Live performances tend to have mess-ups... oh well. This is an absolutely awe-inspiring collection of music. Pornography is brilliant, with its horrific/nightmarish visuals & sounds. Disintegration is beautiful, showcasing the bands use of mid-80's keyboard effects. And Bloodflowers, the true surprise. A fantastic realization of a great Cure album. This is truly the more guitar driven of the 3, but you can really feel Robert Smith during this set... incredible. If that wasn't enough, the performance of \\"The Kiss\\" as an encore is, alone, almost worth the price of the DVD. This is ESSENTIAL for any true Cure fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best live albums, ever!","review":"This DVD set is a great collection for any Cure fan, including those who are just learning about the band. All three albums are fantastic, and as one of the reviewers mentioned, the sound quality is excellent and is arguably better than the originals, even when I am using my \\"1999 bottom-of-the line\\" speakers that I bought as a student.It is interesting how well all these albums have stood the test of time, although the Bloodflowers isn't that old, I suppose.

NJMJr."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie!","review":"A great movie that focuses on the love and acceptance between a father and his son. Yes, the son is gay, but the movie does not show anything overt or offensive, in my opinion. If such a thing bothers you, however, it would be best to avoid this because his father accepts that part of his life without condition and, in fact, goes a tad overboard in trying to make his son's new boyfriend feel at home. There is a lot of good talent in this movie and Russell Crowe's performance is excellent and very realistic, as always!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"What? I am so confused.

It reads almost like an encyclopedia. Interesting (though gory) pictures. Not only is it informative, it is also fun to read. Many such books have a really dry, boring tone to them but this one has a definite voice. I liked the author's note at the beginning, though I'm not sure what his girlfriend's horridly abusive family had to do with the book. I also liked the case studies in the end: West Memphis Three, JonBenet Ramsey, Kristin and Kati Lisk etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Don't waste your money on this book. As a professor of Criminology, I found Mr. Turvey's approach to be quite juvenile in it's theories. Mr. Tuvey's analysis often contradicts itself in following chapters. I advise my students that there are far better books about criminal profiling on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative Text book","review":"This book is very informative and easy to read. If you can find it used and in good condition - it's worth buying. If you are a student or in law enforcement, it's a must! I think the resell value holds well due to the wealth of knowledge you can find in this book. If you're a CSI fan - I think it is safe to say, it's a very interesting read. It's all real and you will find 'graphic' photos - if you're not able to handle this - I suggest you don't purchase it. There is alot to absorb and I wouldn't call it light reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the criticisms of the author","review":"The author is a bit condescending in his writing style. He is very clear that HIS way is the ONLY way, and he never shies from insults. Clinicians who practice using a Freudian model are \\"voyeuristic,\\" and anyone who has an interest in this subject must prove themselves in his method or else they're just morbid and disgusting people who have watched too many movies. Maybe he forgot he came into this field too.There are a few useful things in here, but I'm sure there are much better books with a more neutral approach. I found the author annoying and unfunny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the self proclaimed \\"criminal profiler\\"","review":"Brent Turvey has placed some nice pictures and logical ideas in his book however, the reader must keep in mind that Mr Turvey is a self proclaimed \\"criminal profiler.\\" The book is worth a flip through but not recommended to be on your shelf, if you work in the field of forensic psychology. It is this reader's recommendation to stick to books written by Dr. David Canter, Dr. Laurence Alison and academic journals if you are involved on hands on work in the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative and Useful Book","review":"I found this book to be very informative and helpful while I am taking a violent crimes college course.

A lot of people thought it was gonna be a repeat of the anime or some butchering of it (like Tokita's Gundam Wing and G Gundam manga) but that is a far cry from the truth. the story line is completely original and frankly I like it better. It gives the deep characters even more depth to them, and the art is gorgeous. If you loved Pretear or any manga with bishies and strong female characters this is a must must must read and the differences between the anime and manga are fun. Also this book gives one more allusion to snow white than the anime did backing up the full title \\"New Legend of Snow White Pretear\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fairy tale With a Twist","review":"OK, I'm not really a kid, but I just thought it'd be fun to do a kids review because this book is also great for people under 13.

The book was obviously not it. Basically I paid for a scaled-down version of the Constitution with very very basic interpretations of the amendments and articles. The fourth amendment is explained in three lines. There is no thought put into this book, hince it's only ~60 pages, with about 10-15 pages used for credits and table of contents.

Excellent package, with funny linear notes by Desmond!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of Improvisation","review":"I read a response from one reviewer and had to respond. This CD is an absolute must for anyone who loves Jazz. Desmond and Hall are two gifted players who both possess a sound that is immediately identifiable. Along with their unique sound, they possessed an equally unique approach. I listened to this and I couldn't think of a place where they played an extra note and the sound is just beautiful. In an age of overkill, the Art of restraint in Music is too often overlooked. Listen to the masters of restraint. This is Art and if you can't hear it here, you probably don't really like great improvisation, in my humble opinion....."},{"rating":"1","title":"this sucks","review":"This book is not musicians talking about God. It is transcripts of interviews about bands' various tours, political committees, and other bland topics like their family upbringing which hardly mention God at all. It's as if once in an interview the interviewer will ask, \\"oh yeah, what do you think about God?\\" where the rapper or \\"musician\\" responds, \\"don't know him really.\\" Or with the Rage interview, albeit a talented band, an interview by them includes support for the moral relativistic killing of unborn life (they even support partial birth abortion as a \\"choice\\") and playing the race card does not belong in a Christian book.This book is a joke.

I enjoyed this book so much my husband and son were completely ignored. I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best","review":"I have a shelfful of Enoch's books, and this is a keeper. The story is witty, the characters are well drawn, and there REALLY is some history in this historical romance! By the way, I appreciate Amazon making all these older books available thru third party sellers, often used but in good condition. Not only does buying used save money, but it makes available books that you aren't going to find in bookstores. And of course, historical romances never get dated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ENOCH'S BEST BOOK!","review":"This is by far Enoch's best book--although Taming Rafe is very close. The hero and heroine are very evenly matched and you can't help but fall for the hero. He's everything a hero should be - persistent in his pursuit for the governess, very vulnerable to love, and considerable to a fault( when he kidnaps her, he tries to make her comfortable in the cellar). I have read Enoch's works in the past and have enjoyed her works, but this is her best by far. The characters, the plot and the dialogue come together very well in this book and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Witty","review":"I absolutely love this novel! It's a wonderful story full of witty dialogue and delicious humor. Some of the scenes had me laughing out loud.

She at first seem witty and nice but toward the end of the book I became annoyed that she loved him but didn't ever trust him till the last few pages of the book. I would have liked more time with the two charcters together, happy, and in love; even if outside forces were causing them trouble.

That is how wonderful it is, the sales speak for themselves!Lucien has to hire a governess for his obnoxious cousin and her mother in order to properly launch her into Society. Turning this country bumpkin into a \\"Lady\\" that the Ton would approve of would be no easy feat. In walks Alexandra Beatrice Gallant and Lucien just about swallowed his tongue! He didn't care if she had experience or not - she was hired! All he wanted was Ms. Gallant, naked preferably, all to himself!Get ready for a charming romance set in the Regency period. Wicked humor and laugh out loud scenes - the secondary characters are a blast and so was the villain!Find it, buy it, read it... you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I have rarely read a story with a man as sexy as Lucien who willingly admits his love (what woman would not like to hear those words from him) for his lady and she, being extraordinarily stuborn, refuses to agree to him until he decides he will give up his inheritance, and he is an Earl.

Another reviewer suggests that the sound quality here is the best we can expect from Soviet era monaural material. I've owned and enjoyed various LPs of this performance, usually in simulated stereo. These all adequately filled a room with the incredible performance by Oistrakh. And the sound from the orchestra was adequate. On this CD, the orchestra sounds like a small band, so compressed is the material. The violinist comes through, but just barely.

This would still be a great album if this was the only song on here. Luckily, Deep Purple has many other great, classic tunes that make this a well-rounded hits album. \\"Deepest Purple\\" is your perfect turn-up-the-volume album that keeps the listener wrapped up in classic hard rock. No fan of 1970's rock can be without this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Deep Purple","review":"Deepest Purple is a classic for anyone who enjoys the band.

I am seriously impressed with this item and it has served me well on my first thirty miles of hiking with it. The water pack is very durable and can take a beating all while staying sealed perfectly with no leaks. The one thing that I didn't like was when I received it I noticed that the black/green was interesting but the green is neon green and it's only the stitching. In fact it looks awful but with some patience and a permanent marker I fixed it and you can't even tell it was ever neon green.

She is passionate and humane, and refuses to be sentimental or cliched. it's a shame that the only other review of this novel ignores the greatness of Matalon's humanity and doesn't bother to consider her novel's literary and political merits. 'Bliss' is not a novel that is emotionally 'easy' in any way -- it not only confronts the contradictions of political and national identity, but also the tensions of love. It does this using crystalline prose and an a-linear style that forces the reader to be actively engaged in the novel. Though her first novel, 'The One Facing Us,' is more theoretically daring, I recommend 'Bliss' to anyone who accepts that politics and love are too complex to be represented as \\"us\\" or \\"them,\\" \\"black\\" or \\"white,\\" \\"with us\\" or \\"against us.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needs a warning label !","review":"Care about animals?

I was interested in the women, their emotional lives, and how they coped with their families and their social and political environments.I generally give a book a fifty page trial. With this book, I decided at that point not to continue with it. The violence toward the cat was introduced and I knew this was not a good book for me. But, I read the last few pages.

Much more than my traditional mouse used to. I was hoping (I think) that the smaller wire would be plenty easy to keep out of the way - sadly, not so. Also, the mouse itself is QUITE small - about 50% the size of a normal mouse, which means after long periods of time on the computer, I'd just as soon use my touch pad because it becomes aggravating/slightly painful. I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-average mouse","review":"What could go wrong with an optical mouse? It doesn't track as well as other mice unless its on a mousepad. I've a white melamine laminate desk, and it won't track at all directly on the desk, and on a white sheet of paper, its tracking tends to stutter rather than move the mouse pointer smoothly across the screen. Its fine sitting on a patterned mouse-pad however. But for non-optimal surfaces, its much much worse than e.g. the Targus mini optical mouse. Cleaning the optical sensor didn't help.On the plus side, the cord retractor is smooth, the mouse is comfortable, and the size is good.

After a month of traveling with this shoulder pad, I'm ready to throw it away. It's too heavy and cumbersome.Perhaps that's partly because it does it's job too well. There are times when I want my bag resting on my hip. Other times, I want to push the bag behind me, and out of the way.I found myself constantly adjusting the position of the shoulder pad to accommodate a simple 2-inch adjustment in bag placement.With a much heavier bag over my shoulder, I might find this pad to be more useful.

I'll definitely buy more in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Accessory","review":"I got this accessory pad recently when I bought a new Domke bag for my laptop (F-802 satchel). I have one of these pads on my Domke F-2 bag and already knew it's a must with heavy equipment such as SLR/DSLR cameras and full size laptops. This pad makes it much more comfortable to lug heavy stuff around. The few dollars this costs is a minor investment in your shoulder! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eases the burden of being a fully laden pack mule","review":"In many ways this shoulder pad is a microcosm of Domke's bags--tough, effective, and not exactly sexy. Like Domke's bags, there's nothing better out there, and alas like Domke's bags the question should be asked--why the heck isn't this included with the bags? Seriously, bags that easily eclipse $100, especially those approaching $200, should come with some type of shoulder pad beyond a mere canvas strap.That issue aside, the strap does a good job of making the the task of carrying loads of heavy camera gear bearable. I've yet to encounter the shedding others have described, and I found the width perfect for the strap on myDomke 700-10D F-1X Little Bit Bigger Bag (Olive Drab).

This is a very rigid, heavy and hard pad: it does not warp around your shoulder but, instead, sits on top and digs into your flesh.

The padding has the perfect consistency to prevent \\"digging in\\" -- as one poster mentioned, the rubber pad does \\"shed\\" a bit, kind of like a pencil eraser, but it's really no big deal -- I rubbed it on my jeans for a few seconds when I first got it and that knocked off most everything that might have ended up on my shirt in the future. I use it cross-shoulder, and the angled cut of the pad is perfect for this, but I'm sure it'd be pretty comfy hanging straight down too. The plastic backing looks rigid in the photo but it too is very flexible, though it spreads the load of my bag's thin strap nicely over the whole pad.All in all, a good buy for this price and I'm glad I chose it over the other pads available on amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this!!!","review":"The only problem I have with this is that it did not come with my bag to begin with! :-) This is such a great pad, far better than I have seen any other piece of luggage.It is thick, non-slip and really distributes the weight of the bag.

Unlike \`634-5789,' it's all downhill from here. The nine remaining covers are poor choices for Cooder's and Hiatt's guitar attack, much less the emphasis on \\"doo-wop\\" chorus work (Joe South's \`Down In The Boondocks' is barely recognizable).

The photos are nice, the overall book a little lacking in true substance. Nothing new seems to have been presented to the reader besides the photos, and the discussions about the discovery of Mallory's remains in 1999 reflect the fact that Breashears and Salkeld, while well known in their fields, played no role in the 1999 expedition and have no special insights from it to share with the reader. Not bad if you want the background on the earlier 1920's climbs, but Salkeld's other book, The Mystery of Mallory and Irvine (recently released in a new edition in the UK) does a much better job of filling the reader in on the topic than her treatment of the subject in this picture book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT INTRODUCTION","review":"I had some limited knowledge of the Mallory expeditions prior to reading this but not much.

The photos are incredible and let you get a feel for what the author is talking about. If you are looking for the actual photos of Mallory's body clinging to the slope however, they are not here.

Glassbrook's small book on Tapestry weaving is a visual feast illustrating all the most useful techniques in wonderfully detailed photos. I would recommend this as an introductory book for aspiring weavers as everything about the text is crystal clear. I believe this book could even be used to teach children how to weave. It does not have all the technical detail of Nancy Harvey's book but it is an inspiring place for a beginner to start. Like Harvey she succeeds in making tapestry weaving accessible to everyone as she includes instructions for making a basic frame loom. Her teaching sampler is very attractive and fun to weave. My favorite part is the gallery of Ms. Glassbrook's tapestries including detail photographs. Her use of color is amazing and much more contemporary than what I've seen in other tapestry books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb intro to tapestry weaving","review":"I have a fairly substantial library of books on weaving and textiles, and this is easily the best introduction I have encountered to tapestry weaving. The instructions are clear; techniques for a variety of special weaves for the beginner are introduced and easy to follow. The introductory pieces are reasonable for a beginner to complete-the tapestries are coarser weaves to lend themselves to teaching, while being attractive and fun to make. The photographs are excellent, and the samples of her work serve to inspire the reader to try bigger and more difficult projects. The author is an excellent designer and colorist, so much can be learned from her completed work.

You can't compare it to Disney/Bluth, even Disney _TV_ animation is better than most of this film. Some of the secondary character designs leave a lot to be desired as well. There are cats that look too much like bears or dogs. The main story plots are also told in a most uneven, almost offhand way which can be partially blamed on the bad dubbing in the English version.Be that as it may, it is a brave film and kudos to the studio with the guts to take on the subject matter of Filidae.

I think that in the future Pine Hollow books, another rider should come along who's better than Carol. She could use it to challenge herself more. It was really sad when Prancer died! It all happened so suddenly. I think it would've been better if she had died right after she would give birth. At least that way Lisa could keep a foal to remind her of Prancer. But in a way, Prancers death brought all three of the girls together; something that hadn't been done in a long time!

As a collector myself (and owner of Seasons 1 - 3 of Paladin), I totally agree. One day, the studios will REALIZE that to SELL DVD's and STOP PIRACY - they need to QUIT PROMOTING IT! Greedy idiots!

Simply put, I will not encourage the price gouging in which CBS and Paramount are currently engaging here. Shame on the lot of you in those two companies who are responsible! If you would put together the entire season and charge a reasonable price, I'd gladly cut into my grocery budget to buy the complete season 4 (I live alone and don't support anyone else), but I'm not going to touch it at this rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree, corporate greed at its finest !","review":"I bought the first 3 seasons, but I too will wait till later for a complete season 4 !

So I paid $280 for 8 individual boxes, more than a $205 difference!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HGWT 3.5 is another FAIL by Paramount!","review":"HGWT was a great series. I own the first 3 seasons. I'm passing on this & giving a 1 star rating because of Paramount's continuing practice of releasing partial season sets at full season prices. That's twice the cost, twice the space the show takes up on my shelf and twice as often I have to change out the DVD's in my player. Massive FAIL. I'll wait until vol.1&2(if it ever arrives) are bundled into a $30.00 set. If that never happens, so be it. Or I'll get a bootleg or used copy somewhere. F-Paramount & their corporate greed! Enough is enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greed reeks!","review":"I like the series (five stars), but to divide a season into parts shows excessive greed (thus the one star).

I hope there are those out there who likewise will understand me. I was told that season three of this show did NOT sell well, hence, the long delay waiting for season four. Other studios have split up seasons of TV shows in order for them to sell better and these should be at least a little cheaper than a full season set. I for one missed new releases being released of this show after season three was released. If season four volume one sells well, then we will soon have season four volume two. I have seen other first volumes of series sell well and then the second half follows soon after. I would like to have all six seasons and frankly, if this is the way for it to happen, I am glad at least the show is being released on DVD again. I for one plan to purchase it when it is available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention Paramount etc...","review":"The series needs no review per say (a classic)...As I've written in the past, my one star reviews are generally for the half season releases at inflated prices...Paramount's (and similar other companies) implied and prevailing attitude to or about the consumer is something of this order...\\"Go ahead and complain, but as long as our cash register is ringing, we'll keep releasing half seasons at inflated prices. Much more profitable than releasing complete seasons at lower, competitive pricing.\\" \\"Thanks for buying and making our day.\\"My understanding is that Gunsmoke came to a halt because sales tanked.

I loved this show as a kid when it was on TV. I have a personal policy that I will not purchase TV shows that have been sliced into multiple volumns because the studio(s) want their pound of flesh from consumers. This will be no different. While I would love to have the fourth season, I cannot justify paying full season prices for only half of a season. So, as far as I'm concerned Paramount might as well have kept this goodie in the vault and not bothered to release it. If I eventually see it cheaper (as in at least half the whole season price) I'll consider buying it. Until than, forget it. Sorry Paramount!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS WORTH IT","review":"I am so glad I did not listen to the whiners.

Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated: Too Expensive","review":"I own the previous sets. I won't buy this one because of the obvious rip-off. Folks, these shows were in the can and written off long ago, and hence the cost to bring a full-season DVD to market would only be marginally more than a \\"Volume\\" approach, and yet we are expected to pay double! I can view very high quality versions of all these episodes online and even download them from a multitude of file sharing sites. While I prefer to encourage the studios to release more titles and invest in extras, etc., this is like a slap in the face (or more like a 1-finger salute). Don't encourage them. Stay away. It's your hard-earned money at stake. After the whole season 4 is released, buy it used (in new condition) on eBay. Do to the studios what they are obviously trying to do to us. Vote with your business - it's the only message they'll take seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Season, Poor Packaging","review":"I've been waiting for this season to come out for years. I have all the prior seasons, which came in nice multi-DVD packaging. Boy was I surprised that I only got part of a season and a completely different packaging. They look odd on the shelf together now. I love the series, but this packaging and marketing approach is very disappointing. I'm not sure I will buy another set. I think instead of collecting I will just watch on NetFlix which has Seasons 1-6 available for instant viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advice to Paramount","review":"Attention Paramount Video: It's very simple.

Often the mysterious Palladin who works just as well with a gun as he does with his brain, will solve problems not with violence, but with knowledge. I will always hold a special place in my heart for this wonderful series as it taught me so much in life. But, I will not give payment to a blood sucking corporation making millions of $$$ at the expense of the fans, by selling half seasons. I will buy this, but only used and when I can get it for around $6 a half season, making my total cost for the season no more than $12. Not because I am cheap, but simply because used DVD's are no more than that in value to me.

I bought these for a recent trip, and found them to be almost unusable. Granted, I am not a very experienced user of binoculars. However, I'm not sure you should have to be experienced. Should be pretty simple right? Look through them, maybe focus as needed, and stuff that is far away looks bigger right? Not with these. So many adjustments, with no adequate explanation of what the adjustements are for, or how to make them. Something about having to adjust the left eye before focusing both together. Instructions were a joke. Even when I was able to get them properly focused, I found them to be so uncomfortable, that I could barely see through them. HORRIBLE!!! Sold them immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compact Binoculars for the Price","review":"We bought these binoculars for a trip to Cost Rica. We wanted something light, compact yet powerful. They were perfect. They fold up to fit in a pocket, and worked well with my glasses and for the rest of the famiily. Hard to scan due to the small field of vision, but the size and ease of use were great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the size and price","review":"Overall I am happy with these binoculars for the price and I am glad I paid a little extra to get the 10x over the 8x. They are a good set of binoculars if you want something small, compact and light. If you don't mind something a little heavier and bulkier (and paying a little more) I would get something even more powerful in hindsight. So far I have used them for bird watching out the back window and also at an airshow. They were great for the airshow because they were easy to carry on my belt without being a nuisance. I definitely enjoyed my time at the airshow and better knew what was happening on the ground because of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!","review":"It's a beautiful gem of a product, but the focus knob is so tight it is impossible to focus with one finger which makes it virtually unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected","review":"It's so light that you hardly notice it hanging on your neck. At first, I had a hard time getting focused, but one I read the instructions, the two-step focus process worked like a charm. Excellent clarity. I wish I could have a wider view, but I know these are not designed for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless, despite the high CR rating","review":"I bought this as a gift because it had been rated highly by Consumer Reports. I was terribly disappointed. They look, feel, and perform like a child's toy. The eyepieces are tiny, so it's hard to even get them to line up with your eyes; the field of view is miniscule, the image is muddy and incredibly dim. We returned them and purchased a pair of Nikan Action 8x40 for a similar price, and were delighted.If you are considering these because of price, look at the Nikon Action 8x40 -- crisp and bright, and similarly priced. If you must have something pocket-sized, consider the Nikon Travelite V series. The image is nowhere near the Nikon Action 8x40 mentioned above, but it's still superior to this one. Also the eyepieces are much wider. Nevertheless for birding etc, I would hesitate to reccomend any of the pocket binoculars. You're much betetr off with a full-size, esp. a (relatively) light and cheap one such as the Nikon Action 8x40."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Album isn't that good as the past ones.

Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"No!","review":"R&B/Hip-Hop can be pulled off, but under the current trend it is a no, no. The beats are far too generic, the lyrics bland, and the rap verses are nowhere near prolific. These are the problems that plague Ginuwine's 4th effort \\"The Senior\\". His vocals are not enough to save this mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmmm..no","review":"People wonder why R&B is dying & this cd proves it. The beats aren't favorable (or memorable) to the ears. A good R&B song is one you recognize from the opening beat & none of these songs left any recognition (although \\"Bedda to Have Loved\\" came close). I'm glad I borrowed instead of bought. The only good part of the cd is the interlude: \\"On My Way\\" and \\"Bedda Man\\".) The rest of the cd sounds like an unhappy baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was dissapointed =(","review":"i am fan of Ginuwine,have all his albums..but this one i didn't like..except for two or three songs..i just think it's the whole rnb thug image...and the up-beat songs didn't do it for me,some of the slow songs i didn't like..I think he's best album is and still is THE BACHELOR..i would recommend a listener to listen to clips before you buy it or save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Winner","review":"For the most part, I'm not into the kind of music that Ginuwine, and his contempories make. However, Ginuwine is one of the exceptions. I've purchased a few of his albums, yes I said albums, and he really knows how to put it down. \\"The Senior,\\" in my opinion, is his best. \\"In Those Jeans,\\" alone, is an absolute winner, and the rest, of the cuts, are, too, extremely good! I never thought that I would buy anything, by Ginuwine, until I heard \\"Pony.\\" However, I was wrong, as I have three of his albums, and am now a big fan. Vocally, he's no Tevin Campbell. But, he has a quality, to his voice, that, definitely, makes you want to listen. With one note, you know exactly who it is! And, that, to me, makes him special. To be honest, I used to think that he was just another pretty boy, but, now, realize that I was wrong! As for his new release, as soon as it comes out, it's mine. As for the kid, I wish him continued success!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Ginuwine!","review":"I have all of his albums, and they're are great, this is his 4th cd. A lot of people don't know Ginuwine, but he's been around for a long time, he's just not given the recognition that he deserves. And if you have ever been to see him in concert he's a great entertainer. This cd is a little more fast paced from what i am usually use to hearing from him, which is okay, but his voice is drowned out a little on some of the songs, that's why i didn't give it 5 stars. He has a strong and yet velvety voice which makes the ladies go crazy. I am a big big fan of his, and had the pleasure of meeting him, and he's such a great and funny person. On this cd once again there is no Timbaland, which is a popular producer, that helped him produce his first 2 albums. But that's okay cause he really shines on this cd, he's a very talented song-writer, and he proves he doesn't need Timbaland, and i hope to see him go big places with his career. I recommend you buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic Ginuwine cut!","review":"Timbaland was apparently lagging on some projects while this cds was in production (namely Justified) and, therefore does not appear alongside his protege. However, they will be working together again for G's next album.Although, the legendary producer's absence is noticeable, it is not a crime since Ginuwine hasn't done too bad on his own at all! Not his best album but there are a lot of classic R&B joints on this album: ranging from club-bangers like \\"Hell Yeah\\" to the smooth ballads we've come to expect of G (e.g. the great \\"Love You More\\".Must say that Snoop could've been put to better use on this album as his appearance on \\"Get Ready\\" sees him restricted to \\"saying\\" some dumb stuff as he bigs up G."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ginuwine does it again with '' The Senior''","review":"Ginuwine a.k.a Da Gizzle has made a great album and I love his messages for each song because his is only trying to bring all the best of him in this album.

With songs such as Love you More Everyday, On My Way, Bedda to have loved, In Those Jeans, Bedda Man, and Our First Born Ginuwine proves he is the master of ballads and proves that it's not only his looks and his dancing skills that makes him the top r&b artist today. He shows on songs like sex and hell yea that he could get the clubs bumpin too. This cd is off the hook, there isnt 1 bad song on it and this should be considered the top r&b cd for 2003. He definately deserves awards for this 1. Great Job G!!! P.S. Ginuwine is the best dancer in the industry today, no one can compete with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"He keeps on doin' it!","review":"Ginuwine is gonna be here for a long time and with this cd now more than ever you know he will be one of the best! My favorite track on the cd is \\"Love You More\\". I love that song cuz its mellowed out. Its also one of those songs that i could put on when Im at home with my girl.\\"Big Plans\\" (feat. Method Man) is another favorite song on the cd. Method Man rips up the track and like McDonald's, Im loving it! Actually, Im loving the whole cd, GO OUT AND GET \\"The Senior\\" RIGHT NOW! IF YOU ALREADY HAVE IT, GET IT AGAIN!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"After hearing the first 4 tracks on this album I realized, there was something missing...Timberland. Not to take anything away from \\"G\\", but I think he should stick with Tim's songs and beats. Who would put Mike Tyson on there CD? He has no credibility , or \\"STAMP OF APPROVAL\\" to give to anyone. If it was all about the fist song on the album this would have stayed on the shelf. They're a lot of artist out there going for the new look, new sound, new producers and also new writers. It doesn't work for everyone i.e. Whitney Houston...she left Clive Davis and look how well her album did(Or should I say didn't do). From a big music lover and a fan of \\"G\\", Tim's the man you should stick with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ginuwine Bigger and Better","review":"Ginuwine as an artist is ok but after hearing the album i must say he is gooood! I rate this album highly, he has great tracks obviously i have my favourites like \\"In Those Jeans\\", \\"Sex\\", \\"Our First Born\\", to be honest i like all of the tracks.Ginuwine gets better and stronger as he makes new albums and i'm sure his next album should will be even better. God Bless him as he has talent and is gifted!!I think it's a good buy and people should stop hating on man and if they feel strong about his music being \\"crap\\" they should show the world what they have to offer if not don't hate!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugar In his tank","review":"I'm trying to be fare with this dude, but he his to sweet for me. Why is he looking like that on his c.d. cover. It looks like he has about 12 shirts on. When ginuwine first came out he wasn't so sweet acting, but now he has jumped out of the closet. He is singing about stuff that makes no sense. Hell Ya(what)have you ever seen a girl in the club--Hold on. I'm going to sing the real song that he wrote-Have you ever poured wine down a dudes shirt and licked it off and screamed HELLLL-YAAAAA. And I'm not even going to get started on the dancing thing. Ginuwine is like 35 and still dancing in his video's like that's hot. He needs to step on a land mine.

Overall very good album keep it up G peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ginuwine - THE DROPOUT","review":"What is this? I can't get jiggy with this crap? This album fails in so many ways. First off Ginuwine is not good at all by himself as far as producing and writing. He really needs some help. His song lyrics are childish and this whole thing about trying to be some kind of R&B thug is played out and very cheesy. This album has some tolerable songs but none of this is really inspiring or highlights his talent in any positive way. And the biggest disappointment.....Where in the world is Timberland on this? This album only has one good song...Our First Born, that's it. Don't waste your time with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED TO GINUWINE?","review":"Not good. Only 3 good songs. And these 3 good songs aint even all that. The rest of the Ginuwine's songs on this album sound like any regular R&B song out there. Nuthin different.

Cuz I aint never gon buy another album of his."},{"rating":"1","title":"only 3 good tracks on this cd","review":"my friend told me that this cd is great and worth money. I bought it and I was very defeated. this album is boring and ginuwine is boring! only three tracks are worth attention - get ready, hell yeah remix and bedda man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I got to admit, when I first bought this cd I thought the tracks would grow on me. Well after 4 months of owning it there are only a few tracks worth listening to. As one of the reviewers noted here, most of the cd is boring. In those Jeans & On My Way are really the only tracks worth playing but you will quickly tire of them.

This was a dissapointing album for me coming off the previous one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average CD","review":"Ginuwine hasn't made the CD I know he's capable of making. This is lightweight stuff. He's in need of better material and proper management. G; I suggest you work with Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Joe & Joshua P.

I think this is one of the better albums. I was really feeling this album and I think the whole CD was good. Yea he changed around the producers but I think the change did him good.

He did real good on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usefull accessory","review":"More comfortable than it looks, this simple web strap accessory converts your Domke F1 or F2 (and maybe others) into a backpack.

I am very excited by and about this book and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking to learn about the history, lore, and how-to of bowmaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely valuable information for making bows","review":"The amount of information in this book is staggering. I never knew that there was so much to know about turning a piece of wood into a bow. This book covers it all. It contains very detailed information about different woods, wood selection, tillering, wood grains, bow physics and theory. This book seems to be focused mostly on flatbows. But, the information is invaluable regardless the style of bows you intend to build.The amount of information in this book may be a little daunting to the beginner, but I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking about building a quality bow of any style."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for beginners.","review":"so i was interested in making my own bow. searching on-line i this book is referenced several times. so i am about 20 pages into chapter 2 and i am completely lost. while i think this book may contain some very good information it is defiantly hard to understand. and that is the frustrating thing about this book. it seems to detail the process of making bows and assumes you are very familiar with the subject. it doesn't cover any terminology and just jumps right into complicated thoughts. the thing is if i knew how to build a bow i wouldn't need this book, but supposedly this book teaches you how. i was really disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"Most of the complaints I saw about this book concerned the terminology which I can understand. I did some early investigating and research on bow making before reading the book so I didn't have a hard time, the book could be alot longer to cover the terminology but then that information is available for free on the internet and it's nice to just get right into reading about bowmaking. The book is written by different authors, my only real complaint is that the book is poorly edited because some of the chapters are just plain difficult to read or the specific author writes in a way which is difficult to understand. It's a good book with alot of good information, I'm planning on buying the rest in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book and excellent series. The authors give very good descriptions and instruction.","review":"The authors give very good descriptions and instruction on the process of making bows as well as great information on the processes of design and testing of bows.There is some great historical information as well as lots of practical skills and information that will help you to make your own bow from cutting down a tree to seeing the arrow fly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I only take time to rate things that are either very good or very bad and in this case, it was excellent. This book is packed with basics so that anyone can learn how to build a bow yet it has enough science to explain the technical details. Traditional Bow making was close to becoming a lost art, but with this book and its subsequent volumes, it will be preserved for many generations to come.I'm 3/4th of the way through Volume Two and just ordered Volume Three. I highly recommend this series for anyone who enjoys hunting, archery, outdoor survival or just a bit of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"As it says on the cover","review":"this book is vital to anyone wanting to make a traditional bow!as it says on the cover\\"bowyers bible\\" started 2nd book already and cut myself some bowstaves too.Only quible is that as an englishman who was born in portsmouth, one of the writers thought the mary rose sank near plymouth!?!?!(it was portsmouth)but that has nothing to do with the bow making which is clear and concise. a must have book to go with my Hodgkins \\"archers craft\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"I have three words: BUY THIS ANTHOLOGY.

Really, this anthology encompasses the epic of Star Wars."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you appreciate real music go buy this trilogy.","review":"Look this is Star Wars, and it simply has the greatest musical score ever created in the whole universe. (I mean it). I enjoy many soundtracks, especially by John Williams, James Horner, Hans Zimmer, but I must say that Star Wars trilogy is something different, lets say genuine; especially if you are a fan of the movie. Never make the mistake of owning only one of them though, just buy the trilogy, you wont regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Triumph for John Williams Fans","review":"Item was recevied very promptly and in excellent condition.

Highly recommended for Star Wars fans across the galaxy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yessssssh","review":"Say what you will about Star Wars the movie--at least its score was more than twelve lame bubblegum pop songs songs strung together for the sole purpose of selling a soundtrack album--more than I can say for most movies today.

The soundtrack of \\"Star Wars\\" is a truly unique experience. It is one of those rare moments in life when you are transported into another world. And what a journey! John captured the whole magic and atmosphere George Lucas wanted for his film, turned \\"Star Wars\\" into a fantastic space opera, sound and image perfectly synchronized. Fill your life with John Williams and may the music be with you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling!","review":"Star Wars is one of The BEST soundtracks of all time! I first found the cd on a roadtrip, and from the first du-du-du-dum-dum I was enthralled! In my opinion, great music always gives you goosebumps, and I had to go get a blanket. I hardly wear out a cd, but I have the entire collection of Star Wars cd's, and they are almost worn out. The music takes you out into another galaxy far, far, away.

Hold Back This Day was a real page tuner and is worth the read regardless of one's views on the race issue. Even Huxley in his Brave New World didn't foresee this issue but Kendall has met it head on. And just in the nick of time before the so called hate laws shut down this genre of SF writing.I only hope Kendall writes more on the subject and that other authors follow suit. Who in the 50s would have thought that gambling casinos and mass runs by the general population to let off steam,as foreseen by the SF writers back then would be so popular today? One can only speculate how the NWO and it's mandated racial blending will work out.

The phrasebook is not bad, but there is no connection between the book and the cassette. (The cassette refers to a written transcript, but none was included.)

To make things worse, the translations of English phrases into Thai that I was able to find in the book were different from the ones given on the tape!

I don't like Zatarain's rice and beans (red or black). There are a few different reasons for this, but the primary one is that on two separate occasions I've found \\"stuff\\" in the mix. Both times it was the same thing: a sort of fibrous, bone-like object, about the size of a marble. The first time it happened I was rather grossed out, but the second time I quit this stuff for good.

This book is arranged by color combinations. Sounds good, but it isn't. For example, the \\"Iceland Poppy\\" palette has a poorly executed water color painting of light pink poppies surrounded by lime green against a white fence.

The colors that appear in the photographs are often several shades and/or tones different than the paint chips shown - apricot instead of rose, violet instead of blue. Ms. Krims suggests 3 main coordinating colors that go together, plus accent and trim colors. Even in the limited number of rooms that are shown in the photos, finding where all three, or even two, of these main colors are used together is a challenge. I was expecting to see rooms with her color schemes. I wasn't expecting to be shown 3 paint chips and to have to envision (guess) what a room would look like decorated in those colors.

The manufacturers of fabrics give you your color scheme in your \\"anchor\\" fabric, including wall and floor colors, so why get frustrated by picking out wall colors first, then trying to find a fabric to go with it? If the paint and fabric manufacturers would work together, we as consumers would have an easier time of decorating. Not everyone can afford an interior designer.

A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The color chips in this book are all pastel on the pages. Very hard to actually apply the information to select paint chips. I wouldn't recommend it. Try Annie Sloan's Color Schemes for Every room instead. You'll be much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful when you don't want to repaint","review":"I looked at this book because we moved into a house where all the room were already painted in bright colors, and I wasn't at all sure what to do with them. Ms. Krims color palattes gave me several choices of color schemes that would incorporate the rooms that were already there, and have saved me a substantial amount of time and money repainting all the rooms. For instance, the living room when we got it was painted a medium dark grey-green, with yellow, dark green, red, and pink(!) for accent colors. We thought it looked awful, but were loathe to repaint the entire huge room. It turns out that this room is the right shade of green for doing \\"Emerald Isle\\", which we liked very much. With the culprit accent colors removed and replaced, suddenly our awful green living room isn't nearly so awful. Well worth the money we spent for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ideas for the Creatively Confused!!","review":"We just painted our bedroom this weekend and used this book to choose our color. We picked Benjamin Moore Orange 131 (warm and pumpkin-like) and it looks AMAZING! It's a color I never would have chosen, but thanks to this book we took a chance and it looks great. The only reason I'm giving the book 4 stars instead of 5 is because the illustrations are kind of lame - I wish the author had used more photographs of real rooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colorful, but not practical","review":"I'm a real novice when it comes to interior decorating--so when I got this book I was looking for someone to just tell me what works. Krims does attempt to do just that by selecting specific color palettes, but she doesn't provide enough actual real world examples to make the book useful to a novice like me. I need to see how the colors work together in real life, not just in a watercolor painting. I ended up sending the book back. The only reason I gave it a two instead of a one is that I got the sense that colors she selected really would work together--afterall they looked pretty good in the paintings."},{"rating":"1","title":"rkorb15","review":"Having recently purchased seven different books on interior color combinations and inspiration, this book is the most useless I now own. The \\"Pallets\\" are not that different from one another, the water-color drawings are almost irrelevant, the color chips are not related to photographs of rooms, the prose is overly romantic; and worst of all, we all do not live in Massachusetts! (Nor have most of us travelled abroad.) I did not find ideas here to use in my color decisions, and it will sit on the shelf gathering dust.

(The lenses fit fine in the 4 compartment insert that comes with the bag.) Wanted to swap the 4 compartment insert for a single compartment and a 2 compartment insert - thinking they would be the same combined size. They are NOT.... Cannot think of anything a photographer would carry that would fit in these tiny little boxes. Certainly not lenses. This insert should be 1/2 the size of the 4 compartment insert that comes with the F6. It is NOT, by a long way. Called Domke and talked to 2 different reps. They finally agreed that cutting out one side of the 4 compartment insert with a razor blade might be the only way to keep the dimensions I required. I appreciate their candor and help. The 2 compartment insert is still useless unless you are carrying a medium sized bottle of aspirin or some such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small to hold a lens","review":"I should have read the prior review of this item before I ordered it, as my experience was the same and I returned the insert shortly after it arrived. The 2- compartment Domke insert will not hold even a 58mm Canon SLR lens, much less a larger one. This is unlike the 4-compartment, which is sized to fit up to a 77mm lens. Neither Amazon nor Domke makes this clear in their descriptions of the product. It's hard to imagine what a photographer would use this for; certainly not for carrying lenses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recall","review":"I have not been able to see this move and therefore unlike others I will not rate this DVD without seeing it first.

But now to the music.This is my favariot of all the Star Wars series. It comes with 6 new themes however only three are very important. I will first start of the lesser 3 important themes. First there is Lando's (Cloud City) Theme which has a bussiness like overture. Then there is Boba Fett's (the bounty hunter) theme which is a erie'st of all. then there is the droids theme (C-3PO and R2D2)which is sofest and friendliest of all.Now to the more important one. First there is a love theme between Han and Leia. Then there is a very Gentle and very noble theme for the Jedi master Yoda; and there of course the most important of all, the Imperial March (Darth Vader's theme) which becomes the definitive theme for the Imperial.A Must have"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Star Wars film and soundtrack!!!","review":"Oh, this is an awesome CD. My favorite is the \\"Imperial March.\\" It is synonymous with Darth Vader. I can just see him walking the catwalk on the bridge of his imperial cruiser.\\"Yoda's theme\\" is a whimsical piece. Very much like the little creature himself. \\"Yes, to Obiwan you listen.\\"Another wonderful piece is \\"Carbonite.\\" It is when Han Solo, betrayed by Lando, is handed over to Vader to be frozen. Leia, Chewie, Han, and C3-PO are led to the deep freeze chamber. Vader, Lando, Storm Troopers, and the other ugly creatures are present for the event. This is where Leia and Han kiss and she tells him that she loves him only to get a \\"I know\\" in return. This is a magnificent piece. The drums and the horns are featured in it.Of course the getway is awesome as well. The whole CD is worth every penney you would spend to buy it.

This is sheer brilliance.I reccomend it for film fans, Star Wars fans and William's fans everywere."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as STAR WARS in every respect","review":"I'd hate to rank the STAR WARS film scores, but I think that this is an outstanding contribution to the music of the Trilogy. Of course, figuring prominently thorughout is the \\"Imperial March\\" - which I feel should have been introduced in the first film - dark and sinister, yet as instantly recognisable as the Phantom of the Opera's theme in the famous Broadway musical. Passion and drama show up as prominently as they did in the first film, and the score is captivating from first bar to last. Apart from the Imperial March, the Han/Leia love theme is wildly romantic and wistful. And so is Yoda's gentle theme, showing his harmony with the Force. This is truly an excellent continuation of the STAR WARS TRILOGY score."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wont get fooled again","review":"FMW sucks. Who the hell watches this junk?

Pull everything and call it ERP?","review":"I should believed Jim (another reviewer of this book). This book does not focus on ERP. Rather, it's a basic operation management book. There are only 2-3 chapters that really talk about ERP but only introduction. If you look for the introduction, \\"Daniel E. O'Leary\\" book is much more valuable (Enterprise Resource Planning Systems : Systems, Life Cycle, Electronic Commerce, and Risk). Although I am an IE, I don't think this book will be interesting other IE too. Like I said in subject, the author(s) try to pull everything, e.g., SCM, OM, and ERP and call it's an integration.

There are puckers in the fabric between the stitching.

Money down the drain on this one.UPDATED: To follow up on this. Wizard Industries 100% stands behind their product and granted me a full refund within a day of me posting negative feedback.

I have found, after using them for a few months, that a couple of them do have little pill balls on them though, I'm not sure how that happened. I do machine wash and dry them, and they have shrunk some. Quite a bit, really, but that is ok I have small hands and found them to be a little too large anyway for washing dishes. Now they are perfect! They are super soft after you machine dry them.I would definitely buy more.The only down side is they look like cotton diapers.

I've never put them in the dryer, but they still shrunk to almost half the size. They are now thick and unpleasant feeling. I did wash them in the washing machine, however.If you buy them, I'd recommend handwashing or the gentle cycle inside a net bag, using a mild detergent.

Sorry, being almost uncritical admirer of Maria Callas and having got plenty of both studio and live recording, I was looking forward so much ! due to previous reviewers.I have bought this set and I want to write them : please, be a little judicious, after listening it I cannot believe I have the same recording as you have. What you could enjoy when almost nothing is audible. The sound is the same poor quality as was with previous labels - which were much cheaper.I think the script must have been so terrible that nothing more can be done with whatever technology. Of coursewe all can regret Maria have never recorded Abigail and moreover that she did not record this role at her young years. Her voice must have been so fabulous and huge. Unfortunately it can be hardly recognizable from this recording - it is still only a document, not for sitting and listening and enjoying....Save your money and do not buy this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"great to understatand phatophysiology","review":"This book will help you understand all kinds of phatophysiologies, it makes it easy to study!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What Grand History Is All About","review":"This is Manchester's best book and rightly made him famous. Manchester spent decades researching for this book, and it shows !! Few history books have been written with such vast sweep encompassing centuries of interwoven famous lives, wars, rise and fall of empires, tragedy and triumph. When I first read it decades ago, I could not put it down. It is hypnotic. No wonder it has been in continuous print, in one form or another, since its first printing. Written in grand style, it reminds me of the big works by Barbara Tuchman, Robert Massie, Ron Chernow, and Niall Ferguson. When you're through reading it you will have received the equivalent of a Bachelor's degree in modern European history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"I was highly disappointed with this dvd. The comentators were the worst ive ever heard, and the matches were not great. The hardcore matches were clipped and had no point to really watch them.

Needless to say things were not going her way at this time, and if you can not feel the pain in her soul from the recordings on this album, you have no emotion!I remember first listening to this on vinyl back in the late 70's when it was first released, on a snowy night, alone at the then very deserted off season Jersey Shore. If I could get through a listen under those conditions, anyone can.Her gut renching read of \\"Body and Soul\\", \\"I Got It Bad\\", \\"Hurt\\" and others give early Blueswomen (Lady Day, Ethel Waters and the like) a run for their money.The mosy haunting track to me is \\"What Shall You Do\\", that song had me yearning to call child protective agencies.This album is that haunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrying one here too","review":"I played out a couple of vinyl copies of this album, back in Fall of '81. It was one of a few albums released that year that made a huge impression on me. I don't remember if Rickie Lee Jones' \\"Pirates\\" album came out just before Carly's LP, or vice versa. They made a killer combo for this young, closeted romantic.I think this album presents Carly in the prime of her voice, and she sings these pre-rock tunes with pride and subtlety. The songs, arrangements and general charm of this album usually elicits a list of superlatives from me, so here are my extremes:1. \\"Body & Soul\\" should have won Carly a Grammy. 2. \\"Hurt\\" is a great song, but a bit strained in this recording.I hate to put this crassly, but if your main interest in this album is Carly herself, you should own it already. And if the sound of authentic, \\"modern\\" torch appeals to you, check out Miss Jones' \\"Pirates,\\" which complements \\"Torch\\" nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best recordings, if not the best","review":"I am a big Carly Simon fan from the 1970's and this album started my collection of standards by vocalists treating the Great American Songbook like the Bible.She was at the peak of popularity when she recorded this and it was a very daring move to make.

Of the three reviews I have read all the reviewers were bad mouthing the movie in one way or another. I found the movie quite good and the acting excellent. The story of an investigative reporter being one step behind a cold blooded murderer keeps you going until the very end(and the way the killer manages to stay ahead of the authorities is really good). Unlike some movies I have seen in the past it also has an excellent ending. If you want to see a good movie, rent it before you purchase it, so you'll only be spending a small amount for the rental, and if you're disappointed you won't be out that much money. I for one plan to purchase this movie in the near future as I thought it was well worth the time that I spent watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proclaim Jubilee","review":"My interest in \\"Proclaim Jubilee\\" was because a friend gave it to me since I will be celebrating 50 years in a religious community.The book has really captured my interest because of the stress on enjoying lifeand appreciating the world around us.

She is either unaware of how her biases play into the hermaneutic circle or doesn't care. She seems to assume that if one is seeking to follow God her argument is unassailable. This is not true.Admittedly my resistance in part is due to my own reading of history, politics and scripture and my biases are many.

Her profiles of Barbara and Jeb Bush, Vernon Jordan and the relationship between Clinton and Gore were outstanding. In the family section you learn more about Marjorie and her personal life and then in fate you learn more on her struggle with cancer. Its a wonderful, touching book on a remarkable everyday woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Woman at the Washington Zoo","review":"This is a collection of the writings of a highly regarded columnist for the Washington Post, Marjorie Williams, who died of liver cancer suddenly at the age of 48. She brings her wit, insight and intelligence to bear on her experience of diagnosis, illness, treatment, and the impact on her family. Her account of the insensitivities of the modern medical system, and the frustrations of explaining and managing a fatal disease are poignant and often funny. Her observation, early on, that \\"you can say the wrong thing\\" to someone diagnosed with serious illness is a clear reminder of how difficult it is to be sick in our work-driven society, and what pain simple bad manners can inflict.The book is full of insights about the experience of being ill - for those who are themselves suffering through illness, or the loved ones of those diagnosed and being treated with a serious illness, these writings provide a wonderful companion. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gifted insights into people, politics, parenting, and life or death","review":"Each chapter can be read alone, standing by itself, but each is so well written that I have found it difficult to put the book down.

Though it continues in the same vein of DIRTY MIND, the fusion of rock and funk is more characteristic here. Tougher and funkier, in terms of the lyrics and Prince's vocals, many of the moments here are among Prince's best (the title track, \\"Let's Work\\", \\"Private Joy\\", \\"Jack U Off\\"). The rest don't reach as high, but are still great nonetheless.

Although there're lots of violins (I stopped counting at 11!)the music's not at all stuffy, concert-like or orchestral - and having all the violins also doesn't overpower the musical numbers - which run the gamut from an Irish jig to a medley of 40's tunes. I understand that this group is extremely popular in Europe and their native Canada - and I also saw their show recently on a PBS fundraiser - my advice is to try and catch a re-run on your local PBS station if you're doubtful - but if you like a wild ride with violins and percussion - and if your tastes in music run somewhere between Enya and Stomp, this group's CD and video is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEYOND OUTSTANDING!!","review":"This video was made in December 1999 of this ensemble on stage in Calgary and was the program aired on PBS during their last pledge drive.

The drumming action on it is nice, though.Because I didn't like the Remo, I bought an Evans Real Feel, which is MUCH quieter, and has two materials for different rebound action (it's REALLY nice!!)...so now the Remo is a dust collector. I'd recommend not getting the Remo and spend the extra money on an Evans Real Feel (2-sided) RF12D."},{"rating":"1","title":"too loud for a practice pad","review":"while its much quieter than a real drum, its still much too loud for a practice pad. If you're living with someone I suggest you get a pad with a rubber surface, i found those to be exponentially quieter, and they feel just as great.I think the type of plastic used contributes to the loudness, its hard and fragile, and it feels a bit cheap. I'm not surprised the rim won't last long if you do rimshots on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"drum pad","review":"Drum pad is just right for my 11 year old to use to practice when not at home. Great idea for quiet practice time also.l"},{"rating":"2","title":"High-quality practice head","review":"This has a nice feel to it, very similar to a real drum head. It's also large enough to use comfortably. It can also be tuned as it begins to show its age.We're happy with the practice pad itself, but it took quite a long time to arrive (I ordered it December 9 and it didn't arrive until December 22). It was shipped via Priority Mail with a shipping label dated December 10 (did they label it and not ship for almost two weeks?). We received no notice of it being backordered or delayed.Shipping issues aside, the pad itself is very nice quality, and the price through Amazon was the best we found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite, loving look into the female psyche","review":"Raising Hope is the ultimate depiction of four women finding the balance between loving others and staying true to themselves. Ruth Teller, a tough-talking woman, faces life head on. Sara Lynn has sacrificed everything, including her first love, in order to meet others' expectations. Aimee Hoffman has devoted her entire life to raising the child she never thought she'd have, and Sara Lynn has been perfect. Almost. Unusual family dynamics complicate Hope Teller's typical teenage concerns about puberty, friendships, and the future. Raising Hope is an exquisite garden, the beauty of which brought tears to my eyes. A long time has passed since any author has delved so lovingly into the female psyche, and Ms. Willard has made the wait worthwhile. This novel is a must read!Read the rest of my review at (...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful","review":"This story was so great...I just couldn't put the book down.

I don't know how this man sweats as much as he does with such a low level of intensity! This does focus on arms, which is cool, because if you use light weights (I use 2 lb) it's good to sculpt and not build. To supplement, I will stop the dvd after each exercise and do 20-30 jack flies, 180 jumps, cross country skiing, or anything plyo. Also, he does many very slow reps, so instead of doing the slow version, I will just go right into the quick version. If you can do that, it's not so bad. If you are a beginner, this is a good dvd for you. Otherwise, you will definitely have to add some intensity on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD!","review":"I was a fan of Billy Blanks taebo workouts, so I was excited for this new DVD.

I would absolutely NOT recommend this DVD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome workout DVD","review":"I like the simplicity of the video.

The ingredients are so easy to find and the instructions are crystal clear. Each chapter begins with helpful step-by-step photographs that have taught me a lot about grilling well.

Don't waste your money - buy Bobby Flay's book instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I have 3 Weber cookbooks, and each one is exceptional. The Weber cookbook author, Jamie Purviance, really has a great sense of taste and the ability to combine interesting ingredients to make grilled food great. One thing I was wary of with these book was I thought it may be one giant advertisement for Weber grills, but that is not the case (although I must admit I am a Weber fan, all of my grills have been Webers).The focus is simply on the food, and it is done so well. Purviance seems to like Californian-style food, that is, lots of Mexican influence with spices and avacados and corn, etc. The recipes are well written and easy to follow, and are accopanied by large, full-color pictures that make you want to try every recipe.I have made many of the recipes in this book, and have yet to be disappointed. They are great for a tailgate or a backyard BBQ party, and you'll soon gladly find yourself burning through your fair share of charcoal if you get this book. Definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love IT!!","review":"This cook book is a joy! And I should know...my family has been collecting cook book's for generations.

The book has been rained on, dropped on the floor, splashed with all sorts of ingredients, and is generally beat up. I bring it to the grocery store when I shop and even had the cashier ring it up once when I wasn't paying attention. This is the best cookbook I've ever read because the author, Purviance, isn't trying to impress the reader by writing a bunch of pretentious garbage and making things as difficult as possible. Instead, Purviance comes across as a friendly, helpful tutor who wants the reader to succeed. My wife has been stoked ever since I got this book because I have been making things happen on the grill, including the July 4th cookout that her whole family attended at our place. They talked about the food for weeks, and I owe it all to this book. It is a great reference and guide for aspiring grillmasters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tips, But Needs More....","review":"This is a great grilling book and at the price it really deserves a perfect rating, but going by the retail price I wouldnt have bought it for that.

Buy it for under $10 and its a steal..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What About Africa?","review":"This well-researched, entertaining and readable book makes a subtle omission. While laying out a convincing case for the wolf origins of domestic dogs, there is little discussion of how early canines migrated from their beginnings in Asia to every continent. The early chapters shift focus from stone age times in Europe to the civilisation of Ancient Egypt, where, the author states, exotic dogs such as Basenjis were \\"imported\\" from Africa (overlooking the fact that Egypt is in Africa). How did Asian wolves become African Basenjis? And how did wolves come to Australia?Unfortunately, Africa is not mentioned in the book's index, making an indexed study of \\"The Lost History\\" difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of Chaos.....","review":"This is a wonderful book for the person trying to find their way through the maelstrom of emotion following the death of a loved one. Everyone who has experienced the helplessness, guilt, bewilderment, and anguish inherent in the condition knows how difficult it is to find purpose or meaning in the suffering; this in spite of the well-meaning attempts of outsiders to give comfort.Dr. Grubbs work enables the bereaved person to begin to understand the process and work actively to emerge more whole and complete. Her use of the story of Gilgamesh and her use of ancient Egyptian story and symbol are especially beautiful (and useful)."},{"rating":"2","title":"curious cat","review":"A primer on accepting the wholeness of life to include death, a fascinating subject that I have no knowledge of- though perhaps understanding- now.

There were so many questions. Where were the answers? I was being treated by a doctor specializing in rheumatoid arthritis. I hit the internet and found a \\"specialist\\" in my metro. area. I am now under the care of Dr. Maureen Mayes. At this time her book had not yet been released. I feel lucky that I have her knowledge in treating scleraderma and in her book she can share that expertise with others. The book has been extemely helpful in explaining to family and friends what scleraderma is and how it can be treated."},{"rating":"1","title":"An extreme disservice to Scleroderma patients","review":"Dr. Mayes's book gives a well-written account of how scleroderma progresses in a patient unabated. However, to subtitle this book \\"A Guide for Patients and Families\\" is grossly inaccurate. Dr. Mayes misses the mark when she fails to discuss or even mention antiboitic therapy as a treatment. Her condescending advice on coping with scleroderma was particularly distasteful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Before you take anything this \\"Doctor\\" says seriously, please Google him, read the Quackwatch articles about him. He is not a doctor. Several felonies, a long list of arrests and charges against him - all of these things tell me to beware. However, you can make up your own mind. Is this so-called doctor a sincere healer with multiple wonder cures for serious illnesses or the biggest scam artist and snake oil salesman to come down the pike in years? A well-meaning and trusted friend recommended one of his Hydrogen Peroxide/Oxygen products and this book to me. The treatment did nothing, so I looked this guy up on the Internet. What a shock to see his arrest record! You may want to do the same. Hey, maybe the FDA and FBI are in cahoots with the AMA, and are persecuting a beautiful human being. Or not.

Instead it was more like randomly chopped chunks of tomato. Its packed with lots of water, and has a slightly off taste.

It's an average binder that you would see at Staples. You can't get this one there, but I was anticipating a little more quality look for the price.

The second season is as good as the first - and Tennant is a marvel. \\"Tooth and Claw\\" is a great episode featuring Pauline Collins as Queen Victoria being chased by a Ware Wolf (one of the all time great episodes). Gatiss returns to write the wonderful \\"The Idiot's Lantern\\" (set in the 50's); \\"Love & Monsters\\" is hysterical; \\"School Reunion\\" brings back Sarah Jane and has Anthony Head (Giles from \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" as a baddie); \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\" is wonerfully inventive; and the Cybermen are back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show but . . .","review":"As a fan of the original series - especially the golden age of Tom Baker (when he was still taking the show seriously) - I have not been disappointed with the new \\"Who.\\" From the wonderfully reworked title sequence and theme tune (so much better than the tinny version that introduced the show from late Baker onwards) the new series maintains much of the charm of the original without the wobbly sets. I loved Christopher Ecclestone's portrayal of the Doctor, so awaited this second season with a little trepidation. Although I find David Tennant's Doctor a little more superficial, he does a creditable job nevertheless.But WHY OH WHY are BBC DVDs SOOOOOO expensive? Sure, they're generally a quality product, but that doesn't justify charging two to three times as much as for an equivalent US series.

I can't wait for series 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doctor Who season 2","review":"David Tennant picks up where Christopher Eccleston left off without missing a beat. As the 10th and newest Doctor, Tennant's quirky Doc is refreshing and just funny enough to pull it off. His chemistry with Billie Piper, who plays Rose Tyler, is fantastic as the drama intensifies to a sad finale between the Doctor and Rose. I recommend season 2 as a great buy and the additional extras on the dvd's are fun to watch with all the behind scenes, personal video diaries and commentaries. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for the family","review":"Being a parent who was a fan of the original Dr. Who I was looking forward to introducing my kids (10 and over) to this series. Everyone loves it! It's clever, fast-paced, thought-provoking, funny and emotional; a great talking point.We loved the first series with Christopher Ecclestone but this one with David Tennant has reached new heights. Some of the episodes can be scary so probably not for younger kids but it's all done in such a smart and intelligent way. British natives will spot some clever references that had me chuckling.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigger scale & stranger stories","review":"The second series of the new Dr. Who is an even better production than the first series. The scope, quality, and uniquenesss of the stories have all improved. Just one small problem, Chris Eccleston in the first series was a far more interesting Doctor than this current one.The producers and writers have made the series accesible to non-fans, AND have given serious Who fanatics plenty of references to enjoy.

I started with the original series very first 3 arcs and have jumped around the series ever since. The new series is just as enjoyable, if not more so, than the originals, and now that i'm up to season 4, i have to say this has been my favorite so far. David Tennant and Billi Pipper play off each other so well, thats what makes this season so great. They have great chemistry together on screen. Add to that some great story lines from this series (The Christmas Invasion, School Reunion, Rise of the Cyberman,Age of Steel, The Impossible Planet, Satan Pit, Army of Ghosts, Doomsday) really add to just how great this series 2 really was.

It's like a mixture of the X-files and Sliders. I was on the edge of my seat with each exciting adventure, wondering how Rose and the Doctor were going to escape the aliens or the robots or the zombies. Rose and her mother (although sometimes got on my nerves) were much more likeable this season. And I can't say enough good things about the Doctor. He is so charismatic and funny, yet serious and dramatic when he needs to be. I can hardly wait for the third series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for any Doctor Who fan","review":"David Tennant is the most human doctor to date.

Dr Who was always great \\"cheesy\\" fun, but this new version takes itself far too seriously at times - making the cheese-factor something you laugh AT, rather than laugh along with. There are far too many episodes in London (it feels like a council promo at times...) and some of the supporting characters are hugely annoying - especially Mickey, who often had me cheering for the bad guys in the hope that the annoying little so-and-so would get killed in some hilarious (and preferably gory) fashion.On the plus side; David Tennant is perfect as the Doctor, and Billie Piper is also fantastic as the down-to-earth and likable sidekick - they have a great chemistry. Some of the visuals are excellent, and occasionally it does actually hit the mark when trying to be poignant.Unfortunately, this show misses a whole lot more than hits for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of flash and sfx but not a lot of substance","review":"I watched the second series, and it's decent, but so much of it is just flashy special effects and endless running. Gone is the thoughful writing of the past Doctor Who series. I guess if this is what people want, then fine, it will sell. But to me it's all rather hollow and anti-climatic. \\"Oh, another freaky monster... any minute now, they'll start running again\\", etc...I don't know... it just seems like with the earlier Doctors, the writing was so much more substantial. The acting was also a ton better.Plus what's the deal with the Daleks oversaturating the Eccleston/Tennant series?Ah well, my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just not good stuff","review":"I'm sorry, I'm a Doctor Who fan of old, and this new stuff just isn't it. The old Doctor Who of the 1960s and '70 may have had cheesy sets and lousy acting, BUT THE STORIES WERE GOOD! Most of these new stories are weak; \\"Love and Monsters\\" was one of the worst shows I have ever seen, in any series, much less Doctor Who. I would have utterly embarassed, if I were BBC, to put that show on the air. This teary, sappy, emotional stuff just doesn't work, it's not Doctor Who. And why so many episodes on earth? That's not Doctor Who, either. This guy travels, his Tardis takes him where he doesn't know where, not to London in different time periods. David Tennant is ok as a Dcotor Who; Billie Piper can't do anything well but cry. This soap opera stuff has got to go.If you are an old Doctor Who fan and haven't tried these new series yet, you'll be disappointed if you do. This stuff reeks, just bad stories, that's all there is to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful...","review":"David Tennant's mugging doesn't help the tired, repetitive scripting.

His 1st is lightning quick and full of energy. Only Earl Wild's 1st comes close to it. Janis' 3rd is second only to Argerich's with Chailly on Phillips. The faster pace that he and Argerich chooses for the 3rd is more in line with Rachmaninov's reading, unlike Ashkenazy's or Kissin's who chooses to take the opening more slowly. The recording quality of the RCA Living Stereo is quite good, although there are a couple of places where the sound does distort a bit. In the end, this is a very good CD well worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb rendition of a difficult work.","review":"A transparent, incredibly thoughtful rendition of Rachmaninoff's masterpiece.

I'm still new to photography but started to outgrow my original bag which was only able to hold my dslr and two lenses. I figured I needed a bag that I could grow into and finally decided on this bag. Another great thing about Domke is that there is an optional strap that could be bought to carry the bag as a backpack.Although I am very happy with this purchase, there are a couple of things I would change to make it even better. The bag is soft (floppy). It would be nice if it had some sort of under wiring to help keep its shape... specifically the lid portion. The front and side pockets are velcro'd shut. I would have preferred buttons of some sort. Ripping open a pocket to grab something can be annoying especially in quiet situations. The front two pockets can be opened after only unclipping the lid to the main compartment.

Most series that have that short amount don't uusally have good content. I've got to hand it to Genoen, which I've should've known based on Samurai Champloo and R.O.D. It has great storyline and a lot of good action, though I wish there had been longer action scenes.A couple things I'm disappointed with is the characters and their voice-overs. The unrefined seem to be in for comic relief, but it's very poor. Shiro's sexually comments and Kionosuke do it for me. I'd also would've liked to see a little more talk from Jubei's counterpart, Jubei II. Plus, the acting is a little too rehearsed. It doesn't seem very relaxed, but overall, I loved the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not durable, practical for toddlers","review":"These are cute shoes, but my 3-year-old came home from school after her first day wearing these shoes, and threads were already pulling from the seams.Within a week, the suede-like fabric that covers most of the shoe had already discolored to gray (and it wasn't dirt). I used a brush and suede cleaner (no soap or water), and it didn't help. They looked very old and worn out after only one week.Also, during the course of a regular outside play at school, she managed to tear the fabric completely off the toe, revealing the beige toe underneath the suede. Her toes were still protected, but it looked terrible. This isn't necessarily due to faulty manufacture; it's just that kids scuff the toes of their shoes.In summary, these would probably be fine for fashion wear, but I wouldn't recommend for school. In total, they lasted us about a month before I had to throw them away."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"absolutely horrible\\"","review":"After five months the tank started leaking and has ruined my carpet; and i have spent so much money on fish because they can't breath good and have died. i'm at a complete lost because i've had to sent the tank back at my expense.

After receiving the Olympus pair, I compared them both side by side and it was a no-brainer. The difference in image clarity, image brightness, comfort level (both holding the binoculars and looking through them) is astounding. The Nikon pair is far superior in every way (except compactness). Perhaps I should have gone for a pair somewhere in between these two size extremes.

What actally happened was the Dauphin of France, Henri's older brother, died that year, and under suspicious circumstances, too. Some suspected that Henri and his infamous (an unjustly maligned) wife Catherine de Medici persuaded an Italian to poison the unfortunate Dauphin, since the couple now stood first in line for the throne. (They didn't.) Henri's father took his first son's death hard, and the strain in the royal family affected the Court and the country for the remaining 9 years of Francois I's reign.

Rothkopf has written an apologia for the Clinton administration, not a serious history of the National Security Council. The research is shallow, based almost exclusively on interviews, and the treatment of the early period, when the role and functions of the NSC were being defined, is skimpy. Niggling errors further reduce the book's reliability. Paul Nitze, for example, was director of policy planning, not \\"Under Secretary\\" (sic) of state when he presided over the writing of NSC 68 in 1950. Too bad. It could have been an important contribution to the literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hair and Sweet Buttery Goodness","review":"I like the singer's hair. It makes him look like a douche.

This man raps about anything from how to dispose a dead body, to how he believes you should treat a woman. He really goes into details too.

I knew Brian McGrory's name from his Boston Globe columns (I'm originally from Lexington, MA), and I have to say that THE INCUMBENT is a gripping read.It starts off with the assassination of the president which takes a Boston journalist, Jack Flynn, on a deep cover investigation that is reminiscent (in a good way) of the hushed air around All the President's Men.But most importantly you can tell that McGrory knows of what he writes and the suspense of the book keeps building in surprising ways. If you want to feel what it's like to be a Beltway insider, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Couldn't Put It Down","review":"This fast-paced political thriller is what most books of this type are not -- written by someone who actually seems to know the worlds of politics and journalism. The voices of all the characters ring true, and from the most despicable to the most alluring I enjoyed meeting all of them. The jolts in the book were true, timed right, and absent the detour to implausibility taken by so many who try their hand at thriller fiction. The frequent asides, stage whispers really, to the reader also worked -- many provoked out loud laughter. All told, I couldn't put it down and hope this is not Mr. McGrory's last foray into political thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"re-reading original not condensed","review":"Being short on new books to read I picked up \\"The Incombent\\" original paperback off my shelf.

A shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Presidential Election Year Read","review":"THE INCUMBENT might not be the very best polictical thriller that I have ever read, but for a first novel, I rate it 4 stars. Brian McGrory has done a good job with his \\"hero\\" Jack Flynn. The obvious plot flaws, as pointed out by other reviewers, do not detract from the storyline, it just carried me along to its exciting conclusion. The author paints a good picture of DC politics and the many journalists who cover the President of the United States. I felt as if I were right in the White House briefing room. McGrory does not mind making jokes at the expense of his fellow journalists-himself included. Read this book and learn how jounalists should feel about the government and the Constiution of the United states. The fictional President Hutchins has quite a past-judge for yourself! The highest praise that I can give the THE INCUMBENT is that I will probably read his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of suspense and humor","review":"This was one of the best books I've read in months and months, if not years. The plot was riveting, but far beyond that, the characters were real and full and funny, with backgrounds and traits that made you feel invested in their lives. And beyond even that, this book gave a fascinating inside view of how reporters really get their stories, and how they get along with the people they cover -- in this case, the president of the United States. After reading this, I feel like I've been in the Oval Office.A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't trust their recommendations...

Help us John Williams, you're are only hope!May the force be with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of my favorite soundtracks","review":"I am a great fan of all Star Wars music and especially to this one. It has a good combination of different music kinds. Disc one contains beautifull and interesting themes,while the disc two has more victorious action music. John Williams is also my favorite composer in film scores. He has so easy for making melodys and themes for different characters. This soundtrack has much lighter music than the sequels. For example,the Force theme,first heard in Imperial Attack,is the perfect introduction theme. The \\"Main Titles/Rebel Blockade Runner\\" is the perfect,massive main theme. If you want action music, \\"The Battle of Yavin\\" is a good,nine-minute track filled with different melodys. And the Ceremony Music heard at the end of disc 2 is the grand finale - a victorious version of the Force theme. The Burning Homestead is filled with a very sad version of the same theme. I hope this review is helpfull to you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful...","review":"If Star Wars could be compleatly discribed in music, this would be it! Archival bonuses include the Alternate Binary Sunset and starting at 5 minutes on the Alternate Binary Sunset track, (track 13, CD 1)all five takes of the Main Title can be heard incuding slate numbers and incidental noise. A fantastic pair of CDs that any Star Wars/Williams fan would treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good score, but...","review":"Okay, let's get this straight - I love Star Wars, I love the movies, I love the music, and I absolutely love everything John Williams has done. The only reason I gave this score 4 stars was because I feel that the Empire Strikes Back score is better. If it were possible, I'd've given ESB 5 and ANH 4.9, but since that isn't possible, this is what I had to do. It is a wonderful score, an essential addition to any fan of Star Wars or John Williams (I'm both) and includes a few cool extras that weren't included in the movies (along with everything that WAS in the movies, complete and in order). Bottom line - if you just want a couple discs of Star Wars, go for Empire Strikes Back. Otherwise, get them all - I'm sure you'll love them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item description is misleading","review":"This ebook contains ONLY Poems and Ballads, Series I -- not, as the item description states, a much larger compilation of works.

Even in this new world, Max was able to use his own method of deduction of how things worked.Again, although the language (\\"adamant\\" didn't seem a word that a young boy would use, for example) and violence seemed a bit adult for younger readers, Willingham put together a great story that will be enjoyed by many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good YA","review":"This is pretty entertaining young adult fiction, with an edge, and a deeper level of meaning than the surface.

Although the zipper opening is a bit on the small side, I was able to get my three section 7 1/2 ft. pre-lit tree inside with help from my son. You need someone to hold the bag open and the other person to actually put the tree parts in the bag.I purchased two bags because I have two trees, the other being a 6 ft. pencil tree with a wooden trunk. Only the top ten inches or so separates on this tree, so I was concerned that the whole trunk might not fit. Again, with help from my son, we were able to get the tree in with an inch or so to spare in length. There was so much extra space otherwise, that I probably could have put both trees in the same bag with a tight fit.The quality of the material used for the bag could be better, but then it would cost considerably more. I only paid $6.99 each with free shipping, so I definitely feel like I will get more out of it than what I paid.

The bag is huge. My tree is only 7 feet tall and there is a ton of room left over in the bag. Not to mention the handles on the bag make it super easy to move around.

Gary Webb, the journalist first brought the drug connection with the CIA to the American publics attention which resulted in the CIA going to LA and explain they weren't in the drug trade, this meeting resulted in Mike Rupperts declaration contray to the CIA's story of non involvement.

I was hoping it would help turn a Maxpedition Jumbo Versipack into a small camera bag. It didn't work out, but I can use it for other things. What really gets me is how poorly constructed this thing is. Fabric is very thin and single stitched. There is no padding on the bottom, just a thin piece of fabric. The fabric on the bottom panel is not hemmed in places and the fabric is fraying. The padding is firm packing foam type paneling. The padding is not sewn in at the bottom and it slides out easily.

To me this CD is priceless. All of the tracks are exceedingly beautiful but to best one is the Agnus Dei. That one brings me to tears every time. I don't know whether it is the most sad song or the most heavenly I have ever heard. It cracks my heart open and ache with it's piercing sweetness.

Some of the best recordings (including the Baltimore Symphony and the Bernstein) last 10 minutes in length! Unfortunately some of the groups on this CD just tear through the piece (4:52?!) The Boston Symphony Orchestra does a nice job with the piece but they still play it too quickly (just under 8 minutes). This piece requires such control to play and, unfortunately, most of the groups that perform it on this CD do not display that. The choral version of this piece is truly magnificent but listeners would do better to get the CD \\"Agnus Dei\\" (Gregorio Allegri) which includes a beautiful version of the Barber along with a wonderful collection of other songs. For an instrumental version of the Barber listeners need go no further than the Thomas Schippers version which is perhaps the most beautiful recording of the piece ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime adagio, great performances, but...","review":"This is a wonderful CD, but listeners should consider the fact that they are going to be hearing the same piece of music over and over again -- eight times. True, each rendition is different. But after listening to the whole CD once, you will need a bit of a break before you can listen to it again. (Listening to it repeatedly could cause madness and delirium to ensue.) I would still recommend the CD -- it is unique, and it's interesting to compare the different versions, up to a point -- but a collection of adagios (including Barber's, of course) by various composers might withstand repeated playing better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"If you only listen to one version on this CD, listen to David Pizarro's organ version.

In the wake of the tragedies of September 11, 2001, the sombre and lingering dissonance and heart rendering aches of this piece tore at each of our hearts. The strings' echoes mingled in the concert hall amidst the sounds of muffled sobs and the sights of a community drawn together in its suffering.I will never hear this piece again without being reminded of those moments, and the heart-rendering anguish that our nation has experienced over the last 5 days.

We have two dogs and it is funny how they start to pant when the fireplace DVD is running. It is so realistic that they are sure they must be getting hot.

Now that he is nearly a year old, the seat is well-worn, but it was well-worth the investment. Several people have commented on how well/straight our son sits. We used this seat in place of a high chair or booster seat (multiple times per day) for about seven months. Additionally, it worked very well for visits to other people's homes or restaurants since it is light weight and relatively small. Today, at twenty-two pounds, our son fits in his chair still (though his chubby legs are becoming a tight fit). The seat itself has sustained some paint wear on the pommel, but the chair is in great shape otherwise. It cleans up nicely. We will definitely be saving our Bebe pod for any future children to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have for Medieval Embroidery Enthusiasts","review":"This book is a fabulous reproduction of the entire tapestry in full color, photographic format. The photography is amazing and allows seeing down to the stitch level. The accompanying text is superb and detailed, explaining the text and subtext of the Tapestry, the history behind it, and various studies and conservation efforts which have been attempted upon it. There is also some discussion about the context of this work in embroidery, including its similarity to Scandinavian tapestries. A must have for those interested in early-medieval embroidery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, but stuffy","review":"The Bayeaux Tapestry is a gorgeous work of art that has great historical importance. This book does it full justice. The first section is simply the tapestry itself, with a pullout section of brief explanations of each scene. This allows you to look at the work itself and appreciate its beauty and craftsmanship and to form your own opinions and interpretations. (By the way, the photographs are so good you think you can reach into the page and feel the stitching.)Following this are translations of the Latin inscriptions, further explanations of the story and explorations of the artistic and historic significance of the tapestry. The author's language gets a bit technical in the latter sections, but with the help of a basic dictionary are easy to understand. Even without looking up the scholarly words, one can appreciate what the author is saying.I highly recommend this book. More than worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Beautiful Book","review":"This book has magnificent color plates of the Tapestry, so large and clear that the stitches are easily seen, which is excellent for embroiderers.

Overall, a marvelous contribution to the study of this historic work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it for the title track & live tracks","review":"The title track to this one is great, and the live tracks kick butt, but everything else is pretty much unlistenable.

While Dale's voice was as nice as ever, that didn't keep them from sounding like every other pop/dance band out at the time.The album does have a few redeeming qualities.

Basically you have the foam padding sewed directly to the cover, sort of sandwich style. There is no material folded over to protect the edge: the foam is exposed, roughly cut and little pieces are falling off. The sides are constructed better: basically pockets with foam inside and neatly covered edges. As an insert it works well and my EOS 7D and 15-85 USM fit fine. Just not the class act I expected from Domke. For a few more bucks I could have gotten a Billingham insert. Now those are made with tender loving care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Premiere Treatise on Showmanship for Magicians","review":"This is such a wonderful book on the proper showmanship for magicians.

As a fan of Elmore Leonard for years, I'm always on the lookout for good crime fiction. Rarely do I find it, but STREET RATS is a wonderful exception to the rule. This book pulls you in from the first page and gives you a gritty, realistic look at professional criminals and their hell-for-leather lifestyles. In the mean streets of Milwaukee, a gang of thieves is hired to heist an armored car and end up being killed off one by one. If you like your fiction weak and bloodless, don't bother applying here. STREET RATS is tough, brutal, and uncompromising. The writing is incredible, the dialouge pulled straight from life, and the characterizations flawless. And you know what?

By midday I need to go over my face once more and by 5PM, I look like I haven't shaved in a day or two.This product is not all bad. It is very quiet, which is nice. And it did not irritate my skin whatsoever, even the first week (like many other electric shavers).

I like the stand -- reduces bathroom counter clutter. It is quieter than my older unit. Seems to hold a charge a bit longer -- I recharge about every other week.

I decided to buy this one since it is a top model in new Norelco series and got 1) so called \`SmartTouch' Reflex Action System 2) rinse clean.Now I have used it for over a month and feel a little disappointed. The biggest problem is the hair chamber isn't very well sealed so while shaving the chopped hair will fly over on my hand, on floor. If don't clean out the hair after use it can become very irritating on next shave (even rinse after each use still cannot totally keep it from happening). Another thing is that SmartTouch, I have to say I cannot tell anything good about it except a feeling of fragileness.Overall: it is a decent shaver and does its job. You HAVE TO rinse it clean EVERY TIME."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good. No major compaints.","review":"I have shaved with it four times so far. Each time takes a little less time. The first time it took me about 20 minutes because I have to break in my beard and skin. I have to learn the right technique to use it properly and quickly. The manufacturer states that it takes daily shaves for about 3 weeks before you can work up to a very good, quick shave. On the closest of 3 settings, the shave is remarkably close. It feels like it is as close as a conventional safety razor shave.It has taken a little more time than I expected to clean and dry it after each use, probably because I am a new owner of the product. The last cleaning took about 5 minutes, which was not as long as the first time. It is very easy to clean because the moving parts can be rinsed and cleaned in running water. I like that. It feels very comfortable when I hold it.I cannot say yet whether I would buy the product again, but I have no significant compaints so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used for 3 months so far - very quiet, good shave","review":"This is remarkably quiet compared to my previous Norelco which was in about the same class as this one, but with double row of blades.

This generation is, without doubt, their best yet. It gives a very close and comfortable shave, and no, it is NOT the equal of a blade. No electric shaver is. Two of the best improvements are the washable heads (I always washed out my Norelcos, but it was never recommended), and the improved battery technology, which permits this remarkably quiet shaver to go for weeks without a re-charge. Its ergonomics are excellent. It's design is sporty and fun, and the tiny quartz clock, seeming frivolous at first, is a nice touch which I have come to rely on. Five-stars here, but there is one minor, annoying detail they dropped the ball on: It's a challenge to get this thing back onto its stand, usually requiring several tries.

I'm here to tell you that, in my opinion, nothing matches what this shaver can do. It literally glides across my face, catching every whisker in its path. Even those hard to reach areas just under your nose are nothing for this puppy. The only things I dislike about it are the accessories, which are cheaply made and mostly unnecessary. But, you know what? I bought the 9160XL hoping it would shave me better. And I can honestly say that I'm amazed at the shaves I'm getting. Sometimes, we really do get what we pay for.

Also, the need to purchase the oil and cleaning supplies.

Other positive things about this model are that it is easy to clean and has a great internal battery (fully charging in less than an hour).

The charging stand, while attractive in appearance, does not make it easy to insert the shaver. You don't need the stand to charge the shaver.3.

I didn't notice much of a variation in the feel of the rotating blades by adjusting the personal comfort control between the soft sensitive vs normal skin setting. It's not as fast as the razor, but it does get close and my skin no longer protests as vigorously as before.

So I just removed the stand completely and charge using only the cord, just like my old razors. Wish Norelco would buy back the stand as it really serves no purpose.

After a month the motor started bogging down. Even with ongoing careful cleaning and proper charging of the batteries, the shaver eventually refused to run. Customer service was obsessed with charging. Did you charge it for more than four hours? Then plug it in again and charge it for only four hours. That made sense to them. I sent it back and Norelco sent me a new one. The new one lasted as long. It is now beginning to slow and bog down. I just ordered a Panasonic.

The speed of the shaver is audibly slower than all previous models. This makes for a far more uncomfortable shave, pulling in places. I still have my previous model (8825) which gives a FAR more superior shave to this 9160XL. My blanket trust of Norelco is no longer there and I am suspicious of new models based on my great disappointment with this one. When I called Norelco to complain, the woman on the other end didn't seem too concerned and said I was stuck with it. It was a Christmas gift that I didn't start using until after the 30 day period had passed. 2 stars is the most I can give and even that's a stretch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shaver","review":"After replacing a much cheaper razor with this norelco model, it felt like going from a model T to a BMW.

I like the rubber grips as well. The only problem I have with it is when shaving below the nose area. It has a tendency to pull the hairs, maybe it's because the heads rotate at a slower speed than my old one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shave!","review":"I was never a Norelco man, but two years ago I bought my first Norelco. They are a little more spendy than other big name shavers so thats why I never bought one before. Well I was pretty impressed with that Norelco. I shave my head every other day so it has to be good! I was very impressed with Norelco so when the 9160XL came out I waited for the reviews and they sounded good so I took the plunge and upgraded to the XL. Wow!!! I'm even more impressed with this one. Great close shave and lasts a long time on a charge. I've owned the XL for 6 weeks or so and only recharged it once. I'm glad I decided to pay the $130. price tag for this great shaver. I'm looking forward to a long relationship with this, my second, Norelco! Might as well order a set of replacement blades for $30. at the same time.

But the best feature of all is the razor's perfect function as a shaver that hits every area, but is not harsh. Razor burn is a problem for me, or was.

There is no way to slow it down unless you keep pausing and going back in which case it still speeds you through the screens. The voice is very mono tone. They use abbreviations that are hard to follow and do not remind you of what they are. I would not reccomend this to anyone who is a beginner.

I liked most of the girls. There was one girl with an awkward boob job that didn't do much for me. The bikes are nice scenary, the girls tend to be better scenary.

I got another DVD with the same defects! I recommend paying the extra price for a better quality DVD from a different studio. As for the movie, Fernando Soler and Lilia Prado put on a great show, supported by María Elena Marquez. Emilio Fernández does a cameo.

They range from financial limitations, where the patients cannot afford state-of-the-art lab tests to accurately identify the source of illness, to malpractices where doctors misdiagnose diseases due to ignorance and incompetence. Perhaps the most common source of misdiagnosis is the lack of effective patient-doctor communications. Most patients generally have little medical knowledge on the diseases associated with their symptoms. As a consequence, patients are not prepared to ask inquisitive questions when visiting doctor's office. Doctor's initial diagnoses are often passively accepted without questions and challenges. In the absence of critical discussions, the doctors are easily induced to complacency. The rate of misdiagnosis rises accordingly.Best way to avoid being misdiagnosed is to be informed.

After you listen to \\"Dave\\" you'll bust a gut laughing before you even know it. \\"Basketball Jones\\" is a killer as well, the sexy cheerleader vocals and hilarious lyrics make it a definate C&C; favorite. Many times I've caught myself headbanging to \\"Earache my Eye\\", that catchy guitar riff is still stuck in my head to this day. But the biggest gut-buster of the whole album is in \\"Sergeant Stadanko\\" when Chong says \\"Well if it's oregano, you can put it in your soup and eat it.

But I watched it again the next night since it was still in the DVD player, & I was too lazy to get out of the recliner to change it. It made a little more sense second time around. I've since watched it at least eight times (laying in bed, watching the streaming version on Netflix at bedtime). It puts me to sleep without drugs.

I convince a bunch of friends to come over. I supply the beer and snacks.

Regardless, this is probably director Robert Altman's worst film. Newman tries but he's virtually stranded by the inert material he's given to work with. The unsuspecting viewer is left trying to pinch themselves to draw blood just to survive this cinematic endurance test. The film in a nutshell is a post-apocalyptic dystopian fantasy about a game of death involving alot of geriatric Euros spouting out meaningless philosophy about the meaning of life. Who actually thought this stuff would be interesting? Altman can blame the writers but be contributed to the script. Of mild semi-interest is the art direction. Pretty heady praise.

Much like Gould, Altman quickly burned out, and there's hardly a spark of imagination to be found in \\"Quintet.\\"Set in some barren wasteland of the future, it involves a macabre twist on backgammon in which the loser is murdered. The location, a snow swept Montreal, and the contrasting claustrophobic interior scenes, are appealing to the eye, and the cast, headed by Paul Newman, is not without interest.But \\"Quintet\\" is as cold and unmoving as its landscapes, simply another credit in Altman's filmography that boasts of his maverick credentials, but makes you wonder why \\"maverick credentials\\" are something to boast about.Brian W.

Altman, Newman, Anderssen, Gassman, with this line-up you expect great things; you get nothing. Understanding the Altman is trying to create a decrepit post-apocalytical world that is covered with snow and ice and where food is running out as most species have been killed; if this movie was any slower you'ld have to run it in reverse. In the first half hour we spend twenty-five minutes watching Newman walk through the snow. The dialogue is so sparse that it's makes a Sylvester Stallone movie seem like a group of chatterboxes.There's little else to say except this was a very large waste of money and talent to tell us that people can be cruel and love blood sport.

It was not all just Michael McDonald's influence either. Pat Simmons was going thru a very creative time, having more creative freedom with Tom Johnston gone I guess, and Jeff Baxter fit in perfectly with the new soul/jazz sound. As a result, the Doobie Brothers won the respect of a much broader listening audience, and deservedly so. the songs on this CD will stand the test of time and touch many more hearts in the future generations.

I own and listen to both volumes and the 1st is great in it's own right but give this group credit for changing and yet maintaining excellence. Look past your dislike of this one person in the group and listen. That's why they make music for you to listen. I wish the group could get back together with Mike.

It's saying something when I had that original release on an 8-Track cartridge inherited from my parents.So here's Vol. 2 and it mainly showcases the Michael McDonald years. The problem I have with it is that it is a short release (definitely shorter than Vol. 1). And certainly Michael McDonald had many more hits with the Doobies than what's chronicled here. One may be led to believe (what a fool) that the official Warner archives are lacking. But the cover artwork looks slick. Too slick.

The Comas blend a new sound of instrumental beats, fuzzy guitar solo's and amazing keyboards blended with psychedelic sounds of yesterday. I would recommend any music lover picking up \\"Spells\\".. The band show's there diverse style in almost every song. Definitly the best I've heard in 07.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky find","review":"This was a lucky find on Amazon. I had no idea who The Comas were, but the odd cover attracted me enough to check the previews of the songs and I liked their sound instantly. Some of the melodies are simply brilliant and my absolute favorite songs are \\"now I'm a spider\\" and \\"come my sunshine\\". Now I still don't know who the Comas are, but I sure am glad I purchased this cd. Refreshing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Comas....GREAT band!","review":"I have been following The Comas for quite a long time, and I consider them one of the best new bands out there anywhere.

The episode \\"When Iam 65\\" did not have original sparkle of before scripts. The cast was brillant but the writing went flat. It seems there were long pauses between lines. It seems it ran out of steam and to call it quits. Seeing the BBC studio was a surprising treat and to actually see the writers and directors of the show...Richard Briers does an intro and is brillant. Penelope Keith, Felicity Kendal and Paul Eddington were were bang on...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Neighbors Royal Command Performance","review":"The \\"Royal Command\\" was a lot of hype.

Ali has spent all her life feeling guilty about this. She strives to succeed at something and finally finds it in a candy business, Decadent Delights. She needs a handyman and finds him in the form of Matt Baker, a skinny, haunted man who won't talk about himself. But Ali has reawakened his appetite for food...and for life. Now he has ideas to improve her business, but first he must face his past. Here the magic is in the details. The main characters feel like people you know, and the secondary characters are fantastic, especially Ali's dramatic, matchmaking, meddling mother and her pet pig.

This one just feels right. Only regret is that there is not much padding to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Use More Padding, But I don't Mind","review":"As other reviewers have said, it could be more protective, but for casual usage when I go hiking or out with friends I feel perfectly comfortable bringing my camera in this. So I'm giving it 5 stars because it meets all my needs.The build quality is superb, it looks great, and it's really the perfect size for everyday use. I'm sure glad I got this over the smaller more compact version. I have enough room to carry anything I want along with my dslr with lens mounted, and another lens. Because it's so comfortable I find myself bringing it along whenever I leave the house because it's a convenient place to leave my belongings, and that's just what I'd want from my camera bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Family","review":"We could not even watch the whole movie.

Ok the opening music you can look pass that, but if you are a die-hard fan you can see this season is edited to s**t. Nothing worse then watching a show you pretty much know and you say hey it's missing a section like in the Christmas one, Vegas one, Weather one, I can go on and on. You would expect to see that on re=runs on TV but on something that you dish out 30 plus $$ for I say it's a rip off on the public. There is nothing on the box set to tell you that they have been edited. No way will I buy the next season till I read some reviews. Your better off if you have them on tape is to either burn them for yourself or watch the tape and fast foward thru the commercials.

Al Bundy is my hero, and much like him I lost my virginity in the back of a Dodge. BUT, who ever is putting these DVD's out has nixed the Classic \\"Love and Marriage\\" theme song to SAVE MONEY on Royalties, Regardless as to what you have heard about the Sinatra estate asking for too much. Instead replacing it with a second rate, knock off train wreck instrumental that slightly resembles the original theme. It sucks and I hate the company for cutting corners so they can put more money in there pockets, sacrificing quality for profit.

However...it seems they couldnt afford the usage of their theme sonf anymore or something because the theme song is no longer \\"love and marriage\\" by frank sinatra. Instead its some other song they made up to imitate that song! Quite bogus if u ask me. I was quite dissapointed between episodes. But other than that a good season to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD BAD","review":"I am so tired of buying TV shows on DVD just to get the edited syndicated versions.

I returned my set the next day. There should be a law requiring any distributer to post clearly on the DVDs that the episodes are not the complete episodes. This is Married with children the Incomplete 4th season. I am a huge fan of MWC, I grew up getting \\"fatherly\\" advise from Al and the \\"motherly\\" love only Peggy can offer.

The book was entertaining, as I remember anyway, but the film was just excruciating. The acting was totally unconvincing and the plot was...... was there a plot? Can I think of anything good about it? I don't even think the scenery and cinematography were memorable. Don't even watch it on cable for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"The book was awesome and kept me interested and intrigued to the end. There was not enough time in the movie to create the depth that was present in the book. Thus it was a superficial experiencial recap of the book instead of what could have been a great insightfull movie. I would reread the book before rewatching the movie. So Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to play anywhere","review":"For some strange reason, this DVD will not play on any PC's, laptops, DVD players, or even PS3s. The DVD box states that the DVD was created in the U.S. and made to play in the U.S. I have gone to friend's houses, relative's houses, but to no avail. I cannot play the DVD. I was very excited to have been able to find it since I read the book a few years back. I will have to find this movie by other means. I just wish I hadn't thought I would eventually find somewhere that I could actually play it. Hence why I did not return the DVD in the allotted time to receive a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Acting, Choppy storyline.","review":"Glad I saw this for free with Amazon Prime. The acting in this move was beyond pathetic. It seems the goal of this movie was to explain the Celestine Prophecy. It fails miserably. Ater watching this movie, I had no idea until the end what it actually was about. They explained the 9 parts of it in writing, right before the credits. It did not explain how you get to this specialized evolutionary state, just that you have to open yourself up. Achieving the level of spirituality described in this movie would take many, many years of prayer, meditation, and dedication to the faith. One would not be able to fall into it like the main character in this movie. I really would not recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Film and Story","review":"I received this film, after a friend mentioned that I might wish to view it.

The visual is outstanding.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I highly recommend it.The book is next to read. :-) Being a Filmmaker-Director-Writer-Script writer and Producer, it is always interesting to see how the written story was transformed into a visual story.I often wonder, \\"where did it begin?\\"... do you? :-)My best to everyone, GET TO THE MOVIE THEATRES and WATCH FILMS!!! :-)Always Nicholas in Seattle"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Celestine Prophecy - The Movie","review":"I felt that this movie was worth seeing as I hadn't read the book until recently.

Found myself looking at the clock to see when it would end. Watched until the end hoping for some \\"wow-factor\\" ending, but it was a little bit disappointing. There were several scenes within the movie where it felt like they were explaining (their) religion to you, although it was intended for the character nodding his head in understanding. The movie plot really was kinda poor since the main theme seemed to be to share this religious outlook with you and to fashion it into a story somehow that didn't quite flow so well. Wasn't the worst religious movie I've seen, but was just below entertaining for me and if I could, I would take back those two hours of my life. Would have preferred to learned about this religion (read or watched) something more direct instead of seeing this somewhat cheezy, low-budget film that it was delivered though. Just my opinion though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celestine Prophecy, WOW!","review":"Ths is a book that has the potential to change lives for the better. It is fiction wrapped around what may well be truth. It can help us all to grow spiritually, no matter what religion we adhere to, and can help us to find the way to reach or at least get a lot closer to the goal of peace, love, interdependence, and understanding.It is a book to be read multiple times because there is always at least a couple of nuggets that you will uncover each time you read it.It would be great to connect with others who find the same benefits and learn more and share to help each other grow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy Jan....","review":"Sorry but I have to disagree with the above reviews. While I enjoyed the book I found the film to be a turn off. While the scenery was nice it didn't come anywhere near to being as good as the actually written story.It seems to race around everywhere and I felt it combined parts from the 1st book and the 2nd book.And what was the deal with the \\"Obi-wan Kenobi\\" priest at the end??? I don't recall it being like that in the book.I'm not against new age but this was really wishy washy and turned my friends off even wanting to read the book.I know it's about co-incidences but the major one here is that co-incidentally my friends hated it.Try the book. It's better value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Celestine Prophecy the Movie","review":"A good movie. A good visual representation of The Celestine Prophecy. Visually beautiful and the importantmessages about energy were well done.

No wonder a ludicrously simplistic \\"makes you feel well\\" trashy book is behind this embarassing movie. And please, stop abusing the word energy.. we are in the XXI century, almost everyone has has a bit of physics education.. go find some more nebulous concept for your phychobabble...Time ago it was \\"magnetic fluid\\".. now \\"energy\\"..

The series of books are so dynamic and prolific. I especially loved the Celestine Prophecy. Maybe that dynamism can't be translated onto film? I find the movie boring and hard to get into. It's a pity because the book is fabulous and chock-full of useful information even though it's mostly fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"There still room for hope","review":"I like the story very much. If I hadn't read the book first might have not watched the hole movie. I felt the movie was a little vague in developing the story. It moved a little fast and would be easy to miss what was happing. I did like it. I am goimg to watch it again. The message is uplifting for a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book first!","review":"For those who are interested in the Celestine Prophecy, I recommend reading the book first. The movie viewer may be a little confused by the storyline without any previous knowledge of the book.

Anyone interested in the laws of attraction, energy, or spirituality will relate to this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World We Would Like to See","review":"The movie is good, but the book is better. The whole idea is a bit on the \\"New Age\\" side of things. But it is a good adventure - both in reading and in thinking. Both the book and the movie are well worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, SHUT my mouth","review":"I watched the 'making of' to see how this lame excuse for spiritual enlightenment got made. I was shocked to find that: it was a best selling novel, that the screenplay (LOL) was written by the writer who also produced it and according to his claims there were many studios that were interested in making the movie. They should have let the studios make it because this is the lamest dialog I've heard since The Matrix and this self rightous gobbly-goop stinks worst than Star Wars. They must of said prophecy forty times in the first half hour. This can only be equealed by the repetition of Fordo in Lord of the Rings.I'm curious to see if the book is as bad as the movie but I'm a slow reader and I do believe. I do believe I've wasted enough time on this already. Want to watch something spiritually uplifting? Watch \\"The Song of Bernadette\\". I have a long list of movies that I feel delve into the mysteries of life and The Celestine Prophecy is not one."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need to read the three books first.","review":"I read these books several years ago and loved them.

For those who loved the book, watching the movie is a must because you will be transported in an experiential way to the spiritual awakening that James Redfield has revealed in his books. I would give this a 5-star rating if this movie was accessible to everyone.For those who haven't yet read the book:The Celestine Prophecy, I recommend that you start there first. Otherwise points brought up in the movie won't make much sense. I also recommend that you try a contemporary novel in a similar visionary style to Redfield's writing: Nexus: A Neo Novel...a beautiful story of transformation by Deborah Morrison & Arvind Singh set at spiritual retreat.Recommend:The Celestine ProphecyNexus: A Neo Novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Better.","review":"Better read the book then watching the video.I bet you, people that never read the book would never able understand the story in the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I read the book.","review":"I've heard that the book is 100x better than the movie this film was utter garbage.
