Leonard Garment (once a jazzman, an identity he shares with Alan Greenspan) was in the presidential orbit and well-acquainted with most of the principals, and his search for Deep Throat is truly a labor of love. I was particularly pleased to see him recognize the long-neglected contribution of James Hougan (\\"Secret Agenda\\") to unraveling the Watergate puzzle. Garment's careful evaluation of the principal suspects and his conclusion as to the identity of Deep Throat make for a refreshing journey down memory lane. Along the way he offers a balanced, nuanced portrait of Richard Nixon - arguably the definitive American politician of the Cold War era."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"This is must-read for any serious political junkie. Garment provides a pretty compelling argument for the identity of the most mysterious informant of the century.

The highlight of Garment's book is when he recalls Woodward & Bernstein's classic All The President's Men. While he goes through the shortlist of who is suspected of being Deepthroat and disecting the characteristics of DT to the people he actually knew was very interesting to the say the least. But when Garment states that DT might actually be a composite of several people in the administration, I started to lose interest. I still read it twice though. Very Good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charles was my best friend for awhile....","review":"I grew up with Charlie Cohen, and we were best friends; he lived a block from me, and I spent a great deal of time at his house and with his parents. It was a shock to hear he had killed them and gone on the run, and I spent about 4 hours meeting with the author as he researched this book. I was quite impressed; overall, he was quite accurate in his depiction of the Charlie that I knew (but boy, did he change!).

It's still very cute and very sweet and gender-neutral, but it's not a pure red. This only matters to me because red is my baby girl's favorite color, but she doesn't seem as madly attracted to the orange as she is to all things red.In any case, I still like the toy and she still likes it too. It's not her very favorite (she shows teething preference for her plastic keys and her little Haba wooden toys like her froggie and ring-rattle), but she still likes it. She gnaws on the head and chomps down on the ring. She loves feeling the little antennae with her mouth and scratching the fabric with her fingernails.I think it's cute and I like that it's free of BPA and other questionable substances. I leave it in her crib in case she needs something to chew on at bedtime.

I also like the way they give you differnt color combinations for most of the sweaters also. Just in case you don't care for the colors it's knitted in in the book, they give you another color combination. I definatley recommend purchasing a Lopi color card sample if your not able to actually see the yarn before you buy it. I got mine on line where I buy my lopi yarn.

Scott also does the mirror image style that is easy to follow... and you actually get a real work out. You actually learn several moves, step by step. Scott takes you though the moves and then gives you 2 separate routines (a warm up and a work out). Once you get the moves down you can skip straight to the workouts on the menu. There is also an added feature with about 6 extra moves that aren't in his workout. Scott isn't bad looking either, and the scenery is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nothing like picture","review":"First of all, the pictured ring looks nothing like what arrived.

The characters appear exaggerated to the point of being perfectly archetypal for the Grimm genre, and yet somehow it doesn't read as cliche'. Very enjoyable!But what really amazes me is the quality of what appears to be this illustrator's first work. Perhaps this is just his first national release? In any case, it's a hell of a comic.The bio in the inside cover points to both his web site (thecomic.com) which is also very good, and also to another book in the works (Beowulf). I can't wait!

But this particular band, featuring Butch Baldassari, Jim Hurst, Scott Vestal and fiddler Tammy Rogers, among others, has surely racked up a few more credibility points than, say, the Crown Music Orchestra or the Red River Singers. This is an all-instrumental set of country cover tunes, sticking pretty faithfully to the '50s/'60s heartsong canon, with grassed-up versions of oldies by Hank Williams, Don Gibson, Harlan Howard, and others. It's not the most innovative or rip-roaring album ever, but the picking's pretty nice, and it's easy on the ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent scanner for the price","review":"Contrary to the first reviewer, a passive terminator is not needed if this is the only SCSI device in the computer and you are using the bundled SCSI card. All I needed to do was plug in the SCSI card, hook up and scanner, install the driver, and boom, it's working! You do, however, need a terminator if you're hooking up the scanner to a third party SCSI card (ex. Adaptec). The scanner produces excellent scans for negatives, and very good results with slide films. Bundled software, Mirafoto, has ver nice features and is easy to use. However, for certain negative films it does not produce the most accurate colors, but that can easily be corrected in any imaging software (Photoshop 5 LE is included).

I did break one of the tire levers though. Annoying because it is used in conjunction with the chain tool. The chain tool is an excellent one by itself. Overall, awesome multitool. compact, sleek. A touch heavy compared to the mini mini multitools also out there, but functionally this is as good as having a a bag full of shop tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multi-function tool that often fails to function","review":"The tool looks good out of the packaging and has a decent heft. I was initially pleased.First inner-tube change, snap goes one of the flimsy tire levers (see the image I uploaded). Disappointing, but not so big a deal since I have other levers I prefer.Now for a simple chain repair. No problem getting the pin out, but forget about ever getting it back in. There is not enough thread to accommodate the pulled pin, so trying to re-engage the thread while keeping the pin aligned was a real pain. Then, as I finally feel a bit of bite, it turns out the thread is giving way.

The philips screw driver is too short and I couldn't adjust my derailer with it, and the flat head screw driver is too short as well. I couldn't get the tire levers off without another screw driver and then I scratch the multi-tool up.

Granted it was only around $50 but trust me you will regret every penny. Its impossible to set the time on this thing since the button that you are supposed to hold onto it doesn't work 90% of the time. When you have it pressed it just literally doesn't move the clock hands and as you take the batteries out and reinsert them it magically starts moving again and when you push the clock set button again same thing happens and it doesn't DO ANYTHING!

I did manage to set it once (how I don't know) but, come DST and trying to set it ahead one hour.... well, I gave up on it.Bottom line - if you want to know the temperature indoors and out as well as the humidity, then this works great.

Unacceptable cuts!","review":"Shostakovitch's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk is a masterpiece. A previous movie had been made of it, less effective than this one. Petr Weigl film is nice to watch but has a major drawback: more than 50 minutes of the score are cut. Whichever may have been the rationale for such choice, it is hardly understandable. Due to some of the cuts, the sequence of the plot even becomes somewhat strange because you feel that something must surely be missing in the action. Leaving out scenes like the Boris' ghost scene is unforgivable - this scene clearly shows that Katerina is haunted by the spirit of the man she killed (establishing the connection with Shakespeare's Macbeth and Verdi's opera). So, to me, due maily to the cuts but also to some dubious director's choices, this movie rates very low. Unfortunate, but true, considering that it could easily have been otherwise. Respecting the whole score, for instance, would have done a much better job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-mapping for fun and profit","review":"I acquired this for a graduate college course, but never really got into it until we started using it in my job to map out the flow of online instructional curricula.

The song, clocking in at over 8 min, is an utter waste of said amount of time. I thought it would be a nice ambient track, but it's an over-rated Paul Oakenfold rip-off.Yeah, you know, Oakenfold, the techno 'musician' that makes money just for making crap that a 10-year old can make with the same equipment. I remember hearing Oakenfold's 'remix' of 'Natural Blues'; it sounded like he had this 8 min piece of techno garbage lying around, which he put a few vocal samples on and called it a remix. Well, that's pretty much what 'Princess' is, very disappointing to see Moby stoop so low; I take it he must've been bored one evening.The track 'Flying Foxes' can be found on the 'Play B-Sides' album so that would be a much better buy.

The delineations are more surface descriptions minus compassionate, psychological insight. If I had flipped through it at a store or library first I would most definitely placed it back on the shelf.

Not only is she 100% accurate in her Yearly predictions for different Animal Signs but also exhibits a sense of humor and down to earth style of writing that amuses and makes you laugh. It's the only book that I'm proud of to pass around during get-togethers or parties because Lau combines the Eastern and Western Signs of Astrology which we all found sincere and true. A true psychic. I shall consider reading more books by her from now on and hope to read what is in store for the Signs in the Lunar Cycle for 2003 and beyond. She has kept her reverence for the Chinese tradition and yet at the same time has an innovative view of a western mind.

So, I made the mistake of thinking that this was a book on advanced Chinese astrology. This is elementary Chinese astrology. Which is equivalent to looking up your sun sign in your local newspaper.

There seem to be certain elements in Eastern astrology which are missing in the \\"Western\\" version: together they seem to make a person feel more \\"whole\\"! The knowledge of being an Earth Boar, for instance, has brought many insights about myself (and how I relate to others): it has given me invaluable insight into the way others perceive me. Before, I simply thought of myself as a wild, roaming happy-go-lucky Sagittarius. But the combo of Sag/Earth Boar is much more enlightening and satisfying (because it hits home): happy to know that I'm more grounded than I previously thought: a rather naive, fun-loving humanitarian type who sometimes eats and drinks a wee bit too much (!) Well, if the shoe fits...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb and very comprehensive guide","review":"This book has been the subject of many a gathering and well received by all.

The choices out there are limited because their skill set is just not quite where it needs to be to enjoy a lot of great toys. This pegboard seems to hit the mark. The pegs are well constructed, bright colors, and easy to snap in the holes. My son LOVES it. Drawbacks, he can't set up the peg board himself, and he can't put the design sheets in the slot himself either (so everytime he finishes a picture, he needs help, which is really Ok but just an FYI). It also stores nicely. The peg board snaps on top of the case holding all the pegs securely inside and there is a nice carrying handle on the side. It sort of reminds me of the old lightbrights I grew up with, minus the light up feature. Ovearall a very cute and reasonably priced toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I was so excited for my 2 year old to get this toy, given the other positive reviews, but it seems my experience was quite different than the others.

Whatever the technical reasons are for poor sound distribution on this disc, all I can tell you is that there is a very good chance the sound falls far below any DVD concert recording I've ever heard.

Instead I am returning it.I read the reviews complaining of the problem, and thought maybe these guys were too picky. WRONG ! The audio fading is extremely frustrating. It is impossible to watch this all the way through because of it.The notion that 2 channel stereo is better is ridiculous. It too has the same fading problem, and just sounds worse.By the way, I video taped this off Direct TV last summer, and the audio is EXCEPTIONAL.

I saw this concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London in May 2000. I had never seen him before but it was fantastic and Sting at his very best. The DVD disappoints because the stereo soundtrack has been created direct from the mixing desk without any effects, particularly on Stings vocals. As much as I love his and Cheb Mami's voice on Desert Rose, they are far too loud in the mix and make it near impossible to enjoy. I would love to see Ten Summoners Tales on DVD which was a film recorded during the recording of that album at Sting's home in England.

I wish I had listened to them before buying this DVD. The music is great, as usual from Sting. But the sound is CRAP! Even listening on stereo headphones the sound goes in and out, up and down, really loud and then barely discernible. It also always seems to go down when Sting is singing or speaking. Whoever was running the board this night should be shot... repeatedly... in the knees... with a bow & arrow... for days. I mean, it's ridiculous. I'm going to try and return it, but I'm not hopeful. See if you can rent this first (try Netflix) and see how it does on your sound system. If it's good (or even okay) buy it, because it's a great concert.

They should redo this disc and anyone with an old copy should be able to return it for a new and improved one.

Although Dey titles this book \\"Guidelines,\\" I found it instead to be a methodological critique, as acknowledged in the editorial review provided by this website. Many issues Dey raises are reasonable and provocative, but his critique of the major methods texts of grounded theory bypasses the many hundreds of published examples of grounded theory research and thus doesn't address how the method is actually used in practice.

The Grabit failed to \\"grab\\", but by using the larger size Grabit (#3) as suggested, I drilled it out using the \\"burnishing\\" end. Fortunately, the screw was only 5/16 in long, and easily fell out when the head was drilled out. If it was an inch or longer, I'm not sure if it would work, but FIVE stars nevertheless for THIS job.

So far I've worn out a few high-speed drill bits including a diamond grinding bid. I'm in the process of butchering my project with a saw off disk in order to get the corroded bolt out, making a bad situation worse. Pro grade baloney, even the Chinese junk is better.

When the gauge is SET for a 7 inch exposure, the ACTUAL exposure is 7 1/16 inch. This can be verified by measuring the gauge with a tape measure.Although 1/16 of an inch may not seem like much, after 16 rows, the cumulative error is 1 inch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful for installing veritcal lap siding","review":"I purchased this to make it easier to install vertical lap 9.25\\" cement fiber siding.

We loved the idea that this doll \\"cried\\" real tears, however, we realized that when Baby Annabell does cry..her tears pour out soaking everything. Also I was disappointed that her mouth didn't move when crying or laughing. And speaking of crying.....she almost never does! The only way she will cry is if her bottle is taken away. I was under the assumption that she cried at other times and so would need a child's loving care. Overall, this doll is adorable.

It was an instant hit with her. The doll is very life like. However, I would only recommend this doll if you are very adept at keeping track of the bottle. This doll will not function without the bottle. I have tried to obtain another bottle, but no one will sell just the bottle. Zapf offered to send one, however that was 7 weeks ago. I emailed them again and they said it takes 6 weeks because of production issues. I can't believe they would sell a product whose primary function relies upon an accessory they cannot produce readily. Fortunately for us we did not lose the bottle, but rather the dog chewed the end of it. It still works somewhat, although it drips a lot of water. My daughter however, would be entirely disappointed if we had lost it all together.

All annabell does is laugh,laugh,laugh and laugh some more. the laugh is also super fake sounding! annabell is also ugly and a cheap fake looking face. the tears dont come out at all so dont even try getting it because you think the tears would be awsome. I was so dissapointed with her so i got rock-a-bye chou chou and she is super cute (actually the cutest doll face i have ever seen). rock-a-bye also sounds and acts much realer.

We read the directions which clearly state to fill the bottle to the line and then place it all the way into the doll's mouth. As the doll sucks, squeeze the bottle gently and feed the doll about 1/4 to 1/3 of the bottle. My daughter did not have a problem doing this. We did as the instructions say and Annabell cried tears the very next time she cried. My daughter sings to her and she stops crying. She also rubs the doll's belly and she stops crying. Loud noises do wake up the doll. We were driving around town and an ambulance passed us and the doll cried. This doll is well worth the money. I love to watch my daughter be so loving to this doll. It is not annoying to us adults either. It has cute giggles and coos that are the right volume.

Came on here for something else and was curious how much better I could have done at Amazon. I didn't get totally ripped off thankfully.Anyway this gig bag is pretty awesome. The padding is fairly thick and protects my G&L; wonderfully. I am not always the most careful and occasionally bump my bag into something and its protected my electric very well.It seems really well made but I haven't had it that long so I can't give an opinion on its durability. The multiple sets of pockets on the back are great for sheet music, an effects pedal, tuner, capo, extra strings, your cord etc.It has a sturdy handle, along with two back straps so you can either throw it over one shoulder or you can wear it like a backpack which makes it easier to walk around and not bump into things.I would totally buy this thing again and would probably pay even more for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag!","review":"This is by far one of, if not the best gig bag I've owned. The pockets are large, the padding is thick and protective. Zippers are larger and quality made. I would defiantly buy this bag again. The size is perfect size for my ESP guitar. The only complaint I could think of is that once your guitar is in and it's all zipped up a couple of the pockets are a little tight and getting something other then a few papers would be hard. But on the other hand there are a few larger pockets that are big enough. Yes this is one great gig bag for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plush!","review":"This bag is thickly cushioned and well made. The nylon is heavy duty and sturdy.

Reading it as an adult, however, I came to realize that it is not a true history of the settling of the Americas. The book describes migrations to the Americas by people from the Tower of Babel and ancient Hebrews--claims that are contradicted by DNA studies, archaeology, and linguistics. It treats the confounding of the languages at the Tower of Babel as literal history, and is full of anachronisms that easily prove it to be a work of fiction based on 19th Century ideas about native Americans. For example, there are references to iron, steel, brass, metal pieces of money, wheat, horses, chariots, and elephants in an ancient American setting (approximately 2,400 BC to 400 AD) which are consistent with 19th Century rumors and theories, but simply do not fit within the catalog of scientific knowledge available today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamentally Detrimental","review":"Buyer Beware: this book is fiction masquerading as history & is a direct product of a parasitic group that has ballooned into the LDS church.I was raised Mormon, & was devout until age 26.

As a percentage few copies of this fantastic fallacy have ever actually been read and most who start reading it never finish the second chapter. Maybe if L. Ron Hubbard signed on as co-author with Joseph Smith sales would jump. Tom Cruise, have you read the Book of Mormon yet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it as fiction not history","review":"The Mormon church claims the book is a historical account of people that lived in the Americas. No one outside of the church believes it is a historical work at all. One of the stories of the book is found in Ether. The story claims that 2,000,000 men died in battle on one side of the war. Assuming a similar number of combatants died on the other side fighting the war, 4,000,000 men died in battle. At that time, this would mean that more than 4% of the world's population died in a war that no one other than Mormons know about. No evidence of this tremendously large battle has ever been found. As the Smithsonian Institution has previously said, the book has never been relied on for any historical purpose. That is because it is fiction. If you want to learn from the stories found in the book, go ahead.

The index had to be rebuilt, which essentially means everything is being backed up again. When I rebooted, the plan was gone completely. Memeo technical support has been no help so far, the only thing I can find in previous support requests was to start over.Other drawbacks are the backup runs constantly, backing up on the fly.

The majority of patterns are for women. The sweaters all include some type of aran/celtic pattern and many have cables. The patterns are suitable for intermediate and advanced knitters. There are colored pictures of each project and detailed charts where necessary. The book includes some knitting \\"tips\\" for various project to help the less advanced knitter. There are several sweaters in the book I am considering knitting. I am working on my first project and so far the instructions are easy to follow and seem accurate. I would recommend this book as a good source to someone who is interested in knitting this type of sweater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, challenging, and timeless sweaters","review":"What I love most about this book is that these are sweaters that are not your typical sweater (personally, I don't think it's worth knitting an average-looking sweater that you can purchase in the store for $20-$30), yet they are not trendy and dated looking by next year, either. Many of the books out there now that I've looked at contain more trendy styles that will be gone soon.I'm an experienced knitter (15 yrs.) who's fairly new to cables and looking for a challenge. This was it. It is definitely not for the newbie knitter. If you're experience and are looking to make a timeless sweater for yourself or as a gift, this is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed like a good idea...","review":"OK, I know that Aran knits are bulky and covered in cables. I also understand that these aren't exactly in style. HOWEVER, I do feel some buyers remorse due to the fact that I couldn't see more photos in this book prior to my purchase. After pouring over it today, I might knit ONE thing out of the book. The styles are dated, not timeless (in my opinion). I do not recommend this book for those people looking to create something close to a classic gansey."},{"rating":"2","title":"vest of many stitches","review":"the vest of many stitches is an amazing project. it is not for those that want mindless knitting. it is an exercise in both knitting and mental skill - you must concentrate and think as you knit. the finished project is gorgeous. i am really enjoying the process!thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arans & Celtics: The Best of Knitters Magazine","review":"This book has so much to offer - a friend made the Vest of Many Stitches, and I just had to try it for myself.

The photo is correct; the product description is close; the name is wrong. This is a 6\\" fine brass wire wheel for mounting on a 5/8\\" mandrel/arbor. It can be used on a 1/2\\" arbor with the included plastic bushing. It does NOT have a 1/4 hex inch shank for use with a drill.The bushing has a small flange that helps keep it in place when sliding the wheel onto the threaded arbor. When mounting, ensure that your shaft's flanges or washers trap the bushing in its hole. The product includes two stamped metal flanges for a 1/2\\" arbor but they are very cupped and will not immobilize the bushing.The wheel is well balanced (i.e., no vibration when spinning).Update: Please note that this is not a brass wire wheel, it is a brass-coated steel wire wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not mount on tapered spindle","review":"Plastic insert would not stay put, so would not mount on my tapered arbor.

The action scenes are cut from silent movies about the American Civil War and some of the scenes are repeated many times. As is the case with the silent era, the physical movements of emotion are exaggerated and the film is often grainy.Photos of the principal politicians, battle scenes and military leaders are included as references when an event is being described. Of course, there were no video cameras during the war, so the only possible accurate video is of aged veterans, of which some is included. Nevertheless, the video is a weakness of this historical record, especially given the number of repeats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Civil War, 2 volumes","review":"I received this video set and also another video from this dealer.

There is material in here that you won'tfind in the Study Guide, but which should have been included in it. So to get all the information, you'll need BOTH books.

Installed it about a year ago. It was fine for a while, but recently the main body of the faucet started to leak and it also leaks from the top. I got it very cheap, but if you want something that will last, buy a better known brand and get the warranty and easier access to information on them. I haven't been able to find anything on the company that manufactures Corrego. Can't find any way to seek warranty help. Just another fly by night operation I suppose. Avoid Corrego faucets if you are seeking a good, dependable product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice looking, great service","review":"I've had this faucet for about 4 years. Purchased at Sam's Club. It looks very nice. Over the past year or so, some of the clear finish started to wear off of the on/off handle and handle base. Also, the flow rate seems to have slowed. I called the toll-free support number on the box a few mintes ago on a Saturday (open 7 days) and explained what happened. For $7.95 shipping, the company is sending me a new handle, handle base, cartridge, and diverter under the lifetime warranty of this unit. Great service.

Because it's a gel, it adds lots of volume, but because it rinses out, it doesn't leave hair stiff and sticky. I have very fine hair which normally cannot take a conditioner because it flattens my hair completely, even the kind that is supposed to be for fine hair. I came across this gel accidentally at a closeout store, and since then I have been searching it out.I highly recommend it for those whose fine hair cannot usually be \\"conditioned.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible conditioner","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer that this is the worst conditioner I ever tried. The only plus is that it does add volume. But it does so at the expense of healthy hair. Even to apply it is impossible. It simply cannot be worked through your hair. I have very fine, thin hair. As I applied the conditioner and tried to work it through my hair, my fingers kept getting caught in the tangles in my hair. Afterward, I either have to spend a good amount of time trying to comb the snarls out of my hair or I have to apply a spray-on, leave-in conditioner just to be able to comb my hair. And while it does seem to add volume, it is so hard to get a brush through my hair while blow-drying that I just give up and go for the pony-tail look. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rough Conditoner Gel","review":"This was the worst conditioner I have ever used! I bought it to go along with the KMS Add Volume Shampoo, which is great. It leaves my hair rough and dry. I have tried using a little bit of it, then a little more, but my hair ends up the same way. As soon as you apply it, it leaves your hair feeling sticky and you can't work it through your hair as is called for in the instructions. I tried to rinse it off as much as I could but my hair was left feeling hard. After my hair was dried, it felt like straw, not like my hair usually feels after I put conditioner in it. Is the company aware of this? Am I applying it wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"You can tell he has an absolutely beautiful tone! There are many recordings of the four Mozart Concertos, but I would have to say James Sommerville's is one of my favorites! It's a \\"MUST have\\" along with Brain and Tuckwells recordings of the concertos. Mr. Sommerville plays the concertos like a breeze. But I must emphasize on his tone, because that really stood out to me, it's truly fantastic...and if you know me, my ears are picky about tone on the horn. It would be awesome to see him in concert. Anywhoo, you should buy the recording, I can't stress how good it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could listen to it all day","review":"James Somerville's performance is very smooth and pleasant to listen to. He provides virtuoso performances on each and every track that just draw you into the music. The CBC Vancouver Orchestra provides a very accomplished accompaniment to Mr. Somerville's solos. The engineering and production on the CD are also good quality so the sound is powerful and robust--not tinny as I've heard on too many Classical recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"teeeeeeeerrible","review":"dont get me wrong, im one hard-core spongebob fan, but nickelodeon could do soooooo way much better than this. the graphics r the worst ive seen yet on a handheld game, the controls are horrendous, and the story is just stupid. its such an easy game, and its not fun in the least. do nooooot buy this game. i repeat do NOOOOOOOOOOT buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Game, Too Easy!!!!!!","review":"This game was a very big disappointment. It's not that it wasn't fun. It was fun. The problem is that it was too easy. I finished the whole game in four hours. It has a beginning, a middle and an end. The next time you play, it's exactly the same. The stuff is all hidden in the same places and the exact things happen in the exact way. There is only one level, it doesn't get harder each time you play. Take my advice and don't buy this game!

They switched A and B around; usually B is to shoot and A is to jump but here it's A to shoot and B to jump, so it's easy to get confused. It's also real old(It's for gameboy color)so I guess that's why it's boring. And the people in it talk like this: \\"hi spongebob\\" or \\"okay fine take it\\" or \\"hi spongebob\\" or \\"no you cant be hall moniter\\" or hi spongebob\\". It's incredibly boring.

The controls are very odd, and switching weapons(bubble wand, net, etc.) isn't very easy. You have to pause the game and go through three screens. Another part that is really, really, really annoying is you can't just 'save' your progress..they give you a code to re-enter. To all game makers!! Put a battery in the cartridge!! Codes are a thing of the past..we're in 2001 not 1981!! I'm a TRUE fan of Spongebob and this was a real heartbreak. 2 stars just for the name, not the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it.","review":"I liked it. The story was interesting and held my attention. It was also easy to read - I read it in one day. I think most of the people objected to it because it doesn't fit into the main story line of the TV series. I didn't have a problem with this. It's a great story, told from differing view points of the characters but mainly Security Chief Garibaldi's. It was lighter than some, but I liked that too after reading \\"To Dream in the City of Sorrows\\" which was a great book but the story was a bit heavier and took more thought. I think most people who reviewed this book have forgotten about the TV episodes which also seemed to have nothing to do with the \\"shadows\\" storyline but had almost totally separate and sometimes light-hearted adventures. Anyway, I enjoyed it and I think anyone interested in a light sci-fi adventure would too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't belong in the series","review":"Although it is nominally set on Babylon 5 and uses the names of various of the characters (mostly unrecognizable from the series, or mere caricatures of themselves), this book really has no place in the Babylon 5 universe. The story is poor, it advances nothing within the B5 universe, and its \\"reset button\\" Deus ex machina ending violates the entire spirit behind Babylon 5.Take a look at \\"Thirdspace\\" by Peter David (based on the movie by J.M.Straczynski) to see how this story should have been done.There was a serious slip in quality control when this book made it through as an authorized B5 vehicle. If you like B5, avoid this one at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jhaeman's Review","review":"Although I enjoyed the first four Babylon 5 novels, I found this one rather disappointing. The plot is hackneyed and the sort of thing that has happened to the U.S.S. Enterprise about a dozen times. The conclusion is of the \\"ambiguous\\" type that doesn't indicate complexity so much as a writer apparently too lazy to give answers. Unless you're a B5 completist, avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Build-Up to, ....Well, ....

A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found no satisfactory resolution in this story.","review":"As the people reacted to their primal, anti-other dreams, the violence reeled from one description to another. I do not believe Babylon 5 would have the resources to clean up the totality of destruction that was described. [Who could really believe the \\"Hell's Angels\\"- type characters would be allowed to bring their motorcycles to Babylon 5?] No viable hint was given as to the character or purpose of the Green Worm. The ending drops like a boulder - or magic wand - with no real weaving together of purpose. I love Babylon 5, but not this book. It could have been done with any characters from any space environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing really","review":"This book adds nothing to neither the storyline, the characters nor backround.This book has \\"StarTrek the Next generation\\"-style strange force that causes people to get violent. It is handled even worse than in Thirdspace (movie).There were 2 great thing in this book:1. Kosh gave straight answer(!) \\"Yes.\\" 2. Fermis angels, A religios motocycle gang, that wanted to blow up B5.One a star for both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreams and green lights - has everybody lost it on B5?","review":"This good book is a little weird. I recommend it very much because of that.I like all those weird fractions of beliefs depicted in the novel.

I enjoyed the game alot, but at the time I didnt have a dxinput gamepad and had to use the keyboard. the controls good for the keyboard.But if you had a non Dxinput gamepad the directional controls didnt map right and the up and down was reversed.

The money ran out...so in a race to salvage this movie they hodge podged it together with what ever footage they had left. Then they had no time to edit so they overlapped scenes with voice overs so you will understand it without any dialogue between characters. It was like a bad french movie and the off the wall questions made it all seem like a 2 hour Obsession by Calvin Kline commercial. I did like the cinematography however but whoever put this story together missed the boat. I saw all the pieces for a great movie underneath all the pretension so why didn't they make it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted opportunity...","review":"This movie could have been fascinating. The lead actress was well cast and the camera loved her. The scenery was gorgeous. The story, or fable in the case, is an interesting one. With strong characters this could have rocked. Instead, this movie is puzzling at times and incomprehensible at others. I watched with two other people and we kept having to pause the movie and ask what was being said. It was very hard to understand. The editing was just weird - the first cutaway made us think our DVD player had malfunctioned, and I actually rewound to see if it had skipped anything. The characters had no names, and no development. Just a wasted opportunity. I'd advise anyone planning on viewing this to use subtitles to help understand the limited dialog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect. Haunting. Art. (getit?)","review":"Why go to a movie (a Malick movie no less) and expect to see a good movie, but what you actually get is a great work of genius filmmaking and then complain about it because it wasn't hyperactive, cliche-ridden, predictable and traditional? Don't any of you ever want to watch an original movie? Are all of you detractors so intent on resisting being transported to another time? Has our culture become so dumbed-down and ADD crippled that an actual visionary version of an American story can be hated by half of you?The New World is truly stunning. It has a rare depth and is lodged in my head for a long time to come. The only problem is that I didn't get to see the longer cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extended Cut?","review":"First I'm looking at a leaf..then a flower..then a stream..now a bird..next a waterfall..over to a field of corn..and finally down into the angst ridden eyes of Colin Farrell as he stares into his co-stars eyes for what seems like a lifetime.

Sure there are some lovely nature shots while voice-overs recite poetry, but I've seen better on PBS. Please, avoid this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"This movie is the biggest disappointment of the year. The sound is poor especially when Colin Farrel speaks. His mumbling is completely lost. In fact the viewer is often lost as to where the scenes are occurring and what is occurring in the scenes. This movie started with a great idea but fell woefully short."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE MOVIE","review":"Its narrative is almost nonexistent. Its pacing is haphazard. Most of the actors mumble; you need English subtitles activated to understand the English!

It was a riveting experience and it felt right, at least metaphorically.I walked out of THE NEW WORLD (after the credits) with the same feeling. Like this is what it looked like... what it felt like... to be in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607.The cinematography is gorgeous, but it's not 'pretty-like-a painting' gorgeous. It captures the awe at looking at the beauty of a virgin world with un-jaded eyes.Malick is a cinematic poet. This is a tone poem, a concerto, a chamber quartet. This is not your normal Hollywood narrative filmmaking. If you are looking for plot-driven artifice, look elsewhere. It is not here.Instead of a cheap novel, we get a fugue worthy of Mozart or Bach. It's that good..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be viewed with a grain of salt...","review":"I just saw this movie, and was expecting more action and dialogue. It took me two days to get through it, as I was very disappointed with the storyline, (if that's what you call it.) Of course, there was little historical accuracy. Pocahontas was just a little girl, about 11 years of age, when John Smith arrived on the continent. He never fell in love with her! She did marry John Rolfe, had a little boy Thomas, and went to England, where she died (20 or 21 years of age) at Gravesend. The authenticity of the costumes and sets was good, the photography fabulous. I just wish they would have cast a different actor for the role of Captain John Smith. Colin Farrell was just not believable. This movie could have been so good! I heartily recommend the book, Pocahontas and Her World, by Philip L. Barbour, for an excellent take on the history of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith. It is a 'must have' book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extended Version is Far Far Better","review":"The 171 minute extended version is far better then the original 135 minute version. The extra 36 minutes are pretty evenly distributed through out the film from beginning to end and make the narrative such as it is much easiler to follow. There are also a few intertitles introducting various sections of the film. Pocahontas gets significantly more screen time so there is more oppportunity for her character to develop. If you recall the trailers for this film you may well remember many scenes which were simply not in the 135 minute version and I can tell you most of them are now in the extended version. Overall a big improvement though those who really hated the film probably still won't be won over, but those in the middle may well give it a higher rating. Too bad there are not more films about about early American Colonial history and for that alone this movie is worth seeing at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"I can see why people could love this movie or hate it. If you've been conditioned by most Hollywood films, you expect things to progress quickly and things to \\"happen\\". Unfortunately it seems that a large majority of movie goers have a very short attention span and are completely oblivious to what the director is trying to get across to the audience. Just like the Malicks other movie \\"The Thin Red Line\\", people were disappointed. They expected a \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", or some other action packed war movie, but instead they got a visual masterpiece. The New World moved me like a good 98% of the films I've watched haven't. Each shot is methodically thought out. The dialogue rich with meaning. Sit back relax and REALLY watch this movie. Don't be a passive viewer and let the movie happen to you, because it won't. Don't wait for anything to happen, because as your watching it, it already is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressive.","review":"Colin Farell has done some good acting before, however in this one he was particularly off key, as was just about everything. As to Mr. Farell, I am not entirely convinced he has sufficient scope of ability or demonstrative emotional range to become a leading legend as his previous demonstrative 'shines' have previously confined themselves to the dark, introverted typecast and support actor scenes such as when he basked fairly ingeniously under the floodlight of Cruise. As to the movie - This is a good example of a movie where all parts effectively conspire tragedy upon the sum - production (cookie-cutter), music (bland to match the plot I suppose), dialogue (ho-hum), character (cardboard), narrative (ineffectual bandaid), plot (petty) and acting (lukewarm is a compliment). Accolades to the tatoo artists, though I suspect the style doesn't reflect historical context and style, and it doesn't particuarly matter.Moral of the story- take the \\"Two Thumbs Up.\\" with a BIG grain of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"In keeping with \\"The Thin Red Line\\" Malick's production value is as good as it gets. For one he shot it on 70mm film (over 2x the quality of standard 35mm movies) and did not use anything but natural light. Indeed, as other reviewers have noted, people did walk out of the theatre when I watched it. They either didn't get it or were looking for something completely different. If you want to see an action movie about a war to claim new land, look elsewhere. However, if you want to see a movie that beautifully portrays love, self discovery, and sacrifice this is the one for you. One of the finest films of 2005/06!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood at his best in rewriting rosy PC history of everything","review":"Simply ghastly. Orwellian notion of history.

I absolutely hated it. The movie made me want to go home, paint my wall, watch it dry, then I'd have a goodnight sleep. What you do is give this to someone you dispise really badly, so they have to sit through 2 1/2 hours of torture. Sorry, I like most all movies, I love thinking movies, but this movie scarred me for life. THANKS NEW WORLD! Now, I have wasted 2 1/2 hours of precious time.

More like \\"The Black Hole\\"","review":"The New World was literally one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was not only boring, but difficult to understand in places, and I found it condescending to Native Americans. I am not a minority, and these things usually don't get to me too much unless they are blatant, but I felt that the movie made the native people look like animals. Sniffing newcomers like dogs and making noises that were just plain weird may seem like \\"history\\" to some, but depicting people in this fashion can't help anyone's view of what Native Americans were like at that time.Even if I forgave those particular indiscretions, the script was just plain bad. I was laughing at times that no one intended to be funny, and most of the time I just wanted the thing to be over. I would have walked out, but I kept thinking it might get better. It didn't.

It must not have played long in theaters because I rented the DVD a couple months later.After I saw the DVD I now know why. BORING! What a waste of excellent actors, gorgeous scenery and great costumes. Maybe they should have hired a writer and director for this flick instead of a poet.This movie had so much potential, and I watched the whole thing thinking it would take off and get better. Instead I got a 2 hour Calvin Klein \\"Obsession\\" commercial from the 90's. You remember, the ones that showed a man and woman doing something artsy-fartsy with weird camera angles and pointless voice over dialogue. The only difference was that the commercials were shot in black and white and this movie is in color.There are very few movies I hate, unfortunately this made the top of this short list.I give this one star for the actors, location of the shoot and the historically correct costumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The story started off quite good when they arrived at the Americas.

To say it was a dissapointment would be an understatement of the year. There is not whole lot of talking, just running around, smiling(or scowling), exchanging enigmatic looks and so on and so forth. Story drags on and on, and even musical score is completely unappropriate for this type of movie(not to mention annoying). When I heard this movie was made by the same guy who directed \\"Thin Red Line\\", one of the worst movies in the universe, light bulb went inside my head. I guess if you want pretentious and \\"artsy\\", this movie is for you. If you actually like to hear actors talking, perhaps you should look elsewhere.P.S.

But this film was so bad it inspired me to spare you the trouble of sitting through the whole painful experience. The script for the whole two hour film could not have been more than 3 pages long! The trailer is actually better than the film itself and not nearly as tedious, it has 10 times more dialog and action. Come to think of it, even the trailer might be a little bit too long. This is the slowest movie that I've ever seen... Oh, and by the way, this movie has one of the worst soundtracks ever. The music throughout the film is louder than the dialog, and nearly painful to listen to!

Colin Farell was just going into rehab when it got released so he wasn't available for interviews. It's a shame because he is really hot in this movie!! And I love the era of Pocahontas and the original British colony in America, Jamestown. It's filmed in Virginia, near the actual site of Jamestown. The footage is lush and dreamy. The movie is a little odd in that there is not much dialogue - rather you see the movie unfold through the character's eyes. It can be a little slow in parts, but Pocahontas had such an interesting life, it makes up for it. She gets taken over to Britain, where there is more lush footage of enormous landscaped gardens. Plus the outfits and language of the Native Americans are authentic (as much as possible), which is rare to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I expected","review":"The good: the cinematography was (for the most part) beautiful.The bad: The abrupt scene changes remind me of raw footage and is distracting. I understand there's an artistic element here, but when people's lines nearly get cut off, it's annoying. The voice overs were difficult to hear without turning up the volume. Must everything be whispered?The pet peeves: Colin seemingly has one expression: furrowed brow and darting eye. Pocahontas' native dress reminded me of a porno version of what Native Americans might wear: off the shoulder and mini skirt. The soundtrack repeated so often that it become a sort of nightmare. Pocahontas spent way too much time running through the tall grass.Summary: This movie really let me down. I had hoped for an epic film about the new world; instead, I had to watch a sketchy, rather abstract picture of a love affair between Smith and Pocahontas.

No other director use camera angles and use individual emotion such as he does, which is a credit to his ability to reflect onto the big screen like no other. With that said, i have to say i was disapointed in the fact that i was expecting more 'standard' direction that you see in most movies and not something like this. I would love to see him direct a horror movie which i would see in a heartbeat but come on now....we wanted to see something like the tv series LOST in some ways....new discoveries, not feelings.For fans of this talented director, you will not be disapointed.

I can put in random images of rocks and trees for 2 and a half hours instead! Who needs substance? I've got style!\\" Andy Kaufman once put on a show, and even though the audience came to see him do stand-up comedy, he just sat down and read The Great Gatsby to them. The whole book.

The original release shown in theaters was 172 minutes. This disc has a cut version, 135 minutes I think, which, believe it or not, seems much longer than the longer version. In the theater, 172 minutes passed like lightning, because its pacing was exactly appropriate to the near ecstatic experience which Malick set out to convey. If you are at all interested in this film, go for the longer version.

Yes, he is a masterful cinematographist but a boring director. This film is all about long, boring snippets of characters thinking out loud. Do we really need these voice-overs ? Actors are supposed to act either through their voices or expressions. Viewers don't need the director's voice overs to translate their feelibgs. The film is slow moving and confusing. The editing is atrocious. Acting is so so. Everyone seems to be in a perpetual depressed state - just like I was after only 30 minutes....I sat through it all hoping its pace would change but no luck.

It's art, it's poetry in motion, it's a prayer, it's a dream. Don't expect a lot of dialogue, there isn't much. It's power lies in the action, the drama lies in the facial expressions. There isn't much talking between cultures who don't share the same language, between compatriots who don't have much to say because they are exhausted, frustrated, overwhelmed and beleaguered. One learns to pay attention to the details, the sound of \\"peepers\\" in a land that now sounds like traffic, the beauty of the sun sparkling on water, the breath of the wind as it moves through hair.

Jim Caviezel is a perfect non-Collin Ferrell.The stakes were always very very high for this film however, because the subject is just so extremely pivotal and it's never really been put on screen before. Ultimately, I felt let down. It was lacking, and I felt a 'human' presence in The Thin Red Line which I didn't feel here. The Thin Red Line was muddled in many ways, but in many ways it triumphed. The New World is just muddled in many ways, period.My opinion of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. Boring. Boring.","review":"Oh my gosh.

It is incorrectly stated above that the entire movie was shot in 65mm, and in the end it does not matter since no venues really project 70mm anymore, it was resize down to 35mm for theater projection; because 70mm projection aspect ratio is typically, 2.00:1 or 2.10:1 not 2.35:1 which The New World clearly displays.

Sure wish it focused on the discovery of Jamestown more.

The plot does not have a smooth flow. Colin Farrell appears to not have learned any script for this movie, and the whole bit about him not learning a single Indian word while living with them for months is unbelievable.

That is all the good! :(THE BAD:* There's almost no dialog in the movie, just shots of scenery. The main character, Pocahontas, is never introduced...her name never said during the entire movie!* No dialog means no character development. You literally don't know anything about the characters or who's who.* No plot. No storyline. At the end of the movie, my wife and I looked at each other and wondered aloud what the point of the movie was (as did most of the movie-goers).* The lead actress is 16 in real life, so you feel like you're watching child porn. Although there's no nudity, there are numerous side shots of her [...].Summary: If you want beautiful scenery, go see an IMAX flick.

Ha.Like others have said, they just don't fit a standard mattress, much less the extra-thick ones that are being sold these days. I can't get the fitted sheet even close to the bottom of my mattress. I ended up giving the sheets to a friend with an older (thinner) bed and she said the sheets eventually gave out at one corner, likely from being stretched so tight after several washings.I'll go back and buy more BB&B; sheets, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing is way off","review":"I agree with the other reviews that the feel and colors of this set are remarkable. But that does little good when the fitted sheet won't fit onto the bed. As instructed, I pre-washed the set before putting them on my queen bed. Obviously, the bottom did not fit and popped off easily, and did not even cover the sides. My mattress is 6-8 inches thick, not a deep-sided one. I believe it was a double bed, not a queen size, though the top sheet was almost ridiculously long, so I know it was not totally mis-sized. Either quality control is sadly missing at this company, or the shrinkage rate for this fabric is unacceptable. As I say, this did not seem to be the case with the top sheet and pillow cases. What is most irksome is the difficulty of returning items purchased from Amazon.com. Part of my criticism is how exasperating and what a rip-off the whole process is. I will probably not purchase items from Amazon Marketplace again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb quality and feel","review":"These sheets are the best sheets i have ever used, once you use them you will never go back to anything else. My husband and I did not move an inch all night they were so cozy. Additionally, we have always fought about the top sheet and i always got the short end of it. Not with these sheets, the top is so large that it covers way more than the sides of the bed.

This is definitely not the best bang for your buck as far as electric erasers go. First off, the battery compartment is very difficult to open, and you risk breaking it just trying to put batteries in. Second, the button you push to operate it is rather difficult to push, so you won't be able to erase for long without having to take a break. It might be nearly impossible to use if you have arthritis. The mechanism used to hold the eraser is also difficult.

When I was looking for the eraser, I didn't need anything special, so I decided to get the cheapest. Well, I was rather upset, when I tried to erase something written with regular HB pencil. It was smudging... badly. It has 2 types of eraser: white and gray. Both of them smudge. Maybe, if you change the eraser (use the one that you rely on), it'll do the work in a proper way.Second characteristic is that it's less comfortable than the one by Staedtler. The good thing about it is that it's compact and light... and cheap.I really believe that, if you change the eraser itself to the better one, it can perform much better (the way you want, maybe), because the motors in these electric erasers are almost identical.Best wishes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Good product for such price!

Even with 2 levels, it doesn't get boring and the levels are huge so you feel your in a city with lots going on. This game, you get to break traffic laws without the cops. You can drive on pedestrian areas, cut through traffic, and drive underwater. If you like strategy games, this is a great one because you must memorize how to get to each location like a real taxi driver plus using shortcuts to get to places fast to satisfy your customer. You also get tips if you drive in style with swift moves and dropping your customers in style. But all I have to say is that this is the best driving game for people who like to explore places, drive crazy, and think. So buy this game and it doesn't get boring like most games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its ok.","review":"You get 4 new drivers and you race in NewYork not San Francisco.

Cab sharing is good beacuse you get muti fares as they wont all want to go to the same destination. Crazy Taxi 2 is set in New York so the scenery is just as exciting as it is in the first one.

Though it doesn't claim to be a photo printer, I was able to print decent pictures with it using photo paper. That being said, there are three major drawbacks. First, it uses a lot of ink, very expensive ink might I add. While the printer itself is inexpensive, the per page printing cost is high because of 1)how much ink it takes to print an average page of text, and 2)that the cartridge is not refillable and there are no generic versions on the market. Second, it's loud, and I mean startles-you-every-single-time loud. Third, it's slow to spool and start print jobs. I'm running it on a Mac G3 with 128MB of ram via a USB connection. The printer will sit there and make tons of noise for a good 30 seconds before it starts printing. Overall it's okay for occasional home printing.

I believe this is the sole function of the chip.None of the advertising I have read discloses this attempt to force printer owners to use only Epson cartridges. The sales people with whom I spoke concealed this (or they didn't yet know about it).The issue is the expense of Epson vs. aftermarket cartridges. My daughter, a student, uses approximately two cartrides every two months....Buying aftermarket cartridges [is much less than replacing with the OEM cartridges] with the same resulting printer output.Had this been disclosed, I would have purchased another model such as the Epson 880 or another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Epson 777","review":"Epson 777 arrived with broken ink cartridge holder: The holder did not hold down the black ink cartridge.

First, I spent 5 hours trying to overcome a persistent crash bug in the software, until belatedly finding a download patch from a third party. Then, when all began to seem well, the printer failed to print even a single page. Worse, since the level of ink in the cartridge is based on theoretical usage (not actual), it claimed that I had eaten up half my ink supply even though not a drop had been printed. At market prices, that's $15 in wasted ink.To be fair, I'll give Epson one chance with the warranty.

I am a Windows NT user, and I have to turn the 777 on and off again three times before I have to print anything out.

The cartridges constantly clog, and the software constantly crashes.This product feels flimsy, prints at abysmal quality, and sucks down ink as fast as it sucks dollars out of your wallet.

Does it have anything to do with Twain's plans to dig up a fortune in gold mid-trip? And is the killer on board their ship all the way on the Mississippi?This book is an enjoyable jaunt down the Mississippi with Mark Twain on a riverboat. The main characters were enjoyable, and I especially enjoyed the portrayal of Twain. The plot was a little weak, however. The information on riverboats and the river was interesting, but too much attention was paid to it, with little advancing the story. Still, once a second body is found, the plot kicks into high gear.

A major plus is the password for each level which lets you resume where you left off or drop back to a previous level if you wish. There is a premise/story behind the game - you have to go through all the levels to save the hero and the world - but it is really irrelevant to actually solving the puzzles. Challenging and fun.

The game has some of the best and fastest graphics on the dreamcast. The games feel is incridible speed is the name of the game and with six playable characters and two different story lines ( one for good and one for evil) the game has lots of replay value. SA2 even has something the original doesn't a multiplayer mode. While its only for 2 players its still a lot of fun. This is a shining peice of work in the sad sad sad last days of dreamcast. Is this its dying breathe, well... not exactly but it's still a whole lot of fun for a great price. If you at all liked the original pick this one up now!!!!!! you won't regret it"},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you like your hedgehog?

Going at super hyperfast speeds, going to eat at Sonics, or do you think of a little blue hedgehog running at speeds of only you can think of in your mind? If you don't know what I am talking about then get Sonic Adventure 2. Its got all the first Sonic Adventure had and more. Some of the cool things in Sonic Adventure 2 are now you can play as the evil, sidistic scientist known as Eggman(a.k.a Dr. Robotnick)as well as bieng able to play as one of his henchmen Rouge(a flying bat) or as Shadow(a evil Sonic look a like). As always the hyperfast hedgehog Sonic is back and ready to out run evil with Tails(a fox with two tails that alow him to fly) and with Knuckles(a tough hitting echidna who can easily be tricked but can also retaliate hard). Never the less I KNOW Sonic Adventure 2 will be more cooler, more better, and more faster than Sonic Adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"It only Gets Better","review":"I first saw this game on Tech TV an have played the demo. I did not think Sonic Adventure could get any better than the first but I was so wrong. The graphics on this game are undescribable and unthinkable. The levels are much better and so are their plots, stages, and missions. The place that had the most improvement was the Chao homes. They are just unbelievable.

The story is intrigueing, and sonic looks better than ever, I really admire SA2, but I still like SA better. Tails in my opinion is cooler in the chao stage, I hate his robot thingy, and dr.robotnik is just weird. Rouge is cool, and isn't prisy like Amy. Then there is Shadow, I consider the last stage with Shadow and Sonic the hardest.. it took me a while to beat it in other words, and also got me frustrated considering I fell alot.

I've been a strong dreamcast player even years after it fizzled out early in the previous console wars. Sonic Adventure one was very fun game to play, but like most other dreamcast titles it was flawed. Those flaws were strongly outweighed with the many upsides of that title. I didn't give Sonic Adventure 2 a 1 star review because many people,including my own brother enjoyed this game. It also had a decent following.On a personal level however I feel they kept all the flaws from the original game, took out all the previous positive changes, and slapped a title on it.

Oh well...This time, Dr. Eggman/Robotnik is out to conquer the world along with the help of the mysterious ultimate life form, Shadow. Because Sonic looks so much (I personally don't think so) like Shadow, the military has unknowingly convicted Sonic for all of Shadow's crimes! This was an interesting twist on your regular boring video game plot.The Chao, a virtual pet, is also back which is a nice break after you've beaten a level.I seriously recomnend this game, but perhaps you should consider buying it for Gamecube, because the Sega ones are hard to find lately..."},{"rating":"2","title":"You like Sonic Get the Game!!!!","review":"I got this game and was really excited because I loved Sonic Adventure my first game since I was 6.

There is not a baseball game that even comes close to this one when you look at the available titles for PS1 or N64. With the exception of Griffey on N64. But even then, the graphics can not compete with WSB 2k2. If you do own a PS2, then you might want to check out some of the baseball games that it has to offer. But all in all, this game has a lot to offer and is definitely worth the [price]. Graphics are great. Play control is awesome. Good amount of options although it could use a little more. Sound is ok but the crowd sounds could be a little more realistic. Anyone who buys this game and is not happy with it, either has played way too many games and is too critical or they do not like the game of baseball."},{"rating":"1","title":"to play or not to play","review":"this game whomps.the grapics stink.2k1 is alot better.i wasted money buying it and time playing it.dont be fooled by all the other ratings.trust me this game is not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"This is one of the best baseball games I have ever played, and i've played some great ones. The curveballs actually drop insted of just curving, and it's easier to call your pitches than W.S.B.2k1. Most of the rosters are up-to-date, and it's sweet that you have the minors on franchise mode. The price is fair, and i think it's worth it. Buy this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"world series baseball 2k2 is probably the worst baseball game i have ever played in my life. home run derby stinks. the players dont even look like themselves, the game was just horrible. world series 2k1 is much better than this. batting is much harder, than the first. if your thinking of buying this, think again because you will hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Millenium milk. The last millenium, that is...","review":"I was a great fan of Red Dwarf for years. Season VII put me right off, and while its successor improves minutely, the difference is so very small its hardly detectable. None of the capable actors are given humourous material to work with - and we know they /can/ - and much of the satire is grimace-inducing rather than the intended effect. Avoid at all costs. Or rather pick up any vid from the first six seasons..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This tape, and along with the rest of 8, *%@^!","review":"This was such a disappointment. I can't even believe they made this and put the Red Dwarf name on it. They peaked with series 6 and 7, but this just doesn't cut it! It is not worth buying, in fact it insults the whole Red Dwarf collexion! Captain Hollister is back, but where are characters like Ace Rimmer or Ivan McGruder??? Hollister wasn't that funny anyway. I have to say that commercialism has killed the true essence of Red Dwarf and why is it filmed similarly to an American Soap Opera. This is not General Hospital! Over all this was a very big disappointment! Don't buy it! It is not even worth a star for this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is nothing but bad Dwarf!","review":"This has got to be the worst series Red Dwarf has ever faced. I would suspect that the writers from series 6 and 7 were not writing this one! People rate this as a great video, but why??? The antics of Rimmer and Lister are not really that funny and add the element of rebellion with an authority figure like Captain Hollister, well, you have a half-witted comedy that does more damage to the Red Dwarf name than the fourth string Lybian basketball team does to basketball! If you must have this video to complete your collexion, then great, but if you are looking for true humour and the wit of series 1-7, it is NOT here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great season!","review":"This season was as good as the earlier Red Dwarf! There is alot of imagination and alot of good gimicks left for the crew! I hope there is a season 9!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Dwarf lost it's momentum from series 7","review":"It lost everything the series had built up. You have the stupid humour of Rimmer and Lister reporting to the ship's captain which gets old in the first episode. It is too bad to think such a funny series took such a dramatic plunge (head first) from where it was before. Granted expectation were high, but you can truly feel the commercialised writing and pointless humour. Where's Ace Rimmer? Well, you won't see him here, or any other interesting character that past episodes have developed. You are left with the captain that is a true bore. Series 8 did not do Red Dwarf justice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Dwarf VIII: Well acted, badly written","review":"Red Dwarf 8 was recieved eagerly in both the UK and overseas. Hovever, despite vastly improved special effects, it seems that the writers of Red Dwarf, for the first time for over a decade, have run out of ideas. The series was brilliant in its early stages, and maybe it is just overshadowed by the hiarious series 7, but Red Dwarf 8 just seems very substandard compared with earlier episodes. The acting is very good from all cast members, but it is unfortunately very poorly written. If you really want to see Red dwarf in its full splendour, I would suggest the newly digitally remastered Series 1,2, & 3 videos available in most video shops, and give this one a miss, unless all you want is to be dazzled by high-budget computer graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow a friend's tape - it's not worth paying for","review":"Red Dwarf has really gone downhill in series 8. It has lost the depth that made it stand apart as a must see show in past seasons. The jokes are stupid and everyone acts even more idiotically than usual (and that's saying a lot!). There are some truly funny moments here, but they are few and far in between. I recommend drinking a few pints of your favourite lager before watching this season, maybe then it'll seem comparable to the last seven."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT ACCOMPANIMENT TO VIDEO","review":"Having seen the video of this compact disc previously, I jumped at the chance to purchase it at 75% off at at a Chapters Boxing Day sale.

The musicanship was great of course. Flawless lyrical soaring from Gary, Mathew playing his \\"parts\\" as one would expect. Artful guitar licks and bass playing. Drumming was weakest point but steady and acceptable. Maybe I approached this with too much life, but the performance as a whole had no fire. Sorry. I agree with a previous review that mentioned the lack of audience enthusiasm. Again as he said, this might be due to lack of production quality. No excuse for that though with today's technology.I really don't care if Gary plays a grand Piano or his Roland, but I DO object to a portly guitar player wearing a T shirt, tight jeans and sneakers.

The book was well researched and acurate but for only a couple of indescrepencies that did not effect the outcome. The author described the victim very well considering he never met him. I should know, the victim is my stepson whom I love and miss dearly. I read the book with tears in my eyes as I relived the hellish account of the murder and trial we went through. I could see each character and events vividly in my mind. Now when our friends ask many questions that arise, we simply tell them to read the book for all the answers. The reality of it is shocking to our family, friends, us and especially the greatest victims of all-our grandchildren. The first murder in Sevierville, Tenn. in 33 years. Hopefully the last - anywhere!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insane Instructions","review":"I am one of the family friends that PHoltum spoke of for this assembly. We did it the day after Thanksgiving and I thought maybe we were suffering from a food and drink hangover! The instructions have 34 steps, pictures that don't show top from bottom, left from right--I thought I was taking the SAT'S again! 3 people and 4 hours, ahhhh, my friend owes me a kidney as I drowned my 'assembly sorrows'after this VERY painful procedure.

The instructions really were not that bad. I have seen much much worse. A few of the pieces are tricky to put together but it was not the fault of the instructions. We both understood what needed to be done and how it should be done. It was actually doing it that caused some frustration. I'm referencing the portion of assembly involving the aparatus used to adjust the rim up and down.The finished product is nice and works well for my purposes. The rim and backboard vibrate a little more than I would like (the reason for the 4-star rating) but I think that was the sacrifice I made for choosing the portable system over an in-ground system. Overall I am satisfied with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"sensuality, amazing voice and great great songs","review":"This CD is to recommend to people that do not like singers screaming all along the songs (like Celine Dion, ...). The songs, the strings on this CD are unique. The best songs are 'When I say' (written by Vanessa and Johnny depp himself), Lalala song and 'Pourtant' Also there are french songs as well as english and the lyrics are very interesting. Vanessa takes her time to come out with a album (average one every 5 years) an therefore she is not commercial like many artists these days. She works with people she likes to work with and that is interesting. Vanessa was the first artist calling the french artist 'M' at the very beginning of his career (he often confirms it in interviews) and he is in France now become very famous and his participation in this CD is greatly appreciated !Thank you Vanessa and I am looking forward listening to your new CD out in April 2005 :-)))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Loser","review":"What a horrible voice!

There's everything from the sort of techno and electric guitar stomp of \\"Commando\\" to the fragile samba lounge of \\"St. Germain\\". Jazzy horns fill out many of the tracks while \\"L'eau et le Vin\\" has a middle eastern flavor. Other tracks have a folky sound. Overall, though, there is a similarity of the material that keeps the disc sounding cohesive rather than flighty.Of course, she's no diva wailer but I like that. I like the way she uses what she has. Her vocals are seductive and she makes certain her voice fits in as it leads the music and then at other times seems to hide inside it. Much more intelligent singing than alot of the shrieking that is popular nowadays.The arrangements are classy and simple.

The genuine article. The very same football that is used in NFL games. Enjoy the smell and feel of real leather. You may have to condition the skin of the ball, by wetting it, in order to achieve a better grip as the skin is fairly slick right out of the box. Also, the instructions on the ball say to inflate at 10-12 pounds, but if you do this you'd better have the large hands of a Manning or McNair in order to get a grip, because it'll be as hard as a rock. For tossing the pigskin with friends I suggest inflating only to about 8-10 pounds so that your fingers can put a decent indent on the skin and give you better control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bilingual Parallel text - French and English","review":"I love reading bilingual or parallel French and English books.

I knew I'd have to have the same Dora game, but could only find this L-MAX version. The problem starts with a feature of the L-MAX that only allows one of the games called \\"Animal Adventure\\" to be played if L-MAX is plugged into the TV. That means the older, cheaper verion of Dora offers an extra game on the handheld! I think product development really dropped the ball on this one.I returned the L-MAX version and found the cheaper plain Leapster version instead. I'm still offended that Leapfrog would charge more for this version and offer less.If your kid doesn't need to plug into the tv, pass this one up and shop for the non-L-MAX version of Dora's Wildlife Adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"What can I say?

An email to Amazon brought a VERY prompt reply and an offer to Air Express a replacement unit or issue a refund. The second one arrived in two days and is just as contaminated. Looks like a grimey gray wavey film on the bottom of the glass that simply needs a two second cleaning. What a shame that this simple that task is not something Canon thinks ever needs to be done.

As other reviewers have indicated, there was a lot of page turning back and forth to find the right chart to go with the right question but there are plenty of charts to support the material provided.

In the introduction to the book he states that the book is created to appeal to both novices and people with substantial experience.

It carried me right to his cockpit and flew me through Mach 1, 2 and 3 with deafening passion.Chuck Yeager represents that generation of Americans who felt that making history was cooler than making money. He risked his life believing in what was best for his country without an ounce of hesitation. He enjoyed taking chances and learned from each flight to prepare him better for the next.On top of all that, General Yeager is a patient, hard-working, honest, charismatic, altruistic, relentless, loving, humorous, and controversy-free man.

General Yeager holds no punches in his recollections of mistreatment by the envious, unctuous newcomers bent on having his career derailed, due to his lack of educational credentials.

You can also strike a man out with the right pitcher, but I hit four home ones in two innings on the highest difficulty level available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Die than Play","review":"High Heat Baseball is a very disappointing game. The graphics are horrible. I was playing Sega Dreamcast World Series 2K1 and when I switched to this I thought there would be better graphics. Instead I got players like Brady Anderson that don't have beards in real life but in the game they do. When pitching, you can't control where the ball is going, you can only control if it is a ball or a strike.For instance you can tell it to throw a fast ball for a strike, and it will throw it right down the middle for an easy home run. You can catch a ball that is 6 feet away and when a player throws it goes off way to the side of you and you still catch it. But fielding and base running is very fun in this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad graphics and a lack of realism ruin this game.","review":"To begin, let me just say that I don't understand why people think that this game is so good. Firstly, the graphics are extremely poor when you consider the power of the PS2. Even given the most advanced graphics engine on the planet, 3DO still managed to make this game's graphics look like an old 16-bit cartrige. In addition, this game lacks realism. The fielders take forever to reach the ball, even when it is just grounded to the shortstop. Also, it is impossible to warm up pitchers or locate any pitches with any accuracy at all. Overall, if you are looking for a great baseball game for the PS2, go with Triple Play Baseball. It has better graphics, a better pitching engine, and the fielders stay awake. This game was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game is a JOKE!!","review":"terrible graphics, no franchise mode, everything that made high heat a great baseball game before has been neglected to be included. while the AI is challenging, it is still to easy to hit a home run and even when u do, youll be hardpressed to even hear the crowd cheer for you.

The other reviews talk about realistic game play, the fact of the matter is the graphics and player animations are so bad, that any realism is lost because of this! My final ratings as follows: 1.)

All the time he is half-standing and half-sitting. This is bull. I only give this game 2 stars for gameplay.If graphics is impportant for you, buy an All-Stat baseball.

I just had to have it. Now I'm not going to lie. If you put this game on rookie it's like a walk in the park, but if you get the difficulty on the right level. This game will have you on the edge of your seat. I love playing HH baseball that is the reason why I buy some many of their products. But this one for PS2 has to be the best I've seen. Sure they lack Ichiro and Spencer, but they've substitute that take their place. This game is a must buy for serious gamers. If you love stats-like gameplay go purchase this one today.

I don't know and it doesn't matter-I took the game back and picked up High Heat. This is a much better game for those who want to experience a more realistic baseball simulation. Everything TPB didn't have in the control department, HH has. It's fun and it will satisfy the MLB fan in anyone. The only problem is the graphics, which, for a PS2 game are somewhat...disappointing.

Not so hot is the understatement of the year. The graphics are terrible. I mean worse than any PS1 game that I ever played.

The announcers repeat the same quotes over and over, many times the same comment will be heard consecutively. I wouldn't waste a dime on this game. My advice is to rent it before you buy it. I would recommend EA triple play. It does not have the AI that High Heat has but the game looks great and a lot more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BASEBALL GAME OUT FOR PS2","review":"this is the best game of the 3 out.

As a avid gamer I see that this was probaly a rush title. Most Sports video games are released just before the regular season. I know after playing the PC version the company now has time to focus on improvements.I would like to see a create a player mode as well as a minor league roster, a career mode would do wonder for this product.I like the fact that you can hit doubles and triples. I like the fact that the computer runs the players that have a high steal rating. The computer also puts on hit and run. Just for fun I would like them to add a sequence on which the Manager comes out and argues with the umpire and this would add momentum to your team or the computer team. I would like to see that if your fans chant you have a rating boost. I like this title and look forward to playing this in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"No product recevied","review":"Less than one star as I have never received the product but they took my money!!! : ("},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived in appalling condition","review":"I ordered three of these from Hirt's through Amazon and regret that I had not checked reviews for Hirt's Nursery prior to placing an order.

Good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Examination","review":"I have enjoyed the film \\"2001\\" countless times, and decided to buy this book; what a waste of time. This book offers little other than very basic scene analyisis, and some general (and fairly weak) speculations about the film. I was also supprised that the author was mistaken about which characters were in what scenes, and seemed to think that both Frank and Dave are interchangble. A large portion of the book doesn't even pertain to 2001, and mostly served as an excuse for the author to promote his other books, which he shamlessly suggests you buy. Well I'm sorry I got this book and certainly won't be purchasing any of his other books. If you want a book about 2001, I suggest looking elsewhere; as I will be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE WITH A CAPITAL T","review":"This DVD is terrible with a capital T. The two most important elements of a movie are the audio and the visuals, both are poor. There seems to be no direction involved with the film. It is more like a \\"home movie\\".Along with the poor sound and video is the slack musicianship on the DVD. In other words the band is terrible too. If it were a club date it would be as if they were having an off night. Find yourself another movie, this one is not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"First let me state that I am a fan of both JJ Cale and Leon Russell. That being said, there is little to like about this video.The sound quality is decent, but the video portion, while clear, is pathetic. Constant fade ins and outs from one shot to another are certain to give the viewer a headache after about 5 minutes. The camera is seldom on JJ, and while he is playing some great guitar solos the viewer is treated to a shot of Leon Russell sitting there looking stupid. Christine Lakewood looks like she took a couple of Quaaludes, and occupies far too much camera time.As if all that were not enough, JJ Cales hair looks like a Chia Pet, and one of the keyboard players is wearing shorts and roller skates.My advice is to turn off the picture of this DVD, and simply listen to the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The (True?)

Although you may have a broadcast copy of this show, the upgrade and clarity should mandate getting a copy of this. The other material on the disc is woefully disappointing with the exception of a short clip of Alex walking down Wardour Street. But who could expect anything to compete with AK's performance of classic standards from his repetoire. Alex, I hope they have your favourite smokes where you are now.

If that's the case, then this is the book for you. However, I found it difficult to read as the author does not get to the point. Too much time is spent on the simplest things while ignoring the point of the text. It would have been nice to pick up a book like this and get to the point of 'how to' without having to jump hoops through the history of things. That was not the point of the purchase of such a book nor the representation of the cover. There was no point reading the entire text as I quickly realized that much of it was \\"filler\\" text and I could skip to the parts I thought were interesting. My recommendation would be to look for other title options before this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Holiday Fare from Finland","review":"The Kaasinen sisters are best known for their work with Varttina, but this is a side project and is not actually a Varttina release.

Their version of Stille Nacht on the Kantele is nothing short of heavenly. This is a consistent favourite of mine throughout the winter. This is a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price, highly recommend.","review":"I've had this up for a couple of weeks now, it's great.

Relative to the MKSAP and other Q&A sources I'd come across, this one gave me the chance to cover ALOT more questions in the same amount of time because the Q&A were highly representative in subject matter, yet much more succinct.

The video is grainy, the staging is not up to today's standards, but this is how it was done back then, seems like you are back in the era. Other reviewers picked this apart, belching about poor musical and vocal backup, aging groups, vacant stares. What do they expect? Yeah, it was low budget, but this added to the experience. And the performers, Criminy, they are in the 70 to 80 year old range, and still performing!!! I loved this set. Loved it when it was on VHS and originally on PBS. Loved the performers and the slice of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just doesn't get any better than this!","review":"This gathering of Doo Wop Greats is remarkable, these guys are all in their late 50's and sixties and they all sound very good!

One reviewer on here said Jimmy was painfully off key, Jimmy Gallagher off key??? I doubt it! I don't know what Doo Wop 50 you watched sir but the one I saw Jimmy, Frank, Tony and Steve were Amazingly Good, their performance is worth the price of the DVD alone.

She was absolutely thrilled to receive it and LOVED watching it!!! Best gift ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Few Billboard Hot 40 Hits","review":"The direction and camera work is atrocious. I did not care for the first pan across the Cadillac seat and after the fourth or fifth pan, it was very tiresome. Also, panning the old cars that sat behind the set did absolutely nothing to improve the music or the experience. Panning the crowd and the entertainers was not done very well. Many other amateur directorial gaffes. After the first 8 songs (out of total 38 songs), there are no more Billboard Hot 40 hits, just B-side tunes that still do not warrant purchasing today. Also, most of the groups were not all original members, but members reconstituted from other doo wop groups. After the first song, or two, Jerry Butler seemed to detract from the experience, instead of enhancing it. I have heard Doo Wop 51 on PBS and I was expecting this one to be equally as good. I was greatly disappointed. I will stick with my doo wop mp3s. I have a free Doo Wop 50 DVD if anyone wants it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This DVD has some of the greatest performances from a bygone era. The greatest thing about it is that it takes place now. The artists sound as good as they did then. The show is loaded with memories and the performers although getting old, are still wonderful. The sound (5.1) is great and the only problem is the video direction which isn't the greatest but don't let that bother you. It is well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"COOL LOOKING, BUT MADE LIKE SH*$T!","review":"So I love the way these shoes look, I'm a huge Fluevog fan and have a few other pairs.

The author seems extremely detached, even when talking about her \\"raw passion.\\" In fact, Lopez Torregrosa is the least interesting of the characters in the book. Her mother and sister seem like more complex figures. I much prefer Esmeralda Santiago's memoirs, which are far more readable and engaging, even if they sometimes resort to cliches. At least she makes you care for the characters, and her own personal hardships, which Lopez Torregrosa unfortunately does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud","review":"Not a very interesting book. The author states over and over and over again how emotional she is because her mother died at age 78. She drinks alcohol. Chapter after chapter. However, her love for her mother is never shown in detail, its just mouth service. Blah Blah Blah. I'm so upset. Goal of book is to show author's family is very high class.

He has a way of both making complex topics easy for beginners, and for taking professionals to a new level.That said, this book was a real disappointment. I would ONLY recommend it for someone who is very new to music software, very young, or who has no access to the internet to download the Reason demo or partake of the several Reason discussion groups online .The Propellorheads team offers a fully functional (except \\"save\\") demo, so you can try the program out for free. Many online groups offer technical aid to beginners.If you buy Reason, you get a very well written printed manual with a good \\"Quick Start\\" manual, along with an in-depth pdf manual. That, along with Reason's excellent free tech support team and robust online community, are more than you need to help you get up & running with this complex program, demo or paid.Save the [$] toward your own copy of Reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Free manual is better...","review":"This book is REALLY thin, large print, essentially a very basic guide to Reason. You'd do much better to download the demo of Reason and take a look at the accompanying documentation or simply go to the Propellerheads.se site and read the synopses for each of the tools included in Reason. It might seem complex (there's a lot in it!), but Reason is for the most part very straight forward-- you'll learn everything in the book by playing w/ the free demo in about 5-10 minutes. The only thing you may need to look up is how to output matching MIDI data for the REX files (that's in the docs).As far as the book goes, I suggest looking at it in person first and get it only if you've got a bit of extra cash in your pocket. My recommendation: Pass on this and use the $[money] toward buying the real app."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major [waste of money]","review":"Under the title of the book it says \\"The absolute beginner's guide...\\" Well take that VERY VERY literally. This book does nothing more than walk you through getting your feet wet with Reason. There is nothing here that you wouldn't get by going through the excellent Reason manual. Don't be foold by the promise of videos and samples either. You get 4 videos that tell you close to nothing and I have more fingers than there are samples on the CD. I also bought the Sonar Quick Start book from Wizoo. These books are blatently taking advantage of the fact that there's precious little info on these programs right now. The books are 48 pages with big type and lots of white space. They are the most insulting low content books I've ever seen or purchased.

Ring of Red is an example of this.Sure it's pretty and has some nice ideas - but this is not a replacement for classic mech games such as Front Mission 3. There are some interesting additions such as the soldiers but very frequently missions become extremely repetitive - there isn't enough variety to keep you coming - at it's heart it's a very simplistic strategy game which drags out R..E..A...L...L...Y S....L...O...W...L...Y thanks to the 'innovative' realtime combat system (which you can't even pause if you need to go and do something!).Sure you've bought a PS2 and your desperate for something to play on it - but hold out a bit longer - there must be some good stuff on the horizon?! ;-) Musn't there?In the meanwhile get your copy of SSX and boot it back up - much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ring of Boredom","review":"I just rented this game and I think its horrible! I've read the reviews here and it seems some people actually liked this game. I can't see why. It is painfully SLOW. The action is reduced to a wobbling site that has to be placed on a target before you fire...hardly worthy of the PS2. Aside from that, you have to sit through babbling conversations between characters before you actually get to play. Tank battle on my Atari 2600 had much better action than this game. It also gives you an idea how long I've been playing games. Strategy? Action? More like boredom and frustration. The only good thing I have to say about this game is that I rented it and didn't fork out forty bucks to find out how bad it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save money by not buying this game!!!!","review":"Please don't waste your money on Ring of Red, You'll only dissapoint yourself by doing so. The reason why is because it is a terrible game, after a couple days of playing this game, you'll never want to play it again. In the 10 hours I wasted playing this game, the only thing I ever did was walk around the world map fighting enemy robots. Another reason not to buy this game is that you can't save you game in the middle of each mission (Each of them take about 2-3 hours), so you'll be playing this game all day before your able to save. The only thing more boring than playing this game is listening to dull conversations going on between the characters. I regret buying this game, so I advise you NOT to buy it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Game!","review":"This game is very fun to play.The graphics are great.The gameplay is easy,(once you get used to it)and the game doesn't end quickly like some of the others.If you like strategy,this one's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"i dont see how people could like this game. the gameplay is extremely slow, ive pretty much beaten the game but, i think it is a complete waste of time to play"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a game.","review":"This is a comic book. With too much plot. Endless pages of text dialog you must scroll through before getting to even a very short action sequence. Even the action is dull and has too much dialog.

If you're looking for action - look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This is an awful game. The gameplay is really weak. I was hoping that this might be a great strategy game for the PS2, but it was a very lame action game that tries to throw in some strategy aspects and fails at both attempts. You control a group of mecs and the strategy lies in moving them around a \\"chess board\\" type landscape. The action part of the game involves you deciding when you want to shoot the other mec. Basically, a timer starts ticking, and as the seconds pass, your accuracy rating increases. If you shoot too early, you will probably miss the other mec. If you wait too long, the other mecc will hit you first and throw you off guard, resetting the accuracy gague. That's it. Finally, you top that off with the fact that there are truly awful cutscenes after every move and there is no way to bypass them. This game is a big thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shell Shock at 85%","review":"Mechwarrior fans will lover Ring of Red because it is very closely related to the game. Ring of Red is a story about WW2 not ending with the bombing of Japan. The war dragged on and brought in a new style of combat that involved Mechs. The gameplay learning curve takes a while to master. Once you identify which mechs and squads to match up against oppossing enemy then it becomes very fun. However one thing about this game is that they seemed to cut some elements of the game that should have been there. For example voice-overs, the game could have used voice-overs! And they could have used animations thru the breifing stages and small cutscenes. But the game is still fun but reading thru all the dialogue makes me feel like im in front of my old Playstation again. But all in all its a great game that may have been rushed to fatten the game market for PS2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"This is a great game. It takes a while to learn the basic gameplay and battle sequences. But once you do, the game becomes fun and pretty addictive. There are a ton of missions and chapters, so you'll have many hours of gameplay waiting for you. The story is interesting, the graphics and nice, and the sound is great.

The cars \\"speed\\" along at a snails pace. Free Roam? I didn't see any free roam. I bought this game because it was supposed to have more free roam areas than Test drive wide open off road which only has three. Test Drive rocks, the trucks are fast, the gameplay is fast, I hope they come out with a second one with more free roam areas. If you like unrealistic slow moving vehicles buy 4x4 Evo, if you want fast mud pounding terrain trouncing fun, buy Test Drive Offroad Wide Open! Too bad there is no option for 0 Stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long To Load, Bad To Go Fast And Control","review":"... When you race, you can't go fast at all! Controlling is impossible to do.

It has much replay value - 15 courses, 32 race series with avg. 4 races, vehicles from the major manufacturers and various parts to purchase and tweak your vehicle for better performance. This is a game for your library and a good practice for GT3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best but its still fun.","review":"This may not be the funnest offroad racer out there, and the graphics really arent all that great(except in replay mode), but there is a lot too keep you going here. There is a total of 112 suvs and trucks that are all customizable.There are tons of parts to buy for your vehicles and much less limitations than on gran turismo 2. The handling and physics of the game are pretty good despite what other people may say. The point is if you like cars are trucks or suvs or whatever you'll probably like buying and custimizing the differant vehicles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I rented this game from BlockBuster to see if I would enjoy it enough to buy it, and IMO this game was not even worth the $6 rental fee. Although the graphics are certainly beautiful, a combination of unrealistic physics, quirky handling and boring tracks ruins the game. Even worse, the game crashed with the following message before I had even logged 1/2hr of play time:Invalid Vehicle Number!

The free range of driving off the track is a big plus. It has all fun of upgrading similar to armored core except it is based just a little more on reality. I suggest setting your game to an easier level though. It can be very frustrating to race an entire race prefectly up until the end and then make one tiny mistake and go from first to last in a split second. My poor controler shall rest in peace and i will make sure to heed the warning at the beginning of the game and take breaks often. this was my first controler lost to me due to aggrevation at simple game, but it is testament to how engrossing this game can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and Shocking for all 4x4 Enthusiasts!","review":"Hearing the engines of SUV's and trucks reving up \\"locked\\" in 4x4 gets alot of people's blood pumping. This game is exciting for those who love games that involve racing off road. From snow, sleet, ice, rain, mud, dirt, and rocks, 4x4 Evolution has it all. Controls are very responsive and not-quirky. The sound is stunning and very realistic. \\"Turning\\" and off road driving is just like you were doing it yourself. Only bad thing is, this game seems to base it's tracks on one purpose, there is nothing really \\"new\\" in the tracks, just your usual turns and objects.

This game is also available for the PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"A helpful hint","review":"This adaptor has the aperture stop down rim, which pushes in the small pin on the back of an m42 lens to allow the aperture blades to close as you move the aperture ring. For lenses which have the switch to move between M and A mode, this is entirely unecessary, and can even become a problem with some lenses. I know that the Pentax Super Takumar 50mm f/1.4 will have problems focusing to infinity on adaptors with this rim. Save yourself the trouble and find out without a rim."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GAME SUCKS","review":"If you like Oblivion you will hate this game. Crappy graphics, the most ridiculous dialogue ever and bad game play. I have never been this disappointed in a video game purchase. I really wanted this to be a good RPG.

The graphics are great but it freezes every few mins because of all the grass graphics and such. I guess you could get more indepth with the game and have more of a story line, I personaly beat the game in 4 hours max. You can just hack and slash your way through it the designers left alot of bugs in it so you can get past doing alot of stuff by simply killing quest people, which takes alot out of the game.Above all its a 2/5 for me. It has a online mode but the southpeak game servers are so laggy with online play its like watching your character do the matrix in slow mo the whole time you play. I'd say its only worth the 10 bucks if you really want fast gamer points"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This game sucks and I actually played it for a while. I think that sums up the reviews, both the bad and good ones. Its not a good game people. Some have simply chosen to seriously overlook all its flaws to enjoy the few likable things about it. Things such as the weapons and as any rpg player loves, the leveling up aspect. But everything else about it is very dull and not worthy of today's standards. How can a game like this come out quite a few years after games like Oblivion? A true step back. 2/5 and that is kinda generous for the most part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exact opposite of fun.","review":"The first second i got this game i was excited to play i always love unboxing RPG's. As soon as i played the game the font was so incredibly small i couldn't read it on a 32\\" HDTV. That wasn't the least of my issues. I entered the game to discover graphics that are from 2000. Aside from the graphics, don't listen to the people who say the voice acting is good. It is literally the same male and female for ever character. The sounds don't differentiate at all which is a major issue for modern games. That aside too the story is non-linear, but all side quests are the same, go fetch for a reward, quests. The main storyline is crap, frankly, and i didn't, no couldn't play it because it was so bad. I'm happy i bought it a [...]$ because thats ALL it's worth. Do not buy this game if your looking for fun, buy it to be put to sleep, and turned off of video games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst 360 Game Hands down.","review":"First of all i'm not going to try and compare this game to Oblivion because as far as i'm concerned it doesn't hold a candle to it. This Game has graphics that are worse then current gen games. It baffles me that such a ugly game can have such horrible frame rate. The blood effects resemble something from a genesis or snes game. Horrible voice acting that doesn't even sync up correctly with the lips movement. This game proves that if it isn't well known or hyped up it probably won't be any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A NEXT-GEN EXPERIENCE","review":"This game is a sad joke.

What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two steps WAY BACK","review":"I'm an RPG fanatic and enjoy playing practically all of them (even the bad ones). However, poor voice acting/writting, terrible graphics (especially for a 360 game that came out AFTER Oblivion, one of the best RPG's of all time), average combat, and horrendous char system make this game practically unplayable. 4 stats? 1 race?

It was like something shot in the early 80s. I would definitely avoid this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gar.Bage","review":"This game was poor in many ways, but you could have fun with it. What disappointed me most (besides a poor interface and spotty game progression) was the ending. Also, I ran around the map at a pretty low level, avoiding encounters (I was bored). I ran into a person who immediately progressed my story WAYYY ahead, in a way that made little sense, taking into account the fact that I yet to complete a number of quests.

Thankfully, I rented the game, or else I would have been out $40 and another slot of my shelf would have been taken up.The gameplay, graphics, and sound are all decent, but that's as far as it goes. After you get the general play down it's basic push button on this creature, loot the body, repeat until inventory is full.

I had to shut it off when my horse kept getting stuck on items in the environment, such as rocks and walls. The game will not let you get off the horse or dismount and you are forced to restart. I asked the employee at the game store and he told me that I should bring the game back becaue it is the worst game on the system. That is the first time I ever had a store advising me to bring back merchandise the sold to me. The game was shipped out unfinished with significant bugs. This game shouldn't even be given away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Woes","review":"This game is a \\"woeful\\" attempt to recapture the imagination and adventure of Oblivion. I found it incredibly dissapointing. I was excited as everyone else, geeking out, to play a new fantasy inspired adventure. I liked the idea, the premise that something happened to your sister and it was a part of a much larger story. Great. Then I began playing the game and I wanted to pull my eyes out of their sockets. Terrible interface. Ridiculously stupid combat. The worst inventory management imagined. Voice acting from an episode of Dark Shadows (70s version) or freaking Canterbury Tales. Graphics that would have been good on the original Xbox but hardly next gen. A waste of time and money. Maybe a renter, but one that would be played and then forgotten about when you get a request to go play Lost Planet or Gears with a friend. Avoid this at all costs, it will rob you of your joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"tears of disappoinment","review":"i have to agree with the previous reviewers. i love rpgs to death, and when i saw this game for rent, i didn't even question. now i do question why i spent the rental money on it. the voice acting is stilted and cheesy; the graphics are inexcusably choppy and the combat controls are unwieldy, often leaving you facing AWAY from the enemy, getting mauled from behind.and to add to the tragedy, the story is uninspired and generic...this is not another oblivion by a long shot.please, rent this game if you just HAVE to play it, and save your money for Mass Effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly, incomprehensibly...","review":"...awful. I eagerly awaited the release of Two Worlds, waiting through the repeated delays and bought it on launch day. I played through the whole game, too, and got about 85% of the Achievements. Mostly because I wanted to like the game. I really, really wanted to. I loved the cheesy dialogue, which I found to be hilariously refreshing. The world is big, and there are lots of monsters to kill and lots of places to explore. But the game is so flawed, I can't believe it was released. The Inventory system is completely screwed up and almost impossible to understand and organize. The graphics are bad. The surroundings are somewhat pretty, but the character just looks bad. Combat is frustrating to say the least. Skip this game, and just buy Oblivion.

I loved Diablo II on the PC and Oblivion on 360, and was looking for another good RPG. Bad choice! The entire design does not suit the 360. Fighting and spell casting are tedious. You can barely see the minimap or read the text in the quest tab. It will take you a very long to scroll through the variety of items in your pack. And riding the horse was incredibly difficult--the controls reminded me of old-time tank simulators (push left-right to turn, regardless of which way the camera is facing, and very crude speed control).I'm glad I bought this used at a certain brick-and-morter that allows returns: I'm going to get something else.

After about 3 hours of playing, I must say that I am HIGHLY disappointed. The graphics are beautiful when you are still, but when you begin to run, the backgrounds are choppy and jagged. As if the framerate didn't slow enough during single player mode, during multiplayer the game is nearly unplayable. The game has a very raw, unfinished feel to it, and isn't near of the same quality as Oblivion. I would HIGHLY recommend renting this game before making a decision to drop $60 on it.

The game is clunky and old hat, with nothing to make you even want to explore the world. And by far the worst offender is the ungodly voice acting. I swear you have never heard anything as horrible and ridiculous as the dialogue in this game. Please do not buy this piece of garbage! I am not one of thos muckrakers out there just looking for stuff to complain about. I love games and really wanted this to be good, but it's not even remotely passable.

These guys play their hearts out on stage. The next day I hit the stores and picked up this album. It's got so much to it, it keeps you jamming all the way through just like their live shows.

The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and even those don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.) And the production quality is not great either--you can't really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that. After two run-throughs, this will go in the heap of CD's that I had great hope for but never listen to. Great player, but mediocre songwriter: probably explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joyful and definitely \\"Unclassified\\"","review":"After reading several reviews I noticed that Robert Randolph is being compared to a lot of different artists. I've got a few to add to the list. This album is an energetic mix of all types of music. I hear a song like \\"Calypso\\" and it reminds me of Carlos Santana while \\"Good Times (3 Stroke)\\" sounds like Steve Vai if he'd grown up a southern Baptist. While you can hear great influences like Jeff Beck or maybe Earth Wind and Fire, it never seems derivative. The music is soulful with a style all it's own.

Though I have to give Randolph props for technical speed and passion, the material is a grave disappointment--juvenile, repetitive, shallow, and uninteresting. And no, it can't be revived by the infusion of the abovementioned energy--it just don't work. The tunes are decent funk-rock, in the vein of Sly, but the playing is at times overbearing, scalar and unpleasant, with occasional flashes of brilliance...more puzzling than interesting, more annoying in the constancy of the riffing than fun.

I Need More Love was the song they performed and it was great. I looked up more info on this group and now I have both Unclassified and Live at the Wetlands in my collection. This CD doesn't have the \\"power\\" of the live CD, but it is plenty good. It's one of the few I can put in and play straight through without skipping any songs.This is a unique blend of Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Allman Brothers, and lots of funk and blues.

The more I read, the more I realized how unrefined my own library skills were. This well-written work opened my eyes to a literary universe of books and libraries that I never even imagine existed.

Only one is related to Halloween, but I think the creators threw in The Missing Piece because it has a wizard, and The Big Storm because it's got a thunderstorm in it. So, only one episode is about Halloween, but it's one of the better Halloween shows for pre-schoolers. My 4-year old watched this last year and still watches it now. The \\"little monster\\" is not scary, and the costumes of all the Dora characters are really cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"My little one loves it!","review":"My two year old is a huge Dora fan so it was no surprise to me that she loved this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure with Dora and friends!!!","review":"I bought this DVD for my daughter Amanda~~a tried and true Dora fanatic!!!!

They invite him to go trick or treating with them, the only catch is, the lil monster must be home by the time both hands on the clock are on the 12. Last time I checked, when it's dark outside, that would mean that they are out trick or treating until 12AM!!!!!! Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a night of trick or treating fun, but the preschoolers tht I know are pretty much finished trick or treating after around 9pm!

The graphics are breath taking and soooo wonderful!!!! There are multiple ways the story line can go, which makes the re-playability awesome. In this game you can go back and change your own destiny, even change the way the town looks. There are a lot of cut scences in this one, but that didnt bother me one bit because the graphics were so beatiful! The town is excellently designed, awesome motion, the people really look and move like people. The game is a bit easy, because there are so many clues given it pretty much tells you what you have to do, in order to change your destiny. But it is really fun and I am enjoying every bit of the game. My suggestion is to go and get yourself a copy, you wont regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Not worth the money","review":"I was SO excited about getting to play this game. I rushed through Silent Hill 2 to start this one and was so disapopinted. The theory and story line are good, as are the graphics. But the whole game was over with in under 4 hours. There weren't many choices given throughout the game so I don't imagine there can be much variation on the endings. It certainly is not worth paying $50 for and I have no interest in playing it again. The puzzles were stupidly simple and there was very little thought needed to go into \\"where do I go next?\\". Save yourself the money. Rent the game from Blockbuster for 5 nights... you'll have it solved in 4 hours anyway!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good graphics, interesting storyline...but short and dull.","review":"The beginning of the game starts out being interesting and mysterious enough, and the first half of the game (took me a couple hours) was fun to play, but after that it went downhill. The detail is incredible, but the entire game takes place within the space of a few city blocks. You eventually get tired of all the running back and forth between buildings and finding nothing, switching to a new time period only to find nothing and switch to yet another. The time paradoxes are interesting, but some of them really dont make sense, and the endings are rather dissapointing, as well. Depending on the ending you get, the game explains various parts of whats *really* going on, as if you hadnt figured it out the first time. I got all the endings (there are a few pivotal points where the choices you make determine the ending you get) and found it to be an utter waste of time. Replay value is nil, I'll never pick it up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the game!","review":"Does anyone know if there will be a sequel to this game, or are there any other 'choose your own adventure' games that are similar to this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great game with a great story!","review":"This game is a great game. It has a very good storyline and pretty good graphics. If you like games where you have to use your brain and solve stuff, this is your game. The characters are well developed. My only complaint is that the game is not long enough. I can beat the game in a couple of hours. If they make a sequel, I would like it to be a double disc so there can be twice as much. even that little complaint can't take away from this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie or game?","review":"This so called game has a very good story and plot. It keeps your attention, by making you want to see what happens next. However, the gameplay could not satisfy an 8 year old. Why you ask? Because there is none. You watch 15 minutes of cinematics and then are pretty much told what you have to do. There is really not much thought needed since you are pretty much led directly to where you have to be or the object you need. Oooooh. there are multple endings. Whoopee! You still have to sit through a majority of the same cinematics and virtually do nothing. Out of the 5 or 6 hours spent playing this game through the first time, I would estimate that I only needed the controller in my hand for 30 minutes. This makes for a good movie but don't buy it if you actually like to PLAY your games instead of watch them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game was a waste of money","review":"I bought this game without renting it first (my first mistake). It was one of the worst games i've ever played. One of the most Irritating things about it was that you spent about 80 percent of the time watching the game vs. actually playing. The storyline [was bad] too. Very boring game."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think so!","review":"Yeah, the graphics and voice are cool but please...the actual game was sorry. I played through chapter 2 and stopped, I wasn't even remotely interested in what was going to happen next. You spend half your time reclining on the couch with the controller next to you watching a very long and boring movie hoping to god you get to play soon. I love murder mysteries but as far as I'm concerned Eike can stay dead because I'm not especially interested in finding out who killed him."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game is craaaaap","review":"This game was completely boring and as soon as I beat it (under a day mind you) I threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually appealing but leaves much to be desired.","review":"I bought this game after reading the rave reviews and must say, at the risk of sounding picky, that I found the game left much to be desired. The graphics, music, and sound are quite magnificent but the story is disjointed at best and rather insulting to the intelligence. I finished this game in less than two days just through casual play. To be frank I found the ending so hokey-pokey that I had no desire to play the game again to see what other endings there might be. The voice-overs were better than average but many were just plain silly and the dialogue unecessary. I would have given this game three and half stars but unfortunately I didn't have the option. If you are new video games and enjoy visual stimulation without much substance than you will enjoy this game. This reviewer was drawn in at the very beginning but was left wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun murder mystery game","review":"Initial word of mouth on this game is that it played like the Resident Evil games. Not really. This is like an interactive story where your decisions based on time travel influence foreseen incidences of your death. Once I started playing this, I was definitely drawn into it with each chapter that I completed. If you like decision-based storyline games, definitely try this game out."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GAME!!","review":"Ok shadow of Destiny Is Great...A Little Short im Able to beat it just under 2 hours but since there are 5 endings its great to play over My Personal Favorite is Ending B After you Talk to hugo After He Gives you 20 minutes to bring Homunulus Back go to the Fortune Teller Talk to her Then She will tell you who she is The Go Back to hugo and Talk to him again.I Beat the game 3 times and have the Ending B,C,and D Ending C is The Saddest It Brought a Tear It Was Funny at some times.I just Hope there is a Sequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!","review":"I wish I could find more games like this. It's basically a choose your own adventure story (that you can interact with) about time travel, 2 of the best things in this world put together.

The story arises from the imagination and the amount of time you put into it.A valuable addition to your bedtime library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for early readers!!","review":"This is an excellent book for kids - especially those just starting to get into books. There is minimal language, but definitely a story and an exciting picture on every page. There are 10 hamsters, each with their own 'persona' and an ant that you can hunt for (like the mouse in Goodnight Moon) - kids love the search and find aspect and they are excited with each turn of the page. They can easily recognize and remember the dialogue so they can 'read' the book too. I think it is a great, great book - also a wonderful gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you say..\\"Where is the.......\\"","review":"This book is great for little ones. We loved Good night Gorilla and this book. My daughter loves to play the \\"where is the.....(soccer ball, stroller, umbrella, etc.)\\" game. I point something out that is on the page and she looks for it. Great picture/word recognition for little ones. My daughter absolutely loves this book. Very little words, but it takes us a long time to read by playing the game mentioned above. One odd thing, the boy puts on his pj's before he takes his bath, But my little one hasn't really noticed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What fun!","review":"This is a really cute book, although there's not much reading involved. It's about a boy and his hamster who give a \\"10 Minute Bedtime Tour\\" to a family of hamsters.

(One of the hamsters is even a scrapbooker!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"10 minutes till Bedtime","review":"My kids cannot get enough of this book. I ordered it used but in \\"very good condition\\". This statement wasn't incorrect but when I received the book I noticed that the seller forgot to mention that somebody had stamped the letter \\"P\\" on two of the front pages. Not a big deal for us (coincidentally our last name starts with a \\"P\\") but I think they could at least have mentioned this imperfection when they advertised the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Real Book!","review":"I was very excited to get this book because of the great reviews and the Caldecott Medal but was quickly disappointed. It is hardly a book. Although it has great pictures and could have easily been a great book, it was not. We read our books (not just look at pictures) and there is absolutely no story here. Page 1...1o mins til bedtime, page 2...9 mins til bedtime, page 3...8 mins til bedtime. That was it-no story-just the same sentence over and over. I have to assume that the artist wrote the book and I really wish that they had brought a real author on board. There was such great potential here but in my opinion it fell flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as \\"Good Night, Gorilla\\" by the same author.","review":"I had high hopes for this book after reading \\"Good Night, Gorilla\\", but was disappointed. The \\"story\\" is just plain weird. The text seems to be geared towards a 2 year old, yet the illustrations are too busy for a toddler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots to talk about with your toddler ...","review":"There's no story, as such, but there's so much going on in the illustrations that this book takes considerably longer than 10 mins for my son and I to get through at night.There are lots of 'running themes' through the book - which makes for a fun time trying to find the same characters in the different illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read - your toddler will love it!","review":"I got this book for my 2.5 years old nephew. We had a great time reading it and he begged for it each day. The book does not have a lot of text, but the pictures are truly worth a thousand words. There's a lot going on in each page; which makes for a fun time discussing all the things going on. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book for a 4 year old!","review":"My son who just turned 4 absolutely adores this book. He can spend forever looking at each page, finding each numbered hamster while always finding something new too. We all laugh out loud at the silly antics of those hamsters. We can't read it before bedtime though - my son gets too excited and wound up! We tend to read it during the day more. I really enjoy 'reading' this book, and my son and husband love poring over the pictures. A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining for elementary age readers!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed all the activity in each colorful page. The author interactively presented her book to two elementary classes at the bookstore where I work. The children really got into each page. My 17 year old son read it the day before and it made him laugh out loud. It is amazing that all the activiy takes place in only 10 minutes! Look for characters from her other books in this one and have fun reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"19 month old loves 10 Minutes... Has to have it!","review":"My 19th month old son loves this book; he'll drag it out for us to read to him at least once a day. And at bedtime you can forget about any other books if he spies this one. It has very little text so you can change the story and comments each time which if oyu've ever read a booka hundred times is a nice option. The illustrations are detailed so you can find something new eachtime but not so cluttered that it's confusing. And if you are familiar with Goodnight Gorilla, also by Rathman, there is a scene from that book in the background of one in 10 Minutes... Bottom line, buy ths book if you have a small child. They'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll find something new upon each reading","review":"My three year old daughter's favorite activity is reading, and she loves \\"10 Minutes till Bedtime\\" ever since she was two years old. The text is simple-- 10 minutes till bedtime, 9 minutes till bedtime, and so on. But the illustration is smart and funny. Every time we read the book, we find something that we've never noticed before. For example, we found the Candy Land game on one of the pages, and we found \\"Good Night, Gorilla\\" on another page. It is fun for both parent and child to observe the details of the story and talk about what is going on. It is a must have in your child's book collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a delight!","review":"What a delightful discovery this is.

Inks are cripplingly $$ compared to other brands. Avoid it if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Printer","review":"When one computer guru talks to another about printers, Epson never comes up, why mention a horrid product when an HP will do it better, faster, quieter, and NEVER break. First off, all Epsons, including this one, all have the printer head built on into the printer, if that goes, which it will usually after 8-12 months, one must go out and buy another printer. HP and Lexmark both have the print head on the cartridge, so if the prints don't look spectacular, get rid of the cartridge, not the printer as you would with Epson. Also Epson's waste so much ink cleaning and cleaning, they use an air system to output the ink to the paper whereas HP and Lexmark use electricity to output the ink, which doesn't require the cleaning. Spend a lttle more and get some quality, buy an HP 932C."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Printer - Terrible Customer Service","review":"My first printer was defective and Epson replaced it with a refurbished model despite mine being only two days old. The replacement was also defective! The third worked fine. They lost track of the one I mailed back and sent a letter months later threatening to charge me for the \\"nonreturned\\" unit. Epson promised to replace the ink cartridges wasted in the attempt to repair the first two units. After repeated calls to their (non-toll free number), still no cartidges.

I recommend this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great print quality, poor product quality","review":"At the begining you have to think, why other printers can't print this good? believe me, few printers in this price range can match the output quality of the 880. The problem came when the ink ran out, although the printer monitor shows some ink in the tanks, there is almost no output in the print head, after many print head cleanings, i decided to change the cartridges, new cartriges but no output, sadly, the warranty had expired (because i only used to print photos, it was seldomly used) and now i am stuck with a somewhat expensive and bulky door stop. This is the second time it happens to me with an Epson. Do yourself a favor and buy any other brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Winner","review":"I've had this printer for nearly 3 years and it prints today just as good as it did when new. I see no need to upgrade as I doubt any printer out yet can print photos any better than the 880. Uses lots of ink as previous reviewers mention but I use aftermarket refills from Meritline.com. I get 5 cartridges for the price of one Epson brand and the print quality is amazing. Always use the Epson paper for best results and you'll be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper feed problems","review":"When I bought my printer I was excited to get it home and start prining pictures and documents. My excitement soon faded, the paper feed is unreliable. Any time I start my printer it never feeds the first sheet, I have to coax the paper for a couple of minutes before it feeds.I have also been having problems with the color, when printing pictures the color does not match what is on the computer. To verify that it is a problem with this printer I have taken the same picture to other printers and made far higher quality pictures.

You need white gloves, a mirror and at least a half hour of undisturbed time to do the exercises, not to mention many tricky finger placements to \\"trigger\\" the muscles. Even the narrator on the video refers to them as 'tricky'. I honestly can't see myself doing these exercises consistently over any period of time.I think that if you are going to try and do facial exercises, they have to be fairly simple and you shouldn't need \\"props\\" to perform them.

It's like the old arcade games of the '70s like Robotron and Contra... just guys swarming at you constantly, and you're layin' down the lead...oh yeah, the other thing is you MUST pick up the same powerups in sequence to upgrade your weapon.

There's no complex mission here, just pick up and play. The concept is simple, shoot the \\"evil\\" tan troops (they are plastic, there's no blood in site) while marching through various types of terrain. Nice effects and a good dash of humor.

I have played a couple of the Army Men games for the PS1 and really enjoyed them, especially two player mode. They were fairly simplistic, but all in all, good fun. So I was very interested when the Army Men: Green Rouge came out for the PS2, but I could not believe how bad this game is. The only thing that I liked was the opening movie. Other than that, the weapons are slow, the game is always forcing you forward which gives you little control over your soldier, the ability to aim your weapon is difficult to impossible, and thier is no two player mode. 3DO should be ashamed for releasing such a poor game!

Not just for the army men series but out of every game I have ever played. the only good thing about it is the opening movie after that it's a big let down. contra atleast allowed the player to think about movement and stradegy this game doesn't even allow that. the weapons are useless and boring, the screen pushes the omega along, and the tan troops might as well be space invader type AI. Boy am I glad I rented it. to be honest even that amount of money was to much. To the people of 3do, sarges hero's 2 was a great game just improve on it. the omega would be a nice addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Frustration Than its Worth","review":"This is a big disappointment, the controls are horrible so the Omega is hard to handle. The screen keeps you moving forward so if you miss something or an enemy you can't get them and you have to shoot the enemy off screen.

I agree with everyone else, rent this game first-don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor excuse to release a quick game","review":"This is the first game in the ARMY MEN series that I've played. Friends told me that the past titles were innovative and clever. If what they had to say is true, then the 3DO company didn't transfer their talents to this game. Even though the game is laid out in a three dimensional setting, I felt as though I was playing 2D Contra on the old NES. Each level is basically the same terrain, but colored differently to give you a sense of \\"oh, these must be the mountains\\" or \\"hey, now we're in the forest.\\" You have no real decisive power on where the Green Rouge travels or even what pace to keep. A continually scrolling landscape pushes you along as you pummel the tans with a weak targeting system. Long, monotonous, stagnant, boring. If you absolutely must see this game firsthand, then I suggest a quick trip to your local rental store. Even then, you will most likely turn around and drop it in the return box the same day. Erase this one from your curiosity synapses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another... Game from 3DO","review":"What can I say? It's 3DO. I don't think 3DO has made a good game since...well...ever.

In his attempt to play a bitter B movie star who never got a shot, Campbell is just a bit too convincing and bit too close to home.Add a star if you can quote Army of Darkness from memory but even die-hard Campbell fans will only find modest amusement in this film.The DVD extras are quite nice and add some entertainment value but the main attraction is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme Some Sugar","review":"This movie was bad in a good way.

The dark and black portion of scenes were very digitized. I did not enjoy this film at all. I enjoyed Bruce in Maniac Cop, the Evil Dead films, Adventures of Brisco County Jr., BubaHoTep, because those films had charisma. This film highly lacks the charisma.

They are low-budget (and Bruce is hardly poor as he's one of the original investors in Renaissance Pictures and owns a HUGE piece of land in Oregon, on which this film was mostly shot), trashy, badly written, unfunny and lacking in good special effects or ideas. In an attempt to make fun of his own past, Campbell has the characters repeat his lines from the \\"Evil Dead\\" and \\"Army of Darkness\\" again and again. The acting is dismal and Bruce comes off as his \\"Ash\\" character every time, only he's older and heftier and less funny each time. I've seen enough and could not even sit through all the way through this groaner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CRIME AGAINST ART","review":"Bruce Campbell plays himself as he is kidnapped to fight the Guan-di, Chinese god of bean curd and protector of the dead. Bruce believes he is role playing until the god appears.The film is a comedy spoof of Bruce Campbell, his films, and fans. He is an obnoxious unlikeable character who lives in a trailer and is hated by his own dog. The film jests that all of his \\"customer Amazon reviews are great\\", spoofing the reviewers of his film.

He's back in top form in this movie with dry humor and plenty of action to keep you watching even through the end credits. Bruce proves if you want it done right, you have to do it yourself. He wrote and directed this gem with a style that only he can achieve, with the help from friend Sam Raimi. Bruce makes plenty of jokes about himself and his movies in every way possible. I only hope he continues to write and direct and act in his films because only Bruce knows Bruce. Other directors and writers of his other films from Alien Apocalypse to Sundown to The man with the screaming brain, don't really get Bruce. I already have watched my copy of this movie twice and enjoyed it more the second time than the first.

Kudos to USA for hiring him for Burn Notice. The humor in this movie is right on you really have to pay attention or you will miss a lot of it. The Kelly Graham chick with the big [...] is hot and the Milf joke that normally would have been lame is brilliant from Bruce.Overall even if you aren't a fan this is still a great flick.

I'll just stick to alternating triple strength formulas.Osteo Bi-Flex has changed my life though. I injured my legs years ago and the residual injury is similiar to bad arthritis.

At 172 pages it is painfully short. Considering the plot takes sixty pages to start moving, the story does not have much substance. Early on, it is hard to get a sense of what is going on due to constant switching of plot lines. Most of the plot lines have no back story, so you are not sure who you are reading about.

The previews and trailers for it were very impressive, but I am loyal to the show for the simple fact that the gameplay is flat out better. The Bigs was released and has the same gameplay as the original 2K Baseball sim, but with this particular game the gameplay works. The whole problem with MLB 2k7 is that the gameplay is an arcade style on a simulation style game. The gameplay for that perfectly matches the arcade style format for The Bigs.Pros: Excellent Graphics, interesting characters, unique player movements, and the HOMERUN PINBALL mode is very entertaining to the point of being addictive.Cons: No Season or Franchise mode, hitting homeruns outside of your powerup is harder than it should be.

Obviously he had more confidence in himself, than coaches who have been in the game for much longer than he has even been alive. Sometimes players don't understand the processing that coaches go through to put together a game plan, and then to carry it out. Yes, it is unfortunate that he had to have four coaches throughout his career, but at least he had the oppurtunity to play the game. There are many other young men who would have loved to at least get to play at the University of Oklahoma, or anywere else.

Back in the late seventies and early eighties, horror movies could get away with waiting awhile to make with the scares, as long as there was a good opening shot to give something for people to look forward to. This movie doesn't have ANYTHING for the first half of the story, and this is 2005. Today's horror audience doesn't have the patience that they did in 1980, and this sucker would've gotten walked out on then.How did this movie even get funded? Did anybody actually read the script before they started shooting? I find it hard to believe that even the B-listers involved here would have willingly lended their talents to such a lackluster dog of a horror movie, especially knowing that it was a remake of something that wasn't too spectacular in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I am an avid horror film fan and this movie was a total disapointment. ***SOME SPOILERS***I understand the point, innocent people who were murdered in the past want revenge against the decendants of those who killed them and reside on Antonio Island. Okay that could be interesting...but it goes no where. Maggie Grace's character comes back to her hometown b/c she's been having weird dreams. Slowly she starts to remember/figure out the truth about Antonio's founding fathers. But why would she have these premonitions, she isn't a relative of the people who were murdered (reincarnation??). The ending was abrupt and I'm still not sure what it means or why the ghosts went away. Overall I would say do not see this film, I mean I've watched some low budget, crap horror films that have left me more satisfied than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allow Me to Clear the Fog for You","review":"Their is nothing foggy about this remake. It is very clear that this version stinks. You would think that even a televsion \\"Superman\\" would know better. Who taught him how to pick his movie rolls, Ben Affleck? It should have been very easy to make a hit movie out of a classic like the original \\"The Fog\\"? Apparently it wasn't easy enough.The story line of this movie stunk. This movie made no sense and had no direction. Thinking it would be an obvious great remake, my first instict was to buy it sight unseen. Thank God for \\"Blockbuster\\". All it cost me was four bucks to rent this movie and for some reason, they would not give me $3.99 back. Go figure.

Selma Blair was the wrong choice to play Steveie Wayne. Her voice and the way she came across in the movie was too provocative comparred to Adrienne Barbeau whose voice was soothing and more relaxed. Tom Welling was miscast in this film, he still had his Smallville way about him. I was expecting Lana to pop out at any moment!! thank god she didn't.

I rented the remake and it was simular but nowhere near as good as the original. The performances were horrible, the dialogue laughabe and the effects rediculous. And then they change a key plot point towards the end of the movie that left me rolling my eyes and scratching my head.I guess the whole reason for remaking this was to get the teen crowd to view this as if it were something new (much like all the other remakes they have been making lately) but my advice to people under 25 is rent the original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"enough already,stop with the remakes","review":"i loved the first fog(it is one of my top 15 horror movies)but like the man said \\"if it ain't broke don't fix it\\"!!!!!not worth your time or money,get the first one instead!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The first version was a bit corny but it was still better than this one.

I hadn't realised I was buying Wuthering Heights in the guise of a 'horror' film. \\"The Fog...a Love Story\\"? Total rubbish, utterly ridiculous.I think the biggest horror of all is John Carpenter was on board as a producer for this schlock? This played out more like a drama. It's way too slick, the CGI did nothing but detract from an already boring film.All I can really say is I hope to God that John Carpenter makes sure Escape From New York is off limits to anybody getting the idea to re-make that classic. John...PLEASE...STOP THE MADNESS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG","review":"Watching this movie was like trying to (...)when u r really really drunk. You keep going and going but you never get there.

I have nothing against director's re-making classic horror's such as Dawn of the Dead and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as these where both fantastically done, but this re-make of the classic John Carpenter tale is a joke.

So I tried to look at this remake as its own film to ease the pain. On a positive note, the special effects are better than the original. Though 25 years later they should be. I think if this movie wasnt a remake people would like it better. Its not that bad if you put it on its own agains most modern horror films. The acting is decent and that goes a long way.BUT... this isnt its own movie. It is a remake of the classic Fog. And if you compare the two films, this one fails. Why change the story so much? Why change the characters? If you are going to remake a movie try to keep it like the first one. Dont go and change 80% of it. If you do that you may as well make a brand new film and not a remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad,bad,bad","review":"An island town in Oregon is haunted by the angry spirits of people long murdered by the town founders.

Enter \\"The Fog\\" (2005 version) an unoriginal, pointless and insulting remake of John Carpenter's classic. Storyline is the same as the original, the ending is different.I have no idea why I punish myself watching these awful remakes. Do yourself a favor, skip this film and watch the original by John Carpenter (1979) back when horror movies were dominated by originality, creepiness and setting rather than loud sounds and CG effects.

The characters were boring nonetheless and really did not interest me. The storyline itself behind the Fog was pretty good though but it could not save the ending of this film, which was really lousy and to me made hardly any sense.Take my advice, and many others I assume will say the same thing- get the older version. The older version is way better and so is the ending. The actors are even better in the older version. This remake is poor compared to the old one so please do not think the old version is as bad as the remake because it isn't- it is a whole lot better trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was the original better?

Waste of time. John Carpernter's original with Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, her mom Janet Leigh, Hal Holbrook and others was a pretty good atmospheric horror flick.

It isn't Oscar material, but what scary movie is. It is meant to be fun and campy and I actually enoyed it. I will also admit I am a huge fan of Tom Welling, and there is a great scene in the film where he takes his shirt off: that is worth the price of the movie.The film basically follows the same plot as the original in which a huge fog bank descends upon Antonio Bay and all hell breaks loose. Lots of surprise elements are included, and there were many times I jumped while watching it.The DVD has some great bonuses, including commentary by the director, deleted scenes, and a great documentary on remaking a classic.When the new version of \\"The Fog\\" came out in 2006 it debut at #1 at the boxoffice, eventually accumulating a gross of over 26 million dollars: someone liked it!Sit back, make some popcorn and enjoy a great, scary film."},{"rating":"1","title":"its too bad this film was made","review":"This movie was terrible. At no point is it scary. The acting is stale, the visual effects are cheesy, and the changes to the plot are completely unneccesary.

Let us review the credits shall we -Tom Welling (TV's Smallville), Maggie Grace (TV's Lost) and Selma Blair (Hellboy) and directed by Rupert Wainwright (Stigmata).Smallville, Lost, Hellboy and Stigmata. Doesn't that just say it all? Kind of like the big yellow FALLING ROCKS! sign you see on dangerous rocky mountain passes.Neither Tom Welling, Maggie Grace or Selma Blair can act their way out of wet paper sacks!The Fog is a good story/plot done wrong by mediocre Hollywood imagination and mind-numbing acting talent. What could have been a standout, knock you over remake turned into what is found in most children's diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original The Greatest Re-Make The Worst","review":"I will always remember the fog original as one of the best John Carpenter's movies this re-make is so sadly horrible it's a wonder it was ever made. This re-make was obviously made for the young adults for today who are moreinto these unremarkable actors and actresses of today. Tom Welling may be good as Clark Kent on Smallville but his acting here was while not atrociouswas not even in the good range and the blond girlfriend of his in the moviewho's name I cant recall was just if not even more terrible. There are some decent actors in the movie but are far in few so all I can say is get the original movie and keep this atrocious re-make where it belongs on the shelves or in the trash.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fog-get About It!","review":"Made for TV caliber stinker remake of a for-its-time decent horror movie. Acting is bad with TV actors. The dialogue is bad to corny at best. The story is completely unbelievable. Continuity was all over the place. This was just one of those plain old bad movies on cable that you somehow find yourself in front of after stumbling in late on a Saturday night.I remember the original as being a bit more entertaining, but that was like 25 years ago (the original The Fog was actually the first movie that I saw on cable TV in like 1980). So if you're in the mood for a Foggy evening, rent the original. There's no way it couldn't be better than this amateurish remake.More than enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remake of The Fog is dead in the water","review":"Pun intended. Why is it that every classic horror remake is made with people that weren't even alive when the original came out? Horror is not just for teenagers. But every horror movie coming out lately is about some 20-something or God forbid, a 30-something. I guess people beyond that just don't scare easily. I know you couldn't have got a pulse on me during this one.It's not believable that the male lead in the film would be a fisherman. Sorry, not buying it. And how do you suppose Adrienne Barbeau feels to have Selma Blair play her character? Blair doesn't look old enough to have a son the age of the one in the movie either.All I can say is, ug."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tragic case of all style . . .","review":"I saw the original. What took me back some is the fact that the plot of why the ghosts are in the island town is totally unrelated from one another. Plus, I really didn't like the whole random choosing of the victums.I could see how they had watched the original and said, \\"we can do this much better given the technology we have now.\\"But did they really have to sacrifice story.The characters even have little differences but not many. They are all, collectively, your typical scared townies that don't know what's going on and just wander around when it comes to solving it. The style of the film was executed perfectly, though. I can never get enough of the images. But there just needs to be mory story.plus, it's just too short when it comes right down to it.Final Verdict: The plot gets lost in the fog.But, hey, that's just my perspective. You might like it better than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is what we get with a remake","review":"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews. Just some thoughts on this remade disaster...Actually, just watch the original version of The Fog (1980), or read the good reviews that have been written if you want to know all about this movie. But anyway...John Carpenter has said over the years that he was never happy with his 1980 movie The Fog. So, he actually welcomed a remake and was even involved in the project as a producer along with Debra Hill. The end result was a total disaster. The remake was turned into a typical teen horror film complete with (you guessed it) tons of CGI. It's just a typical current day horror film where a bunch of kids you don't care about meet their demise. The movie lacks everything a good horror movie needs.Steer clear of this train wreck of a movie. It is one of the worst horror movie remakes of all time. In fact, steer clear of 98% of the horror movie remakes out there. They can't compare to the original movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fog Schmog.","review":"This is a short review, because basically this movie is all CGI smoke and mirrors and no substance at all. The digital transfer to DVD is awful; the \\"FOG\\" is nothing but Pixels. As for being a frightening, creepy or even slightly scary film it falls on its face. There is nothing at all thrilling about this boring remake. Its disappointing that this cast was given such a vehicle of banality to act in, we all have seen these people shine in other roles. The Original, as many have pointed out before, is dripping in creepiness and still to this day resonates in my mind every time I am passed by a wisp of fog. What Hollywood fails to realize with all these thinned out remakes is that the original films were rooted in the times, the mood of society, the innocence of this country and the untapped talents of up and coming directors and writers who have since become jaded and bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful.....","review":"Take all the spooky dread and atmosphere of the original....the beautiful but creepy music.....the seriously menacing dark and wet hook wielding dead lepers....surgically remove all that and insert pretty cookie cutter faces and a script as stiff as a board.

The acting is HORRIBLE. The script is HORRIBLE.The concept of the Fog coming and bring with it death should be easy to turn into a decent move but by a miracle they failed to do even that.The fog comes, the main actors start walking around and suddenly the town is in ruin?! They don't show anything. The most you get is a dog in the distance yelping and the main character saying \\"lets get out of here\\".Ridiculous.The best action sequence they could come up with was some people jumping off of a boat IN SUPER SLOW MOTION with a small fire on their backs and flame-retardant goo smeared all over their faces.Please whatever you do, I beg you not to waste another second of your life considering to watch this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foggy memories of a poor film effort","review":"The movie opens with a fairly boring beginning. Things don't look too promising- and they don't get any better throughout.I would liken the film more to a Murder She Wrote episode than a horror/thriller movie.

Well, this one was. I saw the unrated version thinking this will be scary. That is not the case in this movie. It is quite boring at times and a let down from the original. By the end of the movie, you are sick of seeing so much fog, which actually looked like smoke to me. I think the only reason this film might be popular as a rental is the fact that Tom Welling from the show Smallville is one of the main characters in this film.

It was John Carpenter remaking his own movie for todays audience. I hadn't seen the old one in so long I can't remember much about it except the basic plot premice of curse, fog, ghosts, ship, scream, kill, scream. The new one is about the same if you go by my description of my memory of the first one. Selma Blair is just a really bad actress. She is monotone and has no charisma and delivers her lines like she is zonked on prozac or something. The Smallville guy is the main hero and he isn't very good either. The rest of the cast is pretty blah too. This is a straight forward ghost story, no gore and little effects. In some ways that is refreshing cause I don't think a horror movie has to be all blood and guts and shock. But this movie just isn't that great.

The plot contains more oxymorons than I've ever read. There are numerous unbelieveable scenes and happenings. One such example is that of a road in the dessert that is hidden (in the DESSERT), onto which a car turns; once that car turns, the car following loses track of them (in the DESSERT). We're talking wide open spaces here for endless miles. How is it possible to lose track of something that can't hide? There's also an instance when it is noted that it wouldn't be wise for the main characters to go to a place owned by her parents as that's the first place where the pursuers are bound to look. In the next few paragraphs they describe their destination which is, ofcourse, owned in part by her parents.

This travelling circus troope has to venture ever farther into the vast country's hinterlands to escape from its most deadly enemy.And what is that? The tv! Where they see the dreaded tv antennas, they know it's time to move on. So they do.This is a very touching film about the trials and tribulations of being a travelling performer--a tough life, but one that they would never give up.

It is an excellent movie. Larry has found a new person within himself that he never knew existed, and now is helping others to do the same.

But in this ludicrous adaptation of a substantive novel, he simply cannot pull it off. That famous smirk is always there, right below the surface. I expected him to break into an SNL skit at any moment, destroying any pretense of real drama. Go see Groundhog Day instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Acting, Poor Editing","review":"First off, I like Bill Murray. Unfortunately he simply doesn't have the acting talent to play this role. He tries, but he does not have the dramatic or emotional depth required of the role. One would be better off reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the All Time Worst!","review":"What a disappointment after reading so many GOOD reviews of this film....and even more so after LOVING the Maugham novel on which it is woefully adapted. Poor Bill Murray: he obviously (as a co-writer and star of the film) loved the book, too, but ended up in one of the biggest turkeys of all time. It is especially hard to try and get past his comic persona and any fan of the novel will be left scratching his head wondering how this particular version ever came to be. The supporting cast is weak, with the exception of Theresa Russell who does a great job with her limited role and a terrible wig. I haven't seen the Tyrone Power version yet, but something tells me I should just stick with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing something","review":"A good film version of the Maugham classic with gorgeous cinematography ,excellent casting and acting, this Razor's Edge is very entertaining and thought provoking. Bill Murray seems a strange choice to play Larry but ultimately plays him to perfection . The other actors all do quite well in their character portrayals. This is an admirable effort to transfer a complex and unusually structured work of fiction to the screen that succeeds to an extraordinary extent.However I felt that the ommission of the author's veiwpoint and narration as written in the novel distorted the story to a degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another sleeper, apparently NOT undiscovered...","review":"GREAT movie! Has kept me thinking about it since it was released in video MANY years ago.

The life of this one man makes such an astounding impact to so many around him, that you feel your life is changed as well...I watched this movie again for the first time, since I was in my early 20's. I found I had forogtten alot of this movie, but upon watching it once more, it brought it all back to me and I found it even more touching now, then I did when I first saw it.This is a must see for anyone who is striving to understand life, their purpose and the reason we live. This movie will simply amaze you at how deep the human mind can go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miscast","review":"In \\"Lost in Translation\\" Bill Murray showed his abiity as a serious actor.\\"The Razor's Edge\\" was too early in his career for him to attempt it. I found it impossible to believe his character. He seemed to be playing at trying to be real, and the result was shallow and unconvincing.I was already familiar with the book, which I liked immensely, and the film with Tyrone Power was so perfectly cast that those actors were the people they portrayed.I know many people will disagree with me, but so be it. Nice try, Bill, but it didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Underrated Movie","review":"First off I think Murray was excellent, I believe he intended to keep his portrayal of Larry Darrell a bit aloof or understated. I think one of the most interesting scenes of the movie is when Darrell is holding his friend and mentor (can't remember his name) who is dying in the foxhole after having just saved Larry's life. I have always liked to believe a rumor that Murray used the death of John Belushi for inspiration during that scene. Anyways I read the book years ago and love to watch this movie over and over again. I pray it comes out on DVD soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"My husband told me about this movie. He'd seen it a long time ago - probably when it first came out. He mentioned that he'd like to see it again so, I ordered it. We watched it together both really loved it. I cried my eyes out. Bill Murray's acting in this movie showcased his wonderful talent as a non-comedic actor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites...","review":"Great story.

My VHS copy was done and at $7, this couldn't be passed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story","review":"Bill Murray showed his talent as real actor in this picture. The story is food for thought about living truly from the heart. When we ask what is the meaning of it all and we seek answers, we can bring changes tourselves. This also about what is really important about life and finding greater purpose. It is very spiritual. No matter how you percieve God, the message is universal. Excellent, excellent film."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a way only Bill Murray could... this film changed my life","review":"I saw this movie for the first time as an eigth grader. It made me go find and read Siddhartha followed by every other Hesse novel. I wanted to be a methodist preacher up until that moment. I did not become a minister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done, Bill!","review":"This is a film that was unfairly maligned by critics, but demonstrates Bill Murray's tremendous range as an actor and the skill of a director who accurately and lovingly depicts a specific period of time i.e America circa 1917 and 1929; Paris during the 1930's, etc. Murray gives the principal character, Larry Darrell, a disarming sense of humor that adds an extra dimension to one of Maugham's most beloved and perplexing protagonists. The musical score is superb...far more polished than of many others produced in the last 20 years. I only wish more films were made like this. Supporting cast is equally good.....Buy the DVD and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much different....","review":"If you first read Maugham's novel and wanted to see a \\"movie version\\" of that novel, I believe that you, as I was, will be sorely disappointed by this movie. Way too many important parts passed over and some semi-minor parts of the book are glamorized. On the other hand, if I had never read the book, I probably would have really enjoyed this movie a lot more, and probably would have given it 4 or 5 stars.I just placed an order for the 1940's movie version of the book, which, from what I've heard from other reviewers, is much truer to Maugham's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self indulgent misrepresentation of a great story","review":"If you only watch the first 20 or 30 minutes you'd think you were watching a remake of \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" rather than a remake of the film with the same title. The makers would have been better served to continue with that tack rather than backtracking to \\"The Razor's Edge\\" as the ambulance scene is probably the best part of this movie. The resulting fiasco has an all too pervasive \\"Animal House\\" or \\"Meatballs\\" feel. The soul of the story is totally absent. The original version with Tyrone Power is a must see. The book by Somerset Maugham is a must read. This prattle should be taken from the market as an injustice. I read somewhere the studio allowed Bill Murray to make this film as a reward for big box office moneymakers like Ghostbusters, Meatballs, and Stripes. He went to a place he had no business in. The deadpan arm dragging just doesn't cut it in a powerful story such as this. It is a travesty. Shameful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was very disappointed with this film. Bill Murray is not the right actor for the part, to begin with. He is too heavy-handed. Also the script departs from the novel in ways that indicate that the writer(s) missed the whole point of many incidents. The implied sex scene, for instance, does NOT take place, and the fact that it does not is important in the development of the characters. The re-writing of the novel for this film unfortunately destroys all the nuances of character and plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the Original Version instead.","review":"The original version, released in the 1940s and starring Tyrone Power, is far superior to this re-make.

I only discovered that when I got it home. Even on my 27\\" TV, I found it very annoying that half of the screen was black. I had a LONG list of movies to buy on DVD, but this has certainly curtailed my enthusiasm. There should be full-screen options available too, and each DVD should state clearly which format it is in. Personally, I will not buy ANY widescreen movies on DVD.I DID buy \\"Spiderman\\", and it was full-screen, thankfully.

The Superman movies all look awesome on DVD format for the first time. Superman: The Movie is beautifully done, with a full restoration and new, restored sound effects. The film has never looked so good. There are also three very informative documentaries about the film, plus lots of other goodies. Superman II, III, and IV are not nearly as packed with extras, though. In fact, they have none except for the original theatrical trailer. But I must say the DVD versions of these films look so much better than any old VHS version you can find. Plus, they are in widescreen which is the only way anyone should ever watch a film.

The tornadoe on the Wizard of Oz is more realistic than the one in Superman 4. Plus on part 3, it trys to be funny meanwhile the story is too dark to find funny or even take seriously. Richard Pryer is the only good thing about that one. Part one has fun special effects and Christopher Reeve and Kidder have great chemestry. Good movie but it's part 2 that is no doubt the best because it builds up on how the 2 feel about each other. Plus it has the best Villain of the 3 movies. Terrence Stamp is just fantastic as Zard and part 3 and 4 just couldn't top him villain wise. Part 2 no doubt needs a special edition released though.

As a Superman fan, I find it upseting that standard versions haven't been added to the DVDs. The four Batman movies offer full screen and widescreen, so why is Superman being excluded from this? Like many other people, I do not like watching widescreen movies. Since Warner Bros has been able to release DVDs that offer standard and widescreen versions to fit people's tastes, why can't it do the same with Superman? I also feel that the price of the Superman collection set should be lowered since it lacks this feature.

This simple yet rich idea explains why we are facing structural problems like unemployment, increasingly unbalanced distribution of the wealth, gender & immigrant issues, poverty, etc.Solutions to these crucial & chronic problems cannot be as simple as economic tricks like tax or interest increases/decreases, etc. Today's society needs to welcome/appreciate the variety within and should try capitalize on this variety.

As the book progressed, you got to know and learn about the characters and what they do and what they like. As I started to get interested into the characters, that's when the book got interesting.The book teaches several good lessens in life. The book also has several subplots which also makes it more interesting. This is a nice short book that is completly worth your time. I suggest you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stotan!","review":"Chris Crutcher tends to throw every problem known to man into his books, with a particular focus on domestic abuse. However, despite being overbearing in some of his books, the ideas in Stotan! seem fresh and real. Friendship and the toughness of Stotan Week lead the four boys to knock down challenges in their life, together. This book is an amazing story about what it means to be a true survivor. It's not just swimming fast...This is probably one of the best of Chris Crutcher's books, and one that never fails to inspire me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stotan is a great book","review":"This book was very remarkable. There are twists and turns around every page. The author did a very significant job writing all the tragic issues such as racism and domestic abuse. The book also talks about relationships and how to deal with almost the worst thing that they can throw at you. Stotan week is a week that Jeff, Lion, Nortie, and Walker have to deal with athletic and emotional roller coasters. In the beginning the book was a little unorganized. The book was a little slow in the beginning. It improved greatly towards the middle and even more in the end. I am recommending this book to older children, 12-17. It is a very short yet good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should never choose this book to read.","review":"Out of the pages that I read I thought that the book was not that great, but when we talked about it in class it sounded alright in some parts.

The acting is beyond bad. The musical selections are terrible. Every few minutes one group or another breaks into a grinnin' and shuckin', bug-eyed Amos and Andy song and dance routine. If a movie had intended to poke fun of black people it couldn't have done a better job. I was embarrassed for black people just by watching this over-dramatized, insulting mess.Surely, somewhere down the line, this mockery of the black church had to be KKK-inspired.

Progressive metal bands would be charging from 60-80.The music on this cd is great, but it's insulting that the band and the label markets this is a full length. There's a reason most grindcore albums have 20-30 tracks. Besides, how lazy do you have to be as a band to exist from 2001 to 2008 and release a total of 35 minutes of music?That's 5 minutes of music a year. Very hard working band.Don't get me wrong, the music on the cd is great. Whether you call it grindcore or not, it's intense and imaginative.

It's amazing how much fun they have while learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful learning!","review":"We got this game for my 4 yr old along with the Disney Princess one and at first she played all princesses, but after a little while, she spends more time with this one. The games are more timeless and she loves building her book. Great for letter learning and writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick Start Kindergarten","review":"Best thing we ever purchased was the Letters on the Loose and Leapster L-Max. My son entering kindergarten loves the Leap Frog Letter Factory video, word factory video and Leap Pad but this is on a whole new level. He can listen to professor Quigley and interact with a Video type game that shows how to write his letters then lets him write the letters on the screen with the accompanied pen. After he writes each letter it is stored in the memory book of his handwritten letters. If he is plugged into the TV he may then view and display for the whole family the great book of letters he is working on. There is a game to catch capital or lower case letters that arer specified differently each time he plays and animated letters play a game that asks you to do different tasks that help with hand eye cowardination and letter recongnition/phonics. We love it!! Kudos to Leap Frog again. Searching for the number Zero next to help him with Math Skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not the best, from LeapFrog","review":"My daughter (age 4) fell in love with this cartridge immediately -- which is great. She completed an ABC book after just a couple of hours with breaks. It's good writing practice and more forgiving, I think, than the writing portion of the Disney Princess cartridge. The games; however, are not all that demanding or educational. For instance, one game, the player tickles a gorilla while he says the \\"g\\" sound. So what? Some of the games are better than others, though, and I suppose not every one of them must be of high educational value. I do think that this is aimed slightly more at preschoolers than kindergarteners, which benefits us for the time being. Overall, very good and entertaining, but not a \\"must-have\\", especially if your child already knows her letter sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"The guy above is stupid","review":"Alrigt, first off i'm not some stupid kid, i just didnt want to fill out the form...Second, that guy is a moron.

Bill Murray can turn any word into a laugh. I want to read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I never read the script, but I did see the film. The best word to describe it is disappointing. I heard a lot of buzz about this film. After I saw the film, I didn't get why there was so much buzz for this film, a '90s version of \\"The Graduate\\" with a lot of promise that goes awry towards the end. I like films that have quirky characters so long as they are believable and have reasons for being quirky. Why any of the characters act the way they do in the film is beyond me. What starts out as a black comedy that would involve revenge between a young man and a tycoon ends up going all over the map. If anyone can tell me why this movie was so excellent besides saying \\"It's Rushmore\\" or \\"It's cool,\\" please let me know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch the Movie First","review":"I dare use the word \\"quirky,\\" because that usually means \\"esoteric and/or pedantic.\\" But \\"Rushmore\\" manages to be quirky while still being entertaining and heartful. There is real emotional impact in this film, as sharp and hurtful as first love lost. Yet, it remains a brilliant comedy with enough \\"moments\\" to make repeated viewings worthwhile. The book only serves as a fond memory of the film, much as the soundtrack.

You know you're on familiar territory when the \\"actors\\" begin our little romp with references to Bela Legosi.Is there a plot worth reviewing in a movie like this? Well... is there EVER in an Ed Wood film? You don't watch a movie like this for the quality, the acting, the writing or... *Especially* the porn. You watch it because Ed is so lovingly bad, and so thoroughly consistant, it's like spending time with an old, slightly insane friend. All the standard props are here - undead, slightly dead, mostly dead (and an almost erotic lesbian scene). But in the end one star is all it gets, and is probably more than it deserves.

But when viewed on a TV set, the picture quality is terrible, much worse than a VHS tape. Anything with subtitles or writing is totally unreadable.

The basic ingredients are all there for a satisfying cosy with TWO spunky heroines and double love interests, but The author failed to deliver on the promise.Perhaps the situations were supposed to be humorous coincidences, but they stretched far beyond humor and were too far-fetched to be believable, and there was ample evidence of sloppy writing and no editing. For example, in one scene the heroine goes to a luncheon that is to feature a speech by a noted occultist. Instead, with no explanation, the scene unfolds with a speech by the hostess on vegetarianism instead.If you are looking for a modern historical mystery with a light touch, I would recommend Jacqueline Winspear's Maisis Dobbs series instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danger: don't start playing until your work is finished","review":"This version of the SIMS is the best they have come up with so far.

I was, in fact, one of those college kids who played it in her dorm room in lieu of studying. Years later, the second one comes out and I was eagerly anticipating it. Yes, the new features are cool, and yes, the graphics are neat. However, the five-plus minutes you wait for the game to load (on my brand-new loaded Sony desktop) is NOT so cool. This game takes up so much memory to run that you can't do anything else on your computer while you're waiting for the game to load, and there are many, many lags.In addition, it's not very user-friendly. It's very difficult to zoom in or out, or scroll around your Sims' houses.Overall, this game could be really neat, but I am just not willing to sit around and wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT SHIPPED!!!

It is a huge wast of money. They priced this game $49.99 when it should only be worth $9.99. Unless you have the newest computer then you have to buy a whole bunch of extra stuff like new video cards and sound drivers. I always have a very highly updated computer but I still will have to pay a lot of money just to play this game. Although I will probably end up returning it for it is not worth the trouble. When I first got this game I tried it on 2 of my computers (windows 98 and windows me - it is said to work on both of those computers) when it didn't work I thought that that particular package just didn't work.

I left it alone for a few days, thinking it was just an internal error, but when I noticed the shipping date was STILL in mid-October a few minutes ago, I quickly cancelled and replaced my order. Hopefully I'll get my Sims on Friday...if not...I'll just go to Best Buy and purchase it, and then return the Amazon copy there after I receive it.I've been an Amazon customer since Christmas '97, but this whole process was just overly frustrating. The point of a pre-order is to guarantee arrival on or near release date, not a month later. Had I not had a gift certificate I wanted to use, I seriouly would have ordered off another site or planned a retail attack route."},{"rating":"1","title":"freezes my computer","review":"I can't even really play.

It is time to move on. SIMS 2 uses new technology that wasn't available when the original was released and is not compatible with the older game.OK, so you spent a lot of money on the original. Since you did it sounds like you enjoyed the game, if so you got your moneys worth. Quit griping and enjoy the new game because it's going to rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use the Game Advisor to determine if the game will run.","review":"I love this game - I got the DVD version and it works just fine on my year-old Dell Inspiron 600m with 512 MB RAM, Mobility Radeon 9000, 1.3 Ghz Pentium M processor. I was worried that it wasn't going to accept it but I used the Windows Game Advisor: http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/games/gameadvisor/default.mspx and it told me that my laptop was well past the minimum requirements for this game.I am not going to really do a review other than to say I am a Sims 2 addict..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-piracy gone too far + warning","review":"I couldn't wait to get this game. I loved The original Sims and knew this would be even better.However - I, like a lot of other people who have purchased the game, can't play it. The anti-piracy software is so restrictive that unless you strip down your system's software (ie Nero CD Burning software among others) and possibly hardware (CD/DVD burner) the program will not run. It will install but you cannot start the game. If Maxis wants to alienate their fans, they've done a great job. I'm already in the process of returning the software until Maxis can do better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done MAXIS","review":"I was never into the first Sims and all of its expansions, but THE SIMS 2 changes everything.

GREAT GAME!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to Write This Review - The Game is a Bug Fest","review":"I am a huge fan of Maxis/EA. I have been a big fan of the Sims (and the expanision packs) as well as Sim City. Like everyone else I was really excited about the release of sims 2. So I am sad to report that the game has given me terrible problems. I cannot play for more than 10 minutes without it completely crashing my system. When I can play the graphics are choppy at best. I have a system that meets or exceeds all the system requirements, my drivers are up to date and I am not a tech novice. I am hopeful that Maxis will come through with a patch to fix the numerous problems I experienced. To anyone who wants to play the game...wait for the patch or a newer release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Game I Never Played","review":"There's so much copy protection on this game that it won't even install on some of the systems.

I bought a copy of it yesterday, and I am very disappointed with the game. It first took an hour and a half to load, as my computer wasn't reading the disk. After I finally downloaded it, I tried playing and it's extremely slow. The graphics are terrible, and after I tried changing the graphics to 'high' the whole game froze. It is also really difficult to move around in the game. It takes forever to load and even longer to make you Sims do anything. I would seriously think twice before buying this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't WAIT!!!","review":"Yes, The Sims is addictive. I confess, I confess!!!!

Yay!!!Oh, and for the reviewer who couldn't find the system specs on their website......(...)I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't WAIT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not another 5 years of expansion packs!!! Noooooo!!!!","review":"As much as I enjoyed the first Sims and nabbed it the first week of release I realized after a while what a pox it was. Will Wright, the talent that gave us Sim City and all its offspring has been doing nothing else new creativley due to having to work on the Sims, and even SimCity 4 is tainted by the Sim characters you can import into your town.I wish this Sim fad would go the way of the beany babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Review First!","review":"I am highly disappointed with this CD...not the content, per say, but the set up. Why on earth did they make the whole thing on only one track? My personal CD player does not have a fast forward option (as most personal players do not) so if I want to listen to the Evening Meditation I have to listen through the Introduction and the entitre Morning Meditation first (23 minutes). Another reviewer has said the same thing, if I would have just read the review first I would have spent my money elsewhere. Bernie Siegel is a fine MD, and the content of this CD is fine, but VERY poor design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Meditation Tape, Not just for cancer patients","review":"This is just about the best meditation tape I have ever found. I have been using guided meditation for about 10 years now and it is awesome for picking you up out of a depressing time to steeling anxieties to relieving you from or preparing you for a stressful day. Bernie's soothing voice glides at just the right speed to bring you onto some of the deepest meditations I have ever been in. Some of the visuals he helps you create makes you want to stay forever. Bernie uses so many different visualizations everyone is bound to have a favorite part and find something they truly love. While Bernie's tapes are normally made for cancer patients this one is truly for everyone. Buy this and I promis you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"not well organized","review":"I agree with an earlier reviewer that this CD is not set-up well.

What I found makes these lyrical essays beautiful is not the language itself (for this, I think no one beats Thoreau) but the ideas and descriptions expressed in the unfolding of the stories or central themes.The critical essays are essentially Camus's thoughts on culture, philospohy, and other literature (e.g. Faulkner and Melville). Camus's commentary on himself is also very interesting, for I think that these essays are the most telling of Camus's views not just of himself and his writing, but of his views on society at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good ring","review":"This is my wedding ring.

She keeps it on the table in her waiting room with some other reading materials and tells me she has had eight or ten patients ask where they could buy the book.

The jokes are a bit corny, and each time an episode tries to educate people or contains a \\"life lesson\\" sort of moral, it seems a bit as if it is being forced down the viewers' throats. There are many other educating programs that teach lessons while being humorous in the process out there, and Steve Urkel does not redeem the rest of the series enough for anybody else. I apologize to the creators of \\"Family Matters\\" and every single member of its fan base."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fresh Prince","review":"I was excited when I first heard of this show. Carl, Laura, Eddie and the rest of the Winslow family are all well written and thought out characters but then every in every episode you have to deal with Steve Urkel who is horribly played by Jaleel White. Urkel is probably one of the most disgusting and horrible people ever to grace the silver screen. He constantly is messing up the Winslows residence and all he can say is \\"Did I do that?\\" in the most annoying voice ever heard. I watched the series on and off hoping that Urkel would learn not to damage others property but it never happened. Carl should of shot him between his 4 eyed face and used his Chicago police connections to get rid of the evidence.After a while Urkel then makes a \\"cool\\" machine and becomes Stephan Urquel and I really just had to stop watching the show before I hurt myself or someone else.

I just got Season One on DVD, and while I am pleased with the boxset as a whole, there is a TOTAL disregard for special features. No commentaries, no optional foreign language tracks, no original ABC promos, nothing of the sort. I was expecting hours upon hours of special features, but WB failed to deliver. I want these features on the Season Two boxset, provided that there is one. Warner Bros., either put more special features on Season Two, or don't release it at all.

My only complaint about the DVD set is that Valerie Jones (the actress who played Judy in the pilot) is featured on the DVD artwork instead of Jaimee Foxworth. And that a picture of Urkel is on every single DVD. In future season releases, I hope they feature more pictures of the other cast members on the DVD cover & discs.

Of course men have been writing women's stories and vice versa for ages in straight lit and other genres. But when it comes to sexuality, at least modern erotic literature that has some class to it, there is a need for truth and authentic emotion.

I do find it usefull that they tell you where all the secret rooms are, but once I get the rumble pack for my controller that's not going to help much either!

I personally love the rap track put down on top of one of my all time favorite Jazzmasters tunes, \\"Peace On Earth\\". If you don't care for the rap track, at least read the enclosed lyrics. It takes a lot of guts and skill to listen to \\"Peace On Earth\\" and come up with \\"If You Knew\\". That's the great thing about this country, you are allowed to voice your opinion.As for the other tracks, track #5, \\"Puerto Banos\\", track #6, \\"Time For Living\\", and track #13, \\"If You Knew\\" are my standout tracks for the moment. I've just received the CD today, listened to it three times thus for, so the favorite tracks of today could quite possibly change tomorrow.All in all, this is a very good, well put together smoooth jazz CD, lives up to and exceeds what I expect from Mr. Hardcastle, Helen Rogers, and company.

People that want to buy things based on pound for the dollar should look at reviews in Consumers Digest, they are very good at that. There are a lot of lower priced grinders out there that will do a decent job, of course they will be just as messy, with same static problem and noise. This grinder is a step up from those and gives you very consistent grinds with less noise, if that is not important for you, then you might not be happy with this grinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Being a Civil War buff,i can only say that this movie can only be put in a class of it,s own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The last Confederate","review":"Maybe I bought the wrong version at Amazon Germany even though it is in English as well as German of course.

I think that what the family are doing to preserve their family story is important. If you research Captain Adams the movie is completely diffrent then real life. There was no escape from prison. There was no rescues. Even the title of the movie is misleading. Wasted Money. Also very bad acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Confederate: The Story of Robert Adams","review":"This a great story to tell, but the family should have let professional handle it. The movie was poorly done. My favorite part of history is the Civil War. My own great grandfathers were vets. Who by the way fought on different sides of the war. I didn't understand the movie. If he was the last confederate that it what the story should have been about.

I would not purchase this DVD. Get it from Netflix if you have a hankerin' to see something new with Union men and Rebs blazin' away at each other.Routine romance angle, Southern hero and Union wife. The few black people in the film were in the distant backgrounds except for one woman doing laundry. The cast was weak and just didn't fit their roles. It could have been so much better but seems to me like the director found where there was to be some large scale Civil War reenactors/battles and quickly assembled his cast and embedded them with the too many clean shaven Rebs and Yanks.Just my thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not have been distributed.","review":"I thought the kid who played Anakin Skywalker in the last, horrible, Star Wars films had set the standard for wooden, awkward performances.

And, as a bonus, surely Julian Adams does his great-great grandfather proud. Even without that family connection (excuse the understatement: see the \\"making of\\" dvd bonus documentary) it's a fantastic film; with the knowledge of that connection, it gives a very fine film an added richness.

As a person who is big on historical accuracy i couldnt stand to watch this movie. I would love to know where soldiers were getting their ammunition as none of them were wearing any cartridge boxes. One of the Union Soldiers was was wearing an army coat and blue jeans. Most of the battle scenes were fought by diorganized mobs, which never would happen during the civil war. The main character was an Infantry Captain, he was wearing no rank insignia and a wore an enlisted mans uniform. And biggest HE RODE A HORSE!

The batting controls are terrible, the base running and fielding controls are subpar, and what happened to the ability to change to camera angle??

A total step backward for acclaim from the N64 version. If you want a good fun baseball game to play try the N64 versions, (they are so so so much better!!!!)

You can't create any players in exhibition or series mode (that would include the playoffs) and you can be ONLY ONE TEAM in a season/playoff. What a Catch 22, well, I am sending mine back to acclaim to get one I can return for my money back.

Just suffice it to say that if you were waiting for ASB2002 on PS2 to get rid of your N64, you will need to make more shelf space to keep it around. Being a Madden Football and ASB addict on N64, the PS2 did more than justice with Madden for the PS2 (it is just amazing) - Baseball has been a different story!

The good thing about this game is that the player graphics are breath taking and the game play is really easy. Also the throw back uniforms are pretty cool. So what is it that it only got 2 stars. First of all the graphics for the stadiums are horrible. MLB 2K1 is a thousand times better. Second of all the commentary for the game is dull and boring, It is the samething over and over again. Last the game only has on camera angle and it just dosent fell like you are in the game. All in all this game was not what i expected. This is something i would expect from PS1 not PS2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting...","review":"I bought this game hoping that it would finally be THE great baseball game we have all been waiting for. Sad to say, I am still waiting. What's the deal with NO camera angle options...you get what they give you(and the angle for fielding SUCKS) and that's it! Batting and pitching are overly complicated and very slow, fielding is a joke (outfielders are able to get to balls that are not even close to them and make the catch), and if you don't change your pinch-hitter, he will be pitching for you next inning. 2 stars are for the beautiful but difficult to see graphics and the turn-back-the-clock uni's.

When I got better a the game and started playing on harder levels is when the damage was done. I mean finishing a season with 125 wins and having Jeter and Justice both with more than 70 homers isn't what i expected. So i returned the game(Lucky I didn't lose the receipt) and decided next time to rent a game before buying.I rented All Star Baseball 2002 and loved it.

I can not defeat the computer. Anything you do is just countered. You score two runs in the first, the other team scores two runs in the first. Hit a home in the top of the 9th, the other team hits a home run to beat you. It is driving me nuts. Granted that the graphics are impressive, and the gameplay is mediocre. The gameplay aspect doesn't bother me. I would just like to sit down and have fun, and it is impossible to.

This game has so many options and different set ups. It is a very fun game. The only thing i didn't like about it from the previous ASB's is that in emotional moments like a game winning home run, its kinda shrugged off. On the previous ASB's there would be fireworks and crowd noise, which is absent on the new ASB. The game is simply over now when an emotional moment occurs.

The graphics are substandard at best -- fielders catch the ball when they are several feet away from the ball and the ball seems to just magically appear in your glove. There are no camera options, and no other real options to speak of either. I thought I had made the right choice by picking this one over EA's Triple Play (especially in light of my mild disappointment with EA's NBA Live), but I just couldn't bring myself to play ASB more than 2 or 3 times. I have since traded it in for Triple Play and, while Triple Play is certainly more arcade-style than real baseball simulation, it is far more enjoyable. If you want a game that is truly fun (and let's not forget the purpose of these video games, folks), don't get this one. And I don't work for EA."},{"rating":"2","title":"could be better, but so far its the best baseball game out","review":"for the most part its a pretty cool game, the graphics are awsome. the sound is excellent. pretty easy to figure out. the only big downside of the game is there should be more camera angles and they should have had the same player control that was offered in the n64 version. (i thinks the n64 controls where easier to use). besides for that the game is very fun to play. it feels just like being there. maybe in allstar 2003 they will fix those problems and maybe add a more detailed creat a player. then the game will be perfect. i do recomend this to all baseball fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put, it's boring","review":"I tried to get through this book, I really did.

Playing as gun-toting heroine Aileen, you blast your way through hordes of repetitive mutant aliens. What really hurts Alien Syndrome the most is said repetitiveness, and it comes in more ways than just alien blasting: from the level design to the combat elements, Alien Syndrome recycles itself from beginning to end. The Wii controls sort of work well when it comes to aiming and shooting, but it doesn't take long for pure boredom to set in. The RPG elements that are inserted don't really amount to a whole lot either, and actually seem as more of an afterthought for the most part. All in all, Alien Syndrome may seem like a little bit of fun at first, and it is for a brief time, but sadly wears down into an exercise in monotony. It may be worth checking out for fans of the original arcade game, but all others should avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Bought this game remembering playing something similar years ago, however after 5 minutes taking the game back.

By todays standards this movie seems \\"Hokie\\", but for three fourteen year old boy's in 1964 it was a movie and Summer to remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally on DVD","review":"The quality of the video has gone way up from the VHS copy. Still a great surf movie from the 60's."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"RIDE THE WILD SURF\\" SHOOTS THE CURL","review":"A fun \\"sun and surf\\" flick of the mid 60's - this is certainly one of the better offerings of that genre. With a good cast that includes Tab Hunter, Shelley Fabares and Fabian, this entertaining flick moves well,contains some fairly innocuous love scenes, and actually has some nice surfing footage. Perhaps not surprisingly, it has a good message for teens and it's fun to watch too. The title song was actually a hit tune as well - cute movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jean-Baptiste Lully: Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme; Andre Campra: L'Europe Galante","review":"Jean-Baptiste Lully: Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme; Andre Campra: L'Europe Galante is a 1988 Harmonia Mundi recording starring La Petite Band directed by Gustav Leonhardt. I must admit that I am huge fan of Baroque music and therefore it was quite easy for me to love this recording. All the lyrics are available in French, German and English. A tremendous and sensual recording that I thoroughly enjoyed. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victorian Village Home","review":"My 3 y.o. daughter received this as a belated birthday present and she loves it. Our living room in our house is decorated Victorian with a pink Victorian loveseat and a globe, so she loved that this house has a pink Victorian loveseat and a globe in the living room.One issue though: this house is supposed to shut so that it can be carried. We can NOT get it to snap shut securely. As soon as you pick it up it pops open. So we have been wiretying it shut when she wants to carry it or take it places."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Great Little Toy...","review":"My daughter received several of the Sweet Treats playsets for her fourth birthday.The playsets were bundled together, and purchased at a deep discount. If the toys had not been on discount, I may have not purchased them at first, since the houses and accessories were smaller than what I had truly wanted.However, I am glad that I bought them for her, there is a lot of attention to detail, with a variety of people and furnishings to keep the imagination going. The houses close up and store very neatly (a big plus for us) - and we are enjoying the sets so much, that I am anxious to buy her more.I recommend these sets to any mom in my situation - My daughter is beginning to outgrow the Little People sets (and I am tired of stepping over the large Little People buildings) and I did NOT want to go the Barbie route. I can see the Sweet Streets lasting for a few years, until my daughter is old enough to invest in an elaborate dollhouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on Designing Networks with Cisco equipment","review":"This is an excellent book at a very reasonable price to get the same information you would get from Cisco's DCN self study course.

Rick is an accomplished keyboard player. Six Wives of Henry VIII is possibly the definative masterpiece of rock keyboard wizardry to date. But in my opinion Rick Wakeman as a soloist has done little since then. The DVD still shows that Rick can play and has lightning fast hands. But the main vocalist is horrible! Every time he opened his mouth I wanted to scream. Worst possible moment was his rendition of Starship Trooper. Jon Anderson can sing circles around this guy, as could just about anyone else. It is nice to see Rick's son following in his footsteps as he appears on this disc. All in all for Wakeman diehard fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"a collection of DC's three-part prestige mini series","review":"Written by Alisa Kwitney, this book is beautifully painted by, Kent Williams, the cover art and framing sequence artist, Michael Zulli in part one, Scott Hampton in part two and Revecca Guay in part three.

Otherwise, I would give this movie a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Born in East L.A.","review":"I have been waiting for some time to buy this movie because it was one of my all-time favorites when I first saw it on television. Waiting to see if it would appear at a discount price (about $5-$7)I decided to go ahead and purchase it. I was disappointed to find out that this version had the shorten-version that did not show the marriage on the float at the end of the movie.

Regardless, since it was one of my favorites, I decided to keep it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"East L.A., Homay!","review":"I am a fan of both Cheech Marin & Thamas Chong, Cheech is good at playing both Cheech or Red, but this aint no Cheech & Chong flick!

Ruby is taken on a truck with a dozen other illegal immigrants, and is taken to Tijuana, Mexico in which Ruby has to learn to survive and know how to speak spanish, if he's left out on the streets of Tijuana.

Funny parts include the talking Jesus picture and Chinese Indians. Some scenes are just classic filler. The love interest is mildly interesting. The end is completely cheesy. But hey, that's what you love about it, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious DVD","review":"This is an OLD movie but I had to see it one more time. It is a light comedy that will keep you laughing. The script has some great lines. Especially funny when Cheech says something about joining the army to be all that he could be, and they made him a mechanic. It is especially funny if you have lived in southern California, or if you are Mexican-American, even more so if you are both. Much better than \\"A Day Without a Mexican\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goofy fun","review":"Through a series of mishaps that culminate in him not being able to prove he is a USA citizen to la emigra (He forgot his wallet at home), American Rudy Robles is deported to Tiajuana along with a handful of illegal immigrants.The rest of the movie pretty much revolves around his attempts to survive in Tiajuana ( he cannot even speak spanish) and return to the USA. Also, his growing relationship with a pretty lass from El Salvador.There's a lot of basic fun, goofiness, and a lot of poking fun at prejudices. There is also a priceless scene where he teaches a group of Asians trying to sneak into the USA how to pass as east LA homeboys.There are some thought-provoking ideas slipped in through the laughter as well. I recommend the movie as a good, basic, fun ride with bright flashes of wisdom and compassion thrown in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granny Zone","review":"This movie is pure fun. It's not to be taken so seriously. This is a great movie to watch alone when you really need a laugh. This movie is great to watch with my grown children because we laugh together just like we did when we watched it years ago, in our happy home when they were carefree children, before all the world crap, job closings and war hungry people trying to blow us off this earth, Aids, etc.. Maybe if I were an angry, put - up - on Latino - Black - etc., I would find some parts \\"not so funny\\"? It's refreshing to watch a movie that doesn't depend on 4 letter words, sex or racial insults to be funny. Certain movies are made to make us laugh and sometimes when we let down our guards ( racism-lonliness-fear ) and open our tight lips to laugh we \\"breathe.\\" The next time you are down watch this movie or \\"Soapdish\\" or \\"Half-baked\\" - \\"CaveMan\\", \\"My Blue Heaven\\", etcc..

Even Susan Lucci wouldn't be caught dead in this lame soap opera in the sky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I am not sure why I had such high hopes for this film, but I was sorely disappointed by Disney's 'The Black Hole.' The film is horrible beyond compare. Its premise is basically a retelling of '20,0000 Leagues Under the Sea' without any of the grandeur of the 1950s classic.This films should have succeeded yet in my book it is an utter failure. The costumes, the incredible cast and the music all should have insured a great movie. Instead it is an overly dark, brooding film with huge lapses in logic and incredibly bad science that undermines any chance of enjoying the film. The characters act with no discernable or believable motiviations. The actors had to put up with scenes that are comparable to Irwin Allen's 'Lost in Space.' Go buy '20,000 Leagues' or 'Tron' instead!I found the movie so badly put together that I just cannot recommend it, not even if I found the film in the $5.00 bin would I buy it. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it and have waited years for it's return!","review":"Finally the Black Hole returns!

From the menacing nature of the ship and its inhabitants to the beauty of one of the co-stars and her psychic relationship to her robotic peer, there is much to love here. Several notable actors, including Tony Perkins, appear in this highly entertaining film.This marks what I consider to be one of the first times that Disney became adventurous and willing to take on darker and more chilling themes than before. The movie is challenging and mysterious and explores some of the more fascinating themes of human to robot interaction that speaks of what is to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sci fi classic","review":"The usual reviews on this are bad. But you need to stop comparing it to star wars and star trek and judge it for what it is. It's basicly a sci fi movie for kids. The special effects were awesome for the time and the scenery was amazing. Their is a genuine creepy feeling to the movie. Of course, if movies were a few hours longer this could have been super developed, but for what it's worth, this movie is right on target. My only grievance is with the few scenes where the cast is exposed to open space and yet maintain their composure and don't float away. Now we all know that wouldn't happen in real life, but you know what?...IT'S A MOVIE GET OVER IT!!! For fans of sci fi and 80's (actually 1979 but definate 80's flair) it won't disapoint. Disney had quite the one-two punch with this and another legendary sci fi classic, Tron. I recomend them both, and as always, go for the dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad!!","review":"After reading some of the reviews here, I have to take a moment to remind everyone of what this was back in the day. This movie had one big problem....it came out after Star Wars. Had this movie come out prior to Star Wars, it may have been considered more of a success. I had no problem with the story or the special effects in this movie. Based on the time period, the effects were as good as they were going to get. Those who complain that you can see the wires on the robots are sitting too close to the television and are spending way too much time trying to find something wrong with a good movie. Bottom line is...this is a good movie that deserves to be viewed and appreciated. Word has it that a remake is being considered and that may satisfy those who have a problem with this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"campy classic","review":"The Black Hole has something that a lot of supposedly better movies don't - an original idea. That idea may have been too far reaching for it's day but even viewing again, decades later, it was enjoyable.Best of all for me - The robots. Still wish I had that Vincent model from when I was a kid. - sigh -You do have to overlook the inconsistencies - great visual effects then a minute later you can see the wires, and I think the actors did the best they could with poor dialogue. If you view it just for fun I believe you should enjoy it.Would love to see a remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"A remake of Dr. Strangelove","review":"Okay, it isn't, but Bob's voice sounds just like the guy who rides the bomb. And that's one of the few redeeming features of this movie. It has so many problems: the irritating, platitude-spouting robot Vincent; the distracting musical cues; the muddled theology and incomprehensible ending, where we see ... <spoiler warning> ... hell? and heaven? (Maybe the movie is a remake of Dante's Inferno--would that make Vincent Vergil?). Not to mention the wooden acting all 'round, the inappropriate \\"slapstick\\" moments involving the robots, and the collapse of the plot halfway through the movie, resulting in character behavior which makes no sense. The picture quality was decent, though, except during some f/x sequences where the picture seemed choppy or in jerky slow motion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like it was made in 1969","review":"After watching this one on TV recently I came away thinking I had found the source of George Lucas' inspiration for Star Wars: the stormtroopers, R2D2, and even the theme song of Star Wars appear in this hokey film. I am now astounded to see that it followed Star Wars. Made in 1979? Unbelieveable! I thought it was dopey but attributed that to its \\"age,\\" but now realize that Disney should never have released this dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Black Hole - Transcendental Tunnel","review":"A Disney film plunging the viewer into the searing galactic equivalent of Dante's inferno? \\"The Black Hole\\" is as chillingy infinite as the title implies. Buck Rogers and Metaphysics. What are Reinhardt and Maximillian but fevered incarnations of Victor Frankstein and his Creature, spinning through eternity in the morally-vacant reaches of space, arousing man's searching lust for conquest, the dark side of Captain Kirk, with Norman Bates along for the ride.

Ok, not exactly timeless classics. It also brought this very, very strange and dark entry from Disney. Incredible work by Peter Ellenshaw on this intended space version of Verne's classic. Two stupidly \\"cute\\" robots -- the voices of Roddy McDowell and Slim Pickens. My sharpest memory of this movie upon seeing it at a theatre at the time was, \\"Jeez, I can't believe it was only 90 minutes! It seemed like forever!\\" The ending, I guess, is some strange play on 2001. Good cast but stilted dialogue undoes everything. I'm not saying this movie is the worst thing ever done. Hardly. But Disney touted this as their modern 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA and Schell's character as a modern Nemo. It just doesn't make it. It does have a terrific cast: Schell, Ernest Borgnine, Yvette Mimmiuex, Robert Forester, Anthony Perkins, Joseph Bottoms.

Yes, it's corny, yeah the robots are silly, YESSIREE, Anthony Perkins and Maximillian Schell are vying for the Golden Ham award. But you have to give the folks at Disney a B- for the effort. There is a anamorphic version of this film out there. The DVD box is RED.Anchor Bay did the best they could given the print that was acquired by Disney.

There were certainly \\"some\\" special effects but it could have used more.

I'm sure the special effects were good in their time, but they're pretty unimpressive today. That's not the problem, though. The script is horrible. The acting is horrible. The music is HORRIBLE.

The Black Hole offered another film to mimic characters while playing on the playground, or filled your mind with fantasy.

Star Wars debuted two years prior, and Alien came out the same year, yet those two films feel like much more modern science fiction films than The Black Hole does.The story is boring and drawn out. Even the action scenes are boring and laughable. The characters, even the two \\"cute\\" robots, are a challenge to care about. No child would ever willingly watch this film today.

I don't think I have ever seen Matthew Broderick give such a poor preformance and sound so pathetically lame! Who the hell was the casting director! You could tell Broderick was trying sooo hard to capture every vocal inflection and nuance that Gene Wilder gave to the original film. Broderick came off as though he was 'acting' which is not indicative of a proffessional actor!He failed miserably at imitating the brilliant preformance that Wilder gave to the role!As for Nathan Lane, well.. kind of hit and miss,trying sooo hard to imitate Zero Mostel that he comes off as trying to do just that, but sounding like a lame duck! Hey Lane! Stick to animation voice-overs!The only actor that really did a decent job was Will Ferrel.His preformance was the only saving grace to this disaster of a remake!Thumbs down on this one!

With the exception of Nathan Lane's great take on Zero Mostel's character, the casting is terrible (icluding one of the most irritating comedic actors of all time replace the fabulous Kenneth Mars).

The movie was fun but I think it's almost impossible to catch the flavor and fun that live theater presents, especially since a good performance is enhanced and energized by audience appreciation and feedback. That being said, this is an enjoyable film aside from the lackluster performance by Uma Thurman. No offense but she's no Cady Huffman. Will Ferrell was good but Brad Oscar could have shone in this movie. I was very happy to see that Roger Bart, who is a favorite of mine was included in the film as well as Gary Beach.

The last 20% was the best, but a lot of that was the newness, versus real input for the viewer. Unfortunately, Mathew Broderick could NOT pull off the Gene Wilder part, the other guy Nathan Lane did NOT endear one as Zero Mostel did. Thanks, Harry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaw-dropping creativity","review":"The Producers was originally a 1968 Mel Brooks' film about two sleazy Broadway producers trying to make money by producing a surefire flop about Nazi Germany. In 2001 a new version of The Producers began a long run on Broadway. Now we can see the new version on DVD. The musical is an amazing satire of both Broadway and Hitler, and I enjoyed it, as well as having my jaw drop in appreciation of Brooks' creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor attempt to make a movie from a fabulous show.","review":"I just love the show and have enjoyed the music from it for some years now. I'm sorry to see the movie because I found it very \\"slap-stick\\" and although some of it was memorable, in general I felt it did not measure up to the previous DVD of \\"Producing the Producers\\" which I enjoy frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not everything needs to be remade!","review":"The Producers was perhaps one of my favorite commedies of all time. The new version falls flat on its face.Broderick = Wilder, hardly. Broderick is talented but just can't do the part as well. Wilder could make you laugh just from his facial expressions.Lane = Mostel, no way! Zero was a classic comedic actor. He seemed real in the part. Lane is a great actor and I like his work in most films, he just can't be Max.The rest of the cast is just weak in this.If you did not grow up seeing the original, then this movie might work for you. I know my kids seemed to enjoy it, I could not make it all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"The original \\"Producers\\" was a pretty funny movie for its time. If its humor was somewhat broad, juvenile and singularly New Yorkisch it still contained a good number of laughs and was a lot better than most American comedies then or since. This 2005 remake takes the cake as the worst \\"comedy\\" and \\"musical\\" I've ever seen. There was literally nothing funny about this movie. I wanted to vomit every time I saw the unbearably bland Matthew Broderick or the creepy queerNathan Lane, neither of whom were right for their respective parts. For some reason, the powers-that-be completely wrote out Lorenzo St. Dubois and his very funny solo, in order to give Will Ferrel more screen time, and added a mess of unmemorable and unfunny musical numbers to the script that made this excruciating dreck even longer than it had to be. And somehow a lot of obviously very culturally deprived people found this thing funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Producers","review":"If you find it in China, it might interest you to turn on the subtitles. They're from a completely different movie. Some fool with a videocamera in the theatre made this, and the audio is challenging. I watched until the bit where Nathan Hale hung himself on the clothesline, which is right up there with a Three Stooges DVD I don't like, and then I gave up. I suspect the real version is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I love Nathan Lane, but this was so trite it was not even funny. Turned it off after 15 minutes. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Brooks is a Comedic Genius!","review":"Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick) arrives at the office of washed up producer Max Bialystock to work as his accounting. Leo, who secretly wants to be a producer himself, voices the thought that a flop can make more money than a hit, and Max instantly begins thinking of how to create a show that closes its first night. After considerable trepidation, Bloom agrees to join Max, realizing that he's risking nothing - his life is already in a virtual jail.Max stumbles upon a script titled 'Springtime for Hitler' written by ex-Nazi Will Ferrell, one Max is certain will fail. They then recruit a gay director. Financing is accomplished through Max's collection of lonely old ladies.On the first night the audience originally reacts with horror and some walk out; however, the flamboyance of the play soon convinces the rest that it's intent is to mock Hitler and the show is a success. The actual accomplishment of that mockery is comedic genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"A riot!","review":"An absolute riot! I laughed the whole way through. Will Ferrell is at his comedic best in this. The music numbers are well choreographed and sung, overall a really fun film. This movie always brings a smile to my face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I see the same movie everyone else here did???","review":"The original Producers is one of the funniest movies ever made. This is one of the worst. Couldn't stomach it for more than 30 minutes. Music is canned boredom, acting is terrible. My biggest regret is that I can't give it negative stars. Don't waste your time and money. Stick with the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great musical, updated for the new generation!","review":"Another one of the greatest musicals EVER! The cast is fantastic. I'm ashamed to say that I'm not a fan of the original Mel Brooks version; I REALLY don't like Gene Wilder as the overly timid Leo Bloom and he just can't be anyone else but Willy Wonka for me! I'm also not a Will Ferrell fan but he is great as Franz Liebkind, a former German Nazi in post WWII America, and avid Hitler fanatic.Overall, the cast is great, they all seem to have a chemistry with one another and the songs are just so darn catchy. I would highly recommend this title to any lover of musicals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Camp Classic!!!","review":"I saw both the original movie and the stage play - and loved them both. I was originally sceptical that the musical would not translate well to film, but needn't have worried. The new musical film is an absolute delight - from start to finish! If you loved the stage play, you will enjoy this too. It is very camp and over the top and the musical numbers are just tremendous. I particularly enjoyed Matthew Broderick singing \\"I want to be a Producer\\" - this has lots of glitz and glamour! I think it certainly helps that Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick had the experience of their roles on stage. The whole cast seem to really be hamming it up and having an absolute ball!! I'll admit to being a fan of musical films and this has sky-rocketed to my number 2 favourite (just pipped at the post by \\"The Sound of Music\\"). If you love frantic, fast-paced, camp and over the top - you need to see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Comedians should star in Comedies","review":"Mathew Brodderick is awful in this. Flat delivery and barely emoting anything resembling the nervous, nebbish accountant he is supposed to be portraying. It does not help that Gene Wilder was simply brilliant in the original. God what a contrast! Since MB is a central character in the movie, monochrome, bland and lifeless performance literally destroyed the movie for me. There are very few readers of this post who could not have done a better job than MB, that is how bad he is in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"the original was much better","review":"I thought I was really going to love this movie but I guess I was comparing it to the original. There is no comparison. Watch the original, much funnier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ulla Dance!","review":"This movie is hilarious, If you like musicals. Nathan Lane & Mathew Broderick do an outstanding job in this remake of the 1968 classic. The comedic timing, and the interaction between Lane & Broderick movies this happy little movie right along. The appearances of Will Ferrell (Franz Liebkind), Uma Thurman (Ulla), and Jon Lovitz (Mr. Marks) help keep you rolling with laughter. Uma Thurman's audition scene is wonderful, not only for \\"Ulla Dance!\\" but for the reaction performances by Lane & Broderick. In all, a great remake of a classic. One of the few instances where the remake might just be better than the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over-the-top fun!","review":"The premise of this movie-turned-play-turned movie is that a producer can make more money with a flop of a play than he can with a hit. This plan is proposed by accountant Leo Bloom, played by Matthew Broderick, to producer Max Bialystock, played by Nathan Lane. The flamboyant producer teams up with the nerdy accountant and they proceed to put together the worst show ever seen on Broadway. Dreams of million dollar profits are dancing in their heads when--wonder of all wonders--the show is a hit! All of the performers are over-the-top and funny and this movie is a hit, as well. It makes for a great evening of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Good As The Original, But Still Good","review":"The original \\"Producer's\\" movie was stellar; you can't beat Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel. But this movie of the Broadway version is still spectacular. Lane is wonderful, Broderick merely passable, as always. Worth seeing, definitely, especially with all the deleted scenes the DVD offers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent recreation of the Broadway show","review":"Ideally Gene Wilder would be 40 years younger and would replace Broderick in the Broadway show and this film, but shy of that this movie is about as close to the Broadway version as you can get.It is a lot of fun and features almost all of the songs from the Broadway show.It is wacky, very politically incorrect, and worth every minute. Fans of the original film will note that the new film, as does the play, has a different ending (or maybe just an expanded or exteneded ending)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it","review":"This version of \\"The Producers\\" isn't good enough to make a patch on the original film version with Zero Mostel. Save your money, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Example of a Remake","review":"I made two collasal mistakes concerning this movie. The first mistake was buying it and the second was watching it. It is a remarkably bad example of a remake of a classic movie. Nathan Lane is a pale comparison to Mostel and Broderick, well, comparing him to Wilder would be a sacrilage."},{"rating":"1","title":"as bumpy as a bad highschool play","review":"I was quite excited to see this movie as I usually enjoy both Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane, and I was very disappointed. It is the worst movie I have seen in ages. I realise that they attemped to capture the feel of Broadway, but it just felt amaturish. I am sorry that I wasted both time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I was really excited to see this movie. I was looking forward to it a month a head of time. The idea of Nathan Lane and Matthew Brodak sounded incredibly funny. But it was the exact opposite. The story is about Max(Nathan Lane) and Leo(Matthew Brodak) trying to become rich. They cheat older women out of money and find anyway to get a buck. The laughs were scarce, and the movie felt way to long. I hope Nathan Lane and Matthew Brodak try again at another movie, because this one made them look awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and then delighted","review":"Have used Amazon manny times and been delighted. Ordered this dvd not realising that different regions in the world have different 'settings' for playback on dvds and once received I was unable to play this dvd at all....

Uma is just great! Broderick never seems to find his character.So glad I never saw it in the theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonerbar!","review":"I think enough has been written about the actors. I am big fans of the musical play and the movie. My views are about the wonderful sound in 5.1 Stereo. I have recently finished my home theatre in my basement. My theatre is 50'x 29' and seats twenty made up of five rows. My screen is 15'x 9' with a gold curtain in front of the screen. Something that theatres can't be bothered with anymore. The 7.1 Denon Sound is outstanding. After viewing this film in all it's glory i knew that all my hard work was worth every penny. Of course my favorite production number is \\"Springtime for Hitler.\\" How can you not get goose bumps while watching that. The editing, costumes, music, acting, sound, dancing and everything else that makes up this film is worth 5 stars plus. If you haven't seen either the broadway version or this film, you are in for a wonderful treat. It is almost a throughback to the old films like 42 Street. This is a must have for any collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a category of his own","review":"I've been a fan of Jason Morant for several years now and have been to a few of his concerts.

Jason Morant's \\"sound\\" is indescribable and unique, he takes his influences and throws them asside to create a genre of his own.

Simply, he is a classic and the situations he depicts, hilarious. I probably listened to his records over a hundred times back then and I am sure my CD will get about the same play.

You might also complain that Tom didn't need to release another hits package while still an active artist. Again, it was MCA, not tom, who released this package, and presumable, they could care less about his music recorded for other labels.

Whoever wrote this tripe knows nothing of the UCMJ, the code of laws governing military personnel. Despite Travolta's statements, you do have the right to remain silent, the right to an attorney, etc. Garbage. Additionaly an injustice is done to victims of sexual assualt. The psychological trauma involved with such a heinous act is treated in a bloated, cavelier and compassionless manner. This movie angered me for the obviously offhanded manner with which it treated these topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book Instead!","review":"I'm so glad I read the book before seeing this movie. I understand that such a long book has to be cut down to fit into a 2 hour movie, but they deviated so far from the original story that it was almost unrecognizable. The acting was horrid, the story line was mangled - ugh.

You inevitably compare it to the book and want to scream, fortunately the General's Daughter is not one of those. I think it does fine justice to the original book and John Travolta is excellent as is Madeline Stowe. There's depth here but you have to look between the lines to see it. I marked this one for myself because it shows quite a different side of the US military that is rarely ever displayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"far fetched with an agenda","review":"Good cast wasted on a typical anti-military plot. Sorry but I choose to believe that most soldiers are good, respectful men and women of honor. Yeah, they'll always be a few bad apples and a few cover-ups, but this story was ridiculous. I kinda got the direction this movie was going from the very beginning when the General told his listeners that \\"nobody wins in a war\\". Really? Tell that to all the men and women who sacrificed everything to defeat Hitler. If winning isn't the objective for going to war, what is? This movie was uneven, often confusing and of course they had to throw in a creepy sex theme to degrade the actress who played the murder victim. Getting tired of Hollywood's degradation of actresses for entertainment value. Bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointing","review":"After having read the book & the author's message on how he closely collaborated with the director & assured his readers that the movie would be closely patterned after the book, I though it would be nice to see the movie as well. Afterall, John Travolta is a good actor. But I was totally dismayed after seeing the movie. If I had not read the book, most of the scenes would not have made any sense. I should have just stuck to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Dumb!","review":"When you hear John Travolta try and speak as a true southern would, you can't help but hope and wish he doesn't talk anymore. The Generals Daughter is about a female officer who is found tied up, naked and murdered. She is the daughter of a top general and there is a huge mystery behind who did it. No clues, suspects. Gee we never have heard or seen something like this before! So with just a couple of days to solve the case in rides Paul Brenner (John Travolta.) He his assisted by Madeleine Stowe both are CID Officers. They only add to the tension that is hanging on the base. With James Woods and James Cromwell rounding out the supporting cast. This film with it's just horrible lame dialogue and predictable turn at every corner. It belongs on the shelf and best be forgotten. Grade:D-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all around fun!","review":"I really did like this movie. I'm not usually into stuff that has to deal with war and the army and such, but this was more like a psychological thriller. It really suprised me in the end.

I love the acting and i think that this cast pulled off a really great feat. I watch this movie over and over again because it is thrilling and has great acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great film","review":"This movie would have you in suspence all the way.

There both awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Travolta is good as usual, and great music!","review":"A very intriguing plot, good acting, and a great musical sound track make this a much better than average movie. It kept me in the dark (literally and figuratively) to the end. Part of the intrigue is the fact that most of the movie seems to take place at night, and the addition of the unusual music adds to the mystique. I immediately purchased the sound track on CD. If you just want to watch a good thriller-mystery, and especially if you like John Travolta, give it a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Actors Wasted...","review":"...in a truly distasteful setting. There was very little effort made to impart real human emotions to the various characters in this film. Try as they might, Travolta and company cannot make up for what's lacking in both the script and direction...substance. Even more insulting, the film is edited for people who have a five second or less attention span. Check out the first ten minutes of this film and see if any shot is held for that long before cutting to another. There's one excellent scene between James Woods and Travolta, but otherwise it's disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it really was that bad","review":"The General's Daughter was just as bad as everyone said it was, but Michele has a thing for Madeline Stowe and I have a thing for Jimmy Woods, so we rented it. Ugh. I've developed a theory-- it takes a great screenwriter to get a good movie out of a mediocre novel (for example, the chap who did the screenwriting for Hitch, who transformed many a bad book into an excellent film). And GD didn't have a great screenwriter, or even a good one. Travolta, however, does a spot-on Georgia accent. Oh, yeah-- and a shoo-in for most annoying soundtrack of the year and most annoying song of the year (\\"Sea Lion Woman,\\" which should be stewed in a fire kindled from its own sheet music)."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of travoltas worst movies due to a bad script","review":"John travolta has made some classic modern movies and this isn't one of them. Even in his slump periods where he made some obscure movies they were better than this. In fact this one is so bad that it claims it's based on real events which is not the case. In fact even my most liberal friend thought some nutcase must have written this one!I can say that yes there's crime in the military and rapes and such but this one seems to have a motive of just being antimilitary instead of telling a good story about bad people in the military which is acceptable. This is almost as bad as 'the valley of elah' and like that one you had excellent actors lost in a movie driven by a underlying idea of smearing rathering than telling a story. That one though was far worse than this one! Travolta acts as well as ever but he can't save this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"John T's performance was superb as always, I saw this movie in '99 in Chi Town, 2 yrs later I bought it on VHS, it wore out, so I bought it on DVD, the plot was good, but you could have left out the parts about the homosexuals, not too good for children under 17 to watch.The music was great by the Shipp sisters, only wish they would have made more recordings, as far as I know they only did this one song for the movie. I have a signed copy on a cassette from them. I cherish it, I uploaded it too my Windows Media player.This movie is well worth your time watching it, if you have never seen it befor - you won't be disappointed. From a 68 yr old man who lives in Chicago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Actors Are Wasted In A Lousy, Miserable Movie!","review":"You would think that a movie that has superb actors like John Travolta, Timothy Hutton, James Woods and James Cromwell would be a great movie but unfortunately even their superb acting couldn't save this convoluted mess!

I loved the book. Didn't like the movie so much. In the book, the dialog was much better, and there was better chemistry between Paul and Sarah/Cynthia. The book also left a few clues as to who the killer is, and in the movie, they seem to grab their conclusions out of thin air. My advice is save yourself a few bucks, and since you're on Amazon anyway, buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum, implausible","review":"I haven't read the book, but I think the movie has a rather weak story. As the murder mystery unfolds, the plot seemed more of contrivance and lurid sensationalism than an actually clever answer. Also, the movie is clumsily (to the point of being irritatingly obvious) put together, putting in cliches and stock devices to substitute for real ingenuity.Travolta's charisma keeps you watching. But, I got the constant feeling that he's trying damn hard to carry this film by himself. Everybody else doesn't seem to have much else to work with or do in this movie.It has its moments, particularly the first confrontation between Woods/Travolta which is quite tasty. It won't bore you, and you'll probably want to watch it through. But, aftewards, you'll be like, ehhh. . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie -- Bad plot, Lame dialogue, Eroticized Rape","review":"Don't see this movie or buy it. It was a poor excuse for an action movie. The end makes no sense -- the murderer has no motive.And... to top it all off. The rape seen is totally eroticized. The female protagonist is in agony, and we, as viewers, keep seeing her perfect nipples. It's enough to traumatize any female viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN-OF-THE-MILL THRILLER OFFERS FEW SURPRISES","review":"It's \\"A Few Good Men\\" meets \\"8MM\\" in \\"The General's Daughter,\\" the latest John Travolta vehicle that offers up more cliches than any one person should have to digest. Clumsily done, the film offers some solid performances, but the lagging pace and flat dialogue are its ultimate undoing. Film doesn't go anywhere soon, and a ridiculous ending doesn't help any. Film should have been titled \\"A Few Good S&M Men.\\" Not bad, but very far from original; it's all been done before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I've always said that John Travolta was underestimated as an actor.

It had too much gratuitous nudity and violent sex scenes. I was very disappointed. The entire plot and characters were implausible and the staging flawed.

It never did. A series of events just sort of happened. Travolta's character, Paul Brenner, \\"develops\\" through some macho noise. A woman turns up dead. Brenner investigates. Possible suspects behave strangely, implicitly promising that some stunning revelation will be made. When that moment arrives, the conspiracy revealed proves to be unbelievable for lack of any credible motivation. Lack of motivation, in fact, is the common flaw for all of the characters in this waste of time. Pointless moments spent explaining Brenner's past relationship with a co-investigator only temporarily distract from the weak plot. Brenner was also unrealistically flip and insolent for a military man in a military setting. On the positive side, the lighting was good and the uniforms the characters wore were clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travolta's Worst Movie, Hands Down!","review":"This is one you do not want to add to your Travolta movie library! I kid you not!I saw this while on a girl's night out with my Mom when it first came out, and we both left the theatre deeply disappointed with this smutfest! The only redeeming scene was the in the beginning, with the shootout on the houseboat...Do you really need to show the full details of a rape scene? That was the primary reason why I hated this movie...to choose something so traumatic for shock value! For shame!Again, if you thought \\"Staying Alive\\" and the \\"Looks Who's Talking\\" movies were no credit to John's career, don't bother with this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip DVD of General's Daughter","review":"As a longtime laserdisc/DVD fan I was disappointed with the bonus material on \\"The General's Daughter\\". Director Simon West reads his stiff commentary off of cue cards and reveals little insight beyond what you'd expect to find in the publicity kit. Cinema fans might be interested in the deleted scenes, the ones that give the Travolta/Madeline Stowe characters greater depth and history are missed and the original ending is much much better than the Movie of the Week one they used in the film. Like \\"Disturbing Behavior\\", the deleted scenes are actually better than the junk they used. Not a good film, but the flat commentary by West make this one to miss if you are thinking of starting a DVD collection.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The General's Daughter","review":"The General's Daughter, promised to be the next great action thriller from John Travolta turns out to be nothing more than a sick perverted twist on films that ended like it, such as L.A. Confidential. Anything and everything is shown in this film, from sadmasicism, to rape, to a woman (The General's Daughter) sprawled out for all too see on the ground. The story plays out fairly well the first half, The General (played by James Cromwell) has ignored his daughters rape for years, so that he can move ahead in the military. John Travolta comes in to investigate something, does anyone know? Well besides the obvious, with the exceptions of a few good performances by, James Woods and Travolta, this was a very poor movie, and sick in my opinion. I left the theatre with a very bad taste in my mouth. My advise, by Phenomenon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another conspiracy theory","review":"This movie has a excellent plot to it with all kinds of twists and turns, it really gets you thinking.

The good points about the game is the graphics (not great though), being able to \\"improve\\" your players by earning attribute points, and multi-tap capability. But the game comes up short when you actually play it. The game itself is pretty slow and really slows down when a player is \\"on fire\\". The controls aren't great either. But what's more annoying is that there doesn't seem to be much difference in player abilities. All stars like Kobe or Vince Carter almost plays in same level as bench players. This is really noticeable when you have the lead. I guess it's to keep the scores close.This is a good party/rental game especially with several friends.

Sure, this series is all about offense, but hey, at least in the others, you could knock people down when they were dunking. Defense is completely impossible in this version. Furthermore, the third player really doesn't add anything while cluttering up the screen... The fact is, the court is super small, and there is no use for a third player (or heck, even a SECOND player) because all anyone does in this game is inbound, go straight in for the dunk, or shoot a 3. it's boring. games are kept close by the computer's catch-up mode, but that's the only way you'll ever miss a shot. simply a stupid game and a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as great as an actual show by Jim","review":"I would recommend this to anyone who loves Jim Breuer.

Compared to the ps2 wakeboading game this is actually better in my opinion. Even thou the graphics are not as cool, it has serious potential. The only real problem is that when you start to get good, it's almost too repetitious. If your a fan of arcade style games that you can swap off with a partner then this is good game for group play with little frustration and a good competitive game.

I tried reconnecting numerous times, using inputs I knew worked with other component cables, and I rechecked the connection (wiggled and jiggled) on the PS3 end to no avail. (And yes, I made sure I wasn't connecting the red audio cable into the red component video input on my TV). I ultimately decided it was the cable that was defective and returned them for a refund (which was processed promptly by Amazon without any hassle) rather than an exchange, as I decided instead to upgrade my TV (which I also bought from Amazon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Live","review":"This is it. Big Country's definitive live album so far. I say, \\"so far\\" because if it, along with last year's studio effort, \\"Driving to Damascus\\", enjoy any radio and sales success in the all-important US market, it might not be their last. I don't much care for most live albums usually, and Big Country's mid-to-late career releases in the genre (with one exception, \\"Brighton Rock\\") seemed to miss the mark in light of the fact that this band built a huge reputation on the quality of its live performances.This band blows away U2 for musical talent and integrity, in my opinion, yet U2 sells hundreds of millions of copies. It doesn't figure. This is arena rock that makes you think there might really be a band that could make a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This CD is a very deep.

It is great. Alanis is an amazing artist and this DVD shows just how great she can sound without the magic of a recording studio and production. The special features are cool, too. This DVD is pretty much an outdoor \\"Unplugged\\" concert, but without the audience. My favorites are \\"Ironic\\" \\"Uninvited\\" and \\"Heart Of The House.\\" I really liked also that you learn history about the Navajo Indians as well as an Alanis treat. I learned a lot about the Natives and history of the different famous places that Alanis visited. The scenery was breath-taking and the music was spectacular. I wish she would've sang \\"Hands Clean\\" though. Otherwise this is a great DVD, one I will probably watch over and over endlessly! It is a must have for any Alanis Morissette fan or any fan of the \\"Music In High Places\\" series. It's great, you'll love it. I reccomend it to anyone! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"for fans ONLY","review":"You are a big fan of Alanis then you will certainly like this DVD. Do not expect exciting stuff.It's not really a documentary about Alanis but mostly about Indian culture and Great Canyon beauties. Alanis is here to sing some songs (UNPLUGGED) in the middle of mother nature in front nobody except the camera !!! She loves it but I wonder if it's really interesting.For sure, it really shows that Alanis must be a simple and kind person with a great talent. So if you like Alanis to death or Indians or great canyons, then this stuff is for you.

Twilights Moon's setback seems to one rooted in over-eagerness and the need for attention and praise. It's a shame, because the music isn't varied or interesting enough to warrant the self-hype. Comparing himself to Lindsay Buckingham is such a vast miscalculation that you do kind of start to feel sorry for him...but because of the size of his ego, not because of the music he makes.

It's been a while since we've heard from a rock band where you can actually hear the words that they are singing. Of course, I picked this up after listening to the immediately listenable title cut and after a few listens found myself humming the remaining tunes from this album. I guess I can't recommend this album enough; perhaps the best from 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for those who like classic rock","review":"If you're the type who likes the more classic rock rather than the newer more 'hard core\\" stuff, Train is a good band for you! The sound is rather different and more rich, and not quite as hard of rock than other bands. They use keyboards in this band which makes it sound like something you'd hear cruising down the road 30 year ago. But don't get me wrong; it still sounds fresh and modern. \\"Drops of Jupiter\\" is the strong track on the CD, but there are many others that make a really close call. A worthy buy! There is some good things happening musically on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now That's What I call Music!","review":"In a summer full of samples of songs from the 70s and 80s, in a summer where the number one song is the gawdawful \\"Bootylicious,\\" it's so refreshing to hear such a well-written album as \\"Drops of Jupiter.\\" Train is a very good band that takes the time to actually compose thought provoking music and, more importantly, to actually use charts and arrangments beyond playing over and over a two second sample of some other song. The only downside of this album, is it could use just a little more variety, music-wise. Much as their self-titled debut album featuring \\"Meet Virginia\\" had a lot of good songs, this album does as well, but perhaps a slightly different sound in one or two tracks would have made this a five star album. Still I give it four. If you like music that's actually about something and talks about life, you'll enjoy this album. If your idea of good music is Destiny's Child, this is going to be over your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Train is awful...","review":"Why do people like this crap. I hate almost all popular music right now, but this is about the pinnacle of that hate. Drops of Jupiter is a horrible song, tell me what hell its about, its so uninspired. This band is put together simply to make money, you can tell the music means nothing to them or it would be about something or at least have emotion. I mean i guess i understand liking this band if music isn't important to you and all you know is what is played on the radio, but take my word for it that there are much better bands out there that you probably haven't heard of. If you like this band try Death Cab for Cutie or Bright Eyes.And I'm not trying to be insensative. I truly do apologize if i'm insulting your favorite band. But Train horribly disgraced Led Zeppelin when trying to preform a cover track. Big Head Todd and the Monsters have been the only band who have come close to making a respectable cover of Zeppelin."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the dumbest albums ever","review":"How anyone likes this is beyond me it totally sucks. The lyrics just suck and are very uninspired, bands like this usually don't write their own music anyhow so it wouldn't suprize me. The overplayed craptastic song from this album \\"Drops Of Jupiter\\" is a terrible radio play song that I would rather stab myself in the throat than listen to again. The vocals are terrible and the musicianship just isn't there. Train suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Boring For Words","review":"I thought this band might have something after hearing \\"Drops of Jupiter,\\" so I tried the CD. Well, a single with the lyrics \\"love for deep fried chicken\\" should have tipped me off as to what I was getting into. This is the most abstract bunch of [junk] compiled into one place I've ever experienced. After listening to \\"Drops of Jupiter\\" the 300 millionth time last fall, it struck me. I'd never considered it until I listened to the album, but suddenly I realized it- I hate this band! You remember that last album, surely? If you haven't heard it. I'll tell you about it: EVEN WORSE THAN THIS ONE! (And you didn't think that was possible.) Try some Alanis Morissette or Nickelback while these guys decide if they're rockers or country crooners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"Most of the songs on this album are pretty good. I like \\"She's on Fire\\" and \\"Let it Roll\\" a lot. However, none of them are as remarkable as the breathtaking title song \\"Drops of Jupiter\\", which was the whole reason I asked for this CD for Christmas. \\"Drops of Jupiter\\" is beautiful and poetic, with a lot of references to celestial bodies. The rest of the songs took me a while to get into. At first I thought they all sounded pretty much the same, but after the first couple of times I listened to the CD, the differences between the individual songs grew more and more distinct, and the CD began to grow on me. This CD hasn't exactly made Train my favorite band, but I may very well buy the other CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a few good songs","review":"This CD was recommended to my by friends and I had also heard the song Drops of Jupeter, however when I got the CD, I found that Drops of Jupeter was the only really good song.

They had the miracle of Drops of Jupiter and who knows where it came from, but come it did, like a slap to the face and always remained fabulous with every overplayed-on-the-radio hearing. (Though I could do without all the \\"na-na-na-na-na\\" background over the last minute or so.)And beyond that, there is not a single thing on this CD worth hearing, relentless mediocrity, as if one were trapped on the state fair circuit, hearing big-haired bands from the 80's eternally playing their semi-hits while roller coaster and dodge 'em cars add to the aural clutter.Two stars for one miracle of brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"diament","review":"uslyszalem piosenke Drops of Jupiter calkiem przypadkiem w stacji radiowej. i oniemialem to bylo cos niezwyklego. pozniej kupilem cala plyte,na ktorej kazdy utwor jest diamencikiem.po prostu trzeba miec ta plyte!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Train Rocks.","review":"I loved Train since, Meet Virgina.

Rock went downhill bigtime after the grunge era. If you want to listen to groundbreaking, creative, and talented bands, try searching your older siblings' or parents' 70's and 80's rock music catalog. Rock and pop had some real talent back then. The current state of rock and pop music these days is pathetic, 'Train' included. One of the few exceptions would be David Gray. Anyway, 'Drops of Jupiter' is a neat tune, but that's it!

'Mississippi' simply flows through your mind like the great river. 'I wish you would' like the rest of the album proved to me, surprisingly, that the male romantic is still alive and kicking....without the need to remove the testosterone drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD!","review":"Sometimes there's a song that is so good you're willing to take a gamble and buy the CD on the basis of it.

They proved that they were worthy of the spotlight again with the title track, \\"Drops Of Jupiter\\", a very catchy tune with a perfect touch of strings. Definitely one of the year's top three songs. There are some very good tunes besides the title track, like \\"Hopeless\\", a mellow track with flawlessly recorded acoustic guitars and a catchy chorus. \\"Mississippi\\" is another mellow cut with a haunting saxophone tinge towards the end of the song. \\"Getaway\\", \\"Let It Roll\\", and \\"Something More\\" are also solid tracks on a CD that often recalls the Counting Crows. Some tracks like \\"Respect\\" and \\"I Wish You Would\\" often become repetitive. But as a whole, \\"Drops Of Jupiter\\" is a definite highlight of 2001 so far, with possible Grammy potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avoiding the Sophomore Slump","review":"This is a definate example of how a guarenteed one-hit-wonder could come out with a solid album and erase that label.

Overall a solid album from the people of Train."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drops Of Brilliance And Loads Of Mediocrity","review":"Like many reviewers, I can truly appreciate the title track, Drops of Jupiter. Great vocals, super keyboards and heart felt lyrics make this song(not CD) a true winner.The rest of the CD just sounds like run of the mill pop that is here today gone tommorow. She's On Fire, Its About You, Missisippi, and Let It Roll On are semi-memorable tunes with a few good harmonies thrown in for good measure.Otherwise this group sounds like they are merely trying to find their sound. It's too clean and pretty to be rock n roll but not natural enough to be country. Its merely syrupy hum drum pop that does not offend me but certainly does not move me either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who doesn't love this cd!","review":"This cd is a classic and if you love Train, then you know \\"Drops Of Jupiter\\" and this cd is a valued additiion to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bemused, Befuddled and Boy is this GOOD !","review":"Like most of the reviews of TRAIN listed above, I too watched the Drops Of Jupiter video on VH1. Just two days ago as a matter of fact, and now I too have my very own copy of the album.I don't agree with the stereotypical placement of these fine musicians into the \\"POP\\" catagory. It would be like classifying Stealy Dan into the childrens section.As for the title track, FANTASTIC!!! You can listen to it at a low volume and capture the lyrics, play it LOUD and dance your feet off, repay it over and over and hear something differet every time.Another facit of Drops Of Jupiter is that it does not grow old the second time through.I like it, you will too.

It has occupied a place among the favorites in my collection, along with Matchbox20, Sheryl Crow, Collective Soul, Cowboy Junkies, and Indigo Girls. I play the guitar and like to play along with this CD. The songs are fairly simple to figure out and fun to play and sing along with. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent!","review":"This CD was a definate winner- the reason it doesn't get all five stars is only because I only like 4 songs on the CD. (Hopefully I will find more with time) I would describe Train as U2 with a southern accent. I LOVE Drops of Jupiter. It's About You is my second fave, Hopeless is also wonderful, and if you are in a mellow mood, Mississippi is perfect. I would recomend this CD to anyone, unless you don't like county music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whimsical Lyrics, Mellow Sounds on \\"Drops of Jupiter\\"","review":"Although the best song on this album is definitely the title track, Train's second cd is definitely worth a listen...and a second...and a third. Other strong songs include \\"She's on Fire,\\" \\"Respect\\", and \\"Let It Roll.\\" What makes Train unusual are the dreamy and not quite logical lyrics. Example: \\"the best soy latte that you ever had is me\\"?! Drops of Jupiter is full of beautiful, mellow, and sometimes melancholy sounds and images. A satisfying and whimsical listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"remarks about my amazon purchase of Drops of Juipter","review":"I got it quickly, which was nice.

My favorite of course being Mississippi...Train was a band that up until about a month ago, I had no idea about. I had heard Drops Of Jupiter but that's the only song of theirs that I knew.Eventually, I pursued more information on the group and got their albums. Drops of Jupiter is a great album. The songs range from classic rock hits to smooth, soothing songs. They have such a wide range of music style.

Susan"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're in your car, you better have this CD handy.","review":"Yes, Train sounds a lot like some other bands that are out there, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It seems to me that everyone needs to have a disc they can blast in the car on a summery day and just enjoy and sing along to. This could be that disc for you and yours. The lyrics, while on the surface a little pedestrian, develop layers of meaning as you get into the disc; 'Hopeless' has to be one of the most pained and nuanced tracks about infidelity I've heard. The careful modulation from bravado to self-delusion to vulnerability is honestly touching. It's the one really stand-out track on the disc, but if you're like me and you don't really pay attention to most of what the media deems \\"alternative\\" music, you may enjoy this slice of sunshine for the occasional delights it brings."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent TRAIN of thought","review":"Sometimes sophomore bands put all their good songs on their 1st release. I thought the self-titled CD was excellent, so I was hoping their 2nd CD wouldn't fall into that pattern. I'm definitely not disappointed -- Train has gotten even better! Drops of Jupiter is phenominal. Already had the chance to see Train once this year and hear they'll be in Atlanta 2 more times ... guess I know where I'll be on those dates."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD won't lose its luster.","review":"Drops of Jupiter by Train is an excellant CD. The title track is emotional and heart felt. I pretty much like the entire CD from the first Track She's on Fire to the last Mississippi. However, I feel there is one exception, Hopeless, sounds more like a cheesy song found in a beer commercial. With this one down point the CD is still excellant. The other songs make up for this low point. Train has deffinatly matured since there last self title album and prove to be more than a one hit wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"one-hit wonder","review":"As an 80's music fan, couldn't get into this cd.

Not so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, Train?","review":"I was looking forward to this album for a long time. I liked the upbeat sound of Train's debut release. I was looking forward to seeing what they would put together on their new release \\"Drops of Jupiter\\". The first release, the title-track was exceptional. It made me look forward to the release of the album even more.With that said, I was greatly disappointed by the lack of enthusiasm on this album. It's dull, lifeless, and leaves a lot more to be desired. I wish I could say differently, but this album has disappointed me big-time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frat-boy rock","review":"Taken in a vacuum, this CD is okay. The writing, harmony, and instrumentation are good. But I have several problems with it.First, I heard it the first time when they were called Vertical Horizon, or the Origin, or School of Fish, or Material Issue, or or or.... get the point? Sounds like a bunch of theatre / music major frat brothers got to thinking at a party and said \\"You know Pat, there's not enough good middle-of-the-road music these days; we should start a band.\\"The second problem I have with this CD is the production quality. It sounds as if they placed the mics too close to everything, then dampened the higher frequencies. Very thumpy, claustrophobic, and annoying if you tend to listen for production quality.So if you like any of the aforementioned bands, this CD is a good bet. As for me, based on the reviews, I thought this was a breakthrough album. It is NOT a breakthrough album, and I'm fairly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just One of Those Good Cd's","review":"I remember the first time my friend sat me down and made me listen to my first Train song. After that first song...I was HOOKED! I rushed out and got their first cd. So you can just imagine my excitement when I heard Drops of Jupitar. I didn't know the words to the song yet but knew that I would very soon. Train has songs that get in your head and you don't want the songs to get out. They put you in a good mood. I love this cd...if you don't have it yet, then you need it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly wonderful video","review":"This video is well worth purchasing. It is a refreshing break - even though you will see it alot. My husband and I constantly throw busy people trivia questions at each other.

The indications on the box on the running time are misleading.I believe that for its price, 24 minutes of video are poor and disappointing. Other DVD for the same age range and price run for more than twice it (Thomas and friends, Barney, Dora, Elmo).I would recommend parents to choose another DVD and to carefully look at the duration of the movie, since children might get bored soon of repeated programmes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy and Slow","review":"I was really excited to receive my 24 port switch. I was excited until I installed it, ( it was is very noisy). Then when I used it I never get transfers to switch up to the 100, they stay on the 10. Since this was/is a used item I suspect that the original owner knew it didn't have the 10/100 switching capability any longer. My loss, I guess.

Basically anyone that had anything to do with this hot steam rolled mess posing as a film. The whole production was a GHASTLY mess from beginning to end. Atrocious acting, run of the mill plot, bad lighting, dialog, makeup, casting and costume design. I knew there was going to be some gore but the rape scenes were down right unnecessary. I should have followed my gut. With a name like \\"Run Bitch Run\\" what did I expect. Jokes on me for wasting an hour or so out of my life watching this steaming dung heap of a film. Everyone involved in this mess should go play in traffic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say No to Amazon Instant Video","review":"Give me a break -- either sell me the DVD or forget about it.I refuse to download and pay over and over for something I don't actually own, and can't stick in a DVD player.Every time the only option is a download for something I want -- I will pass it by -- and I will find a different venue for the next three items I wish to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as Nude Nuns with Big Guns","review":"I bought this flick based on the fact that I liked the directors' second feature-length film, \\"Nude Nuns with Big Guns.\\" The latter film is so over-the-top outrageous, cynical, wryly humorous, and has funny dialogue and situations. \\"Bitch\\" has none of these. It is a pure, deranged, off-putting exploitation film, violent, sleazy, and unpleasant to watch as the story unfolds. Basically, the movie is about a young girl's descent into madness after being raped and brutalized by a threesome of perverted nut jobs. The bulk of the film is spent with her getting revenge on the three crazies. There is abundant nudity, and the recurrent themes of anti-religion, Nun-bashing, and lesbianism are all there as in \\"Nuns,\\" but without any sense of humor or empathy for the main character. The downbeat ending is the poorest cap to a bad film I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok... for late night flickering, but not good to buy","review":"the movie was ok... if you just flickering the television when nothing else is on. If you want to buy this movie, i recommend you go back in time to where this would be a significance."},{"rating":"1","title":"low budget grindhouse extreme","review":"This is a wild movie. Every scene is way over the top. Very lowbudget and the acting is poor. It is the basic rape-revenge slasherflick with plenty of blood and nudity. I give it the one star becauseCheryl Lyone and Christina DeRosa are both quite stunning. Cheryl Lyonedoes a decent job with her crazy whacked-out chick stare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I usually like well done revenge movies. I happened to watch this one because it is available on Netflix and the synopsis sounded interesting. Well, this movie is now in the top three of all time worst movies I have ever seen. Actually, I fast forwarded through about 75% of it because it was just unbearable.I try not to judge what other people may or may not like. If you enjoy absolutely horrible writing and acting, totally over the top gratuitous sex and violence, and characters who don't seem related to the genus homosapien, you may enjoy this movie.(I created the \\"Mikey Likes It\\" name for a review I wrote about a TV. Trust me, it has nothing to do with this movie)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rape, Revenge. Rubbish...unless you're into that sort of thing","review":"Pure sexploitation. All T&A. Cheat thrills, Catholic school girls, and bad acting. There's a big difference between an homage and a low budget, minimally skilled production attempting to leach off a recent trend. Guess which this is? There's not much else to it really, well, except for the plunger love and necrophilia. And decapitation. And machete sodomy (machodomy?). But that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sunday school","review":"I was expecting a movie more like ��The last house on the Left�� or ��I Spit on Your Grave��. Instead I got a sunday school class.

Some good versions of their more recent tracks but some real murder of the old Feat classics. I kept staring at the box to remind myself I was listening to Lafayette Railroad. As for the 27 minute version of Dixie Chicken, I fell asleep in Bill Payne's piano solo - when I woke up I thought I was listening to Rachmaninov. It's a great rock'n'roll song, and Payne is a fine rock'n'roll pianist, so give the song the respect it deserves. If you must buy this, stick with the first disc or learn how to program your player to skip at least the first 2 tracks of the second disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Communication!","review":"It has been more than a month, and I still haven't received my book.

It is a little smaller than the stock 220mah nimh battery, but fits in the battery try fine. It doesn't have a balance connector. I'm used to using larger lipo batteries that come with balance connectors that can be \\"balanced charged.\\" However, I use the Traxxas EZ-Peak Plus charger with a molex to losi adapter that I purchased at my local hobby shop and charge this battery on the standard \\"lipo charge\\" setting at 0.2 amps and it charges fine in about 30 minutes to 8.4 volts.The battery makes the Losi 4x4 Micro Trekker go considerably faster than the stock 4.8v battery (which isn't that fast to begin with). I think this battery is a little overpriced given its small size and capacity, but my son is happy having 2 batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY for your 1/36 Micro-T Stadium Truck!!!","review":"This battery simply isn't compatible with the Losi 1/36 Micro-T Stadium Truck! The electronics that are installed in the vehicle CLEARLY state that 4.8 up to 7.2 volts is what is acceptable. The stock battery is a 4.8V 150mAh NiHM. This battery is a 7.4V 180mAh LiPo. Easy math tells you it is 0.2V over capacity. This boils down to the speed controller overheating and shutting itself off (to protect it) after about 20 seconds of driving. I have about 25 years of electric R/C experience racing 1/10 scale cars. I'm ashamed I blindly trusted Losi and Amazon to do the homework and sell me compatible parts for me and my nephews fun little 'toy'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veterans","review":"Very nice dvd.

The controls are simple, and easy to learn, so you can be whooping robot butt early in the game. The enimies are really cool, and they seem to be able to learn your regular moves, so be ready for a challange later in the game. The sub - weapons are amazing! When you are in close range of your enemy, instead of shooting a weapon, you grab him and throw him off somewhere! The sub - weapons range from throwing dagger - like weapons, to shooting a huge laser! What's cool is that once you beat the game, you get two - player! Once you replay the game, the missions are different, too! The only bad things in this game is... The story: It's A little cheesy, but it's interesting. The length: This game, if you're a true gamer, could be beaten in a day to two days. So, if you like Gundam Wing, get this game!PS. It comes with a playable MGS2 demo! I give it two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!!!!( most of the time )","review":"This game is really pretty good (especially for a mech game). The graphics are nice and and smooth.The controls are of the best ever made for a mach game and pretty much anyone can master the controls the first day. The game is pretty short though which kills it some if your looking for a good, lengthy game.Also, beleive it or not as it turns out you have to beat the game which really [stinks] if you want to play any multiplayer and if you don't have a memory card its pretty much useless to beat it unless you just want to beat it.But its still a great game worth buying especially if you want to play a game thats just plain fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE!","review":"This game is one of those games that starts out fun, really cool and easy to manipulate with only a few tiny flaws that mar the surface and quickly starts on a downward spiral of sheer annoyance. I can't say any more without spoiling the game for those who still want to purchase this waste. What a shame that this game had wasted all that potential. It has great graphics, tight control and mediocre voice acting. The only way that this game sells so well is because of the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo, and I can safely say that it is the SOLE reason to buy this steaming pile, pressed into a disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this because of the 5 star rating...","review":"This game is awful...A MUST RENT..What a waste of money..Graphics are pretty good but not top notch..I am sorry,but for all of you who gave this 5 stars, You would not know a great game if it smacked you in your Yapper !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke.","review":"Well, It seems that you can't trust Konami. They come out with great games like Metal Gear Solid, but also produce [junk] like this. The demo disc, well it's worth it, but you can buy the game now. The gameplay is horrible. It's just a giant robot collding into other robots in order for them to explode. WOW!

There is hardly any variation in enemy's and missions and in the end you'll find it better to have rented then buy. yes Metal Gear Solid is packaged with it and is amazing. It only demonstrates what a good game is and what Zoe of enders is not. Either way I would rent it first. If you like it then buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mech fighting fun","review":"This was one of the first games I bought for my PS2, and it definitely didn't dissapoint. Z.O.E is fast, fun and the graphics are simply awesome.Although at first glance Z.O.E seems like nothing more than a Virtua On clone, it is actually much more than that, and features a completely different control scheme. Zone of the Enders is completely mission based; you travel from location to location destroying enemy mechs while trying to keep civilian damage to a minimum. The story unfolds as you complete each task through anime-style rendered cut-scenes. Don't expect an amazing story-line though... the plot is a little weak, but that doesn't keep the game from being fun.The battle system is easy to pick up, the gameplay moves at a fast pace and the story is easy to follow; all of which makes for a very fun (if not a bit shallow) game.(and Z.O.E. also includes the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo... how can you go wrong!?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zone of the Enders- Game of the year","review":"This game is truly a marvel. As young leo, you pilot the Mech known as the Jahuty. The best part about this game is the fact that you can destroy every inch of the backround. It is cool as hell to have burning buildings in the backround as you fight. Of course, you don't want to. Civilian deaths take quite a toll. Although it was short, it was, without a doubt, the best PS2 game of all time. Throw in a MGS2 demo, and it is a godsend."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GREAT GAME FROM KOJIMA","review":"I (LIKE MANY OTHERS) BOUGHT THIS GAME FOR THE MGS2 DEMO, BUT ENDED UP LOVING Z.O.E.

THE ONLY THING I FOUND TO COMPLAIN OF ON THIS GAME IS THE ENDING (I WON'T RUIN IT FOR ANYBODY READING THIS WHO HAS NOT PLAYED) & SOME OF THE CINEMA IN THE GAME GETS ANNOYING BUT IS WELL ANIMATED. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMEND THIS GAME TO ANYBODY, IT IS ONE OF THE BEST TITLES OUT THERE FOR THE PS2. I AM A HARDCORE MGS FAN & THE DEMO SEDATED ME TILL I CAN PICK UP MY RESERVED COPY OF THE GAME."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not about the Gameplay","review":"This game is all about the story and the animation. The gameplay is basic enough and it's basically the same throughout the entire game. The drawing point is the story and characters and the wonderful cut scene animations that are amazing. The gameplay is fun, I've always wanted to pilot a mech like this, but for me once I saw that first cut scene I was hooked. If you like the anime style, this game is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zone of the Enders is GRAND","review":"This is my favorite action game EVER, though I haven't yet purchased ZOE2 (i'm still trying to recover from Christmas expenses.) There are no action games that match the speed and energy that radiate from the gameplay of this PS2 MASTERPIECE. This mech game is sure to please any adventure game enthusiast that is looking for a quick quest. Why do I say quick? It is unfortunate to say that the game is rather short. The first time I beat it, it took me about 5 hours, and I've played adventure games that have taken twice as long, and even longer than that. It is very sad that such a brilliant piece of gaming art had to turn out to be so terse; however it is definately worth every penny that one may spend to purchase this game.Bottom line.....this game is GOOOOOOOOOOD!!!

Z.O.E. is basicaly your average mech game. You find and use the orbital frame Jehuti at the begining of the game and try to save your colony from some bad guys. There is About 50% is cinamatics and 50% play time. The action is good but can get borring after a while and the music is all right.

ZOE gets pretty compelling for the first few hours or so w/ its flawless control and rock-on camera angles! but then it gets pretty repetitive because u only need one attack to defeat enemy. Other than that, it has some neat extra after u beat the game such as VS mode which is sure to boost up the replay value (and did i mention multiple ending as well?) ! The music simply rocks. Awesome techno-rock music sets the \\"Pacing\\" and \\"Adrenaline-pumping\\" action for the game. well wat can i say? my hat's definitely off to Hideo kojima, one of the greatest game director ever on earth for producing Metal Gear solid and ZOE.

Matthew Bates went to college with Laurel Armand's brother and fell in love with her picture. He accepts a job in New Orleans, hoping to get to know her and is assigned to work the same story as her.Laurel is annoyed at having to share credit for the story and thinks that \\"yankee\\" Matthew is not her type. Of course, she soon learns otherwise and they solve the mystery together.Excerpt from the back of the book:\\"Long before he met her, Matthew Bates loved Laurel Armand. Working with her brought both pleasure and pain, because the sexy Southern belle kept him at a professional distance. Then the rival reporters were thrown together on a case of murder and madness-where much more than love was at stake.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"book was written in 1992","review":"It drives me crazy when book publishers do this! Nora Roberts wrote this book 20 years ago (as a Silhouette paperback, entitled #21 - Orchid - Language of Love). They should not be allowed to give it a new name and pretend it's a new release.

All the characters were just great and I really liked a lot of the stories. One episode I remember loving to death as a child was one involving a game of capture the flag.

Their physical therapist said the pipe extension on the seat wasn't long enough to give them full leg extension when peddling. I ordered it before Christmas due to high demand even though it was for their birthday on 1/29. Just found out it is not eligible for return or exchange for a larger one. So my niece will need to take the seats to a bike shop to have a longer pipe put on.

I lost count how many times he mentioned his own medical center and how he treats patients with chelation and detoxification from our our environmental chemicals we find in our lives that cause us to be sick.Nothing new here at all and it reads like a big, fat commercial for his center.

I've been diagnosed with a very rare autoimmune disorder that causes life-threatening allergic reactions. One of my triggers is heat. I used to love the sauna, but I would have to be CRAZY to visit one again. Sure... I eat a healthy (organic) diet, minimize my exposure to chemicals and heavy metals, get plenty of sleep... but I also avoid my triggers and I'm faithful about taking the medications my doctors have prescribed. This is how I stay out of the ER. One size does not fit all.Educating yourself is extremely important if you think you have an autoimmune disorder. BUT... this book is not the way to do it. Run the other way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a BAD idea.","review":"This book is literally dangerous. The author describes various people with serious, potentially LIFE-THREATENING illnesses and goes on to say how they were taken off all of their medication and miraculously *healed* with all sorts of non-FDA-approved and non-regulated nonsense herbs, supplements, and potions. It might sound like it offers hope to those that wish to stay away from modern medicine, but you know what? 50 years ago, you had five years to live (maybe) after a diagnosis of lupus - these days, because of corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs, many lupus patients can live a full, long life (20, 30, 40 years!) - real medication is how you treat real illnesses, and this book is extremely dangerous in its attempt to convince seriously ill people that they can be just fine if they snub western meds. Instead, they're likely to get extremely worse and possibly die. What a horrible book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure quackery - worse than snake oil","review":"This book is a repository of a litany of scares and pure quackery, much of which has been debunked by research and clinical trials decades ago.

Kudos. As a story, it's worth the watch. Protaganist Alicia Montalvo (played by Judy Herrera, AKA Jade Herrera) takes the audience on a journey that anybody can sympathise with (unless you are heartless) and that is relatable to many in today's society. It's unclear as to why the photograph on the movie DVD cover depicts a female that is not seen anywhere in the movie (it is not a photograph of the actress that portrays the lead character), but it is understandable given the movie's purported budget. I'd say \\"East of Hope Street\\" is heart-warming, inspiring, and possibly for some a swift kick in the ass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff, I say!","review":"Having recently finished The Taming of Corky, I was glad to suggest it to my students.

The players flicker a great deal while moving up and down the court. You can even see through them as they become transparent when the action is too intense.

Bad graphics, music, and repetitive gameplay make this game a waste of your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing Sequel to NBA Showtime!","review":"This game is not better than last year's edition. In fact, it has even manage to fail in several areas that are well-done in last year's NBA Showtime. The only positives I can think of this game are a few added extras including new moves such as alley-oops, more secret courts, and more players. The gameplay remains the same overall. What I don't like is the horrible music that plays in the background. It can drive you insane after 5 minutes! Also, the graphics are worse with players that look awkwardly long with skinny legs! The colors are very dull compare to last year's game. During the game players constantly flicker and sometimes they even become transparent! This game is not fun to play because of the annoying music and bad graphics. I would advise getting NBA Showtime instead if you like arcade basketball games for your Game Boy Color!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Arcade Basketball Game!","review":"This basketball game has good arcade action. It plays very similar to the NBA Jam series. Players in this game can do super moves and get powerups on the court. It's very fun but will eventually get boring.

The second volume in this series did not live up to it's predecessor or even reach half its potential. Following the first book, I was excited to see how Sarah and Wessex would reconcile their differences and live together as husband and wife. Unfortunately, none of that ever materialized. The footnotes were ludicrous, the direction of the story even more, and the writing dismal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just disappointing","review":"Like other reviewers I hoped to get more out of the sequel after reading Shadow of Albion, and I like Edghill. But the paperback, even with fewer footnotes, was hard going.The threads never came together satisfactorily and the plot was ridiculous. I don't mind christianity vs satanism in a book butin this one it made the characters extremely one-dimensional and just didn't gel with the magic mixed with voodoo.How is Sarah supposed to prevent the People's decimation with or without the Sahoya's help? Why is the chief's son courting her? What exactly did the Grail do? The book raised loads of questions and answered none--the authors would have done better taking out most of these plot devices.I'll read other books by both authors--just not the ones they co-author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brakian roots music from Pantanal","review":"Almir Sater brings to us the sweet music of the Brazilian wilderness of Pantanal, one of the most beautiful parts of the Earth, most of it still untouched.

A psychotherapist would have a field day examining this bizarre partnership. Unfortunately, Shawn Colvin's fans suffer. There is nothing on this record to differentiate Shawn from the rest of the banal female singers that flood the airwaves. That's a terrible shame because Shawn is so gifted, and her talents are completely wasted. While her lyrics may still be full of wit, irony, and elusiveness, Leventhal's arrangements turn it all to a muddy mess. Do yourself a favor and pass on this CD. Instead, listen to Steady On, Fat City, and Covergirl to fully appreciate one of the most gifted singer-songwriters of the last fifteen years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whole New You by Shawn Colvin","review":"CD does not play in any of my car CD players.

Stick with her old albums as this one sucks something fierce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frankly, I Preferred The \\"Old\\" You!","review":"I have been a fan of Shawn Colvin's music since her first release,Steady On, back in the late 80s. This is the only item in her impressive catalogue that fails to grab me, even after repeated listenings. Without actually looking at the CD booklet, I wouldn't be able to name a single song on it, off the top of my head. This does not mean that the album is bad, by any means, but it is not to my taste. I feel justified in saying that it is certainly not up to the quality of her other work. I recommend insteadA Few Small Repairs, which remains her strongest collection. Fortunately, Ms. Colvin's latest release,These Four Walls, is also superb, and represents a return to form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top 1000 Reviewers can be wrong !","review":"Could not disagree more with the lead review for this album. Fans of Shawn Colvin will have loved her early work and took in \\"Repairs\\" as a breath of fresh pop air. Whole New You goes too far from her roots and too close to pop trivia, bar a few star tracks that we'll buy this for anyway.But, to get closer to Shawn, buy Cover Girl - contrary to the Top 1000 reviewer, who by definition, listens to a whole heap of stuff and doesn't specialise in backlist, this album is far closer to her soul than anything. Half of it is live, most of it unplugged, all of it what she loves listening to and performing. Wake up and smell the coffee...."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Charmer- Snatch It Up!","review":"Shawn Colvin has offered up a terriffic new album with WHOLE NEW YOU. The editorial review made me a little concerned that she had decided to join the world of punk or rap music and that we should all run like the wind from this album. Rest assured, this is the same old Shawn singing in her same wonderful way. Enjoy playing this body of work, and know with confidence that you are receiving the soul-filled folk sound that we love from this woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced and very disappointing","review":"I've been a long-time fan of Shawn Colvin's, and I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed in this new release. I recognize that artists change and evolve, but she seems to be heading in a direction that's more designed to ensure her [money] and mucho radio play as opposed to why I fell in love with her in the first place, namely spare arrangements that allowed her voice to come through. There's not much heart in this CD. It seems listless and angry."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice, overall","review":"I wasn't offended at all by \\"Whole New You,\\" as it seems some other reviewers were. Sure, it's more \\"produced\\" than her early works, but I'm okay with that. Goes with the territory. As someone who owns four of Colvin's other CD's, I think this is a nice addition to the collection. If you love her voice and lyrics, I think you'll enjoy this latest work. I'm looking forward to the chance to hear her live, because I do believe that's when she's at her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whole New Low","review":"Wow ... was I excited about the prospect of a new Shawn Colvin album. I still listen regularly to the smash \\"A Few Small Repairs\\" so couldn't wait to rip-off the shrink wrap and have a listen. ... A slick, over-produced effort was what greeted my ears. I yawned all the way through it .. the melodies, such as they are, meander and the lyrics are trite. I searched, in vain, for some catchy pop hooks to capture my interest, but there were none to be had. The quick fix is to lose John Levanthal .. let him grab onto someone else's coattails. And the cover art? Truly bizarre. What could she be thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Background Music","review":"Well there is nothing to be critical of here. The music is competent and intelligently written--performed like the true professional Colvin has become. Colvin as always uses the limited range of her voice to great effect (as perfected on the breakout unlikely smash, \\"A Few Small Repairs\\"). The tracks lack individual distinction but blend beautifully into the background of your work day or car ride. No hit singles here and this one will fly well below the pop music radar....but its not bad, I swear! If you need something with a little more PLUCK try Jess Kleins' fabulous \\"Draw Them Near\\"--an up and coming Colvin to be for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but Sweet","review":"Shanw Colvin's newest release \\"Whole New World\\" is a step down in intensity from her grammy-winning 1996 release \\"A Few Small Repairs\\" but is worth owning, nonetheless. It doesn't have any tracks that sound like radio hits except the title track, but it does have the musical texture and lyrical depth required to make it memorable. The ache in her voice is just as alluring as ever and the songs will tug at your heart. My chief complaint is that the CD is VERY short in length. Excellent production from John Leventhal and a must-have for your CD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have been a huge Shawn Colvin fan for almost 15 years, but I am more than a little disappointed with \\"Whole New You\\". When I listen to a Shawn Colvin album, I want to hear Shawn sing wonderful lyrics and play her acoustic guitar - either alone or with a background that highlights that singing and playing. John Leventhals backgrounds are overproduced, making the vocals seem hidden or less important. It seems that this album is more about Leventhal, and less about Shawn. Many of the songs seem disjointed, often jumping abruptly between verse, chorus and bridge - as if each section of the song was written separately and patched together later.I was hoping this album would grow on me, but not so far. All I can say is that I can't wait for her next album, to see if she can gain control of the musical focus of her own career.Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 3 year old screamed in terror.","review":"I got this book from our local library and did not read it before reading it to my 3 year old daughter. When we got to the part about the boy putting the mother in the trashcan, not feeding her, beating the can with a stick, and taking it to the dump, my 3 year old freaked out and started screaming. She was absolutely terrified. I told her it was just pretend and we finished the book to see what happened but the book never really got much better and didn't go into detail about all the great things older siblings get to do. It just provided pictures of the older brother holding the baby while the mother watched soap operas and the older brother staying up late to watch a late night talk show--both kind of inappropriate since I don't what my child to think she has to watch her sibling so that I can watch television or that she gets to stay up until midnight.

But goes on to say that he will put the Mom and baby in a trash can and hit it with a stick, not feed them, cover them with ashes, and on..... While I'm sure this was meant to be funny. I don't find it that way at all!!! I find it disgusting. Why would you even want to put these ideas in a kids head. Maybe they can't put the Mom in a garbage can, but they may try to put the baby in one. I can't believe a book like this was published."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only we had a negative number of stars...","review":"This book isn't funny. It's extremely negative to a level that I didn't think possible for children's books. Truly, I saw it at the library, couldn't bear to read the entire thing, then came to give it a bad review....it's really that bad.If your child is having a hard time adjusting to a new pregnancy or new sibling, deal with their actual emotions. Do not give them the idea that throwing mommy away is an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking and Disturbing Book","review":"I was happy to find a book to help prepare for a new addition to our family. I wasn't prepared to have the character want to put his mom in a trash can, beat it with a stick, take her to the dump and pour ashes on her. This is really disturbing and NOT something I want to read to my child. There are better ways to deal with anger and frustration a child might be feeling then putting such an ugly visual in the minds of both children and parents. I put my copy of this book in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny, yet sensitive","review":"This is a humorous look at how a young boy responds to his mother's pregnancy.

But that's it.","review":"Pros: Great sound, probably the best I've heard in a headphone.Cons: Everything else.I mean, really. I was a little surprised to open up the box and see these headphones in there. They look more or less like something that is put together by a 12 year old. Cheap and nondurable is what came to my mind.Another issue i've had with them is that you cannot put the cord over your ear, which insures that the headphone will stay in. They look goofy when you have them in, due to the cable being almost always erect and sticking out. I don't understand why they weren't engineered to go over the ears. For this sum of money I believe these are definitely not worth it.Summary: They sound great, but everything else is surpassed by other headphones and better engineering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with the Shure headphones, you'll be sure glad you did!","review":"These headphones do an excellent job of cancelling out background noise and its nice that they come with a box full of optional earplugs. The headphones came out in 2004, which i'm sure at that time were amazing headphones. But it is 2009 and I believe that Etymotic should redesign their headphones. These headphones are no match for the Shure SE420's. When you wear these headphones you will feel like Frankenstein because they stick out from your ears so awkwardly. I sent mine back and am now using the Shures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The short and not so sweet- IMO, these earphones are simply not what most of the reviews would suggest. Are they better than earbuds? Yes they are. Are they audiophile quality? Not in the least. The bass response is iffy at best, and they have a tendency to sound overly bright in the high range. I use them with my I pod as most others will, and I import music at 320kbps, so I offer these phones the best opportunity to shine and they have proved to me to be marginal. That said, the price is not ridiculous for what you get but if you are really looking for high end response you will have to look further. I find that many people make up their minds about a product before they buy it, and even in the face of contrasting reality will still swear allegiance to an inferior piece of gear. I am not one of those. You will get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bass, good mids and highs","review":"I am returning my set for refund. I bought these for my Samsung mp3 player. The base from the headphones included with the player is better. The documentation says to make sure you have a good fit or you will not hear the base and have a weak or tinny sound. I tried both types of the included inserts and I could not get them to work for me. I tested them for several hours trying to get a good deep base. After spending this much for a set of headphones I really wanted them to work.

Ive always had a problem with headphones because you have to keep the volume too high when there is noise around you like at the gym or on the street.

It took me about 15 minutes to decide to return them. I listened to both rock and jazz through these earphones, using the different endings that come with them, and through the earphones that came with my Zen mp3 player and through the earphones that came with my Apple Shuffle Ipod. The bass actually sounded fuller on the Zen and IPOD earphones and I was unable to detect any real improvement in sonic clarity resulting from the Etymotic phones.Unless I am missing something, these earphones are the Emperor's New Clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"These in-ear earphones are all and more that they claim. They are comfortable and easy to listen to. Once you have found the most comfortable earpieces from the supplied selection, the advice to ensure that they are placed sufficiently far into the ear is important for the full acoustic range. Great for noisy places like aircraft. Allow enough slack when you clip the wire retainer to you lapel or collar."},{"rating":"2","title":"No frills. Quality sound.","review":"I was after a pair of noise-canceling earphones for plane flights and Starbucks, but also something that has excellent sound. This pair does just that, most excellently. After reading the reviews on Etymotic's other (more economical) earphones, as well as many other brands, I opted to get these for reasons of durability and quality, even though I can't hear frequencies greater than ~18kHz. I use Bang & Olufsen's A9 earphones, which I own, as a product for comparison. Compared to the A9's, these Etymotic earphones are a bit softer with the higher frequencies. And(!) the bass isn't overwhelming, which is my complaint of cheaper earphones (but not the A9s). If you have the money, drop it on these. It pays to buy quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better durability for the price","review":"No complaints about the sound quality of these earphones, but for the price, I expected better durability. Until recently, I only used the phones on occasion when traveling and such. But after recently joining a gym, I put them to more use, and consequently put them to the real test. Unfortunately, I can't say they past the test because after a few months of workouts, one of the phones shorted out and no longer produces any audio.

This time I decided to try Etymotic's competing earphones, the ER-4P. Bad Idea. Sure, the sound is good, but it's good on the E3s as well. However, Shure has a number of great ideas that Etymotic missed out on. Their earphones conform around the ear, not stick out making you look like an idiot. When wearing the Etymotics I scream \\"I'm a fool with wierd headphones, someone mug me for my ipod\\". With the Shure's no one even noticed I had headphones on. The big difference is excess noise. The Shure's fit snugly around the back of your head. When the cable is bumped, the sound travels to the snug point and dies, never reaching your ears. The Etymotic cables just dangle. Everytime you turn your head the cables bump your shirt collar, and loud vibrations offend your ear drums.I tried each for six months. Now I'm selling the Etymotics and buying another pair of Shure's. They're both the same price, go buy the E3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in-ear headphones","review":"I have tried many different headsets with my iPhone and these by far are the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the Shiznit!","review":"Wow! I moved to these from the ER-6i. Big difference. The 6i's are good but these just have a much fuller spectrum of sound. Some say there's not enough bass; I disagree. Everything is there, in just the right proportion. So many nuances that you've never heard before just pop out. They're not fatiguing either, soundwise. I listen mainly to rock, so can't comment about jazz or classical. I was hesitant to spend so much money but am so glad I did. They're comfortable in the ears, too. I wasn't crazy about the glider tip with the 6i's, but that tip seems to work best with these. My only complaint is that they hang a little heavy due to the junction where the cords from the earpieces come together to form the main cord. Use the shirt clip and you won't notice it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise and Distortion is what you'll get...........","review":"If you listen to high fidelity classical recordings forget about it.

The book is basically a long survey article with little practical instruction for HOW to deal with fat-tailed distributions. The one strong point of the book is the extensive list of references. Mainly though, the book suffers from the general sense of \\"math anxiety\\" that is so prevalent throughout the population. Bottom line, if you don't know enough math to deal with the technicalities that the authors so studiously avoid, you can't do anything useful with the modeling of fat-tailed distributions.

His favorite part is the Mr. Brown segment, which he watches while reading along in his own Mr. Brown book. Yes, it is more of a video of still pictures, but so are many of our older Richard Scarry videos, and he loves those as well - I think of it as strengthening his attention span.

Zoe is cut off from all of her old friends since it was court ordered until she gets in contact with one of them.

Another thing I noticed is the typical scenario of teen-girl-track-star-with-an-overworking mother.

Every show is entertaining and usually carries a message.A lot of other programs spun off form the characters that played in this series.

Can't wait for all the black & white seasons to be released on DVD.I'll eat Aunt Bee's pickles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Gets Better With Age...","review":"...I personally rate the second season of TAGS a half-star higher than the 1st season, only because the characters start to come into their own a bit more. Andy gradually loses his WILL STOCKDALE accent from NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS, and Don Knotts truly starts developing the legendary character of Bernard P. Fife in episodes such as 'The Pickle Story', 'Barney's Replacement' and 'Sheriff Barney'. Other favorites from season two are 'The Manicurist' with Barbara Eden, 'Barney and the Choir', and 'Aunt Bee the Warden'. Season three will truly be a treat, as the show really begins to hit its stride. Regardless, I'll own 'em all before all is said and done (yes, even the color episodes).Just remember:'WE DEFY THE MAFIA!!!'"},{"rating":"2","title":"What I've been waiting for, and a must have for all Andy fans","review":"The full seasons of The Andy Griffith Show are finally for sale. I think that this show was the greatest show ever made, especially for families who like to watch tv with their children and not have to worry about what they are fixing to see. The comedy and real life values that come from this show have never been seen since and probably never will, so you better get it while you can. The price is very good as well, $1 and episode. I would of thought they would have been more. I just can't wait to have the full collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Great picture quality. Worth the price.

I grew up in a small town in the south so I knew people like these characters, old country folks you can't help but love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good season!","review":"I really like this season. One of the reasons why is because it has a lot of classic episodes in it like \\"The Pickle Story\\" or \\"Three's A Crowd\\" even \\"The Merchant Of Mayberry\\" which features Sterling Holloway who was later the voice of Winnie The Pooh. Barney is very funny in this season especially in \\"Barney And The Choir\\".This season also features one of my favorite actors Buddy Ebson in \\"Opie's Hobo Friend\\".If you like wholesome entertainment go head and pick this up - it won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANDY GRIFFITHS SHOW, SEASONS 1 & 2","review":"It has been a very pleasant experience watching the first two seasons of THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW. The comedy tends to focus on the foibles of humanity, and has at times broke me up into guffaws of laughter. Don Knotts is simply priceless as the bombastic, bumbling Barney Fife, and Andy Griffiths provides an apt 'straight man'to his antics. In short, the initial three seasons of THE ANDY GRIFFITHS SHOW provide good, innocent humour in the setting of small town North America which was so prevalent in the early 1960's. As for the seasons after #3, I personally will be taking a pass, since I recall them as a gallery featuring rural rubes such as \\"Gomer Pyle\\" & \\"Guber\\", who serve as the butt of laughter at their odd personalities."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrated","review":"I do not like that you have to view all of the commercial type previews at the beginning of the dvd..it takes about 10 minutes and you cannot bypass them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try","review":"It will work for my GPS (Magellan Maestro but takes away the ability for me to be able to use it in my car as it does not clip but rather screws into the GPS.

Even though I have read it so many times and I remember the different ups and downs of the story it is still an awesome book to read in repitition. This is the perfect story in deplicting that no matter what back ground you come from if you want something bad enough and your willing to do what it takes to get there, there is no stopping you.

This printer has black and white and color copying, scanning and printing. It is a good size, easy to use and has ink tanks that are seperate for each color, so you just replace what you need. I have had mine for about 2 months and haven't had any problems with it. Pictures print quickly and are pretty sharp. I think this is a great printer to use at home as I do for my basic household computer printing, and I make many copies which is great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multifunction or Malfunction?","review":"This product is, in theory, a very useful multitask machine. Unfortunately, I've had quite a bit of trouble keeping it in working order. The ink ran out after what seemed to be very little use (though this, I'm afraid, may be typical of modern printers). Then, when I bought the replacement cartridge..., I still get the \\"cartridge needs replacing\\" message. ... overall I'm sorry I didn't get a basic printer and the other peripherals (scanner, fax) separately.

I think i will just buy a new printer instead. I am very unhappy with this printer, and have no way of getting it fixed properly.

I absolutely do not recommend buying this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible printer!","review":"I have had nothing but trouble since I got the Multi-pass. It won't feed envelopes no matter what I do. It didn't work well with Windows ME or XP. The scanning ability is very good, but the printer qualities are a major problem. It skips lines of type and will not print a complete page of checks, but only the top check. I have down loaded new print drivers twice and still have not been able to get it corrected.

When I heard that this one had come out, I ordered it sight-unseen from my local bookstore and eagerly awaited its arrival. However, I didn't get very far into it before I realized that it was not what I had hoped for.Maybe it had something to do with being co-written, but this last book just didn't hang together. Conversations were stilted, and the characters kept feeling the need to remind each other about things they'd done in the past - obviously just to inform the reader who may not be familiar with the series. Very awkward. While it is good to hear from old friends, this story just wasn't good enough to merit its being written.Suffice it to say that you should only read this if your imagination won't satisfy you as to the future of Anthropos and the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Single from an Amazing Hardcore Band","review":"Give up the Ghost is unlike almost every other hardcore band out there. Formerly known as American Nightmare, but now not allowed to even refer to that name because of copyrite issues, they play \\"tough-guy\\" hardcore, AKA sped up punk with screaming, yet they have some of the most poetic lyrics in music i can think of.Wes Eisold has a beautiful voice, though his vocals mainly consist of screaming. The title track, \\"Love American\\" is also one of the best tracks on the recent \\"We're Down til We're Underground\\" album, which is one of my favorites, while the other two songs are equally as amazing.Give up the Ghost is certainly one of the best hardcore outfits in recent music history, and its a shame that they recently broke up, even though I couldn't imagine them coming out with an album to top this single and \\"We're Down til We're Underground\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"unable to use","review":"I was so looking forward to playing this game.

I also think that there is a lack of talent and creativity in most of the MET productions including this one. The outdated painted scenaries are a real shame. Whereas European productions are experimenting these days with new concepts of opera staging (some of them quite good and some others quite unfortunate) Americans seem to be stuck into a rather rigid and old fashioned concept of staging. This is a clear example that money and excess does not necessarily buy good taste specially if they do not go hand to hand with new ideas. About the great diva: I certainly love Anna Netrebko, particularly her mad scene that is quite breathtaking. However I cannot take out of my mind the legendary performances of other great divas such as Maria Callas and Edita Gruberova in the same role. Anna Netrebko is spectacularly beautiful and elegant in the role though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The old Stand and sing MET","review":"The telecast of Fille du regiment set a very high standard for opera in genral and for the Met specifically. They returned to their old \\"star-driven\\" stand and sing production for Netrebko. The chorus was static and uninvolved, the baritone was loud and unsubtle, the tenor was tall, handsome and VERY nasal and the young bass has started to sing out of the side of his mouth. There must have been dubious cuts and the only acting and movement were done by Netrebko. Hers is a beautiful instrument, but not really suited to this kind of music.I hope the Met keeps going in the new direction of energized and logical porductions.

Which is it? If indeed it is the Netrebko version, which I have seen on television in a Met broadcast, she brings the character to life in a way that made me appreciate the opera for the first time.

However, I just cannot enjoy music with the New Age / Avant Garde elements that Badi Assad adds to the tracks. Making popping sounds with her mouth, for example, ruins the music for me. If you are looking for CLASSIC or CLASSICAL guitar, this disk will disappoint you. There are a couple of tracks that are more traditional, but maybe not enough to justify buying the whole disk.

Can't Jane Austen's characters be copyrighted so that this can't happen again? Jane Austen's books are enjoyable because the characters are so well written and they have such class, something missing in the modern world. The author has turned them into characters from a \\"bodice-buster\\" novel. Darcy is now an 18th century Fabio and Elizabeth lusts like she is in a novel entitled, \\"Love's Savage Destiny.\\" The author also substitutes good writing with outrageous plot twists like Elizabeth being kidnapped by a disgruntled footman, and Georgiana going off to the Napolianic wars to be a nurse! Thumbs down for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I love Pride and Prejudice and like many fans, I just want to know more. That said, I still would not reccomend you buy it. First, the book uses over complicated language mixing \\"period\\" language with current words and phrase. It was awful. Then, the story line was both transpart and painful. It gives those of you who want to read it sex scenes, they it is not worth reading the rest of the book to get to them. Also, both Darcy and Elizabeth were not accurately pictured in the book. This book was a big disappointment. I feel like I wasted my money. I usually love this sequels to P&P even if they are not good literature, this one is not worth your time reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read, but...","review":"I love a good story with interesting characters and I found it here but, please, dear author, get a new editor and pay more attention to consistancy in names, places and spelling. I was not looking for Jane Austen's style, but I would appreciate the names of her characters to be spelled correctly - ie.\\"Elizabeth\\" not Elisabeth. Now, that I have that out of my system, I did enjoy the story and will read it again - with my blue pencil in my hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think so . . .","review":"This is a book for a romance novel reader, not for a true Jane Austen afficionado. The first half is all sex and the seemy brutality of the period while the second half is all Darcy chasing across France after his sister. In all of Jane Austen's books, the action is of the drawing room, ballroom, and formal gardens. Other events (seductions, pregnancy, birth, illegitimacy abandonment, duels, death) are merely mentioned. Elizabeth is a dope, Jane is a dupe, Bingly is a dud, and Darcy is dull. Who really wants to envision Darcy sitting on his bed and peeing into a chamber pot while Elizabeth looks on admiringly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bar Sinister, Pride and Prejudice Continues","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't even bother to finish it and will be giving my copy away. I tired very quickly of the sexual aspects of the novel...if I wanted that I would have gotten a Harlequin romance instead. I prefer the way Jane Austen built up gradually to the romance... I do not think that Jane Austen would have written like this if she were a contemporary novelist. A much better choice for those who can't get enough of Darcy is An Assembly Such as This: Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman by Pamela Aidan."},{"rating":"1","title":"fraud","review":"As I started reading this book, I realized I already read it.

There should be a fine of thousands of dollars for her and the publishing company."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!!","review":"I loved this sequel. I laughed, cried and gasped at the rollercoaster of events. I especially enjoyed that the author brought you the same feelings toward all the characters as Jane Austen did.

I am not a fast reader but, I finished this book in five days. I loved it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sequel","review":"This book is the best sequel that I have read to pride and prejuidice and perhaps is the one closest to how I image Darcy and Elizabeth. It is true that this is NOT the way Austen would have written (but there again she was never married so is it suprising that she didn't write about what happened after the weddings) but is still very good. The first couple of chapters focuses on Darcy and Elizabeths physical relationship but once Ms. Berdoll has addressed this (essentail) topic the story moves on in an entertaining manner. Some parts did make me want to cry (in part because the story was so sad in places but also the grammer is awful - have you not heard of a spell check?) In conclusion - well worth the money - best sequel yet but loses one star to its grammer (or lack of it!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book!","review":"If you don't want your good opinion of ALL of the Bennets, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Bingley ruined DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! The spelling is unbelievable! Come on! EliSabeth? Has this author even read Pride and Prejudice? Jane Austen is turning in her grave! All this story is about is EVERYONES intimate life. Darcy having a premarital relationship, and Bingley and adulterer? That would never happen in that time! This book is not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to Jane Austen","review":"The book is pure trashy pornography; the so-called love scenes verge on or tumble into the ridiculous; the characters are all of them caricaturized and absolutely not corresponding to the originals; the facts told could never have happended to Jane Austen's characters, because they are neither so gross and superficial, nor so ignorant or ingenuous as the author makes them appear. The spelling is disastrous, the syntax nonexistent. Great books make the reader eager to know how the story goes on, but having read some sequels to Jane Austen's novels I'm of opinion that in most cases it is far better to check one's curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This is a trashy romance novel trying to be a classic. I was very disappointed in the sex, sex and more sex happening throughout the novel. I'm certainly not a prud, but a book that advertises itself as a sequel to a classic, well written and modest story, to find so much sexual suggestion and description was a sincere let down. For those who enjoyed the suggestion of sexual tension in JA novels, this is not a book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if Jane Austen were illiterate....","review":"The concept is interesting, the plot is intriguing, and I can accept characters who only share names with the originals. However, struggling with the language - not only pretentious, but very often grammatically incorrect - leaves me feeling like Alice after talking with Humpty Dumpty (\\"words mean what I want them to mean\\"). This book is mentally exhausting to read, when it should be a \\"light-hearted romp.\\"It is also very heavy to hold, even in paperback. this makes it especially easy to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this","review":"This is a very silly book that is obsessed with sex. I seriously doubt that any of them would act this way--even Lydia is unbelievably crude. This book has taken characters from a beautiful, genteel world described in elegant prose by Jane Austen, and turned them into players in a trashy soft-porn novel. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the timid or innocent...","review":"The title should have been Sex Sinister like another reviewer has stated. This is your typical bodice ripper, sex depraved, trashy romance novel, which just happens to have characters named Darcy and Lizzie. The style is not even close to the period of Pride and Prejudice so therefore can not be considered a sequel to the book, but it could be the x-rated sequel to the mini-series maybe. Mr. Darcy must have been very rich indeed to afford two baths a day for each one of them, when during Jane Austen times more than one bath a month was considered an extravagance even for the wealthy. I found this book to be more like a very bad soap opera. While the mini-series took some creative license in good taste to make the story more compelling visually, this book does just the opposite. I was just very disappointed overall, since the characters are very compelling to begin with and to then put them into a bad soap opera without an originality or any glimmer of taste?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Austen lovers will be disappointed and/or disgusted","review":"As a few other reviewers have hinted, this should more properly be titled \\"A Sequel to Andrew Davies' Pride and Prejudice\\" (although that does an injustice to Mr. Davies). It's not only wildly inaccurate in even the most basic facts (names, places, correct spellings), it needs an editor with a drawerful of red pencils. The prose at times is so purple it verges on ultraviolet. I wish I could have \\"awarded\\" it zero stars. Like a previous reviewer, I didn't even think it was worth donating to the library.And to our European friends (one of whom remarked that \\"only Americans will like it\\"), PLEASE don't group all of my countrywomen together - ANY discerning reader from ANY country will realize that this is just a bad book, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have read them all. This is the BEST- Bar none.","review":"When I googled Jane Austen, I wasn't even aware of the \\"cottage industry\\" regarding prequels, sequels, and \\"variations\\". Someone's comments vehemently recommended this book, \\"The Bar Sinister\\", later reprinted as \\"Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife\\". Please know - it's the same book with the latter version having some minor additions and grammar changes. The best sequel written to date in my opinion: truly captures the style, is accurate to the period, but adds the sex. If you blush, this is not for you, however, if you are adult, this book will hold your focus from the start. Great plot, characters and oh, yes, romance. Set aside the weekend, you won't want to leave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"I am not ashamed to admit that I absolutely ADORED this book - despite its appauling (indeed) editing. Although I am a great Austen fan, I am not an Austen \\"purist\\", and trully believe that a sequel written 200 years after the writing of the original, cannot but portray one the geatest stories in the history of literature through the prism of 21st century sensibility - and sensuality! \\"Bar Sinister\\"'s plot is tremendously rich, the voyage of the book's characters through it deepens our understanding of them and you are left with the very satisfactory feeling that you have travelled along with them and they have somehow become part of your life! It really felt like quenching a thirst - the thirst that P&P leaves you with and makes you read it over and over again! It is everything that I had ever wished for in a P&P sequel - I do not think it can get any better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Austen Readers Beware","review":"Not only is the plot rambling, the grammar atrocious (every other sentence contains a phrase, like this, in parentheses), but the characters are utterly unbelievable. If you are looking for some amusing, if trashy, light summer reading, and you don't mind the desecration of some of literature's finest characters, read on. If, however, you are an Austen purist, save your time and money. This one is a disappointment from the word go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Jane Austin is doing flips in her grave! I never expected perfection but you would hope that when someone writes a sequel to someone else's novel, they would try to write in at least a similar style. This book does not even come close. The author uses phrases over and over again that Austin never used and the almost constant sex is something she never wrote about. This book is terrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bawdy Fun Not for Purists","review":"This book will most appeal to whose who loved the recent miniseries. It bawdy and funny, and the story is quite good. Jane Austen purists BEWARE and take a hint -- DON'T READ IT! Let the rest of us have our fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bar Sinister, Pride and Prejudice Continues","review":"I love Jane Austen books and always wished there were more of them.After reading the positive reviews for this book I set out to find it.I had to order it and I was very eager to receive it.It was a HUGE dissapointment.It was a trashy book with nothing that would even remind me of Pride and Prejudice.I couldn't finish it.It was absolutely disgussting.I was going to give it to the library but I was ashamed to donate such trash.I just recycled it.I guess that you have to be an american to like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! WOW! WOW! - What a Wonderful Book! ...NC17 though","review":"All I have to say is..What a wonderful book. If you do not mind a lot of explicit intimate scenes, this book is for you. The author, Ms. Berdoll, did such a wonderful job of bringing me into Darcy's and Elizabeth's world. I felt like a bystander in the novel witnessing Darcy's Passion....almost like a fly on the wall (if that makes sense). The characters are recognizable and Ms. Berdoll says true to Jane Austen's writing style. With 400 pages, I did find it a bit long, but that does not keep me from giving this book high marks. I buy all of the P&P sequels I can find. This is one of the best. Bravo Ms. Berdoll! When's your next sequel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is awful","review":"This book insults your intelligence. Don't waste your time. I don't know why any reasonable publisher would think Jane Austen fans would appreciate this nonsense. It is basically soft-core porn disguised as a period novel trying to cash in on the success of Austen's P&P.I gave up after a few chapters because you couldn't get through a page without the author interrupting her story with another sexual encounter. It just doesn't fit the genre. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Austen Would Never Have Gone There!","review":"The Bar Sinister is a great romp and just what we were waiting for after the marriage of Darcy and Elizabeth. Pride and Prejudice was a lovely film and I hope they make a movie of this one too. I can just see Colin Firth in this role. In fact, I could see him clearly throughout the book. Berdoll could use a better editor and much better cover art but the story is solid and kept me in a tither for more than three weeks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy continuation of P&P","review":"I agree with the reviewer who suggested the editing could have been better. There is so much character jumping that it is difficult to keep track of which character is saying, doing, feeling, whatever, whenever... but who really cares. The story was great fun.It is somewhat R-rated. The foreward presents a plausible explanation of the authors decision to leave nothing to the imagination. Although the result is a P&P continuation which one might think was co-written by Jackie Collins, it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bar Sinister","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite novels. I love the characters, the plot, and the writing. In this book we have the same characters, the plot is okay, if a little too complicated, but the writing leaves me cold. What this book needs is a better editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe a change of cover.","review":"I think it would have been better if the publishers had put a much different cover on this book. A Fabio-esque Mr Darcy with a scantily clad Elizabeth would have been much more enlightening as to the contents for the first half of the book. Though it does eventually settle down and have a plot, it seems to be singularly lacking in the wit and vivacity demonstrated by Miss Austen in the original. I bought the book because I wanted to see what happened to these people with whom I had become so well acquainted...or at least thought I had. It is an entertaining book, in it's own way, but if it were the first book I had read about these folks, I would not feel any desire to read another.If you are a fan of romance novels as they seem to exist today, with a high sexual content, then you would probably like this book, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted","review":"If anyone hated Jane Austen's P&P, it must be this author. Elizabeth and Darcy are put through hell. It undoes all the beauty of Austen's writing. I was sickened by it. The sex was great but overshadowed by too much trajedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story","review":"I know that it has many spelling mistakes and that the spelling of some of the characters names are wrong or that she has changed the first name of some of the characters but the story is excellent if you can ignore the above, Darcy and Elizabeth are a very loving couple. It gives problems that would have happened in the 1800 such as a still birth and highway men. The love Darcy and Elizabeth have for one another wins through. My only problem was that I couldn't see Georgiana doing what she does in the end of the book, but after six years with Elizabeth she may have learned to have a mind of her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rank it lower if I could","review":"This is an unbelievably poorly-written book. Mispellings, grammatical errors, and incorrect word usage dominate. The sex (talk about ubiquitous - to use an unnecessarily big word, as happens frequently throughout the book) is just plain goofy. It has absolutely nothing to do with Pride and Prejudice, aside from use of the novel's characters and settings - misspelled, of course.One unexpected bonus was its value as comic relief. Since I purchased the book nearly a year ago, I've lent it to four or five friends. We've all enjoyed a good giggle over it and marveled at how such a terrible book got published."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bar Sinister","review":"Although this book uses the names of Jane Austen's characters (some spelled wrongly) it is soft pornography and explicit about all sorts of, normally unmentioned, bodily functions. At best it is unnecessary. Poor Jane Austen will turn in her grave. I cannot imagine why anyone wants to write all this muck."},{"rating":"1","title":"mis marketing","review":"The book is a great read, but I am upset, nay angry that Amazon nowhere made clear that it is exactly the same book as \\"Mr. Darcy takes a wife\\" Instead it is marketed by Amazon as: people who bought \\"Bar Sinister\\" also bought \\"Mr. Darcy took a wife\\".I have bought loads at Amazone and am frankly miffed at the,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny and an eye opener","review":"I have read this book 5 times and although it is not an Jane Austin, its still good to see writers are not afraid to try some new ideas and techniques to INTEREST us. This is probably far from what would of happened in 'Jane Austin World' but this is definitely a page turner and I literally laughed out loud at some of the things which were DONE and SAID. If you are not already ordering this book now another inducement is that if you love \\"Mr. Darcy\\" this book will definitely make you smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good except it's not the best","review":"this book was pretty good because it showed that Darcy and Lizzy really loved each other in my oppion. I hated Bingly because he didnt care about Jane. I also hated that the author mispelled Elizabeth's name. But all in all it was pretty intersting cause i finished reading the book in 2 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comprehensive, not the best.","review":"As an art historian in medieval art I would suggest this book if you are looking for a work that is more detailed than the all-encompassing art historical books on Western Art. However, its content is quite dense, almost cramped, in its attempt to cover so many art objects in such a brief manner. Consequently, the writing can be quite dry and hard to follow. If one is searching for a work that has a more leisurely pace but is just as informative, I would suggest the work by James Snyder of the same title. Its more lengthy, but far more detailed and focused on particular objects--a good basic text for the novice or professional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Sifter..","review":"This is classic Trek.I remember reading this sooo long ago when it first came out.I cannot heap enough praise for this book!Others have mentioned 'Mind Sifter'..possibly the most powerful Star Trek story since 'City on the edge of forever'I never forgot it and it did the unthinkable...it brought me to tears.Other Trek books to get along with this one, are 'The fate of the Phoenix' and 'The price of the Phoenix',strong stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent history...","review":"I think that Keri did a great job in this movie.

Kerri Russell did a wonderful job as Livy, learning to love the land and Skeet. Mare Winningham is always outstanding. I thought this movie was great. I have watched the DVD at least a dozen times.

I don't usually watch these types of dramas but I'm hooked on this one and now it appears I won't be seeing any more.Completely and udderly PO'D,jadesky"},{"rating":"2","title":"Summerland ALL SEASONS","review":"Summerland is the best show ever, and I really hope that all of the seasons will be put on DVD, I know I will buy all of them.

I know I will be very upset because when I first saw Summerland it was truly the best day of my!!! But now a few moments later it's all gone like a wonderful dream that soon just blows away when you wake up!! But unlike a dream Summerland might not ever come back and that so totally sucks that there will be no more Summerland. So they should sell the every season of Summerland on DVDs so all of the Jesse McCartney fans can always see him over and over again though it might not have the same magic as seeing it on the TV for the first time but it's still something special anyway!!!

The jersey was a holiday gift. His father is a Giants fan, and my nephew dedicates the fall and winter to the New York Football Giants, especially Eli Manning, his favorite player. The Reebok jersey made this young man so happy that his reaction caused everyone in the room when he opened this gift to pause.The jersey looks authentic; it's composed of good material, and it fits as if tailored for him. I had to ask the company to exchange my original purchase for a larger size, and they met my request with speed and efficiency. The product is solid, the company is customer-centered, and my nephew wears the jersey no matter what the temperature is. I would purchase anything from this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calendula","review":"This works well for helping skin irritations.

I'm not sure if it's the hypnosis that gets me or that ideas that Rose suggests, but I did get better. I still listen to it from time to time when I'm struggling. The major difference that I can feel is that bad thoughts don't stay in my head, and somehow they are blocked quickly so I just leave them alone and not keep thinking about them over and over (which is quite common for people with minor stress/depression problems). I've spent a bunch of money on stuff like this, and this is the few that actually works. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd really delivers what it promises","review":"This self-hypnosis c.d. is a very relaxing way to bolster your self-esteem. Melissa Rose's voice is very soothing and her guided journey can help open up paths you may never have known were available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost, but not quite...","review":"The first track is an explaination of how to use the second, nothing terribly unusual. The second track is a guided imagery relaxation and self-esteem exercise. I found Ms. Rose's voice, pacing, inflection, and progression very relaxing and easy to use - except for some phrasing and word choice that was jarring to my ears; \\"valley girl\\" speak if you will. This sounds so out of place on this CD that it could limit it's usefulness to you if it bothers you as it does me. I would gladly buy a CD by Ms. Rose that was more carefully scripted."},{"rating":"2","title":"overcoming obstacles","review":"i've never believed in self hypnosis, but this cd made a believer out of me. ms roses' voice is very soothing, and yet authoratative. she made me believe that i could overcome all of the obstacles in my life . this cd is definitely a good buy, and will be on my daily listening list for many months to come. i can't wait for more work by ms rose."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"i agree w/the other reviewers in that her voice is very relaxing, but i thought the cd would be more about affirmations and she was going on about some healing ray of light and this other bologna. not worth half the money you pay for it. i plan on immediately trading it in at sam goodys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overcouming Obstacles","review":"Don't WASTE your Money on this!!!! She tries to hypno you way way tooo fast. From the start of the CD to the time that she tries to put you under is less then two minutes.

It is ruff and crackly.Denmeister"},{"rating":"1","title":"I chose...poorly","review":"Returned this CD after two weeks. The hypnotherapist tries to get you into a deep sleep way too early. Then the images she uses are disjointed. You're in a library, for example, then you look down at you feet, and suddenly you're on a mountaintop! What?? I was just in a library! And how is a mountaintop relaxing? It's freezing up there! So you try to adapt - but then all of the sudden, you're on a beach! Forget it. And she makes references to a baby - which is NOT at all relaxing. Kids stress me out. I was too jarred and uncomfortable. This CD harmed more than it helped.

I would recommend this video to all beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe yoga","review":"I hope there is something wrong with this vod. Specifically, Sybel starts the practice with poses that most often are used as part of a cool down process: bridge pose, plow, and pigeon, to name a few.As the other 1 star reviews have said, Sybel's practice is disjointed and confusing, with very little prep or breathing leading into or during each pose. When I go to a yoga class the instructor typically spends 2 minutes in pigeon. Sybel spent at most 20 seconds.She unsafely moved in and out of poses without instruction on breathing or any amount of set-up. A beginner could definitely injure themselves easily.But honestly, I suggest avoiding this altogether, regardless of your level or ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for someone who mainly focuses on weights!","review":"I really enjoyed this type of yoga since the foundation of my workouts are mostly weights...

There have only been a handful of musicians that have impressed me. Oscar Lopez is one of them. I bought this album a couple of years ago...along with others like Jesse Cook and Ottmar. This album is an incredible piece of work. I play this album over and over and find new riffs that I discover. The music penetrates your soul and is addicting. All of the songs are excellent. My favorites are; Baila, Baila, Cerca de Ti, Corrientes, Gentle Seduction, and Mulata. I highly recommend this album...it is well worth a listen but once you hear it, you'll get hooked, Oscar is so passionate in his playing, you can almost see him play the guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Senor Lopez' best album; give him a \\"B\\"","review":"Whenever I feel my emotional prowess waning, \\"The Flavor\\" brings me charging back.

Well, Oscar, don't quit your day job as a guitarist.I've spent money on this stuff and here is want I have learned. The heirarchy of this genre': (1) Jesse Cook, good variety, particularly his double album, (2) Lopez \\"Seduction\\", (3) Ottmar Liebert fun, but after a while it all sounds alike, (4) Armik, much flashy technique, but little soul or depth.

I bought the Blue one and I had people ask about it when I want to doctor appointments - I probably helped sell two or three. It really is pretty and it was such a help in my healing. I was able to get around and felt so much more mobile. I like that it was so stable, well-made, adjustable for height and had a seat with a padded back rest so I could rest when I needed to. The basket was nice and useful. I think the price was reasonable for such a well-crafted unit. If you have to use one of these things, get this one - it's terrific.

I used them several times on my trip to the Caribbean and they worked great.

Excellent value."},{"rating":"2","title":"very comfortable fins","review":"As other reviewers have stated, these fins are a little more flexible than other fins I have used in the past.

The foot fit well, but the fins bent right below the foot. My friends watched as I kicked under water and saw them bending rather than propelling me forward.

I sacrificed for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Chinese have small feet?","review":"I have had very good experience with US Divers' products in the past.I don't know how significant it is that these fins are the first I have owned that fit like shoes rather than by a strap behind the heel. However that may be, the X-Large fins are advertised for mens' sizes 10-13. My size is 12, so I felt safe being right in the middle.Getting these suckers on is an incredible struggle. I cannot believe how hard it is and I regret the purchase. When I finally get them on, they work OK, although they do not have as much power as my previous US Divers' fins.

I had no problems with the seller of this item infact he went over and beyond what was required as a seller to resolve a situation that i consider now a product problem and not a vendor problem. The main problem is that the backup battery ( the internal battery) fails after a certain amount of time. This has happened on 3 different x3s so it is not a fluke. When the backup battery fails and u remove the main battery to switch it out, all your data and items will be lost. If i were the next buyer i would not reccommend the x3 instead get the x51 which has no backup battery. The product will work as intended when the battery is left in and never removed or let expire.

Unfortunately this song is lost on one of the worst albums of our time.The group has talent, unfortunately I think they will be a one-hit wonder, lost in no mans land of VH1s \\"Where Are They Now?\\".If you like this song, just buy the single. Because from MTVs heavy rotation of the video, you think they are a group that is borderline rap/pop, but once you see their album cover you will know they are a heavy dark rock band, that somehow got a song with rhythm, hooks and great beats.Word to Crazy Town (horrible name for a band)take the money and run with \\"Butterfly\\", re-organize, soften your sound and hire a good graphic designer for your album covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I hear Butterfly one more time....","review":"This is so annoying. The song and lyrics are good, but Crazy Town wrecked it with their annoying voices. And then the radio got hold of it, and it played it 10 times in 1 hour and it annoyed the heck out of me. It got so boring. Every time it came on, I just switched the station (although there was no station that wasn't playing this song, so I turned my radio off altogether.) I mean, after a few months you'd think this would be all played out and they'd quit playing it, but not this. If that many people like Butterfly, just buy it.

You push that one radio friendly song you have on your album so much that everyone with any taste in music simply regrets buying your album before you got \\"famous\\".Crazytown started off with 2 great singles, Toxic and Darkside, but I never once seen a video for them or heard either song on the radio. But I when I heard my 10 year old sister singing along with Butterfly which was blaring out of a radio set on our local Top 40 station I knew that they had thrown out all the credibility they had earned before that career crushing single.Hope Crazytown enjoys their 15 minutes of Top 40 fame.

From the repetitive and predictable distorted guitar riffs to Tal keeping in the lower octaves of his vocals, I was not getting into the music. Not to mention, all of the tracks are overproduced and layered in too many intramental tracks.

I recently purchased this movie on VHS and I have to say that I was amazed about the performance that Joan delivers here. Her usually over the top dramatic acting is toned down a lot. Yet it gives you a cold shiver when you see her running that house. The calculating moves she pulls off to keep her life the way it is are revolting and evil. One can only feel sorry for her, since she alienates everyone and everything around her by doing so. I personally feel that this movie was one of her best performances. Yet it seems to be little known.Although when you watch Mommie Dearest you'll understand where they got their material from.

At this point since I needed the costume that week, I called and requested the belt to be shipped which they did. I would not get a costume from this vendor unless you plan to get something damaged, It looks to me that they store their costumes in hot storage areas causing the colors to bleed example the boot covers.

I may need to pin it slightly at the back (covered by cape) just to insure no slippage. The whole outfit is VERY shiny but looks the part. The belt, cape, wrist bands and headband are flimsy but fun...you are really paying for the dress. I bought separate boots like the ones the model is wearing (you can get them on Amazon for $30) The boot tops that come with the costume are more like cheap legwarmers. I also got an official WW wig on Amazon for $25.

The medium, which fits a 10-14, actually fit me really really well. My torso is short and my legs are long so if you are the reverse proportions, it may fit differently. The skirt is short but not booty-short short, it covers enough and went down to mid-thigh. I tried this on at a party store before buying so I had the benefit of that try-on. The bustier is a velvety material with light boning/shape. Without a bra, my 40-C's actually stayed up (I know, never happens). The accessories are cute, cheaper quality but what do you expect. All I need is my Lasso of Truth (sold separately--why?) and I'm ready to go. Have NOT tried the boot toppers on yet but they looked OK--will report back after my party. Not a plastic costume, it's actual fabric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs bigger than the normal \\"big\\"","review":"I ordered this in a medium after reading the reviews to but smaller. I'm 5'3 and 155 and was initially going to get a large. The medium is still too big! I will have to have the top altered. The skirt is longer than what I expected but I'm OK with that since I'm a mom and this is what my son picked out for me to wear on Halloween (he's flash, his brother superman, and his dad green lantern). However the skirt also has too much fabric and is bulky and frumpy looking. If I was going to be wearing this \\"out out\\" I would recommend buying the nice boots. The covers are hideous but they'll due for simple trick or treating. So if your normally a Large, I'd buy a Small!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great costume","review":"Loved this costume.

But alas I have something that is too big for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"I bought this to cannibalize for parts to go with another costume.

It tells the history of the Maya and Aztec in a very interesting fashion, from the discovery by the Spanish backward in time. This however, is confusing for those not familiar with the timelines of these cultures and I found it bothersome. Even so, I thought it was a great presentation, especially the computer animations of how these mavelous cities must have appeared at their peak. The many incredible shots of ruins, the story of how they were rediscovered in the 19th century by explorers, and great computer animations make this a great video for the entire family. We purchased this as a Christmas present and have watched it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"The second book I've read that has started dispelling my perception of the CIA as a cloak and dagger \\"spies killing each other\\" organisation.

I read another book that cris-crossed on a subject that the author implicates the CIA. The book I read (The Killing of Pablo (Escobar)) doesn't back up this author's point of view regarding why the CIA/Government was invloved and who really killed Pablo. If I don't believe his \\"take\\" on this subject then I can't believe much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"substitute soy","review":"I bought the book because of all the great reviews.

This is an emotionally charged collection of work. Often unrefined and certainly unbound by convention it offers a diverse, honest and powerful alternative to mainstream short stories that I feel are often sterile and predictable. I read this book as part of a class assignment. It is one book I won't resell after graduation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I admit it, I can listen to this guy talk for hours. While I prefer his live presentations this book does a great job of capturing his deeper philosophical beliefs and emphasis on character being the total value of a man.

The pictures are gorgeous, the unusual animals are beautiful and interesting and the simple story is alot of fun! I enjoy how the story builds up and then brings itself back around to a similar place from which it had begun. I love the frog's spanish text. I didn't think it was confusing at all as one editorial reviewer mentioned above. I am buying another copy as a Christmas present for my 8 year old niece. If your child is interested in animals and forests, as mine is, I'm sure he/she will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent quality","review":"Waterloo has a large selection of toolbox sizes, this one was perfect for my wood turning tools.

This book leaves a lot to be desired. Examples are not completely developed. The author skips steps and simplifications leading to hours of trying to figure out what the author is doing and where equations come from. The tone of the author is arrogant, assuming everyone will understand his incompletely developed ideas. Publishing is sub-par with ink spots and pencil marks throughout. Stick with a more completely developed textbook for a class; it'll be well worth the couple dollars more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful, changes your perspective on the world","review":"I first learned about this book while looking at www.peakoil.com This is a very interesting and well documented perspective on circumstances and events surrounding all the many wars that have been fought around govt and business needs for oil. Explains the '73 and '79 oil shocks in a way that I haven't seen described yet. Makes you ask, how much of what we see in the news has already been orchestrated by the United States and it's need to dominate the rest of the world?The only reason I didn't give this book a 5 stars is that i feel that the description of \\"the Corn Laws\\" in britain could have been better described. I'm still a little confused as to exactly what they are. Otherwise it's fairly easily readable for the average joe or janet to decipher."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time","review":"I find it odd that some of the reviews here praise the book for being well-documented, because in the 60 or so pages I've read so far it has no documentation or support whatsoever for some pretty wild claims. I had high hopes when I picked this up at the library because it is an interesting topic, but now I find it impossible to take it seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read","review":"Fascinating reading. An interesting slant on the oil-driven geopolitics. Argumentative enough. Loved every page of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real eye-opener","review":"This is a must for anyone that is interested in geo-politics and wants to know why things might happen in the way they do. Buy, and read twice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"While Engdahl has an impressive grasp of wider geopolitics, be warned. His conclusions can be extrememly flaky to say the least, and are rarely backed up by the facts he presents.President Harding was assainated by British spies working for Shell...interesting, or occupation of the Ruhr and the subsequent hyperinflation of the Weimar republic (as a result of plots by british spies, if you believe his heavy implications) was \\"a horror to which few nations before or since have been subjected\\". Coming from a german i find that a bit rich.Conspiracies theories abound. If you're looking for a fresh take on the subject of oil's role in world politics, then there are interesting themes to independently pursue, but take it all with a hefty pinch of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and emotional!","review":"I just got this CD as a birthday gift, just today. I have also seen the entire Haibane-Renmei DVD series! The music on the DVD series, and on the CD, is beautiful and emotional. I don't know why, but some of the songs bring me close to crying (and I don't cry easily!). I will cherish this CD, and listen to it many times!

Interesing that there are so many used and new for sale (just gives you more of a reason to check them out if their stuff is going so cheap)"},{"rating":"2","title":"so good","review":"These guys may come across as just another emo-core/indie rock band, but they're all much more advanced than the average emo/indie band. They've all been in the music business since the 80's and it shows in United By Fate. The best tracks are UNDERCOVER'S ON, TRAVEL BY TELEPHONE and EVERYTHING HAS ITS POINT.Sometimes when I listen to a lot of emo-core/indie rock bands, they all kinda sound like the same thing after a while, but not these guys. TRAVEL BY TELEPHONE has a pretty unique guitar riff in it that I've never heard anywhere else. And another thing that's great about it is that it appeals to people who like rock in general, people who like indie rock, and just about any other form of the genre.It's too bad that something so good was so overlooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quicksand-lite","review":"Walter Schreifels has abandoned the metal/post-hardcore hybrid Quicksand pioneered in favor of heartfelt ballads and mid-tempo alternative rock. His latest project, Rival Schools, has more in common with limp-wristed emo kids Jimmy Eat World than with peers such as Jawbox or Helmet. If you like your music sanitized, weepy and bland, then \\"United By Fate\\" should provide a satisfying listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste your money elsewhere","review":"Those of you who think this is the next evolutionary step for Quicksand listen to too much Creed. This album is just plain bad, and for that reason alone it surprises me that I haven't heard it on the radio. Rival Schools sounds like everyone else that is trying so hard to sell records that they became oblivious to the concept of writing decent songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"You could write this book","review":"The theme is low-cost style and, sure enough, the ten houses featured, many if not most of them renovations, show some examples of this.

There's very little information in here, and what there is reveals only a vague understanding of how houses are built and what things cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just pictures- no practical advice.","review":"Don't expect any practical advice from this book on how to limit your building costs.

(We had reviewed this product on line and saw the one drawback was some \\"noise\\" associated with the operation of the fan.) We mounted it on the wall (primarily) and on the side of our cabinet. It went up solidly - which was my main concern. To my surprise, the fan is much quieter than expected. The Stainless steel looks much more expensive than it actually was. Mounted according to directions puts the not so attractive off-set light (and cover) out of sight.

Then, she suggests understanding the reasons (R) for the conflict and the different conflict styles that might be used in dealing with it. The last step is and using the intuition (I) to come up with alternatives to choose the best approach. This book is well written in a clear, easy-to-understand style. The illustrations, charts, and fill-in-the-blank questions are especially helpful in showing how to apply the model in your own organization.

Although, audiophiles know some of them, the great record buying masses do not. Growing up, Alice Babs, Monica Zetterlund and others were played around the house.This recording is phenominal. I have heard this on LP many years ago,and the sound of this Japanese import is outstanding. Monica truly has an angelic voice. More Billy than Ella. More earthy than Alice Babs. Bill Evans truly is in fine form and the two of them have a beautiful symbiotic musical relationship, where they flow together and drive each other farther.

The plot is a bit predictable and for some a bit disturbing in the wake of 9/11 (which caused a year's delay in the movie's release). Still dispite it predictability there is some things worth the time. If you like the action adventure type movies this is one you should check out. If you are fans of the forementione Lando and Estes definately check it out. If your into the strong willed heroine who doesn't need a man to save her, she can save herself, this one is for you. Because Lando and Estes have quite a leading lady working with them in Actress Rachel Blakely (of the syndicated series The Lost World). Blakely is definately an untapped treasure, not only is she attractive, sexy and a talented actress, but she can whip ass in a long gown and high heels. Is this a Bond Girl in the making or what? Blakely alone makes this movie worth checking out, of course Lando and Estes don't hurt either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachel Blakely does it again!","review":"This is a very enjoyable action/adventure story.

I take pity with the poor kids (and adults) who buy this kit. I'll stay away from Elenco products and suggest to others they do so as well.

Whether or not this was a stage play before, it does seem now like a musical invented for the cinema. Petula Clark sings a great deal and is very good. As a musical of the period, late 60s, it has some typical qualities. Peter O'Toole won a Golden Globe for this movie and this should indicate to people how good this movie gets at times. I have never really connected with the original 1930s version and always preferred this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"MR. CHIPS","review":"PETER O'TOOLE AT HIS FINEST.

Don't waste your time. Watch instead the original 1939 film with Robert Donat. There were too many great films made in 1939 to even list, and the Donat film is one of them. This remake with Peter O'Toole is a musical (actually a slap in the face to MGM musicals) and does not even follow the original story too closely. I tried to keep an open mind - I love musicals - but had to turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travesty","review":"Despite the wonderful presence of Petula Clark and Peter O'Toole, and some other good actors,it is hard to know how to condemn this misbegotten venture in terms sufficiently contemptuous. It is possible for a musical to transform its source while still respecting it, and create a genuine new work -- West Side Story may be the best example. Too often, the outcome is a bastard hybrid whose very cheapness of imagination dishonors the original. Hilton's original story (and Donat's film) will not be damaged by this travesty. But any concept of good taste gets mortally wounded. Terence Rattigan wrote the script. Whatever the size of his fee, he should have known better. The music merits no comment whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment","review":"After having watched the original Goodbye Mr Chips with Robert Donat, and having seen the two later versions of the film, both do no justice at all to the power and the emotion of the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF MY FAVORITES","review":"Ive been waiting such a long time for this movie to come out on dvd.

The original story is superb; a point both Martin Clunes and Robert Donat have proved, beyond any doubt, with their magnificent versions.Michael Redgrave struggled to be adequate, while Petula Clark was so far out of her depth that she could be said to have drowned - horribly!No! Someone made a huge mistake, when they thought this version would succeed. It FAILED MISERABLY! I have given it ONE STAR, for O'Toole's 'guts' in attempting to sing!

Raboteau, America's foremost scholar on African American religious history, weaves copious first-hand quotations with insightful, riveting commentary to provide a tremendous foundation for understanding Christianity among the enslaved African Americas.Chapter after chapter, \\"Slave Religion\\" opens deeper and deeper layers of understanding. As you read, you sense Raboteau transporting you back directly into the historical experiences. His writing is so thoroughly researched as well as so adeptly penned, that scholar, student, and lay reader alike can equally enjoy and benefit from it.

The book is based on Theroux's life and you're not sure how much of it is his personal history and how much of it is fiction. It is an epic journey following him from his Irish, Catholic upbringing in Boston to his years in Africa and then in London. With thirty plus years of avid reading behind me, this book is definitely on my all time 10 best list, and towards the top of the list.Another Paul Theroux book that you should not miss is Milroy the Magician. Fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two of Everything: A conceit worth exploring","review":"As always, the writing is exceptional. The conceit (two of everything) is interesting, but not always believable. The plot, while provacative, fails to measure up to other works by Theroux, most notably The Elephanta Suite, which I loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting semi-autobigraphical (??) account of life","review":"Finally examines the ultimately therapeutic relationship Theroux finds in writing itself as a way to save him from his own romantic immaturity, hypocrisy and later self-indulgence.The real teaser here is exactly how close to his actual life the book is. It would be interesting to find books about himby others to make a decision. Well written and entertaining as usual, this bookdelivers on the jacket note claims and critical quotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"People are always putting on airs... and Theroux just proves it by taking a worldy traveler and showing that he's no better than the rest of us. Full of sex, stupidity and inner reflection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, disappointing","review":"Theroux is good with words, and the first section, dealing with the semi-autobiographical narrator's youth, is a satisfying read. Then the protagonist grows up. He becomes a dull, selfish, philanderer, and the tone of the writing itself seems more plodding as well. Theroux's narrator is a womanizer, which is forgiveable, but unfortunately he's also a supercilious bore, which is not. The book carries no urgency, and there are better examples of the detached, clinical wife-cheater to be had. V.S. Naipul makes a promising psuedonymous cameo, but qucikly disappears back into the oatmeal-prose. Yawn. William Vollman covers the same ground with more skill, and dare I say it, heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deeply insightful journey through youth, love, and Africa.","review":"This book is very well written. It contains wonderful detailsof travels through Africa and India, and the characters areutterly convincing. Mr. Theroux explores the realms of love,sex, and committment with a unique coupling of journeys todistant and sometimes exotic countries.

But wait, how did they fit 18 Bowie songs on a single CD? Most of his tunes, the good ones in particular are over six minutes long, right? Easy, butcher them. You know, cut out the long saxaphone rifts in the middle of Young Americans (I thought my CD player was skipping the first time), the end of Heroes.

Why would they go to all the trouble of gathering so much good music, but then chop the songs up? When I heard these new \\"Best of...\\" CDs were out and saw the track listings, I felt better about the whole mess, and I bought this one. Well, Virgin is apparently taking a cue from Rykodisc and including pared-down \\"radio edits\\" which omit essential elements of Bowie's great songs (such as the distorted guitar solo of Young Americans). I hate to break it to these out-of-touch fools, but this is NOT the version the radio stations play! When I saw that the disk contained extra CD-ROM material, I hoped that there would be some pictures/videos/interviews to calm my blood pressure, but it was only an advertisement for his website. Curse all of them. Don't get suckered into buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 ACTUALLY!","review":"I find it funny when people review a compilation cd and criticize it for either not having their favorite songs or for having edited versions of songs. These songs became hits because they were played on the radio. The versions that were played on the radio were edited! I am probably different than most in that I enjoy having an edited version on a compilation, since most of the songs I already have the album version on the album. What does bother me is when obvoius hits are left off in leu of other material or worse just left off leaving 15 or 20 minutes of space on a cd that could have been filled! Look at The Police, Synchronicity II, Secret Journey and So Lonely were all singles and left off of most compilations of theirs. My ownly complaint about this particular compilation is that of another reviewer in that it did not go up to 1980 and include songs from Scary Monsters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the arbitrary cut-off date?","review":"It wouldn't have killed the record company to extend this into a six-year retrospective - 1974-1980, which would then have included songs from what is arguably Bowie's greatest album, 'Scary Monsters and Super Creeps'. What you're left with instead is a severely butchered selection - and a fairly predictable one at that. (There's considerable overlap with 'Changes2Bowie' and other compilations - but, hey, when you're just out to make money, stick to what works!) This artist deserves a more thoughtful, better presented retrospective of his most fertile and influential period, especially as he has now ceased to make worthwhile music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best of david Bowie 1974-79","review":"These songs are not his best during the period.

I bought this thinking I would get complete unedited songs but all this has is severely cut songs and a promo for his website.

Software and drivers are horrible - initial install bluescreened W2K. Reinstalled and was somehow able to get up and running. Printing anything other than draft mode was horribly slow - a normal color page took ~ 2.5 mins. During printing an annoying status window would come up to show print progress which was inevitably slow (for long periods it would just sit there, progress bar at zero). Occasionally the printer just hung, had to power cycle it before it would print again. PC would also sporadically bluescreen. Upgraded to W2K SP2 - no difference.

There is no power button on the unit, and it never went to sleep -- the scanner light was always on. Finally, technical support was very poor.We ended up taking the first unit back, hoping to correct the noise and not going to sleep problems, but the next unit was still plagued with these problems.

It lets the doctor step out of her bedside manner role. \\"Bloodlines\\" not only provides good background for the Goa'uld culture; it lets Christopher Judge do more than arch an eyebrow.You'll need to buy the boxed set to get the whole pilot-thru-cliffhanger experience (recommended!), but as a sampler, this one is probably the best example of how the series makes good use of the stargate premise and lets the team members have real dimension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing voice track for Season 1 episode 12","review":"While I love Stargate SG1 and enjoy all the episodes, there is a problem with the 3rd disk from season 1.

Mine became unglued and fell apart from its binding- which made even re-selling this monster impossible.If this book were marketed as \\"A history of Horror Writing\\" it might be much more accurately titled. As it was, there were few tips and just a lot of expostulation- disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest running half back.","review":"This is a great example of Walter Paytons running, power and balance, combined with his ability to run at the tackler and knock them off their balance.a true champion, with excellent comments by walter how to play like a champion.i hope to benefit by using it in australia to demonstrate to myself how an afl player should approach sport mentaly to end up a winner like him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walter Payton Greatest Spor...","review":"This was a great DVD of Walter Payton.

Most of which they would return to their old fighting techniques any way and not use what they were taught(Wing Chun ep. for example).Some of the history of the martial arts they explore is incorrect which is probably the biggest part of why you would watch something like this to begin with is to get some insight into different cultures and their martial arts.I would have to recommend instead of this the 'Kill Arman' series is a better find.Still the 5 days training with a fight at the end. But the guy doesn't know martial arts and has to rely on what he is taught.It shows a much more realistic view of how you would really train at a school and shows a fuller view of the martial art itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good show!","review":"This is a solid DVD set. I have watched most of the episodes now, and was impressed.The guys train boxing in Mexico, Jiu-Jitsu in Brazil with a Gracie camp, Muay Thai, Kali, and Krav Maga to name a few. All of which were highly entertaining. This may not be a \\"how to\\" DVD, but rather a peak inside each of the different styles.I would not advise using these as training DVDs, as some of the stuff they do is pretty brutal, and I'm thinking this was done for entertainment purposes. Thats not to say that this is all fake, I believe what they were doing, and even use some of the things I saw in my training, but my advice is not to beat training partners into a pulp everyday!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ick","review":"This isn't even good for children.

If the natives can cast such powerful spells then why on earth is Tarzan needed?(3) Flat characters All of the characters are one-dimensional, and deliver their lines accordingly(4) Unconvincing actionFrom obviously-costumed gorillas suffering from \\"bad hair\\" days to unappealing chimps and strange editing decisions, this is a lesson on how NOT to make a movie.I normally do not dissect movies but this time the story was so poor that I had nothing better to do.

Hollywood must really be a crazy place if someone thinks this guy can act or carry any picture.

The scenery was beautiful, but except for the villian, the rest of this movie was a real downer. The biggest drawback is Casper Von Dien. He looked like a teenage boy wearing his Dad's loincloth. Jane wore one of the most lacklustre costumes of any female lead in the Tarzan movies. Yuccky slacks and a white blouse and that's supposed to be a heroine's costume?Tarzanis supposed to be heroic, bigger-than-life, a knockout torso! Casper should have waited and played Bomba, the Jungle Boy or wait for a remake where he could play Boy. He never struck me as any kind of a Lord of the Jungle. Maybe Lord of Baywatch. Give me Buster Crabbe anyday, the greatest looking of all Tarzans. OR even Johnny Weismuller in his early Tarzan films before he developed that spare tire around his once beautiful waist. This would be good for kids--but for adults, wanting an hour or more of fantasizing about Tarzan and the Jungle, this one is a real dud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Schlock!","review":"Tarzan And The Lost City is a film that should never have been made, much less released. Sure the lead actor is handsome and built, and the leading lady is photogenic, but both never reached their potential in this parody--which I attribute to bad direction and uninspired script writers. He can't act, and she was totally vacuous. Only the villan was believable (aren't they all?) and while the shots of what 'may have been' the African scenery were OK, the rest of the film STANK. The action scenes looked contrived, the emotional content pure vanilla, and the wild animals were all too tame to be even the least bit threatening. AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS!!!

This very weak and plotless spy film centers on the chase of a Thai prostitute who unwillingly gets stuck with a biological weapon. The chase leads the viewers through strip clubs, kinky massage parlors and mud wrestling pits of what we are supposed to believe is Bangkok. However, the Asians in the film are not Thai. Some are Vietnamese and one is Caucasian made to look what Rollins must believe to be Thai. The action scenes are also absurdly unrealistic and the entire film is one pointless scene after another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"My 8 yr old son is a big fan of the Magnetix Products. He saw the Magnetix MagnaWorld Series in a local Toys R Us and begged for it for Christmas. We purchased the Skyscraper Series and the City Series. It is such a huge disappointment!! It is extremely difficult to manipulate. It is only magnetized on the bottoms and tops of the walls- not on the sides- making it virtually impossible to build any of the models (unless you are an octopus). Even my very adept husband found it frustrating when trying to help. Magnetix, in general, are way too pricey but I definitely would NOT recommend the \\"MagnaWorld\\" line to anyone.

So much of this was me. The denial of the parents, the love for someone in the closet, and fear and what it takes to make it threw what most can and will go threw or has. In more then one way this was me for a long time and only when I came out did it clear up but this definitely sums it up for the \\"before\\" events in my life. I recommend this to anyone, mainly parents etc that would like to know what I teen can really go threw in all of the years they have no choice but to wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent and a winner all the way","review":"Congratulations to everyone involved with Get Real. A superbly realised film which makes me proud to be British. So many good things, but in particular I loved Jacquetta May: as Steven's mother she was amazing, a performance of great subtlety and perception ( see the moment in Steve's bedroom when she realises he is gay ). The scene at the disco with John and Steve looking at each other while dancing with Christina and Linda was as funny as it was heartbreaking. The wistful score by John Lunn is another assett and Ben Silverstone...well what can I say? If there was any justice, he would have been nominated for at least an Oscar for this. Certainly one of the last best films of the 1990's, Get Real is just as perfect as films get. Unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I give this movie 5 stars because....","review":"It is one of the FEW coming of age movies about gays that does not make gay people look like [fools].... (That is, no more so than any straight boy who is in the process of coming of age!) Please pardon the pun, but it is REAL. It is much closer to the real life and times and tribulations of growing up gay than any other movie I have ever seen. I can't say it any better than \\"Steven\\" did during his award acceptance speech in the movie... It's only LOVE, what is everyone so afraid of?\\" Touching, witty, tender, sensitive, intelligent, REAL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeez","review":"I reallllllyyyy liked this movie, but damn what a sad ending, I really wish that they would have made it so they could have been together.

Anyway, other than that devastating ending, it was a great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless High School Jock Fantasy Comes To Screen","review":"There really is not a heck of a lot to praise about this movie. The plot could have been any third-rate teen 'romantic comedy' with a gay twist and of course, some melodrama. (\\"Oh Steven, I'm so scared!\\") - the words of John Dixon, the jockboy fantasy of a more brain Steven Carter. Of course, it turns out John is gay and they have a secret affair. Throw in some more melodrama, some really cheesy gay jokes and failed attempts at 'sexual' scenes, and you have 'Get Real.' Not particularly funny, not particularly romantic, not particularly touching, and definitely not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run-of-the-mill Teenybopper Flick Turns Queer","review":"Dear Director: Get Real! Alright, this movie is probably not the worst one I have ever seen, but it insults your intelligence. Think of your typical bad American teenybopper flick with loads of C-grade acting, no storyline, plenty of pretty faces and some bad comedy, and add a gay twist. Essentially, quiet gay teen gets his fantasies come true when the star of the soccer team gets with him. The dramatic scenes make you feel like laughing out loud, especially the bad gay jokes. The only funny thing to see is Steven fall in love with every man he meets at the toilets. A saving grace is Charlotte Brittain as Linda, Steven's sidekick. Did I mention that Steven and John have no chemistry, to top everything off?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Gay Film for Heteros","review":"It is quite obvious why this film would play well with the straight community & be popular in such backwater places as Valdosta Georgia & Memphis Tennessee. The gay guy ends up by himself except for the fat girl in the role of \\"fag hag\\". I am just surprised that the filmmaker did not have Stephen commit suicide in the last scene. I had to go back and watch \\"Beautiful Thing\\"-especially the last scene-it was like trying to get a bad taste out of my mouth. This is what so many \\"sympathetic\\" straights and \\"understanding\\" people want for the gay population-it is all right to be queer but just do it all by yourself. God forbid that you find someone to love & build a life-long relationship with. A real setback for those of us who want to see more gay positive films in the marketplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing","review":"I seem to be in the minority here--Most everyone else who reviewed this film absolutly loved it. I personally found the story...rather tedious. It is a classic example of a movie that should have been good but wasn't. I found the main character nearly impossible to like. I mean I sympathize with him to an extent in that he can't be with the person he loves, but that is no excuse to act like a little jerk to everyone. He spends the entire movie with a very put upon, the-world-hates-me-so-I-hate-the-world attitude and is generally very unpleasant to everyone in a ten block radius. When he's not having sex with strange men in public toilets that is. My overall recommendation about this film...don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite films....","review":"This is a movie that almost anyone can identify with. It's about 2 high school boys who find they have strong feelings for each other. The movie shows how difficult it is when the truth remains buried, and how stressful things can be when we we pretend to be something we are not. The cast all portray their characters flawlessly. This is the most satisfying movie I have seen which deals with this subject matter. I wish it had been there for me at an earlier time in my life. This is essential viewing. It generates strength in the face of despair that is applicable in several aspects of life, not just dealing with fear or shame for coming out of the closet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and Inspiring","review":"Watching this movie, as a homosexual, was a profound experience. I honestly cannot describe how much it touched my heart. I think that it's greatest strength as a film was to deal with such a prevelant issue in such a format. Coming out of the closet is a deeply moving and scary thing. I think people who haven't gone through it can't appreciate how hard it is, and they then cast it aside as less than important. I found this film to deal with a real life situation in a way that a lot of closet-cases would love to have it. Two boys meet, they fall in love, what could be more perfect? And then the tragedy as something so nebulous as life comes between them...I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"poignant and true to life","review":"I had seen GET REAL 4 times in the cinema and cried everytime. The DVD had just the same effect on me. The acting is first rate. The story, the coming out of a school boy, is someting every gay man has experienced. This is toped by a wonderful directing all in finesse. A beautifull story treated with the light touch of the best british cinema. Not unlike another masterpiece : My beautiful lauderette. A must for every film lover (gay or straight)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my very favorite movies","review":"I love this movie. It's one of those magical little Brit flicks in which everything just works. It's also one of the very few films that I can watch again and again (with intervals of a few months in between) and still feel the same kind of emotional response.No doubt much of my reaction is personal, and I suspect this movie is pretty much a gay thing. It may even be more specialized than that -- a gay thing for people who aren't American idiots, which would rule out much of the audience for teen-oriented entertainment, as evidenced by a couple of the more vapid reviews in this thread. So be warned if you are (a) straight, (b) stupid, (c) unable to tolerate non-Hollywood fare, or some ungodly combination of the above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm movie about courageous gay youth","review":"Ben Silverstone does a wonderful portrayal of an at first frightened and confused, then courageous gay youth becoming a man. The friendships, the love, the school homophobia, and the family dynamics which develop all feel quite real. Not all sweet and gushy by any means, but at the end it's a feel-good movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love affair, deja vu","review":"I fell in love with this movie and the lead characters. I now live in Los Angeles but grew up in the British culture of New Zealand. I attended a very similar grammar school and my suburb could have been a clone of Basingstoke. Having said that, they film was totally real to me, the contradictions of living in a British culture that can be include supportive teachers and friends on one level but be so homophobic on another. I also had an affair with the school jock and it pained me that I was shunned by him in public. This film transported me back twenty five years, it was compelling. I feel some of the nuances of the film will be missed this side of the Atlantic and the acting seems subdued by American standards but reflects the reserved culture of the British. I felt the characters realistic and compelling. Watch the film with a good friend. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars is not enough","review":"Ben siverstone gives a superb performance.In fact all the actors were wonderful.Don't rent.Buy it.It already a classic.I hope he does another movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart warming love story","review":"I was delighted with this upbeat look at life for an English boy coming to terms with his sexuality and libido. There are some true comic moments and almost all the performances are refreshing and energetic.Fans of \\"Beautiful Thing\\" may like this film. However, I felt the sexual tension between the young geek and the school jock were a bit too campy and their relationship lacked a certain chemistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Got it Real","review":"The most poignant love story since \\"Another Country\\" even without Rupert and Cary.

This is a dvd which has to be sent to every closet case you know in order to give them the courage to be themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much significance for me.","review":"I purchased Get Real from Amazon and it was the first movie that I could ever really relate to. Watching the film had significance for me, and the soundtrack reminds me of all my favorite scenes. If you were thinking about buying this movie because you read a review, buy it. The target audience is adolescents and young adults who have struggled with the coming out process or similar issues.

As an anonymous reviewer, I guarantee it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"This movie has stuck with me for three days now. The content and the ending were amazing. The story line, the characters, and the outcome were all realistic and had a huge impact on me.

So if you want to watch a \\"real\\" movie that truly captures the emotions that all gay teens go through; \\"Get Real\\" is a definite must: gay or straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Delightful","review":"I've never seen a film done better than this one. The stand out acting of Ben Silverstone as a gay adolescent is truly inspirational to aspiring actors, those coming out of the closet, and everyone dealing with their demons-or society's. Based off an amazing play by Patrick Wilde, Get Real is sure to bring at least one smile to your face and a tear to your eye. Simon Shore, Ben Silverstone, Brad Gorton, and Charlotte Brittain I applaud and laud you all."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very nice \\"coming out\\" film by Simon Shore","review":"This small, but lovely, little film is well above average in its telling. It avoids cliche and compels one to really care what happens to these characters. The performances are nothing short of beautiful - particularly the one turned in by Ben Silverstone as Steve. All of the actors in this film exhibit such a quiet elegance and skill that it would be worth a watch on that issue alone. There's a lot more to it than that, though, and I'm looking forward to seeing more work from this talented director, Simon Shore, who obviously has a gift for cinema story telling. This is a wonderfully dignified little film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Real","review":"This is one of the best or perhaps the best gay storyline ever released. What more can I say?

Bright narrative, instantly likeable characters, and a neatly-observed study of a relationship forged under extreme circumstances, this charming movie balances its dramatic momentum with plenty of comic asides, though the narrative has been stripped of the political dimension which informed the stage play on which it's based. Older cynics may groan at some of the more obvious material, but younger viewers will be enchanted. An unqualified success!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"What a wonderful and sensitive depiction of what it means to be gay in high school.

The other record I speak of is Wayne Shorter's Footprints live!. Directions in Music is a much more cerebral record, I believe, than Wayne's--but the emotional content communicates extremely well. And for me, that's what a lot of modern jazz recordings have been missing--emotion. Great technical displays, but nothing behind it. The past month has been great for fans of modern jazz because of these two records.The beauty of this record is incredible and man if Herbie ain't writing a new chapter on how to comp. on piano!

Seems to me most commentary and analysis goes on too long. That was my attraction to this title, but that's not the problem here. Every topic is handled concisely though often not very effectively. The problem here is a twisted central view that produces sheer nuttiness like this books anachronistic take on Freud. I wish I had more time to elaborate, but, suffice it to say, you WILL be disappointed. This book is about a dozen re-writes from something worthwhile, and I wish I'd looked the reference section over a little more rigorously before wasting my money on this tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Oversold, Irritating, Disappointing","review":"Written in an irritatingly flippant style, this book falls far short of its promise. It is poorly organized and indexed which ultimately results in frustrating those wishing to quickly glean succinct information. Instead, it is filled with \\"cleverly\\" written tidbits that more often than not miss the entire point of the subject matter. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Complete\\" Waste of Time","review":"If I had looked further beyond the promising dust jacket I would have noticed that this flippant tome is nothing more than Name Dropping 101. Packed with lists of knowledge that the authors think everyone \\"should\\" know, this book insouciantly prepares those lacking in depth to hobnob with their equally shallow brethren at the next swank cocktail party. Anyone who considers themselves even mildly intelligent should resent being told which scene in Citizen Kane they should claim as their favorite or why they shouldn't overtly admire Andrew Wyeth. A book such as this only contributes to our cultural \\"dumbing-down\\" by assuring that NOBODY really cares enough to know what they are talking about. The blithe conversational snippets of knowledge that Wilson and Jones promote in their book undercut true intellectualism while making the claim that it is fine to be ignorant as long as OTHER PEOPLE think you are smart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else","review":"There are a few good tips in this book--as well as some nicely selected readings to use for vocal variety. However, most of the content is familiar territory; very little of it covers new ground. It's a British book, as well, so perhaps it would feel more useful in the UK than it did to me in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shows why my friends don't like opera","review":"Poor Verdi- this is arguably his most exciting work, but you would never know it from this video, which should have been left in the vaults. The sound quality, staging, lighting, costumes, and sets are all awful. The orchestra is slow and wooden, stodgifying a remarkable score that should be full of inspiring tempo changes and dynamic shifts and instead leaving the principals stranded on stage, waiting for the instruments to make the key transitions. The staging is forced and awkward and the acting not believable. The chorus extras wander about in the dark, horribly dressed and without purpose. The Anvil Chorus is joyless and dark- I didn't even see any anvils! The singing is quite good, esp. by Sutherland (despite her lack of acting), but is hard to enjoy given the other detractions. Probably the best value here is for hardcore Sutherland fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grim and boring","review":"I had to force myself to get through this thing, and it took several days to do it. Not even Sutherland could save this turkey. If you like this opera (and I don't), then I highly recommend this production. Everyone in it was outstanding. I had this on CD with Callas many years ago and wound up chucking it. I hated it. The tenors and Sutherland each and together have a few good moments, but not enough to make a 2 hour and 20 minute opera out of. The mezzo gypsy did her part well (the relief came during the final curtain call when she smiled and then she looked human and beautiful), but I greatly dislike Verdi's mezzo gypsies, and his operas are littered with them. Blood, guts, burnings at the stake, death, torment, Verdi at his finest. All the gypsy woman did was suffer. I read that Sutherland was 60 when she filmed this, and she could still do it. Only she does it better when she's got something to do it with."},{"rating":"1","title":"tsk tsk.....","review":"Another reviewer puts it perfectly. Bad sound, bad sets, bad chorus...oh, and one addition to it all: bad singing from Sutherland. I've never liked Sutherland from 1980 and on; the voice got especially mushy, diction especially poor. Acting is really bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE IS UNIQUE...Ms.Barbra Streisand!!!!!!","review":"Well I've been a hardcore fan of Barbra for over three decades...She is superb...Her voice is just great....and I am very happy there is this new OUTING...TIMELESS...I live in Rio de Janeiro and I believe I'll never have a chance to see her in the flesh...Barbra if you ever read this, be sure of ONE thing!

Barbra definitely withstands the test of time with this cd!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Streisand Performance!!!","review":"Barbra Streisand's Latest release is HOT!!! Performing all her hits from her first recordings to Broadway to movies and duets- this is a collection of her material from the beginning of her career to present day.It's amazing that she sounds better than ever before- the jokes, the songs, the guest singers (like Lauren Frost) and she still sings at that light speed trademark energetic powerhouse style evident in songs like 'Don't Rain on My Parade' to emotive slow ballads like 'Alfie' and 'The Way We Were'...If you missed this truly TIMELESS concert- or her comeback show in 1994, get this CD and relive the magical voice of this evergreen singer.Just one gripe- Barbra's Ego shows up every now and then but then again, that's our Barbra!Something wonderful indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Concert, six years later","review":"Barbra did a concert tour in the mid-90's that people still talk about. Unfortunately, this CD (recorded the eve of the millennium) is almost a replay of the previous one. She does add a lot of different material from her career that she wasn't able to before, but the performance as a whole is not as memorable as her Concert in '94. If you want to buy this album, I would suggest listening to it before the other one. That might help with seeming repetition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ageless and Evergreen","review":"Streisand consistantly amazes. She is in superb voice as she travels on this wonderful journey through time. From early gems (\\"Cry Me A River\\", \\"A Sleeping Bee\\"), her signature songs (\\"Evergreen\\", \\"The Way We Were\\", \\"People\\"), a few top-40 hits (\\"The Main Event\\", a montage of her various duets) and many standards (\\"As Time Goes By\\", \\"Something Wonderful\\"), to name a few, Streisand evokes warm memories and a few tears. More like an original cast recording than a concert recording, this is a \\"must have\\" CD for Streisand fans, theatre fans or anyone who loves great talent. As an added treat, Lauren Frost -- who portrays \\"Young Barbra\\" -- has the vocal prowess to duet convincingly with the diva.Streisand truly is ageless and evergreen..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spend the Millennium again with Barbra","review":"This is the best of the best. It's like being there with Barbra at the New Years Eve concert Dec. 31, 1999. The album makes you smile even as she counts down to the new millennium. You re-live the experience again, the new millennium that is. She sings all her best and more. I have loved Barbra since the early 1960's saw her with Liberace. She takes you back to those memories of those times when the songs first came out and they are Timeless just like this c.d. 2 c.ds included.IT IS AND SHE IS WONDERFUL AND She will always be Timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her Best live work, but worth having.","review":"One wonders why Barbra chose to record for posterity the two millenium eve performances when her song selection and voice was much better during her september shows the following year. Additionally since alot of the concerts theme was germaine to the new year it seems out of place on repeated listenings. All that aside Barbra did choose the best performances from those two millenial nights and has put together a respectable album of live performances. No where near the quality of her Live Forum or The Concert shows, nonetheless she adds enough unique twists on her old material to make it worthwhile. Particularly enjoyable are the older numbers and the huge choirs she employed. The sound quality on this disc is SUPERB and can truly transport you to that night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Has Moved On","review":"I found this very disappointing. I am quite a big fan of her torch songs from the 60s, but she can't sing them now. She relies on the slow low notes and boring songs without any emotion. Her voice has dropped significantly and she talks, talks, talks to cover it up. She can't reach or maintain the high notes and there's no way she could sing a song like 'Free Again' anymore. And the problem is the long high notes, power and emotion were her trade mark. Oddly, her personality has evaporated too - again her ego and wit were a trademark.Quite simply she has left it too long to resume her live performances - she was either too arrogant or scared in the 70s and 80s. Anyone who finds the recordings of the 60s and 70s sends tingles down the spine should avoid. For new fans - stick to the earlier recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"she was better inny","review":"While not her best live album,most of this album recorded on New years Eve 1999, captures her in near or ecxelllent voice, i wish she had taped her new year's eve showm for tv instaedf of jan 1. Shwas in better voice at her first concert"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD TIMELESS CD","review":"Triste, tr��s triste le nouveau CD. Barbra s'arrange pour ne placer aucune hautes notes, se contente de rester dans un registre de notes graves. Le choix des chansons n'est pas tr��s bon, et les notes humoristiques sont plutot lourdes. On est fatigu�� d'entendre toujours les mmes chansons dans ses albums live telles que : people, happy day..., the way we were, evergreen. Barbra retrouve ta voix et offre nous un album aussi bon que Higher Ground. On sait que tu es capable du meilleur depuis longtemps, mais du pire aussi avec ce nouveau CD !"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE EGO HAS LANDED!","review":"First things first...Babs has a great voice and I was lucky enough to see her at Madison Square Garden for her return to live performing and she was spectacular. This CD, however, is a much different story. This is what happens when you become so self involved and your ego grows so much there isn't a solar system big enough to contain it. The performances here seem lazy and uninspired. The \\"theme\\" is so self congratulatory, pretentious and patronizing its shocking. Babs, we are your fans not your subjects. We deserve better."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS CD","review":"I'm sorry. I use to like her but now she's tooooo opinionated!! She thinks she's the savior of the world or something. Writing to top democrats about Bush ( with very negative comments). She's one of the brian-washed liberals that doesn't have a clue what's happening. I almost feel sorry for her, but her millions of dollars changes my mind..."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, Enough, back to work","review":"I've always loved her. My favorite part is the torch though, because she is singing with a quartet. I've always wanted to hear her that way, I don't care for schmalzy arrangements and only tolerate it from Barbra Streisand because I love her singing so much.I know I know she hears all the counterlines in her head blah blah and that's great... but now that her voice is more \\"intimate\\" (re Isn't it a pity?), I would love to hear the mature Streisand re-explore her 60's club material. I'm sorry, few songs written these days are worth her voice.I was especially charmed by the Yentl demos she put on her boxed set a few years back.Jay Ferranti"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Perormance","review":"Yes this CD has a lot of talking in it, but as true Streisand fan will tell you, Barbra's ability to set up her songs with an engaging story is one of the reasons her shows are so entertaining. Barbra's voice is never more thrilling than when it is recorded live, and we are treated to both her huge powerful notes, and her softer silky ones. Highlights include, On a Clear Day, versions of People and Happy Days that are throw backs to their original recordings, and the amazing medly of Papa Can you Hear Me/You'll Never Know/Piece of Sky. Has Streisand voice ever been stronger? Yes, but she's 59 for goodness sake. At least she recognizes her limitations and never sounds strained unlike her contemporaries, Dion, Minelli and Midler. Regardless of your personal opinions of her, this album is amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"People Need Barbra","review":"This is the definitive Streisand cd. If stranded on a desert island, this would be all the music you would need. She is \\"the greatest star\\" and this cd proves it. Barbra is at her best and young Lauren Frost is remarkable. \\"Papa Can You Hear Me\\" sung with Lauren gave me chills. \\"Timeless\\" truly will be timeless. It is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another tired and uninspired collection of very old songs","review":"Do you we really need yet another collection of tired, old songs from Barbra? This CD is just like one of her concert CDs revisited and regurgitated into a messy uninspired collection. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"RETIRE ALREADY!","review":"Barbra again says she will never have a live concert again, that she is retiring.Barbra sings all her classics on this, but with a weaker voice than her earlier years, giving us those forgetful favorites as \\"Somewhere\\", \\"The Main Event\\" and \\"People\\".And to make this CD as irritating as can be, she puts \\"Papa Can You Hear Me?\\" on this from her classic movie \\"Yentl\\".Bar-bra dahling......retire already...I am sure you will be doing another concert in 10 years tops.I say buy Celine Dion if you want a voice and a personality of someone who is a \\"real person\\".And a final note the music is lost in the \\"LIVE\\" setting giving us droned out versions of what we already have on previous albums....basically this is just a (...) of what Barbra has already sung, but with a weaker voice, and mediocre production.I say buy her older CDs with a stronger voice and better production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Value","review":"Best bang for your buck.

All the accomplishments and downfalls of Wilson are noted. What the author does leave the reader wondering is first who exactly is this complicated yet modest man, which may be of no fault of his own.

Im an unabashed fan of most anything that David Lowery puts his hands to, there's just something missing here.The album is LONG. Worse yet, it feels long. Almost an hour, and it lacks sustainable charm. Standouts include: \\"My Life Is Totally Boring Without You\\" and \\"Waiting For You Girl\\", both possessing sly wit and laconic delivery that is signature for Lowery. There's a few other things to tap your foot to, but this is the wrong entry point to Cracker, I really don't think this shows off their smart, infectious rock talent at all.

I am surprised this is as good as I remember--actually better than I remember! The interplay on the guitars is exciting. Winter dominates the CD--even when he plays rhythm guitar. He truly is a talent of great magnitude. The band, Derringer and company (And), are tasteful and solid. They provide an excellent base for Winter to build on. I saw Winter's rock 'n roll panned by Docendo--the blues reviewer guy--and I understand his purity for the blues. For me though, if an artist can play in more than one style and be as expressive and skilled as Winter, and if it moves me, then I'm sold. Winter can play slide steel guitar, electric blues or rock 'n roll and I'm there listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nana","review":"great way to store spices in a small space.

Children (and even adults) will learn all kinds of things about what's beneath a modern city. I enjoyed showing my son the illustrations and explaining what it all means. Do beware, however, that this is a pretty abstract topic and that it can be difficult for younger kids to fully comprehend exactly what's going on. After all, thinking about what a city would like like with all the soil and rock removed and from many feet below street level is not a simple idea. So this one is probably best for older kids, as opposed to earlier works by Macaulay such as Cathedral or Castle that are much more tangible and easy for kids to comprehend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Disappointing","review":"Rather disappointed - expected something more child friendly - more like the how it works series - would've sent it back but the postage is more than the cost of the book.

OK. There is anything like Depeche Mode here, only the singers voice who in a very succesful way sings like Dave Gahan. But who said that moody or dark synth pop has to be dull and plain? Depeche Mode may have some moody and dark songs but all of those songs have a good melody, that's why Depeche Mode is such a great band. Just think of this album like the worst moments of Camouflage. Many Camouflage songs sound to me like dull and boring songs too without any melodies but they have also very good songs. In this album there is no highlight, all the songs sound the same and they have a thing in common: lack of melodies. I couldn't even hear this album once I just quit it. Maybe if you hear this album from another perspective you could like it but with a reference like a Depeche Mode sound a like you will certainly be QUITE DISAPPOINTED."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best musical movies we own.","review":"My kids and nieces LOVE this movie!

Like eighty-five percent of Don Bluth's movies it features extraneous story development, grotesque character designs and the worst songs in the history of the animated musical. Anyone who lists it as more than two stars needs to have a drug test. But, if you enjoy watching an animated film on the level of a movie from USA Up-All-Night(circa 1988) then this is the animated movie for you. You have to Bluth some credit though, anyone who would try to turn the classic story of Chanticleer into an Elvis Musical has balls, too bad his weren't big enough to pull it off successfully, \\"Rock-A-Doodle\\" is the beginning(and the best) of a downward spiral of Don Bluth's movies into the depth of B-movie oblivion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A confusing movie","review":"I rented this movie awhile back for the kids I babysit for.

Quincy M.E. was originally part of a rotation series that network NBC television had added to its weekly Mystery Movie Series. Later, due to the popularity of the ratings and the high quality of emotional drama and on-screen acting, the series was spun off and developed into a full network series which ran for seven years from 1976 through 1983.To learn more about the series, its cast, the Quincy FAQ, Episode Bible, and community forum, visit the The Quincy Examiner, Original home to fans of Quincy M.E. by clicking the support links that follow.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quincy Was Terrific","review":"I always enjoyed the series when it was on A & E. I am hopeful that the rest of this fine show will be available on dvd. It was fascinating how Quincy could figure out things without the clues that most of us today do.

I only hoped his girlfriend played in the earlier episodes was a continuing character because it rounded out his personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quincy, M.E. - Seasons 1 & 2","review":"Just as remembered.

I have to say the film looks really good for it's age. If you are a fan of Quincy or the Mystery Movie, this is one you will want to add to your collection. Now, I am not going to ask for a bunch of extras, however, one thing I would have liked seeing in this set was the original opening to the NBC Mystery Movie. I thought that was one of the coolest openings to a show.

That's all.It is also wonderful that he is mixing it with interesting and good written stories and anectods.A must read, for everyone that knows how we people tend to have mistakes.

Yet he doesn't any new value to this subject as you'll see if you read other authors on this topic. Perhaps the author was fooled by the fact that someone would publish his book, but that doesn't make him a mavin on this topic, especially since his examples are retreads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book","review":"Boring book with endless sentences and paragraphs making it difficult to read.

Almost all of us have a distant relative or friend who is allegedly a \\"stock market genius\\". Taleb argues that it is usually hard to know whether that person is truly skilled or just lucky. He argues that most often trading success is either the result of ones arbitrary trading style happening to jibe with market conditions or a product of exposure to volatility in a way that allows for small regular gains leading eventually to a spectacular blowup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ideas ina good read","review":"Just when you think you can spot a trend, for example in the market, along comes this book to show how much is still left to chance and is unpredictable by your system.

Some of the philosophizing is also engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely charming","review":"Taleb's first book, _Dynamic Hedging_, is the options trader's trading book. Easily the finest book on the subject, it has just enough math for rigor, and plenty of intuition and application. So I picked up _Fooled By Randomness_ to see what the man would have to say with many more words and many fewer equations. This is a wonderful book, full of humor and subtlety. Don't expect it to impart the secrets of success in the financial markets -- it's more a collection of anecdotes and thoughts from a successful career. But it sheds light on the kind of thinking necessary to ensure longevity in trading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to read again","review":"Obviously Mr. Talleb is much more than just a mathematician. His unconventional way of sharing a usually dry financial story, gives us an entirely new way of looking at ourselves and those around us.

The book drags on and seems intent on settling scores with either colleagues or the demons in the author's head. The author makes a dull subject interesting - but his writing style and hang-ups are a turn-off after a while. A shame really, as the the book is an interesting read when the author stays on-theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting topic, but poor execution.","review":"Taleb claims in the introduction that he wrote the book without doing any library research. Believe the man.The overall subject of the book is interesting, and the author makes some good points here and there. However, he doesn't support his points with many references or specific examples. The book is disorganized and rambling, and Taleb often raises subjects without really explaining them thoroughly. If I didn't already know about the demise of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), then Taleb's comments on this topic would have left me scratching my head.Taleb also irritates with his constant name-dropping and providing irrelevant, personal details about the people he describes.Avoid this book, unless Taleb gets a good editor and comes out with a heavily revised edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concepts and ideas, not a great read","review":"This book had plenty of interesting facts, points and concepts posited, but the reading of the book itself is less than great. I would've enjoyed the book much more with a better writing style that scripted the text rather than regurgitated the factoids. The interesting tidbits the author has studied aren't compelling enough on their own without a solid background to wrap it all together and move the reader along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful lessons","review":"Taleb's book is a playful critique of conventional wisdom. Perhaps those smarty pants in the financial markets are just lucky; while some of us are the inverse. These are serious lessons too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallacies of inductive reasoning","review":"If you ever felt a little queasy about that article in the paper - the one that connected all the dots and claims to have explained yesterdays news - then this is a book you must read. Taleb covers a lot of ground, at times in seemingly sporadic jumps, but each chapter is a mini research library in itself. The reviews for this book span the whole gamut, and I will not try to add to the noise short of saying that if you are interested in probability, in how it affects our lives, and how it skews our perception of the world, then you should judge the book for yourself - I happened to have read it twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"The title of this book is a bit misleading. A better title might have been: \\"Fooled by Randomness: How Foolish Other People are and How Much More Worldly and Clever I am Than They (With Emphasis on My Fondness for Parenthetical Exposition)\\"Reading various recommendations of the book elsewhere, I had the sense that this was a popular book about randomness. Having read half of this book thus far, it appears to be nothing more than a narcissistic, meandering stroll through anecdotes relating to randomness, with heavy emphasis on how *totally kewl* the author is compared to various bond traders, mathematicians and dentists.There is certainly insightful information to be gleaned from this text, but...WOW, is it painful to do so.If you are a fan of Mr. Taleb, this might be the book for you. If you are looking for an accessible book about randomness and statistics, it might be better to utilize the \\"other people bought...\\" links."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book with an attitude! Unfortunately, not a good one.","review":"First, an admission, I could only make it about half-way through this book. What I did read was neither particularly original nor particularly well written. The real turn-off for me was the tone of the book which was like a second year college student who's learned a new fact and then damns the foolish masses for not being as intelligence as he. There's been other books published that deal with this subject and which do a better job of presenting the facts without the 'Mr. Know-It-All' attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much about randomness","review":"Mr. Taleb spends way too much time talking about all the pitfall in the investment world caused by randomness. Yet, he says nothing about how to invest wisely. There are many people who do well in the financial world, and not every single one of them gets wiped out at some point in their career and leaves the business. He claims to have done well himself. Why doesnt he reveal his winning strategies."},{"rating":"1","title":"enough good points to fill a pamphlet","review":"You can pretty much glean the entire contents of this book from its back cover.

It's hard to argue against some of the points that Taleb brings up. That being said, it is understandable why some people disagree with his views. Regardless, this book is worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Most of the ideas presented in the book are deadright. Being a lover of Mathematics and I think its almost a necessary condition to understand the points of the book, I have realised many of these points personally. What surprises me is that many well educated guys from science/ engineering simply do not understand simple things of maths in real life. I have friends who swear by Buffet and believe, inspite of getting it wrong on so many occations, that there is a thing called \\"Absolute Winning Strategy\\". By first principles, I am reminded of my Finance Professor at a Business Program \\" Future is Uncertain\\" So how can there be an \\"Absolute Winning Strategy for future\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this book","review":"I like this book because it's intellectually stimulating. It doesn't matter that I don't agree with some parts, while others I agree with strongly. What matters is that it makes you think of things you haven't thought about before. And that's the most important part.I agree with the main theme of the book, that people underestimate the role of chance and overestimate their skills. It's cool, and often funny, to see the book discuss many of examples of this.I disagree that financial markets are a random walk. I think there's a lot of randomness there, but since people are involved I think there's got to be a lot of non random characteristics.If markets were purely random, in the mathematical sense, I don't think people like Taleb, even mathematicians, could make money trading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low on usefulness -- high in egocentricity","review":"This book is like a carton full of plastic peanuts.

Of course, the great irony is that, for all Taleb's admonitions to beware survivor bias, this would never have been published if he himself had been unsuccessful in his trading.The author confesses in the first few pages that he did no research specifically for the book, and relied entirely on memory -- and it shows whenever he writes about anything not autobiographical. Even then! Maybe this is a fictional memoir of a repulsive, unreliable narrator, a Nabokovian game? Taleb does claim to be a \\"connoisseur\\" of literature. The joke's on us, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing and one of the funnest reads!","review":"This book is life-changing. Not in a way that you wake up the next day and you change your life.

This book reads like a cocaine driven rant that continually promises deliverance to no avail. As others have commented, this book has nothing to do with mathematics or statistics, on the contrary we are fooled by the biases with which we interpret data... So mathematics is baseless as it only proves the foolishness of humanity. Taleb is therefore not human as he seems to believe he is philosophically above it all, including philosophy.The book sucks. Do yourself a favor, if you are still curious to read, then read any random sample of it on google books. You can even skip around the book after any paragraph as that is exactly how this book seems to be edited. Hmmm, makes me think about the reference he makes to monkeys pushing buttons in order write \\"coherent\\" yet random books which would, according to Taleb, with certainty yield the exact transcript of \\"The Iliad\\". This book must be a joke written by his monkey friends... Genius!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Randomness in our lives","review":"Anything written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is going to make us think very hard about the assumptions we make in life. He is an outstanding polymath that every investor and business person should read. Be prepared to be challenged in the areas of pattern recognition, so-called luck, and the behaviour of markets. Entertainingly written, there is some deep food for thought here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Investing prowess and Lady Luck","review":"Now that was an entertaining read. Mr. Taleb is clearly one sharp cookie - what I found pleasantly surprising was his display of a razor-sharp wit to boot. How refreshing it was to finally read a book from a trader who can understand the difference between good decisions and good outcomes in the investment decision making process. I would highly recommend this book - particularly to any investors who were fortunate enough to have made money during the Internet craze and who are dazzled by their own investment prowess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled into buying","review":"This book is just a lot of hot air.You read page after page in anticipation of some great insights only to discover more and more waffle.There is not an iota of substance to it. It was a particularly frustrating read for me as I am a bond trader and I constantly got the impression that the author is trying to portray himself as a big deal to the \\"lay man\\".I am mystified at the endorsement by Fortune magazine ...the book is nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"No need for another book like this","review":"The book could have been better written if there had been a topic. The title is attractive enough for me to open the cover, but the contents are loosely connected with repetition.

For me, I rather spend my time with something more worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A random collection of ramblings (buy Black Swan instead?)","review":"I managed to read the entire book (which means its an easy read and decent enough. I will not go so far as to say its worthless, as I say its a 'decent' book). So, here's my bottom line. Each chapter has the same unfounded examples-- Taleb casually mentions someone did something and concludes 'see, its random'. He does this over and over again. Fortunately, he concludes the book by acknowledging he's as dumb as the rest of us. His thesis does seem to have 1 definitive source of proof: by random chance many, many people (including me) have been fooled into buying this random book. Maybe his 2nd book, Black Swan, is an improved version-- I would suggest (randomly, since I haven't read it) to just start with Black Swan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anecdotes and science","review":"Found the book strangely absorbing and innovative. Myself, I have very little knowledge of things mathematical or statistical, but a rather strong interest in them. Nassim Taleb delivers a spirited defence of skepticism, which I always like. His examples from the world of financial trading (and gaming) are entertaining and probably(!) illustrative, as are his anectodes from other fields of life and his obviously very extensive reading.I should have liked to read a non-polemical discussion of his thesis. But it would have to be written in the same and wonderfully popular and humorous vein that runs thru this fine book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deliver","review":"The book sounds like it will give you some insight into the markets or the ramdomness of it. It builds on that expectation but does not deliver it slowly turns into a boring mumbuling of anecdotes. I did not finish the book and left it half way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise-to-signal ratio too high","review":"The endless ego-centric platitudes in this book raise its overall noise-to-signal ratio to the point where the reader wastes too much time in getting its basic message: that life and the financial markets are ruled by randomness and that our brains are not equipped to properly assess probabilistic situations and avoid making wrong decisions. The book provides precious little practical advice on how to cope with financial randomness, other perhaps than reading The Economist instead of the daily financial press: essentially Odysseus' way of waxing his ears in order not to to fall prey to the sirens' songsI would recommend Peter Bernstein's \\"Against the Gods\\" instead as a means to learn considerably more about the role of chance in the markets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled by Taleb","review":"This is a very eclectic book. It is not very well-written. It is filled with self-congratulatory asides and anecdotes.

I am not sure it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Subject Spotty Execution","review":"Very good subject, its sort of an applied probability book with discussions on financial trading. Also some disussion of the psychology of competition. That's good stuff, but the author keeps throwing his own persona into it, and he's kind of obnoxious, to put it politely. Its like a Saturday Night Live character giving an economics class or something. But not quite as funny. If you can get past that though, it's a decent book. I'd like to read more about the subject, but by someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quick, read.","review":"I really liked this book.

You can read pages and pages without anything interesting popping up. Ocassionaly an interesting point is raised, but you don't get the feeling that the book is leading anywhere, and therefore you don;t feel the compulsion to continue reading it.Secondly, the author has a very irritating infantile style, peppering the pages with snide remarks or comments about how smart he is.At the end of the book, you're left feeling that this might have been a vagely interesting three page magazine article, but there is not enough substance to warrant a book.Save your time - don't bother buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled By Randomness","review":"The principal subject could have been adequately covered in a dozen pages or less.

His points are banal: that successful people are often lucky but don't acknowledge it, or that empirical distributions have fatter tails than predicted by normal distributions. Further, he's inconsistent, one moment praising the truth and beauty offered by mathematical analysis, the next slamming simpletons who make assumptions in order apply those tools (e.g., stationarity). Lastly, his pomposity would be only mildly irksome if it didn't also reflect an ignorance of why his insights are not that new, true, or interesting.

Taleb is clearly obsessed with introspection of his own life, and has humbled himself before the altar of chance -- his sincerity shines through, despite his pomposity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"Mr. Taleb seems to spend half the book patting himself on the back for being a trader who actually reads books. If you can put aside his annoying, self-congratulatory tone and tiresome class snobbery, you will be treated to a meandering, unfocused collection of half-developed ideas that ultimately leave you unsatisfied. I made it through half the book on the promise that something interesting was to come, but despaired soon after. Perhaps there is some great insight in the second half of the book, but I didn't think it was worth the effort to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Thought Provoking","review":"An witty, easy read for financiers and mathematicians, as well as the uninitiated.

Although most of what is covered in this book is not new to me, as I have spent the last 2 years reading about evolutionary psychology and behavioral finance, this book still helps me a lot. It integrates what I have learned so far in a good perspective and his funny brand of idiosycracies should help me at times to enjoy randomness.

Unfortunately, all I got was about 200 pages of self-satisfied ignorance regarding contemporary culture, with the occassional generalization about the role of randomness in the market and life.As somebody with a PhD in philosophy who wrote his dis in Phil of Science, I was especially teed off by the ease which he mocks all theorists except Popper. Going purely by what he's written here, his argument against the entire continental tradition from at least Hegel to the present, is based on the fact that they are difficult to understand. For most, this would not be something to brag about, but for Nero Tulip there is nothing that does not fall into that category."},{"rating":"1","title":"I missed it","review":"I heard rave reviews about this book so I picked it up from the library.

It is not necessarily the easiest read, but it will help you understand several things and debunk some Wall Street myths, e.g. \\"stocks always go up\\" (which is false due to survivorship bias). It will also help you understand why financial \\"accidents\\" (e.g. LTCM) happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A key topic but a weak book","review":"Taleb makes some valid observations on most peoples' weak skills at understanding randomness. But these are fairly simple, and described well elsewhere. And, what a bore Taleb is! He opens the book with one Nero Tulip (a weak pun on his own name) and then spends most of the book arrogantly and humorlessly talking about himself. He aspires to intellectualism, and drops more names than I can count. Some he idolizes, others he treats with extreme contempt. The second part of the book is a discombobulated collection of platitudes. Random, without a discernible signal, like most of what he tells us we shouldn't be reading. There is a thinly veiled promotion of his hedge fund (if \\"all the quants\\" use poor tools and misunderstand randomness, where does his wisdom come from?) An inelegant book that includes a lecture on personal elegance.There is little of substance here. Save your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled By The Hype On The Cover and The Ramble Inside","review":"I had been looking forward to reading this book for some time but I was too busy in my job as a securities analyst. The title was enticing because it seemed to hint at some of the same conclusions about stock markets that I had come to in my 20 years of analysing stocks.I was very disappointed with the book. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. Much of the text is full of long-winded padding. The smugness and the name-dropping and the sneering at those less brainy than the undoubtedly smart Mr. Taleb himself were intensely irritating. Frankly, a huge opportunity was lost here. The title promised much more than what was delivered. Mr. Taleb's rambling self-absorption in his own cleverness and the stream of consciousness style that pervades much of the book is offputting and slightly nauseating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"There is enough material in this book for one chapter. The rest is just fill consisting of the kind of writing one might put in a personal journal not intended for publication by reason of its lack of organization and poor editing.

His success reminds me of the Midwestern sage whose non-dividend-paying stock is at around the same price it was in March 1998 and yet who remains the \\"world's most successful investor\\" on countless magazine covers, TV programs and newspaper copy.That a piece of empty intellectual snobbery like \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" should be hailed far and wide is unfathomable except in a world bent on shallowness.

Therefore, no performance, or even a series of performances, can be the results of anything but chance. There is no value in studying the past of anything, everything is random and nothing about the past can provide any insight into the future.Spend your money on something by Paul Krugman."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye-opener","review":"I found this book to be quite an illuminating expose of sorts in the financial markets and of its (often varied and colorful!) participants. To a lesser extent, this is also an indictment of the role of luck and how it plays into our everyday lives. The book really doesn't go into specific theories (apart from discussing 'option blindness') on how to 'exploit' randomness in the financial markets for one's financial benefit, though. It could be perhaps that the book didn't intend to do so, other than to highlight the hidden dangers of risk and randomness in the financial markets.I agree with some reviewers here that the tone of the book could have been written in a better way.

Hence, a 4-star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight","review":"Taleb changed the way I thought about skill and luck.

I was utterly disappointed. Too Bad. The author makes a good point: we are bad at understanding the role of randomness in our lives. Unfortunately, the substance stops there. No idea is developed, no valuable information transmitted. The whole book could easily fit on a single page. The rest is just boring blabla. Taleb\`s ostentatious narcissism is also annoying. The author spends much of the book writing about how cultured he is.The author claims that he never reads reviews. I sure hope he reads this one.Don\`t buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm still a fool after reading this book","review":"PROS:* The book argues an important message (that we underestimate the role of luck in our results/outcome).* A few interesting anecdotes.CONS:* Although the author is self-deprecating at times, it smells more of false modesty rather than geniune humility (which he argues everyone should have). Most of the time (as other reviewers have noted) his arrogance comes out loud and clear, and that's annoying.* Disjointed style of writing. He rambles, jumps around, and writes in awkward sentences. The writing doesn't flow easily.* Disorganized. He proclaims that he doesn't like to use headers that tell the reader much about what is coming up. For non-fiction books, I prefer clarity, rather than cuteness.CONCLUSION: There are brief moments of brilliance and lucidness, brief moments when you think the book is really going to be worth reading, and then it quickly vanishes.

I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"fooled by rationalization","review":"This book is an attempt by the author to answer the question\\"If you're so smart why aren't you rich?\\".

So, unfortunatelty, it hasn't really changed the way I think about life and business as I have been exposed to the ideas of the aforementioned thinkers on my own. On the other hand, the book puts those ideas to practice in a very understandable and exciting manner.

I appreciate the gift, thank you Paul, but I couldn't get into this book at all. Chance happens. It isn't that hidden unless you have your head buried in the sand. Emotions happen. Contemplation happens. Discipline happens.This author seems like one confused soul. He glumps everything he can't understand, and perhaps even more, into randomness.

That's why I would give it 2 stars and not 1.Other than that the style is quite bad (IMHO of course) but the one biggest problem for me is thatthe author lacks even a single smallest drop of humility.

I did not need all that.The message of the book if there was any is lost in all this bragging."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different view","review":"Fooled by Randomness gives you a view of risk and skills from a probability (though without numbers) standpoint. Using the stories of Nero Tulip and John, the High-Yield Trader, Nassim (the author) points out how much chance, or randomness, is actually behind the scenes throughout. Mostly, he talks financial markets, but this perspective of risk applies to every other thing in life. I have three copies of this book. \\"There are always secrets,\\" he says. And \\"It is not natural for us to learn from history.\\" Read the book. If you've ever lost money in the markets and don't want it to happen again, you're going to have a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"(...) There's nothing here which would surprise anyone even remotely acquainted with the market; it's just a shallow and poorly-structured rehash of well-known ideas, mixed in with a few ill-timed rants and some copious name-dropping by the author. If you're interested in behavioural economics (which I heartily recommend), then try Belsky & Gilovich's popular book or some of the excellent online articles; if you want market war stories, then \\"Liar's Poker\\", \\"When Genius Failed\\", and \\"Inventing Money\\" are all far better bets.The one thing I can say in Taleb's praise is that he raises some nice ironies in a self-reflexive sort of way. One of his \\"big ideas\\" is survivorship bias, to which the publication of this book provides a counter-example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Egocentric, Always brilliant","review":"One can witness the self-infatuated soul who, in spite of what one can expect, be incisive and insightful to the point of seeing things others don't see. I wish TAleb couldn't be a litle more humble but I guess one can't be everything.Entertaining. I could not put it down.

Its strength also lie in that. It is entertaining and personal, and certainly not dry at all for it. Veryb unusual for such a topic usually treated by nerdy electrical engineers .It can rub some people the wrong way (the author trashes those he believes take themselves seriously but this includes himself!).At any rate Nassim says that he writes principally to entertain himself. He certainly entertained me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mundane","review":"If you are a quant you might find this a little slow. Some interesting ideas from a Behavioral finance perspective, but it lacks rigor. Other than lack of rigor it is a fun book to read. It has interesting examples of anomalies in rational behavior.

In fact, I had thought of the same concepts before, but never thought that it's worth writing a book about.The author is incredibly arrogant. At first, I thought he was just putting down a rival trader - a bit tongue-in-cheek, but then realized that he seems to have that attitude to anybody that isn't him.I regret paying money for this book, and wish I could get the 2 hours of my life that I wasted on it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC","review":"The book is a classic on the unexpected events that plague the option writer.

But Talbet goes further to describe these events that occur in real life. His follow on book titled the Black Swan carries on the theme.Talbet closed up his option operation recently apparently the victim of events he cautions us to avoid.There is a lot to learn from Talbet but it is hard to dig out from the text. For the investor I suggest a little gem titledHow to Make Money in the Stock Market-Buy 2,500 Different Stocks-Pay no Commission"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"I'm really not sure how anyone could say that the tone of this book is arrogant. His main theme is that no one is infallible, and that no one should take himself or one's theories too seriously since success may just as likely be due to chance alone.The successful usually do not wish to attribute success to randomness, but rather to some virtue such as hard work, perseverence, strength of their philosophies, etc. This is human nature, and these same successful people become outraged to the implication that the real secret to their success may be mostly due to blind luck. I suppose the outraged are those unwilling to consider that this might be true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an investment manual","review":"This is not an investment manual, it's just an interesting book about how much randomness impacts our lives and our (often inaccurate) attempts to cope with it.I'm not a trader or a mathematician, just someone who enjoys reading about interesting, intellectually stimulating ideas, and this book delivers that with compelling anecdotes, much as, say, \\"The Wisdom of Crowds\\" or \\"The Tipping Point\\" does.If you come for some thoughtful, fun and mostly insightful stories from a layperson's perspective, as I did, you will probably enjoy the book.If you come looking for an investment manual, a serious mathematical discourse on randomness or an economics text, you probably will not."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author Thinks He Is Better Then EVERYONE","review":"The book has some good points and interesting thoughts but it is difficult to get by how much the author clearly thinks he is better then anyone else. This book is a way for him to get on his soap box and proclaim his greatness. Some of the points are thought provoking but all of value can be covered in many fewer pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel worse than original","review":"This book contains a number of brilliant observations that can be quite thought provoking and that are definitely applicable to other areas. In addition, his rendition of the blow-up of a trading desk he observed personally is both colorful and, in all likelihood, accurate. However, it takes a Herculean effort to get to these nuggets of gold (most of which can be found in his first book anyway) - his oversized ego and need to validate his theory and himself personally get in the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling","review":"There is no common theme running through this book. The reader is just led along as Taleb spews forth incomplete philosophical blather, and comes across as someone who likes to hear himself speak. The reader endlessly wonders what the point is, especially after the first few chapters of the book where Taleb is constantly reminding you that he'll make his point in a later section. It becomes a lot to wade through; it could have been edited down considerably to get at his main points.However, at least he attempted to tackle the idea of randomness, which is admirable. Still, I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody. It's just too directionless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea => bad book","review":"I agonized over how to rate this one. The idea that luck (randomness) is far more important that we give credit is very dear to me. Unfortunately, after telling us how humble he has become by studying markets, Taleb spends the rest of the book showing us how arrogant he really is. The good news is that the subject is still wide open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have followed his editor's advice","review":"The author mentions that he refused to accept his editor's recommendations for the second edition of the book which is unfortunate. His writing style is similar to a drunkard's walk, weaving around and around, occassionally making a cogent point and then starts wandering around again.The book title does describe his writing style very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"I originally expected this book to be a treatise on human beliefs, behaviors, and randomness. It turned out to have a more narrative feel; the author ponders and self-reflects, as well as informs the reader. The Monte Carlo experiments the author conducts, and the interesting studies he mentions, give useful insights into how easily we are fooled by randomness. One last note - this book is not really about the stock market. The author is an ex- options trader; his experience with stocks is merely a backdrop to his relating to randomness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing narrative on randomess","review":"First of all my opinion of this book does not take into account those who haven't read this book. One of the central themes of this text is the role that events outside the Venn diagram (so to speak) have on our lives and in Taleb's case on his financial career. Die hard theorists who live by the assumption of everything being \\"i.i.d.\\" will not like this book. The only thing I would've like is more detail on his use of Monte Carlo methods and methodology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous","review":"Hmmm...there are so many things wrong with the ramble, that it is hard to know where to begin. Taleb is at his best when decribing traders, but as a bearish bitter put buyer who has seen all of those dream teenies go out worthless, it is disingenuous to seperate the world into niederhoffers and talebs...there are plenty of the rest of us in between, and frankly, most traders make most of their money jobbing in and out of trades over short periods of time. Also, really guy, no one cares how many times you go to the gym. Honestly...Finally, for someone who professes not to care about the media, and pseudo-academics, he has a lot of quotes on the back cover from his friends in academia and finance...coincidence, or maybe his only black swan.....PS why the trashing of MBAs...sorry Wharton was so disappointing for him, maybe he should have sold a few more puts and gone out boozing with friends a little more...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bludgeoning a point","review":"Nassim's point on how luck is claimed as skill would be great if supported by facts.

This book reads like one of those business presentations that you listen to and then wonder what you've heard after it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled by a Title","review":"Fooled by Randomness actually fools the customer into thinking that the book is about randomness. The prologue contains the meat of the book. The rest is fluff. The author has some good ideas but he never delivers any substance to the reader. If you are looking for a technical book on randomness and the role of chance in the markets and in life, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly filler","review":"This book could be summarised into about 5 pages. In fact, the author did so (in 2 pages), in an article published for \\"The Daily Reckoning\\". I learned very little more from the book than was in that article. The rest is mostly tangents and filler (sometimes interesting, but not what I bought the book for)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Fooled by Randomness is dreadful. It's badly written and its main message states the obvious. The whole booked could be summed up as follows:The universe is ruled by chance.

I don't remember the last time I was so disappointed by a book.The author provides surperficial, arrogant criticism of some people, notably traders and George Will, and paises people with superficial, poorly reasoned complements.The book is arrogant and too long, by the 10th page you could put the book down and not miss anything the author has to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ideas good, author annoying.","review":"Nassim Taleb presents an interesting, and annoying look at how we react to random events. While the ideas and concepts are not new, they are presented fairly well with respect to a trader's life.What's not presented well is Nassim. The less said about Nassim himself, the better.I closed this book so loudly, the dog hit the ceiling..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wall Street meets Levant","review":"To say the least an unorthodox book, filled with musings, life lessons and philosophy of the author and one central theme about probabilistic events and how they are perceived and misinterpreted by even well trained professionals.If Mr. Taleb had stuck to his original thesis instead of branching out needlessly and had used the services of a professional editor, it would have made a more pleasant but much shorter read. Yes, there is also way too much of Mr. Taleb in the book, obviously a very smart and cultivated man with a sizable ego, who seems to carry a certain bitterness too.What was more interesting was the clash between the Middle Eastern genes of Mr Taleb and the extremely quantitative and results oriented culture of Wall Street and West in general. This is probably what led him to the thoughts that resulted in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled.","review":"Taleb tips us off to his game in the book. Hidden in the many pages of gibberish, he mentions how authors who have little to offer to the human knowledge base write books, and if they can get word of mouth to reach a tipping point, the book will makes lots of money. He also describes a computer program that can string words together and make it sound like intelligent points are being made while all along it is actually saying nothing. Taleb has pulled a great prank on the publishing industry and his readers. I had to buy the book for a class and Taleb took my money like so many others. He is laughing all the way to the bank.Don't be fooled by intelligent sounding titles and self proclaimed intelligent writers. Don't waste time and money on this book, both are too scarce to squander."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book will open your eyes","review":"This book really opens eyes on how people make important financial decisions. Taleb describes several biases that blind us, providing interesting stories to illustrate the problems and to support his ideas. A very strong and interesting book. I want to read it once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"it was recommanded by a friend. so I bought the book from amazon. but I was so disappointed.-- the content is not easy to read;-- I could not follow the author's points.-- I just do not know what he tried to say.DO NOT BUY. there are a lot better ones availabe in amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is A Waste of Tijme!","review":"This is book is a total waste of time. It just a lot of gibberish and doesn't make for an interesting read.

No one before has written so eloquently about the subject matter. A great book written for Wall Streeters and Main Streeters. Critics that think Taleb is bombastic or arrogant have their own issues that aren't related to the book. Very interesting and quite amusing read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating, meandering, pompous, and sometimes interesting","review":"It's an interesting subject -- the role of chance in the markets -- it's just too bad Taleb was too busy puffing himself up to get to it. He apparently wants to be a cross between Daniel Dennett and Richard Feyman, but he comes off instead like an insecure blowhard -- like some bore of a party guest who won't stop droning.Is there anything useful in the book? Sure, but honestly, it's not worth the effort finding those few nuggets about fat-tailed distributions and volatility inflation. Read John Allen Paulos's innumeracy series; read Peter Bernstein's \\"Against the Gods\\". Hey, even read some books by Dennett and Feynman, if you want. But don't waste your time on this pompous twaddle. Taleb has an insecurity streak you could spot from high-earth orbit -- and it obscures his entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important ideas badly presented (but see these better books)","review":"Let's ignore the author's obvious eagerness to show us how much smarter than everyone else around him he is, and how \\"cool\\" he is by being unconventional. The core ideas he attempts to present ARE important, but he does them a disservice by his scattershot explanations and disjointed examples. This wouldn't be so bad if he was presenting new ideas or theories, but he is mostly simply rehashing rather old thoughts.To be more positive, here are some books that cover many of the same topics but in much clearer and more entertaining ways: \\"Inevitable Illusions : How Mistakes of Reason Rule Our Minds\\" by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, \\"How to Lie with Statistics\\" by D. Huff, and most anything by John Allen Paulos."},{"rating":"1","title":"muzzy reading","review":"I found the book diffcult to follow because the author is writing down to his audience. He tantalizes us with broad generalizations but fails to provide the kind of back-up detail which will support his conclusions. His language in many instances is vague and the syntax unclear. I suspect the trouble is that he knows what he is talking about, but can't express his ideas clearly in layman's languague and he dare not get into the math of the subject because it is too complex. People who enjoyed the book mostly seemed to do so because he uses a variety of examples and techniques to provide amusing or human traits, but they simply do not add up to a clear exposition of his main theme. which, I think, is that when it comes to randomness few people can detect the signal from the noise. P. T. Barnum expressed it clearly and simply years ago. \\"There's a sucker born every minute.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Random Musings","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out, this book is not a trading manual. If you are looking for usable market techniques, look elsewhere. However, for those with a classical bent, who enjoy the history of ideas and occasionally even wonder about topics more metaphysical than where the Dow closed today, this is a nice read. Mr. Taleb selects a few lessons from probability theory as applied to the markets, and illustrates them with characters drawn (presumably) from his own life or from his considerable literary knowledge. We learn, for example, why if we watch our portfolios too closely we may be unhappy even with a winning record, why working hard to get that home in the best neighborhood may make our lives miserable, and how our best hope against the depredations of Fortune is personal dignity. Read this for perspective, not portfolio advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probabalistic Philosophy","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out, this book is not a trading manual.

I found the characters not very interesting or real. Frankly the movie was plain silly. I found Maggie's mother to be totally unbelievable and annoying. I mean would a mother, who has just learned that her daughter is a Lesbian, say \\"Are you in love with her\\". I cannot believe that. And Kim got upset because Maggie would not answer. Why the heck should Maggie answer that question whilst she was under so much pressure. That whole scene really grated me.

I was disappointed. I realize that it was an independent movie and doesn't share the same money scale as a big time Hollywood flick BUT it was also lacking in a quality plot not to mention good acting. The basic idea behind the movie is two lesbians have to keep their relationship a secret when one of their mother's comes to live with her. The mother turns out to be a wacko in her own right. The movie is not short on lesbians, bisexuals or tranvestites but it is short on the charm that would have brought the package together. There were a few parts where I laughed (one would hope in a 2 hour period a movie could accomplish that) but on a whole I was watching my watch and the chapter tracks to see how much more of the movie was left. Boy I wish I could get my twenty bucks back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad!!","review":"After reading the raving reviews I expected this to be a great movie with some erotic scenes. Wrong! It was pretty bad. Lots of stereotypical dykes and no attractive women at all. Terrible love scenes with no chemistry and the misperception that lesbians are all a bunch of butches and have sex toys just lying around everywhere for anyone to find. Yuck! This is the kind of movie that gives lesbianism a bad image. Do yourself a favor and rent GIA instead. It's a much better movie and the love between the women seemed much more believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"One dimensional and clich��-ridden","review":"Rarely have I seen a movie this bad.

It lacked depth. It lacked interest in these characters. It lacked almost everything. Even the comedy was a bit over-the-top. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy this genre of movies but it just didn't motivate me to WANT to finish the movie, though I did... somehow....The cover of the movie lead me to believe this would be a great film.

It is funny and entertaining and makes you feel good about life. The mix of characters in the movie was excellent. The movie offers a subtle yet effective counter to the stereotying that many folks do when dealing with gay and lesbian people and issues. While the setting and story line was overtly lesbian, this was in the end a movie about life and love between very likeable people. Also, the music was intriguing and fun, just like the rest of the movie! Especially one song titled \\"Julie Christy\\". I enjoyed this movie at several levels and I heartily recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an incredible movie!","review":"This movie is truly amazing!! It is a wonderful love story that also deals with many real-life issues. Maggie, one of the characters is struggling to keep her sexuality a secret from her mother, while at the same time trying to keep the relationship with her girlfriend...

Character development is superb, making the viewing experience that much more interesting. There's not a boring part. In fact, more than one story harmoniously combines with others to engage the mind and senses. The film is not a serious drama. But it's not only a comedy. The characters are real.

This movie's plot is unbelievable, is unconvincingly serious at times, and poorly acted. It's a decently fun light date movie, but lacks substance as it tries to have deeper meanings and dwell in social and politcal issues.

The plot is entirely juvenile, a 7th grader could have written a better script. The acting is horrendous, but this could be due to such extremely terrible writing. I had hopes for this film but they were demolished in the first few opening minutes. It took several (painful)tries thereafter to get through this.

The mother does not know that the daughter is gay. You then follow these members of the family as they grow socially and within the family. By the end of the movie it very heart warming.

Having been to 5 of his concerts, I'm so glad to finally be able to bring one of his performances into my home. Watch him when he gets going on the harmonica, see his interaction with the rest of his band, go crazy with his crazy dance moves, and kick back and listen to the edgiest, rawest voice you've ever heard- this ain't no American Idol Taylor- this is Taylor as he should be seen.

Almost all the maps deal with sections and buildings of an Aztec-like fortress city.

If not, take a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In the first place, contrary to the information above, this product consists of 32 maps, not 64. And that's all you get: maps, with no information as to how they fit together.Five of the maps link together to form an overland map, but there is no indication of where the city lies in relation to this. There is no overhead rendition of the city to show how it fits together. The placement of only two of the included buildings is obvious; where the other two fit is anyone's guess. Worst of all, one seven-level building is included without any hint as to how the levels fit together. Each unnumbered level has a stairway, but none of them seem to match up; the King's Temple has the architectural logic of an Escher print.In addition, the back cover copy promises \\"labyrinthine tunnels\\"; there are no tunnels at all included in this folio.This was a very disappointing purchase.

I was soo wrong. I quickly flipped through the book in the store but did not take time to really look at the projects. I figured, with a 3 and a half year old boy at home, I would be able to find at a couple cool patterns in here. Yet, everything I have seen in here has made me burst into laughter. Beside 1 or 2 patterns for girls (a purse, and an illusion backpack) there is nothing at all in this book worth knitting. I am not sure who would spend the time knitting a plush tool set and pouch which is shown being worn on an 11 year old boy in the book... or a knit hat and eye patch that is shown being worn in the bathtub?? Honestly, my husband and I looked through the book and thought the same thing about all the projects.

As a book targeted to the newbie attempting to discover information on the different Pagan religions and/or is seeking a path, this book is generally not useful. The information that is included is very weak and watered down. Information of the Reconstructionist religions such as Hellenismos, Religio Romana, CR, and Kemeticism is so generalized as to not have any value, and is nothing that a person could not imply from their names.The book also fails to do any substantial \\"compare and contrast\\" of the religions to give the reader an idea of the many substantial differences. Some chapters, such as those on ethics, magic, sexuality, et al, leaves the reader with the impression that there exists a universal doctrine that Pagans adhere to, and the different paths are nothing more then a different flavoring.Ultimately, while I cannot give the book a resounding \\"do not buy,\\" I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a difference a year makes.","review":"A year ago, I would have described this book as a valuable resource for a person new to Paganism and trying to find a path. Over the last year I have made more of an effort to learn about the differences between the various Neopagan religions and now find this book does not do justice to the real diversity of thought and practice that exists. In fact, this book does what many Neopagans do, which is attempt to homogenize Paganism into some universal religion with different flavored sects. The book is weak and ultimately deceptive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guide for a timeless classic","review":"Although most fans of Dragon Warrior have already beaten the NES versions of DW 1 and 2,and even though they are pretty much the same game but with new enhancements,the guide still is a great buy.(As well as the game itself!)Lots of info,pics and more!Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Help","review":"I was disappointed in this guide, due to the lack of detailed strategy.

Space Oddity, the song that put Bowie on the map, and Life on Mars have such a plethora of mixing sounds that even Pink Floyd would be proud. The stringed orchestral parts are probably the most impressive. From those masterpieces, Bowie shifts to the solid rock anthems, Ziggy Stardust and Rebel Rebel. The guitar work is simple, but excellent and Bowie's voice seems to fit whatever genre he feels like using. This is a must for any classic rock fan, and a very addictive drug for any Bowie fan. In the two days following my purchase I listened to it 5 times minimum. And now that I have owned it for longer, I have only began to appreciate it more.

At first the movie seems to be about drug trafficking but settles down to a terrorist plot to blow up a peace conference at the U.S. embassy in Paris.The identity of the suicide bomber would be a spoiler but it shows Rhys Davies new-found respect to do the right thing even if it involves personal loss.But overall the picture is one of those funny/action movies and i had a good time, even the in-joke of Travolta calling his Big Mac a royale with cheese.

If by some miracle of poor judgement there is a sequel to \\"Paris\\" I won't be seeing it.

Disappointingly, it wasn't.I was able to suspend disbelief for the pleasantly over-the-top action, yet I couldn't stop wondering why this rosy-cheeked assistant was ever considered for \\"special ops training\\" in the first place. From the beginning, he would just mess things up and get lucky enough to talk his way out of it. He'd make a better politician than clandestine terrorist hunter.As an action flick, the second part of the movie doesn't disappoint.

Wax kills scores of bad guys within minutes without getting a scratch. But of course when it comes to killing the terrorist bent on blowing up the conference, he can't get it done. Rhys Meyers seems out of his element here. He's terrific in The Tudors however!! Travolta is a hoot I will admit and the stunts and fight sequences are well done in a \\"Hong Kong Kung Fu\\" style.

Didn't find Travolta to be very convincing in his role as a super tough guy. He didn't seem fit enough to be able to pull off a lot of the action scenes in this film, but of course, only in movies could you see a man his size with a big beer belly jumping between buildings, sliding down stair railings, and drop-kicking a group of bad guys all by himself without breaking a sweat. Rhys-Meyers took a backseat to Travolta. If I didn't already know of him from other movies and \\"Tudors\\", I would be wondering where did they find and why would they cast such an amateur actor in a lead role? Anyway, I was looking forward to this movie and now that I've seen it, I'm really glad I didn't spend any $$$ watching it in the theater. It was very disappointing (both acting and plot line)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun ride and a cool partnership","review":"The movie is a little cheesy in a good way. The Rhys Meyers/Travolta partnership is a little odd at first but in the end works. And Travolta's character, as artificial as it may seem at first ends up working and being deeper in the long run.

All in all, a good popcorn flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paris Rocks!","review":"Fabulous, fun, exciting, adrenaline rush with Travolta's charming humor as a nonchalant, relaxed, but utterly capable assassin of invaluable creativity and spontaneity. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays a naive second fiddle, distastefully learning the ropes, barely surviving getting splattered in each unexpected scene. The movie is a roller coaster ride with laughs, oohs, and ahs, and a bit of a twist to find the root of all these murderous encounters. A more polished \\"Crank\\" type film...i loved it!

First of all, I bought it because I'm reading Chandler's book and wanted to see his cool dialogue spoken on the screen. The movie had almost none of Chandler's unique, special dialogue: no similes, no quips, no short talk. The plot only thinly followed the book and left out the best parts. The movie was so dark (dimly lit) that you could hardly see what was happening most of the time and not at all some of the time. The speaking was muted and garbled so you couldn't follow the dialogue. Call me a low-brow, but I thought it was awful. A tremendous disappointment. It should be called something else so that people wanted to see Chandler's book on film wouldn't be so easily taken in by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minus 100","review":"Sorry, this movie just didn't work.

Unfortunately, it is unwatchable on VHS. I rented it a few years back, found the film incomprehensible, and initially assumed that Altman's directorial work was poor. Then, I caught it in a repertory theatre and recognized the problem.This is a masterpiece, but it's impossible to make any sense of the pan-n-scan video; as in his other films (\\"McCabe & Mrs. Miller,\\" \\"The Player\\") Altman takes full advantage of widescreen, a technique that is impossible to capture on a small television set. So do yourself a favor: avoid this video entirely, and either see the picture in a repertory house or wait until the distributors have enough sense to release it in letterbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality VHS","review":"The movie is really good. Elliott Gould is sweet. It looked great when I saw it in theaters way back then. However, whoever was responsible for the transfer from theater format to VHS must have proceeded without the blessings of Altman or the Director of Photography.

Hopefully someone will take notice and do the job properly with letterbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elliott Gould is the Greatest of all Marlowes!","review":"An updated tale of Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled hero adrift in Robert Altman's floaty, loose Los Angeles. Marlowe investigates his friend Terry Lennox's supposed suicide, and the private eye finds himself menaced by a terrifying gangster and embroiled in the bizarre events at the home of a Hemingwayesque writer and his ice-queen (remember this is an Altman film!) wife.The cinematography, the story line, the quality of the acting, and above all the brilliant direction make this to be a haunting, unforgettable and totally fascinating film. You'll love it! I saw this movie 28 years ago, and it just gets better with time.And Elliott Gould is awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone -","review":"Elliott Gould plays a chain-smoking wise-cracking private eye - the former is repulsive and the latter makes no sense whatsoever as it alienates him from the police and others. Somehow he's considered a local mob's best lead for getting their money back from a now 'dead' courier that Gould had driven to the border. At the end, it turns out the courier is still alive, and Gould takes care of that - for reasons that again, aren't very obvious or credible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I've read Raymond Chandler's \\"The Long Goodbye\\" and thoroughly enjoyed it. What makes Philip Marlowe such an appealing character is that underneath his cynical exterior is a man who is a romantic. He's a nice man caught up in a sleazy, amoral world.Unfortunately, Robert Altman completely misses the point of Marlowe's character in this film. While I can respect wanting to take a new approach to a well-worn genre, Altman's sneering contempt for Chandler's detective ruins what could have been a truly great movie. Elliott Gould too often comes across as a goofy smart-... who seems to think he is too cool for the role he is playing.Unlike the genre-busting \\"M*A*S*H\\" and \\"McCabe & Mrs. Miller\\", Altman completely strips the characters in this film of any humanity. There is not one character in this film that is even remotely likeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor translation of an interesting book","review":"There's no doubt that Raymond Chandler is a wonderful writer. But this film version of The Long Goodbye does not do the book any justice. It throws out the 1930's historical context and sets the book in the 1960's. This does not work. Elliot Gould is totally miscast as Philip Marlowe, Chandler's famous private eye. Gould lacks the toughness and wit of Chandler's Marlowe as well as the mannerisms and philosophy. Not surprising, The Long Goodbye is a complete flop. Don't waste your time and money on this film even if you love Chandler, Marlowe and film noir. Thomas Lee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Didn't read the book, not a student of film, and I thought the movie was awful! Elliot Gould smokes and mumbles his way through the film as a bumbling, staggering doofus, the very embodiment of uncool. It's as though by making him a chain-smoker he would be cool or mysterious but it sure doesn't work. The other characters are more like caricatures, poorly and/or overacted. Was very excited to get this film; could barely finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elliot Gould isn't GOOD.","review":"This film, plays ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER as a body builder in the locker room.

It's a fascinating mix of both heartfelt homage, and style twisting parody and re-imagining of film noir, with a great performance by Sterling Hayden, a very good one by Mark Rydell, and a solid one by Elliott Gould. A lot of it is quite funny and entertaining, but there's a sad, almost tragic side under all the hip irony. The ending is powerful, if a bit rushed. I'd put this among Altman's best films, but as I said, it took a second look to get there. Hard to believe this modern classic, like so many others, is out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great LA movie and Altman classic","review":"Many people have reviewed this movie to death and most of the reviews spell it out. It's a great movie but what I really love about it is that it shows some great parts of Southern California, and LA in general. From the wacky apartment that Marlowe lives in to the Malibu Sea Colony you get a great feel for the city in the 70's...when it was better.I was born in Hollywood and raised in LA so I eat this stuff up. Other than that, it's a great movie and a good detective story. Great cinematography and the bonus features are solid. I've seen this movie many times and won't change the channel when it's on TV and pop in the DVD probably once a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique Goodbye","review":"I was late to discover this gem of a movie. I only learned about it a couple of years ago. I am a Philip Marlowe appreciator and have searched out quite a few of the various versions and actors who have played this facinating character. Gould's is one of the most unique versions in this Altman take on Raymond Chandler. Altman brings the best out of this plot of human frailties and shares a glimpse into 70's California using the sleepy eyes of the Rip Van Winkle like Marlowe of Elliot Gould. This is both classic Robert Altman and Philip Marlowe. I highly reccommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Script stinks, kinda bad acting","review":"It's amazing how much lower acting standards seemed to be in 1973 when this was made. You can practically see Elliot Gould reading his lines throughout this Altman flick. Same with many of the others. Arnold Schwarzenneger is a hoot as a musclebound bodyguard, though, but has no lines. Gould chain smokes throughout, everywhere he goes. The 70s LA sets are interesting for their period decor. I wondered where Marlow lived because his building is quite scenic, though the naked yoga girls next door are simply annoying. The title track plays throughout the movie, but there doesn't seem to be much of a score, otherwise. At two hours, this was typical of its day. But it seems too long by at least 30 minutes now."},{"rating":"2","title":"$50 Per Day Plus Expenses","review":"A youthful Elliot Gould at the top of his form makes for an easy-going yet no nonsense Phillip Marlowe in this contemporized (1973) adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novel of the same name. Directed by Robert Altman from Leigh Brackett's screenplay, Gould's Marlowe is an irreverent and \\"laid-back-until-pushed-too-hard\\" private detective who goes to the aid of a friend only to become immersed in a mystery of deceit, drug money and double murder. Gould's chain-smoking and cat-loving Marlowe is surrounded with typical 70s-circa Hollywood/Malibu characters including uninhibited hippie-chick neighbors, an assortment of thugs both criminal and badged, a controlling sanitarium administrator, and an alcohol-abusive novelist played by 50s star Sterling Hayden (Asphalt Jungle, Dr.Strangelove). A very cool John Williams/Johnny Mercer musical score helps establish and sustain the film's mood which ends with a scene that's both controversial as well as provocative. - DM"},{"rating":"2","title":"For a brief, shining moment in the '70s, Gould was king","review":"Director Robert Altman can find a sublimely goofy sort of humor in almost any setting, and he does so here. For one thing, the musical score primarily consists of a single tune played over and over by different performers in different arrangements.What's amazing is how well this self-conscious jokiness fits with the bleak motivations of the flick's traditionally noir characters.Gould's Everyman-ish anti-Marlowe is one you'd actually like to hang out with. He's just as good with cats as with comebacks, for instance.If you've ever wondered how someone like Elliott Gould could be the top box-office draw in America for a short period in the 1970s, you should give \\"The Long Goodbye\\" a look. For a brief, shining moment, the man was king.As Marlowe says, \\"It's OK with me.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This model is no good!","review":"I have also had lexmark and never had any problems before until I bought this model.

This became a good starting point for a frank discussion between my wife and me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Details and insights","review":"The book is filled with stories and detailed interpretations of how lying by men to women works.

The men emerge (almost) as much as victims of their lies as the women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not insighful - out to make quick buck","review":"I agree with the reviewer who wrote that she \\"hates men.\\" It's interesting that her other book is about career consulting....and this one comes on the tail of all the Mars vs. Venus and Dr. Laura material.

For a variety of reasons, same as women. Why do men lie in relationships? Same again, and men have not cornered the market on self-serving lies. Women often just fool themselves into believing they lie for \\"good\\" reasons.

It's sort of along the lines of all the other garbage books like, \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\". Seriously, people--stop encouraging slags and man whores to write more of this drivel--it's all insulting to men and women by trying to get women to buy into this bull.

Instead of offering constructive ways in which men and women can get along, it both blames men and patronises women.

The stereotyping approach is a gigantic leap backwards - this is the 1990s!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the 101 Lies This Author Will Tell You","review":"The author takes on a daunting subject and some of her observations are interesting, yet her scholarship leaves a lot to be desired. For example, she states that, on average, women wait six months becoming sexually intimate with a partner. This and other assertions left me wondering just how much of her book was based on fact and real case studies. On the whole, I was worried about the 101 lies the author was telling me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dory hates men","review":"The author obviously hates men. I was particularly amused by one of her examples in chapter 7. She relates how Donna who was engaged to Lance a soon to be Naval Academy graduate cheats on him while working as a camp counselor by having a summer love affair. Lance discovers the infidelity unbeknownst to Donna. Lance deceives Donna into believing he still loves her and will marry her after graduation. He continues to see her and have sex with her and dumps her when he graduates. The author scathingly vilifies Lance while forgiving Donna's deceiptful betrayal. Golly, sounds like Donna got what she deserved and Lance got a little deserved payback that Donna can ponder about the rest of her life as she asks herself per the author's viewpoint \\"Why did Lance dump me?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"lies","review":"101 Lies Men Tell.....hmmm, interesting concept.

Here's a \\"guidline\\": If you believe you are being lied to, you probably are.

The author explains the feel of each song in a very pessimistic and sometimes sarcastic way, and he often fails to notice important nuances that Fleetwood Mac is famous for, and when he does notice them, he shoots them down as being overproduced or unecessary. As someone who has listened to pretty much everything this incredible band has recorded, I would advise those curious about FM's music to listen to it for themselves and create an informed opinion.

Normally I have problems with One Sizes being too large on me, I am only a 34inch hip (86cm) and this skirt barely just fits! I am not sure what size the Queen runs in but if you have a hip size larger than 34 you may want to go with the Queen Plus, at least it would be easier to adjust this by making it smaller than making something too small try and fit. Aside from the size running small it's one of my favorite accessory items to date. It's very sexy and very hardcore at the same time, it works great for photoshoots and fetish events and looks very cute under a short skirt if you want to just go out clubbing for a night. If you like chain clothing this is a must have!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"I really enjoyed My Sister Sam. I started watching it and became hooked on it. Although it was cheesy in many ways, it was entertaining and light hearted. It was good, honest comedy and I really miss seeing it. After I started watching it, Rebecca Schaeffer was killed. I was upset by this, because she was such a promising actress who had a wonderful career and life ahead of her, plus not to mention she was very young and had her wonderful life cut short by some sicko.

It is true that it is a neater install. There aren't any fibers falling off, just cut with scissors and put into place.However, they do not cool anywhere near as well as Aspen pad. The coolest air I could get out of my cooler with the duracool pad was 77 degree's.

A few shards of aspen is worth it for proper cooling."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money on blue synthetic pads","review":"These pads are total crap. They might be a little less messy but they do NOT cool the air properly because they don't get fully saturated nor retain their moisture. The water mostly flows completely over the top of the pad and down into the reservoir without soaking into the pad.

The airflow seems to be cut down to half of what the Aspen pad's airflow is. The whole purpose of a swamp cooler is to have water evaporate into the passing air to cool it.

Compact Filter Case is well constructed, rugged, and will hold filters securely. That said, I found two problems, on minor, one major, with the design:Minor: the pockets don't expand in true \\"accordion\\" fashion due to how they're sewn to the back. The result is the front pocket is smaller than the back.Major: No photographer in their right mind would entrust their filters (as shown in the product image above) to a case where anything would touch, contaminate, and possible permanently damage them. That's why all quality filters come with some type of hard container for storage. The size of the container drastically reduces the size of the filter the MX-S5363 can hold. A practical maximum limit may be as small as 50mm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This is a nice add-on for the Tamrac bags. I have decided I need a bigger one though.

This show was originally considered for a series but was rejected by the studios because it was too clean (no potential sex or violence story lines). Great story, cinematography and score. For more background on this film, read Dean Jones' autobiography \\"Under Running Laughter\\" where he devotes 2-3 chapters. Jones took this role due to its clean storyline and his no compromise beliefs concerning his Christian faith and his desire to do family-friendly films.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big book with nothing.","review":"If you have any basic knowledge about statistics and TA, you can skip this book.

Simply wonderful! The authors explanation of the various biases alone deserved a million applause.

I have rated this book 4 stars because of this and because of the conclusive part, which fell short of my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Direction","review":"David Aronson's book has set the tone, if not the parameters, of a new conversation among technicians and other interested observers. Whether technical market analysis ultimately yields to Aronson's rigorous standards remains to be seen, but he has placed a high bar to admission into the dialogue. As a result, much nonsense which now passes for TA is certain to be marginalized, by itself an important contribution.Aronson's suggestion that TA's best chance for survival lies in a human-computer partnership is right and strikes a hopeful note.This challenging book is a tonic which should be taken fully by any serious student of the markets.

There is a lot to learn if you are a novice trader and if you've never tried to develop a trading system. I think this book isn't worth half the selling price.

It direct connects to the pivot point for the lift arm (i.e. is not connected to a larger bore hydraulic pump) and takes serious foot power to lift the arm, keeping in mind if the jack is under a vehicle you can't reach the foot pedal anyway. I ended up removing it just so I could better slide the jack under my workbench when not in use.The most serious issue is releasing the jack to lower it. I've tried multiple times to lower my car slowly with just a gradual turn of the handle and it can't be done. Car is jacked up one second and on the ground the next. Perhaps not so bad if the job is done and you don't mind a rather hard landing, but it also means you can't gently lower something onto a set of jack stands.

Continue doing great as you are doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage!","review":"He takes beautiful songs that have already been done,and makes them sound like plastic,cheap,wannabe,immitation.I'm trying to figure out what it is that makes him so popular!If you like real romantic music in spanish,try los panchos(whom he attempts to cover)or los dandys.Oh well,music is a personal thing,and I've tryed getting my wife to stop listening to this,but I have been unsuccesful...so there is something to the lads credit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Luismi THE master","review":"OK, Luis Miguel might not be the greatest latin artist ever and he's light years from anything as adventurous as what's happening in latin rock, but he is THE master of the craft. These impeccably produced albums redefined a musical legacy (romantic bolero music) that was lost and relegated to lounge singers and corny latin interpreters.What began as a crossover experiment became a permanent cause for Luis Miguel, and we have to credit him for reviving bolero and re-introducing it to newer generations that could have cared less if these songs, \\"from my grandparents days\\", faded in time. The concept grows from the first album (weakest, experimental) to the third (best accomplished). These albums are a must have even if your not into latin pop, and it doesn't get any better(the fourth Romances album, not featured in this collection,is where things start sounding abit tedious.)This is best from Luis Miguel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Romantic Luis Miguel songs","review":"Excellent, great listening, romantic and totally Luis Miguel at his finest.

Never have I experienced such pleasure in listening as with Luis Miguel. This man inteprets lyrics in such a way as to make them his very own. His blending of smoothness with emotional content is extraordinary. When he sings, I believe every word and feel the impact in the deepest parts of my soul. Whether it be the pain or hope of love, his presentation is so intimate and personal that one feels as if he's telling his own stories. A truly great singer-Viva El Rey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most beautiful book!","review":"This book is wonderful.

The book was delivered in a timely manner, but the the condition of the book was very poor. None of the pages were glued to the cover of the book so they all fell out.

Use them for doing general maintenance on my cars.My only negative comment is that the safety pins tend to fall out if you tip the stands when you are carrying them. Not a big deal.

I already had a pair of 2 ton jacks; was looking for bigger 3 tons for my full size pickup. They arrived on time but upon inspection they were the exact same size as my 2 tons (height, width, craftsmanship). The only difference was the insert lug. It was about 1/8\\" thicker. I guess that's were the increased capacity comes from. But again, being same size and limitations as my 2 tons...they didn't meet my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Quality","review":"These stands are very well made. They are solid and will be buying two more once i have the money. You cant find a better deal for 3 ton Jack stands.

The reviewer acknowledges the rarity of literate workers in the early industrial age and lack of narratives from typical workers of this era. These narratives are absolutely fascinating, horrifying, beautiful, and insightful. I cannot imagine why it would matter whether they are typical stories.

Can't recommend it highly enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd and unimpressive","review":"Second in a series, featuring an American and an Englishwoman who are private detectives for the Cunard Line, and also have a personal relationship.I was unimpressed. The book is very formulaic, and the writing is often stilted. A typical \\"locked room\\" mystery with everyone having a secret, and several crimes going on at once. There are huge plot holes, and the only way most of the crimes are \\"solved\\" is by the detective(s) jumping to conclusions with little or no evidence, confronting the suspect, who, despite the fact that she/he/they are sophisticated criminals who have intricately plotted their offenses, immediately cave in and admit their deeds. Absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naive","review":"This book so naive to the realities of dating and the nature of women that you have to wonder if the 2 authors who wrote it ever dated in their lives.The basic premise of theis book is that you if simply hit on a certain number of women, one will probably go out with you. That's like saying that that if I buy enough lottery tickets one day, I can possibly win the lottery.The techinques used to \\"seduce\\" women are even worse. One reviewer nailed it on the head regarding the techniques:the only thing they'll help you do is help you look gay.This book does not illustrate anything else to help seperate you from the other 500 guys trying to compete for the same woman. In fact, this book will not only not help you keep up with the competition but will help eliminate you all together. Get real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could women really be this stupid?","review":"While there were some interesting things about dating in this book (which, truthfully, any man over the age of 16 would already know), I found this book really hard to believe. \\"How to Succeed\\" is obnoxious and irreverent, all right. I guess that means I'm one of those hated Sensitive New Age Guys -- I believe in treating women with honesty, integrity and respect. Let's face it, if a woman doesn't return your calls or show up for a date its for a very good reason. It's not because she \\"forgot.\\" Or that she's playing hard to get. How insulting! It's because she's NOT INTERESTED, plain and simple. Any further pursuit will only serve to make a guy look pathetic and desperate.

Zero.","review":"I recommend this book to men who need to be told to clean their nails before a date or to call a date who stood them up on pretense of apologizing for doing the same. There is no evidence other than the authors' claim that there is research behind this book. There is certainly no understanding of the female behind it. But, if your goal is to exploit women and if you are lame enough to think women will fall for the \\"research\\" findings of this book, then give it a try. It could teach you to scrutinize what you choose to read more carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a joke","review":"This book does 2 things. First it promotes itself. Second it says nothing that a moron would not already know, like personal hygiene. Other than that it advocates low life tactics that can only turn women off. Their tactics are neither healthy nor likely to succeed, even if you want to be a low life with women. The authors' goal is very obvious: take the money and run. I would run away from this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've used all the techiques taught in this book","review":"I've used all the techiques taught in this book and I'm still masturbating. I don't know if it's me or the book but I let you decide. Although it didn't help me get a chick, it did boost my self-esteem up a bit. I'm feeling more confident about myself now. So this is actually a good self-help book. Probably the most important thing I learned from this book is to not seek validation from anyone but yourself.

Just keep in mind that it takes practice and time. If some suggestions like the \\"hand puppet\\" do not appeal to you then just stick to what you like. The idea is to get a woman's attention and get her laughing. You can use many techniques to do that.

I have read dozens of other titles on dating, sex, and romance, but none offer the type of specific information covered here.

If what it says is true, then a lot of my conceptions about them were very wrong. However, I've tried to follow the techniques, and have not had a result yet. The authors claim over and over that they include everything you need to know and that if you follow their technique exactly then you'll have no problem, but it still hasn't worked. Maybe the rules are different on a college campus. I'm a med student, in great shape, and not bad looking, but I've still never had a date even after trying these techniques.

I've been flirting more than ever using the tips in the book. I definitely wish I had this book about five years ago.Most of the tips remind me of what I learned about successful job interviewing. I studied a few books and found that being honest and being myself was not going to cut it. Many times I knew I was the right guy for the job, but unless I acted like the guy that they wanted I never got anywhere. This is not fair, and it will drive you crazy if you ponder over it. The same goes for dating, as I'm beginning to learn with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book - Stupid Title","review":"This isn't a perfect book on woman but it does provide a lot of insight on how to be more successful when dating and dealing with woman. I would recommend it to most guys as a good dating primer if the title was better. Unfortunately, the authors chose the title it has and guaranteed that most guys won't read it or show it to any of their male friends.A better title would have been 'A Mans Guide to Dating the Modern Woman' or something.

It is written from a fairly feminist perspective despite the fact that the authors are men. It had a few good points but I could have spent my money in much better ways. A lot of it is stories (Bruce is the fictional 'hero' and Bob is the 'failure' and they keep re-appearing to illustrate the ideas in the book) and the stories are awful. There are checklists in each chapter (\\"what to do during the date\\") and these stories recap what the checklists and ideas say. When one of the stories quoted the checklist verbatim (something like \\"bruce touched his date on the arm at least once to make physical contact with her blah blah blah\\") I nearly vomited.

Warning! if a man is a disciple of the authors he will sweep you off your feet, and after he gets what he wants (sex) he will dump you, making it impossible to trust the truly nice guys that come after him.
