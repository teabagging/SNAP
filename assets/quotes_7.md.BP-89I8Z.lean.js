Déjà Vu, Lake House, Premonition and the television show Daybreak all hit the public about the same time. At least Déjà Vu tried to explain how this phenomenon is possible. Sandra Bullock's Lake House and Premonition didn't bother. But we all know it's inhumane to keep beating a dead horse. Denzel Washington continues to have an amazing presence on film. And after playing so many cops and bodyguards that is an amazing feat. The only creepy side to Doug's Carlin's investigation is his almost stalker like inclination to Claire. I do have to agree the actress playing Claire looks a lot like Halle Berry. Overall: this is an entertaining film and it is worth your time checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this movie ... ok enough said","review":"One of the best movies I have seen in a while.. turn it up and sit back... this movie also shows you what not to do in traffic."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best British Blues albums EVER !!!","review":"If I had to choose between 5 TOP British Blues albums, this will be one of the 3 firsts.

The descriptions of composers and recordings allows one a greater appreciation of the music.This edition contains twenty essays that did not appear in the previos edition on topics as diverse as gregorian chant to atonlity.This book is perfect for anyone interesed in Classical Music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for anyone plagued with chronic back pain","review":"Wealth of information for back pain suffers.

The example in the book didn't even work and was thin on getting things like the postal address to work across multiple programs.I managed to get my project done using web resources, magazine articles. No thanks to this book. After using the OpenLDAP site for help, I got a very weak address book going that held the minimum information. After launching the book into the corner of my office, I managed to get the full project done to 90% of where I want it to be.He spends so much time pointing you to different RFCs, in essence, making you do all the work. The reference to where information comes from is great. Mention the RFCs but narrow the information down to help me solve problems.I hope Oreilly can find an experienced author to re-write this book in a way that helps the people who fork over the money. I have tons of really good Oreilly books. This, however, is a poor poor poor book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book well worth its price","review":"This book is written a while ago and it definitely needs update.

When I read it from the chapter 1, introduction, it was still not clear what I was getting into. After reading it all, I still think the introduction was not very helpful. I don't think reading this book from cover to cover all through would help a lot.Nonetheless, after reading through this book with actual practice (installing OpenLDAP and running the examples as the book illustrated), I got good grasp of the concepts of LDAP and understanding how it works.I like its practical examples and connection to other applications.In conclusion, I feel I spent my money well on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great LDAP book!","review":"Great book!If you use LDAP in a serious way and need to REALLY understand the inner workings, get this book.It is clearly written, to the point, and very valuable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"O'reilly books are the best","review":"Another great O'reilly book.

It covers:-detailed slapd.conf configuration-pam_ldap-nss specific and pam specific configuration parameters in ldap.conf-DNS implimentation with LDAP-conversion toolsThis book is an excellent guide on actually putting LDAP to work, including design, configuration and implimentation.This book is NOT designed for people looking to impliment other LDAP software (iPlanet, etc).

It seemed like there was the potential for a good story here, but Michael Rips never really got around to it. He was too in love with his own \\"quirkiness\\" and telling bizarre little side tales without explanation.The non sequiturs in this book were numerous enough to fill up a book of their own. A few random moments and diversions can be entertaining but, for the most part, this was nothing but random moments with brief glimpses of a plot. Over and over again a new character would be introduced for one anecdote--invariably being a disturbing, violent, or sexual one--and then never mentioned again. That would be it. Nothing to do with the larger narrative, no thematic point to it, nothing.There was the potential of a good book here, but it simply got lost beneath the author's own extravagances and pretension."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Read","review":"I LOVED this book!!!

This is not a mystery story, and the search for the lady in the paintings is just a minor journey, interspersed with dozens of peripheral characters that come and go in a flash. Some funny moments halfway through the book in events that probably didn't really happen (his grandmother getting sucked up a garbage chute into the kitchen from the basement during a tornado)are much welcome after his meandering into unrelated asides from classical literature.

I finally got around to using the ravioli maker yesterday. Unlike the pasta maker which works beautifully, the ravioli maker is terrible. First, it is not electric like the pasta maker. Attaching it to the mixer serves no purpose except to anchor it to something. Each piece of pasta needs to be exactly the correct size as the hopper head. The raviolis turn out very small with little filling. I was able to salvage half of what I made. I froze them so I have not used them yet.

I have no idea what sort of epicurean nightmare passes for food for those who gave this good reviews but, I can tell you that this is a waste of money and we are all stupider for having used it. It is a pointless attachment to a Kitchenaid in as much as it is a manual crank and requires more fiddling than manually rolling the dough. Just to be clear this is not a machine that you set the components in and crank away till they run out. The process to use this machine either requires you to puree the filling (in this case why not just by a box of frozen from the store) or you need to feed and shape every filling by hand. When it does produce a ravioli it is usually a mess and is surrounded by half a pound mangled dough/filling goo. There are plenty of much cheaper dough rollers with and without motors that will be far better and faster for someone wanting to make a quality ravioli."},{"rating":"1","title":"really is a waste of money","review":"I used this in a pasta/ravioli class and it is NOT worth $130. First, it does take practice, but so does using a ravioli tray or making them free hand. The ravioli we made came out better using a $20 tray or free hand with a $6 fluted cutting wheel than they did on this thing. Sure, if you practice you could get it to work...but it would take less time and practice to use a ravioli tray or cutter and save you more than $100. Even when we got \\"good\\" with it, it was not a major time saver, in fact, I could do more by hand in less time. You could buy dozens of cool sizes and shapes with the pans for the cost of this one piece of equipment. This is one place where KitchenAid misses the mark...I will say that the roller is a lifesaver, and I will not use a hand-crank machine again...but this is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as expected","review":"The Ravioli maker does not work properly and only the ravioli in the midle are usable. I own a ravioli maker I purchased for $20 and it works the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a tray or do by hand instead","review":"So was funny to begin with that basically the mixer becomes a holder. Point being that there is no reason this type of device needs to be held by a mixer. We tried it twice and just find that for the price this device is not worthy. Besides we like having the roller attachment installed as we work and this device is then in the way. Ravioli can be done as fast or faster with less effort with a tray or by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's easier to do it the classic way","review":"I own almost all kitchen aid stand mixer attachments and this is one of the few that I gave up using after few weeks.It's very difficult to adjust the amount of filling that goes into the sheets, and I also struggled to make the sheets air tight. After several unsuccessful attempts, I went back to the classic way of layering sheets by hand. It was not worth the $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pasta!Pasta!Pasta!","review":"Is there anything better than homemade pasta. So worth the effort and time. This contraption takes a little time to get the hang of, but once you realize that the pasta has to go through the press a good 20 times (per size adjustment),then you will have a true appreciation for the art of pasta making. A solid buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitchen not aided","review":"This product is not as advertised... firstly you have to buy the roller which is not disclosed at purchase time... secondly, it is a manual machine, all it does is hang off the mixer, so you just as well nail it to the wall... it, and the roller, can't be washed, so it is unhygenic. But most importantly it doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs engineering","review":"I can see where this expensive ravioli maker is a good idea, but it's definitely NOT ready for use. After EXTENSIVE preparation of the dough, the raviolis came out with leaky edges and didn't hold much filling. Kitchen Aid was not willing to provide ANY support as far as refund or exchange for this problem. I'll have to keep making my raviolis by hand for the time being (which is easier than using this thing), and my confidence in Kitchen Aid is gone. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"tis a waste","review":"the motor doesnt even come into play here.. you manually crank it... why bother even making something for the kitchen aid that doesnt use the motor?i get better results with ravioli trays... which only cost about $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"it will make ravioli","review":"but it is messy, not really easy to operate, and expensive for the level of performance.

What a piece of trash. I've tried it, repeatedly. My friend, who was also duped into buying one by the good reputation that KitchenAid enjoys, tried it. Her husband, who can make anything work, tried it. Failure after failure after failure after failure. If you're looking to make a pot of disconnected shreds of pasta with free floating filling, this is the equipment for you. If ravioli is what you're after, you'll do better buying a can of Chef Boyardee."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is JUNK!","review":"Like many other reviewers, I also love KitchenAid products, however, this one is a failure. I was very excited to receive it as a gift, so I overzealously prepared meat (finely ground), mushroom, and cheese stuffings for the raviolis. I went to roll them out, and they burst right open! The cheese worked the best, because it was so soft, but even with those less than half of them were useable. I was so mad, because it took a lot of effort to also make the pasta and roll it all out, just to have this ravioli maker mutilate it! I hate the thing, and I will be returning it as soon as I'm able to get back to the store where it was purchased. I would recommend against this product - it is purely frustrating!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I own a restaurant and I have been in the food business in some way or another for many years. I make many Italian foods by hand from scratch. I absolutely think that this item is JUNK. For the home cook it is absolutely the most difficult item I have ever seen. If I didn't wait so long to open the box, I would return it in a second. Shame on whoever decided to keep selling this item. Also keep in mind that it is not powered by your mixer. It only uses the mixer as a holder and you have to crank it by hand for it to work. It's so bad that it's almost funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what expected","review":"It was very difficult to use.Spent several hours on it and it never did stuff the ravioli or moved the pasta through as it should. Even with it attached to the mixer,still had to hand crank the machine. Is not worth the money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I've been happy with many other KitchenAid products, but this one is pure junk. The pasta roller attachment that KitchenAid also offers is great, but the width of it is so close to the size of this ravioli press, that the edges of the ravioli barely have enough dough to seal - and many of them pop open.It's worth noting that although this does in fact attach to a standing mixer, it does not use the mixer's motor. You have to manually turn the crank with your hand.I returned this piece of junk, and bought the VillaWare V5500 10-Square Ravioli Maker for $18. Save yourself some money and do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works, but...","review":"I have used several Kitchen Aid attachments, and this one is very mediocre. I received this and the pasta roller as a gift. The pasta roller is great, but the ravioli maker requires dough size that is exactly the same size as the pasta roller, many raviolis burst, and it is difficult to precisely adjust the amount of filling (some overfill if it \\"grabs\\" a bunch and some underfill). The ravioli size is also relatively small. It works, but you may be better off with something else (such as using the pasta roller and manual ravioli trays)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ravioli Maker","review":"I just made my first ravioli using this wonderful product. I practiced with no filling as was suggested by someone. This helped get the idea of how to work the attachment.I believe by rolling the pasta large enough and not overfilling the holder, you can't fail.I really do love this and my guests will enjoy the cheese ravioli I made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners.","review":"I am learning Chinese & these flashcards are great! They are a very nice size to carry around, plus they have several different words listed at the bottom of the card that also use the character. They show the simplified & original character. The biggest plus for me is they show you the order in which to write the character (they only show order on the simplified character)! I would highly recommend these cards if you are learning Mandarin Chinese.Volume 2 does not repeat words from Vol. 1, but just builds a bigger vocabulary.

Faid tries to defend his faith by twisting and bending science in all ways possible, resulting in something that is not science at all, but pure apologetics or pseudo-science. The way he approaches things, he could just as well try to 'prove' the validity of Santa Claus or the easter bunny with the same result.Books like these just make clear that things like religion aren't backed by any scientific proof whatsoever.

There is not extensive choreography here, but it is more like a dictionary of sorts that shows you several movements and then gives you a chance to practice. there are two short choreographies amidst the instruction but that is not the focus. the positives of the dvd are the demonstration of several intermediate and advanced techniques not seen in, say, Kili's workouts, which are on a more beginner level and modernized (although Kili makes great dvds I think!)some of the advanced steps include the pa'i pa'i, the hamenimeni,and many more.

However, the next three books in the series went from bad to worse. The series \`continued' the story while changing the entire storyline; the character's where all very similar and predictable; and the writing was malicious at best. There was a lot of completely unnecessary violence, vague and unexplained concepts, and the ending was positively the worst conclusion of a tale that had began with such promise.

The despair felt in the second book far outshines the emotions the first trilogy made me feel.********SPOILERS********I was overjoyed when Faraday finally survived and received the fate I felt she should have had in the third book.

The first trilogy is superb. It is a tightly constructed fantasy with a sophisticated plot, intriguing elements such as the Star Dance, and impressive use of foreshadowing in the form of the prophecy. The characters grow and the plot develops very smoothly in the first trilogy. By the end of book 3, Enchanter, the story is nicely wrapped up and it would have been a great place to stop.Book 4 starts 40 years later following many of the children of the original heroes and a new evil threat. I continued to enjoy books 4 and 5. But by middle of book 6 the author had written herself into a corner and was struggling with balancing the power of the characters. The demons had been made all powerful. Last few chapters of the book were a struggle to read as the rules of the game become erratic and the heroes seem to win various battles arbitrarily."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad!","review":"I agree with others when they say that the series started out great, but it is so obvious that Sara Douglass didn't like Faraday.

The ending is just plain stupid and defeats anything else she had previously represented in her earlier novels. I was left in a terrible mood after reading it because the ending was just plain horrible.

I really like the interesting bonus features including the life of Lenardo Da vinci and the tour at the rosslyn chapel. The bonus interviews with the historian and theologian gave the in-depth discussion about the controversial topic regarding the Jesus's Marriage with Mary Magdalene and the structure of the bible in early Christianity History. If you are fascinated by the Da Vinci Code, why don't you also consider watch this DVD from different perspectives."},{"rating":"1","title":"childish fight","review":"It is a bit strange to watch all this fight against Dan Brown's book. What is for? Millions people who like the Da Vinci Code book usually do not take it as a source of historical facts. The value of this book is not in the particular facts but in general (and serious) idea about danger of destroying male-female balance in society. Indeed, a human being consists of two parts. Males and females have very different views on this World so that these views should be well balanced. If one of the parts becomes heavily predominating, it may be truly dangerous for survival of our species. Dan Brown just takes our attention to the problem. He shows that the imbalance has a long history and it might be a major source of many current problems in human society as well as the source of overall instability on the Earth. And the latter is not fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Biased","review":"This is an extremely biased DVD put together by Christians for Christians. I thought it would be some \\"Discovery Channel\\"-type look at the historical facts surrounding the controversy, but it's not. Since viewing this, I have seen some other similar programs on The History Channel and The National Geographic Channel which are much more fair, and give both sides of the argument equal time. This one doesn't. It also has several facts wrong. If you are really interested in the history behind the controversy, buy something else. This is very one-sided and is only good for showing in a church basement during a revival meeting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medium well, a little dry...","review":"It is nice to see a reasonable discussion of Dan Brown's claims of factual representation. The main program on this DVD is only an hour long, so it cannot go into every aspect of the story. The main points of contention are discussed with scholars (Mr. Brown does not participate) who are knowledgeable in the various disciplines (art history, biblical accuracy, etc.) explored in this story. This documentary avoids the sensationism with which many alleged delvings into these 'mysteries' have been awash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the closed minded","review":"Fortunately I obtained this DVD from the library & didnt have to pay for it.

They do admit that the book is a great read but apparently everything Mr. Brown wrote is fiction based on his own delusions. They also seem to point to Mr. Brown as the only person to ever make claims like the ones in his book. I am an open-minded person and will gladly look into new ideas and possibilities. This dvd made me feel like a fool to do so. On the other hand, if you don't beleive anything in the book, then this dvd is for you. It might also help to let everyone know that at the end of the presentation, the narrator tells you that if you want to know the whole truth, you should seek your answers in a book you probably already have at home... the bible.

Elmore Leonard's 'The Switch' is one of his more convoluted works. A testament to late \`70's upper-crust living and a some shady characters quick-money scheme that falls flat - much like this book.Leonard's talent for developing personalities in small doses stands shaky in \`The Switch'. Leonard quickly develops Mickey Dawson, a well-to-do wife living the country club lifestyle in suburban Detroit. Her life is set on appeasing her husband, Frank, a real estate businessman with a penchant for golf and booze. When two ex-cons contrive an idea to kidnap the wife, the plot then takes a twist even the ex-cons didn't anticipate. The book's ending, which leaves you with some intentions, is uninspiring.Slow in reading and heavy in dialogue - leaning between insight and contemplation, this book is not one of Elmore Leonard's better offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"FEMALE AWAKENING","review":"Mickey Dawson is cute but naive.

And she really should know Frank is up to no good.Famed thriller writer, Elmore Leonard, looks carefully at Mickey's marriage in THE SWITCH and finds it empty. But Mickey takes a long time to get it. Rationalizing, she makes excuses. Numb, she avoids confrontation. Ignorant, she finally gets smart after meeting an ex-con with a botched up plan.But Mickey does grow and she doesn't get mad, she gets even.

Although Ben Heppner's voice may be considered large by todays standards it is small compared to Corelli and ESPECIALLY Del Monaco. In this age of state of the art recording equipment everyone sounds like they have a big voice. Mr. Heppner also lacks the core and squillo that Del Monaco and Corelli (and countless others) had. The ring in their voices is where all of the harmonics happen. It is these kinds of comparisons that have allowed the opera to decline to the level that it is today.

The Tanglewood Festival Chorus is everywhere as well-trained and refined as Shaw's, and in many places, more crisp. The RCA engineers do a suberb job at recreating the stereophonic experience of the four brass choirs, which, I must say, are quite precise in their rhythms. Finally, with no disrespect to the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, the Boston ensemble is simply more experienced; therefore, their color is more impressive. I just finished a weekend of performances of this work with Pierre Boulez and the Cleveland Orchestra, so I know how demanding (and rewarding, for that matter) the choral parts are. I am more and more impressed by the Tanglewood Chorus with each listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs a different tenor","review":"This is an excellent recording of the orchestral and choral parts of Berlioz' great Requiem. The brass especially comes through nicely for the most part. Unfortunately, I find the solo tenor almost painful to listen to. He has a voice like an angel, and in many ways this is, of course, particularly well suited to the subject matter. However, he is one of those singers who slides from one note to another--if he's moving up a fourth, for example, I guarantee you are going to hear every note in between. If this doesn't bother you, then fine, but I for one am going to look for a different recording of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning to casual listeners: Mostly unlistenable","review":"While the other reviews praise the quality of the performances, it is unmentioned how badly the dynamic range of the recording ruins the product. If you listen to it on headphones or in a dedicated room (I don't) it may be ok, but if there is ANY background noise at all, you will hear minutes of silence punctuated by blasts of trumpets and chorus, the Hosannah and little else.

Truly treasures. It's really unfortunate, though, that the transfer is so incredibly poor. Here's the worst part: the mastering engineer is proud of it.

Some of her private poetry is considerably more erotic and emotional than her previously published work and the new poems (over 100+) are the reason to buy this edition.

It will not be long however, for these to be right at his level.The concept of the books themselves is excellent. Fundamental truths of the gospel are presented in easy-to-understand language, acknowledging children's ability to grasp much more than we often expect. It is not without reason that Christ told us to come as little children...When I first received the books, I even found them refreshing for my own faith just to read through them.

That's why I gave it a one star. The biased, out of context teachings herein do not teach the Jesus of the Bible. Witnesses do believe in Jesus, but as a perfect man and not God. That puts them squarely in the middle of heresy, that of Arianism and Gnosticism. So, they do not believe in the Jesus of scripture but have set up their own version of Jesus. Muslims, non-messianic Jews and others do the same thing: They dispute Jesus own words and the witness of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.In John 1:1, they translate thus, \\"Jesus is a god\\", which is polytheistic.

I hated to put it down to go to work or to go to sleep! I enjoyed it for the story, the characters, the quality of the writing and the history of Africa. What an excellent job in all of these areas. The Courtney family is believable in their struggles, weaknesses and strengths. Wilbur Smith has ways to surprise readers without using absolute tragedies. He can make us fear the worst but save us from it. Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read the previous books about the Courtneys. Excellent reads. I was disappointed with this extension of the Courtney Saga from Wilbur Smith's previous work. Good story until Sean Courtney meets his wife to be, Katrina.

Almost all of Wilbur Smith's books show the beauty and mysteries that the the dark continent has to offer.

So I bought it and it was terrible. Someone should teach the frontman to sing, not growl.

Temirkanov makes the pounding, relentless March seem so malevolent. The Adagio is very fine and equals any other but the Finale brings out the 'divine retribution' element and is the most perfect epic-film music for those Soviet tanks, charging out onto the enemy. The brass tuning seems to mix in with the cacophony of War and brings out wild and even sardonic overtones, almost as if Dimitri S is trying to say \\"You think you have got Leningrad; just wait a while\\" Temirkanov is a master of balance of sonority like no other and he should be a great star. This disc has power, majesty, gravity and deep spiritual turmoil present and should not be missed.

It has mainly helpful topics on the main products of SS97. Where it falls short is on its teaching concepts (like Microsoft Press use of step-by-step approachs). Furthermore, it seems like the author used the older version of SS97 to write the book. Mainly, the book is poorly proofread (examples/formulas/concepts). They also fail to show you that Screencam is an included product of SS97 on the front cover!!! I feel like Sandra Eddy or another author should rewrite the book and make it more focused on SS97 applications (by thoroughly testing out examples and formulas with the updated Lotus 1-2-3 97 and included patches). Sybex needs to make a second edition of the book and do a serious rewrite. Otherwise, it provides decent help and is comparable to Lotus SS97 for Dummies (but not as fun reading!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under-whelmed","review":"Production quality was poor. It shows the form in essentially two sections. Although I admittedly know nothing of this particular style or of the demonstrator, I have been a practitioner of Nanquan for about 30 years. I am less than impressed with the demonstration including his posture (note the obvious head tilting throughout the form) and his footwork. Didn't seem to work together as an integrated whole. Aside from that, this is supposed to be an instructional DVD. Although I have no intention of trying to learn from it, this is not formatted to help someone achieve that goal. There is only demonstration of the form without a breakdown and explanation. There are absolutely NO applications shown for any of the movements, which would further clarify the intent of the movements in the form.

Raitt's operatic majesty, masculinity laced with self-hatred, and charismatic musicality jump out of my tinny little CD player. Michael Hayden is - and I hate to criticize any performer - downright anemic by contrast, as well as lacking utterly the pathos and complexity of Raitt's showstopping version. The use of a real opera voice, with Raitt, was a stroke of genius, as it contrasts so deliciously and painfully with Billy Bigelow's shortcomings of character.I cannot overstate this- DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS LONDON VERSION. Suffice it to say, it misses \\"the point\\" of the show.I will continue to explore other versions, as my love of and fascination with this show is endless.GET THE DECCA VERSION - \\"SELECTIONS FROM THE THEATRE GUILD MUSICAL PLAY,\\", instead.

Neither of them could sing to save their lives, and I've heard high schoolers perform \\"If I Loved You\\" better than that.

Right now I have a 26\\" flat screen TV, three game systems, a DVD player, cable box, and other things on it and I still have room. The DVD storage rack on each side is also really nice as well. The stand itself is very sturdy and open for air circulation (for the newer game systems that tend to overheat) and it looks really nice as well! It's absolutely perfect for what I need it for. Also, the other person that reviewed this item didn't have instructions with theirs. I did get instructions with mine, so I guess the other buyer was unlucky. I definitely recommend this TV stand for anyone that is thinking of buying it.Oh, another thing. The TV stand itself says that it was made for only flat screen TVs, but you could probably fit a smaller normal TV on it. As long as it's not a gigantic normal TV, it would work out OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"No directions on how to assemble this product","review":"Albny Plsm TV StdThis item was received from the seller on time to the shippers for me. I have just received the item in Barbados March 11, 2008 and was very excited to receive it but to my dissappointment on opening the box they are no instructions on how to assemble it. I have to go find someone who I think has a good idea on how to screw up all this little bolts and washers etc.in the right order. In other words we have to use trial and error to get this stand to function.

The original soundtrack, recorded in 1987, seems to be unavailable. This CD was done in 1994, and the arrangements, the order of play, and even many of the songs are different. Comparing the same songs with the original (which I unfortunately bought only on cassette) shows how much more creative and energetic the earlier version was."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok for young kids","review":"Don't buy this unit for a kid who truly knows what makes a \\"good\\" product.

For example, Mr. Murtha runs on and on about the importance of military intelligence, which is true enough, but since he was an intelligence officer, one must take that with a grain of salt. Largely, it's a book of his personal experiences, looked at through his own biases and self-promotion. Take it for what it is -- his story, subjectively told, and not a document of research, objectivity, or analysis.I give it two stars because taking it for what it is, it's nomt horrible, and it is mildly entertaining. But PLEASE, if you feel like you must read it, get it from the library rather than contributing to Mr. Murtha's wallet."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEVER FORGOTTEN!","review":"I read WALK IN MY SOUL many years ago and have never forgotten the heart and soul put in to each page.

I absolutely love the historical fiction of James Alexander Thom, and went looking for more historical fiction authors. This book was pretty difficult for me to wade through, to be honest. It took a long time, and I found it be extremely forgettable and unimpresive. Her style just doesn't work for me. I tried reading Light a Distant Fire and Ride The Wind, and couldn't fully get into those either.

It's basically a \\"slice of life\\" movie in which you view the movie through this character, since she is in almost every scence. It shows how her addiction destroys her relationship, friendship, job opportunities, and health.it was well written - using \\"everyday street language\\"; the film was so real it felt like a documentary to me.this is a must-see for those interested in substace abuse, addiction, and recovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"It feels fake","review":"I just don't see it. The reviews are good and that is why I bought the movie, but it's plastic, not real. It just touches on the surface of the addiction without going deep into the moral retrogression. Is like they had a checklist of things they needed to show and a short time to do it, so they just rush the action. I don't recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story","review":"This is an amazing story and video.

I will add that I did walk on the treadmill daily for 45 minutes (at least). So, I don't know how well the plan works without exercise.

The vast majority of it is cute and family friendly. But, for what ever reason, those who made this film, (which is obviously a Christmas time film aimed at families with children),decided to toss in one God-dishonoring profane phrase in one, and only one, scene.

She made me want to dance, sing, love, and LIVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Commentary on the Greek Text of Romans","review":"This commentary on Romans by Cranfield is by far the best ever written on the Greek text of Romans. His approach is to deal with each problem of interpretation by listing and describing the various options, then analyzing each in turn until he gives the reasons for his own conclusions. While you may not agree with his argumentation, you know that he has done a full analysis and presented good reasons for his views. Get both volumes, and forget the \\"shorter\\" one-volume edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great advice that you wish your Mom had given you","review":"If I could give this ten stars for the 10 great pieces of practicle advice that's given in the book, I would. Maria Shriver's book is a quick and easy read full of the \\"been there, done that\\" stories (some of them were really funny) from the lessons in life that she has learned. Some of the information in the book is common knowlege (get a job that you enjoy doing, learn how to manage your money). There are other grains of advice (don't be afraid to fail, don't even try to be SuperMom) that are true gems.

Nothing enlightening or earth shattering here. I sense that Maria didn't get any guidance at home or at school about how to survive in the real world. She was truly shocked when people told her \\"no\\" or \\"grow up\\". I felt sorry and embarassed for her as I read this. I think someone saw an opportunity to use Maria and her name to make lots of money. But she comes off looking arrogant and ignorant.The book is poorly written and the voice is bouncy, chatty, cheerleader style. Please don't insult your high school or college senior by making this book a gift to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness I didn't pay for this book -","review":"it was given to me by a well-meaning friend. I find it irritatingly arrogant for Ms. Shriver to think she can tell any of us about the real world since she does not now, and never has, lived in it. She simply cannot relate to the problems of the every-day woman and her trite words of advice do not offer anything that we do not already, in our heat of hearts, know. One cannot look at this woman, read what she has (maybe) written, and think she has anything in common with the life of the average woman.

Ten Things I Wish I'd Known-Before I Went Out into the Real World is a book that I think can help people on their way and to understand the point or meaning of life.In the end it's a very good book altogether and I recommend it to anyone and everyone who has troubles with preparing their future"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another book by a different author says it better","review":"In reading this book, I kept wondering, \\"But where I have heard these similar opinions and phrases?\\" Then I remembered, I'd recently finished a 1992 classic, Dr. Susan Jeffers book, Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway. Dr. Jeffers signature phrases are \\"I'm creative, powerful, and I have nothing to fear,\\" and her essential point throughout all her books is \\"I CAN HANDLE IT!\\" as she puts it -- the same phrases and advice Maria Shriver promotes as her own. Ms. Shriver's book is okay, but doesn't have the power, insight, originality of Dr. Jeffers, who includes very pragmatic exercises in her book and workbook to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ten reasons to be born a Kennedy","review":"I scanned this book for about twenty seconds before flinging it back on the best-seller table at Borders. Only a silly child of a privileged American dynasty could write such dribble. Aristocratic Europeans would hestitate to so boldly offer advice on how to succeed at life when your own contribution is mostly to be spring from a blessed womb. I very much doubt that little Maria has ventured very far into the \\"real world,\\" and I doubt very much that anyone could think of ten good reasons to buy this ridiculous book, unless you are a combination self-help addict and Kennedy sycophant.

It was easy to read and I could not put it down. She was honest, sincere, and generous in sharing her life experiences with the readers. I highly recommend the book to high school and college students. It will give them a dose of reality. Also, she emphasizes the importance of goal setting (figuring out what you are passionate about and going for it) hard work, and NEVER giving up or burn your bridges. It is full of real life experiences. Even at 49, I still learned something from the book. Who said you can't teach an old dog new tricks?It was very refreshing to read of how grateful and proud she was of her family, especially her mother and father. She gave them the credit they deserve.I hope Maria continues to write and remains on the air. She has alot to offer.

Here is a person whose uncle was President John F. Kennedy, one of the greatest Prsidents of the USA. Ms. Shriver has written a rather simplistic booklet on life. Her husband is the current governor of California. With all that experience one would think that a more sophisticated write would abound. However, we find this booklet a simple 20 minute read. One star is a gift to this \\"book\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book is not worth your time. As a recent college graduate, I bought the book, thinking some of Maria's insights might hit close to home. Instead, I found pages clogged with run-on sentences, and life lessons that were not insightful at all. Her \\"woah is me\\" attitude got old, as all of her stories of mistakes ultimately ended in self-praise. The book was entirely self-serving, and any reasonably intelligent person with some experience under his/her belt is alreadly well aware of Maria's pearls of wisdom. This Kennedy child should return to the Hilltop for another writing course and some much-needed grounding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational; A Quick Read","review":"I actually bought this book for my little sister as a high school graduation present in 2000. I have since read it myself, and rather enjoyed it. Maria Shriver appears to be down to earth, honest, and frank about herself. She freely admits she was handed everything on a silver platter in her life, but she did bust her butt and work her way up more than people think. She had an overbearing supervisor at one of her early TV stations who made it even harder for her because she was a Kennedy. Maria is actually grateful for the experience, because that makes you even more tough, focused, and determined to prove yourself, in that kind of situation. Every person deserves to tell their story in their own way, and Maria has done a wonderful job, in my opinion. This book also is a quick read, and worth reading if you're into this kind of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, Oh Why?","review":"Heaven help us all. As a recent grad, I received no less than 4 copies of this book, from well-meaning aunts and such. All I have to say is this...what pap! What unadulterated hackneyed tripe! Ms. Shriver is certainly graced with extraordinary self-confidence if she felt that it was appropriate to create and market this collection of fortune cookie platitudes. Maybe we should all take a lesson....this is America, and schlock sells....No matter how putrid an idea, someone will want to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ten things I wish I'd known","review":"I'm a femal reader, I think I expected more from this book.

I was not disappointed. A charmingly written little book, she gave amusing examples of the life she's led, the frustrations she's encountered in her different fields of living, and refreshingly does not belabor her relationship to THAT family, interesting as they may be. She presents some good advice, backed by personal examples, that she feels she needs to share with others. If you're looking for a quick and easy read, a book that will have you smiling throughout, then this is the book for you. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for those just starting to enter the real world.","review":"This book is perfect at this time in my life.

There is no need to run through it, jumping into kids and marriage.Take time to construct your life as you desire...most importantly take time to discover the real you!!

I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparkling debut","review":"The Noisettes debut is a breath of fresh air in the music market place. Only a trio, yet they can create a wild wall of discordant thrash in one moment and then be as tender and gentle as a baby in the next, with the vocals to match. In this respect, they remind me somewhat of Nirvana. Style wise, they've got the chops to do simple rock n roll like Don't Give Up through to the breathtaking musical gymnastics of Mind the Gap (jazz, blues, heavy rock, punk...). Highly recommended.A great debut album and I'm looking forward to the next one having a little more consistency in the songwriting (not that there's a filler on this one) and maybe stronger production, especially to make the most of Shingai Shoniwa's truly fantastic voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"JMill","review":"GREAT product!

I thought the first half was strong but the second half was weak. It disappeared into my CD collection only to resurface recently and boy could I have been more wrong. Upon second listen the first half is even better than I remembered it and the second half is just as good as the first half. \\"Jetpack Blues\\" has been a favorite live number of mine for a long time and comes across very true to form on the record. Other highlights include the track that was originally supposed to be the title track \\"Is This It\\" and the introspective masterpiece \\"Obsolete\\". I've found that sometimes the CD's you have to work hardest at are the one's you end up enjoying the most and that is certainly the case for me and \\"Jetpack Blues\\".

While they made impovements on \\"Kenny Blankenship's Top 25 Most Eliminations of the Season\\" over the season one set, the \\"Behind the Scenes of MXC leaves something to be desired as it doesn't really us how they put the show together (most of it is shows the voice actors in the recording room). Hopefully, we'll see more seasonal sets of MXC.A note about the edited show: Episode 12: Real Monsters Vs.

This CD is better written, is more melodically interesting, and has some definite stand-out tracks, especially \\"Thick Skin\\" and \\"Swan Song\\". A very interesting feature of this band is that all 4 members are songwriters. Singer Tara Sloane contributes one song (\\"American Dreamgirl\\"), but the rest are divided pretty much equally among the guitarist, bassist, and drummer. The only other band I can think of right now that shares songwriting credits so evenly is The Bears, an outfit that Adrian Belew co-founded back in the mid-1980's.I bought \\"Viberate\\" during the period I was waiting for \\"Metasexual\\" to come in the mail. \\"Metasexual\\" was the CD that came so highly recommended to me, but \\"Viberate\\" ended up being far more satisfying.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joydrop's Second Album","review":"Viberate, the second album from Joydrop, will be well received by those who enjoyed their first album, Metasexual. Viberate has a bit of a harder edge in terms of the music, but the lyrics are still beautiful and deep, although almost anything would sound beautiful when sung by lead singer Tara Sloane. All in all an excellent second album that fans will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Successful satire of the romance novel","review":"I found this gently satirical romance novel highly entertaining. I believe it will appeal to anyone who admires Charlotte Bront's masterly style. The hilarious sexual symbolism is perhaps less accessible to those who see the Victorian era through rose-tinted spectacles, as a time of general sweetness and light. The author comes down particularly hard on the local representative of the Church of England, portrayed as a philandering hypocrite. But anyone with the scantiest acquaintance with the sexual antics of nineteenth century missionaries in the South Pacific will appreciate that this is not merely the creation of a morbidly feverish imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous for Adults and Children","review":"This oven has a number of nasty features.

It would be very dangerous to allow children to operat this oven.The fan is VERY loud. The whole oven vibrates. The toasing function is very slow.

It is pricey but it was worth it to me for an appliance I use multiple times a day (I only like to microwave water). It isn't great for toast as it only really gets one side at a time and the door did stick occasionally but it worked great for cooking and reheating things. Yesterday (after just over 2 years of use) it stopped working in the middle of a toast cycle. After coming on here I was able to determine that it was the thermal fuse and was able to fix it, but I really expected better from such an expensive appliance. Without the internet I would have had to throw it away and that is unacceptable.Edit -Well, after another 8 months of use the controls broke so that it would randomly switch itself on and since the only way to keep it off was to unplug it I finally got rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD LUCK AT CLOSING THE DOOR!","review":"I have owned several Delonghi toaster ovens. THe convection feature is great, it is quick to cook and cooks evenly. However, the number one capability of any toaster oven should be the ability to open and close the door securely. After just several months of use, not to mention several hundred dollars spent, the doors of these ovens will not close all the way...this resulted in inconsistent cooking temperatures in the interior of the oven. In short, we could not trust the oven to cook something properly. For the money, Delonghi should be able to install a decent door latch...that is not asking for too much I don't think. Even a 19.00 Proctor Silex from Walmart has achieved this engineering feat.Also, the toaster function is very slow....my great grandmother can cook toast faster and she is blind, uses a walker, and cooks on a wood stove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working in less than two months of owning it","review":"I was pretty happy with this toaster oven until last night when it just stopped working while I was baking some potatoes.

She had gotten this oven last year as a christmas gift she picked out for herself after the previous one died (and it was about 5-6 years old).Not even a year later, this oven went Kaput.Calls to Delonghi sales service were apparently quite matter of fact and rude, something akin to \\"well, your warranty is expired, so go get it fixed.\\" Then she found out that getting the model fixed would cost half the price of the model. I do not feel that is conducive to keeping customers happy. She was quite displeased with Delonghi and as such, Delonghi ovens and other products will no longer be entertained as options by at least one suburban housewife/mother that I know of.As for its operation? yeah. it's an oven, it makes toast and it makes pizza and they taste good; but after about a year, it will die."},{"rating":"1","title":"bizarre theories from bizarre academics","review":"Just take Prof. Heschel, the daughter of a distinguished rabbi and scholar.

Even after flexing the case for several minutes to soften the leather, I cannot get the \\"short cut\\" button to work. Very frustrating.

First off, there is no cushion or protection on the inside of the case, so the stitching actually scrathes the finish on the front. Thankfully I had a screen protector on at the time, so no damage happened to the screen, which most assuredly would have, just to the buttons area.Secondly, the space cut out at the bottom of the product is there to allow you to attach the sync adapter, which you need to do in order to charge or to sync with your computer, doesn't align properly, so you have to remove the unit from the case.Third, but not least, the clear viewing area looks terrible.

And the best recorded ever (James Farber, ladies and gentlemen). How many different albums has Chris Potter been on now where he sounds great and totally different? Even from track to track, he makes you go who is this guy again?Jazz albums without drums can be real same-y after awhile, even Kenny's haven't been too hot (Angel Song for instance, nice but overrated). Not this one. Dave Holland picks you up by your seat and only lets you off into the cotton wrapped bronze that are the hands of John Taylor. Kenny has never sounded stronger and the tunes have that wistful bite of the ECM material, but with a real coppery shine. Yes, reverb, but less so. Never heard of CAMJazz before, but they have an interesting catalog.Highly recommended after just three listens. 5 Berets. Plus track 1 is named \\"Iowa City\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific CD marred by sound problems","review":"This recording presents an excellent drummerless quartet stretching out on eight tuneful pieces. Each player gets a chance to shine and all step up with outstanding solos on track after track. Anyone who is a Wheeler, Taylor, Potter or Holland fan should pick this up. Having said that, however, I must insert a caveat. There is noticeable clipping on some of the cuts, resulting in an annoying clickety clack in several places. At first, I thought this might just be Holland making an unusual amount of noise sliding up and down the neck of the bass, but unfortunately, it seems to be a recording artifact. So for that I dock the CD a star. I will approach other recordings from this company with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never Recieved this album Kenny wheeler What Now","review":"I am very dissapointed in how I have ordered this item and still yet to receive it.

It's very sensitive to slight movements on the controller. I was having a hard time getting it to move forward until I added some weight to the front of the nose. I tried a few things, including a dime, which caused it to zoom forward and hit the walls before I could turn it. Then it tried taping bits of aluminum foil to the front, adding bit by bit until I got the right amount of forward motion. Now I can drive it around the house with great control. The best toy I've bought for under $[...] in a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this RC Helicopter","review":"This is probably the best flying experience I have had with rc helicopters. I mainly fly rc planes, and have a 200 dollar helicopter that does not even come close to the instant gratification this product produces. Other indoor helicopters are difficult to trim and tend to produce large amounts of downward draft that make it very difficult to take off. The Airhogs Heli flew right out of the box. Took a little trimming and the included weights for some forward motion, but overall very easy to fly. I would recommend this Heli to all looking to start flying RC helicopters. I have probable crashed it into every piece of furniture I own, but it keeps on flying. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, what more do you want.","review":"I really don't understand why anybody would be upset with this heli. I understand if it just plain didn't work, but what does everybody expect from this pint-sized chopper. It is not supposed to be a stunt heli with loops and rolls and such. I have had it for less than a day and I want more. I had it hovering and flying in less than 30 minutes. Yes it mostly flies up and down and spins. It is also greatly affected by air movement and yes the battery does run down fast. So what? It doesn't take long to charge up and then fly all over again and again. I have crashed it so many times now I lost count, it still works like new. Yes, I have to do the trim adjustment of the tail every few crashes, so what that takes 5 seconds to do. I was even worried about the IR instead of radio control, there has been no problem. In fact, it was worked so well, I am very, very surprised.To put it simply, this is a fun toy. It is not a model aircraft. It is a flying toy. A great flying toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best toy I ever had !!","review":"I bought this for my 8 yr old daughter for Christmas. Both of us love this heli. Very very stable. Has crashed with walls and ceiling 60 times in the last 10 days and still working fine. Battery life is only 5 minutes, but that is sufficient amount of flying time. Also it recharges in 20 minutes. Stick a right amount of \\"fun tag\\" in the front of the heli to give it some forward motion and you can pretty much fly it wherever you want.This is the best toy I have ever played with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hogs are hogs","review":"Firstly you get only one where the picture makes you think you are getting three.

I couldn't have been more wrong. This little gem really flies great,and after a little bit of practice,you can make this thing do everything that it promises and more. I have owned several of these types of indoor helis. The first one cost me over $200.00 and was almost impossible to fly. I was amazed at how easy this heli was to learn how to fly,and how stable and solid it is. Yes,you will hit a few walls,crash to the floor,and in my case,get tangled up in a few hanging plants,while learning to fly this thing,but it can take it. I have crashed this thing 20 or so times and it has no signs of cosmetic or mechanical damage whatsoever. Still looks and flies like brand new. The box says \\"Ages 8 and Up\\".... LOL....

I bought 2 more (one for my dad and one for my grandpa for xmas) and we'll see how those ones work out, but right now i am very disappointed.Also, If youre buying more than one, you'll be better off buying them from a store because they sent me 2 of the same one, which means they cant fly at the same time (there are 3 channels that arent selectable like it claims... the remote is selectable but the helicopter is programmed with one channel, so 2 of the same wont work together. LAME!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Usless","review":"I consider this a real piece of junk.

He loves it. The fact that it can be flown indoor is especially nice. The only problem we have with it is that the trim does not seem to work well and it will not fly forward very well. It lifts off very easily and can hover, but no matter what we try, it will not fly forward. He still likes it in spite of that. For the price, it is a good toy for a child his age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Little Toy!","review":"This is the toy that began my interest in r/c planes and helicopters. It does take a little practice for anyone who isn't familiar with the controller but after 10 minuets I think you'd be set! This thing was hours of entertainment for me and I even flew it around my room when I was bored, no small feat my room is very tiny. The only problem I have with it, is that once the Li-Po battery wears down you are done, no replacement batteries. However they do last for a couple months and really are almost crash proof (I definitely put mine to the test).

My nephew opened it right away and started to fly it...he got it up in the air on the first try.

I would suggest having a bigger room to fly it in...as he was flying it around in the family room which is not very big. I have to say...it bounced off the ceiling...fell on the floor...and was made to fall on the floor to avoid hitting the ceiling several times. EVERYONE was amazed at how durable it is!!!!!! No broken parts! I am sure his Dad has had a blast with it also!!!! HA!!

However, within the first 1/2 hour of play, one had the little tiny piece that holds the propellers in place snap off. (It didn't even crash!) Thus, no more use for this helicopter. The other two are still working fine but now I am nervous about how long they will last. At $40.00 a piece this was an expensive 1/2 hour of play. As far as I can tell there is no way to order replacement parts. Needless to say we have a very disappointed teenager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in two days!","review":"Out of the package, this toy was pretty easy to set up. The learning curve for my 8 year old son was about 5 minutes who had figured out the \\"trim\\" functions and was able to fly this around the house like he had been doing it for years. The problem we had was the charge interface. There is a small charging wire that you pull out of a slide opening in the face of the remote. The wire then plugs in to a VERY small female receptor on the cockpit of the chopper. You need to make sure that the plug is pushed in the right direction, because you can push hard enough and make the plug go in either way...which I'm assuming is the reason our charger broke. We haven't been able to use it since (I'm in the midst of sending it back)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but cheap","review":"Very addictive and fun to fly, but after a few crashes, it's broken ;-( I can't understand why they would include a tail rotor replacement, but no main rotor replacement. After a few crashes, the main split. A little scotch tape patch up job got it flying again, but then the little weight on the stabilizer (upper propeller flew off and almost hit me in the eye. A little super glue got it flying again, but it didn't hold. It flew off somewhere and I think the cat ate it. This is the 3d Havoc I've owned, and they all break within a few days. If they would provide replacement rotors for the main, than I would go out and buy another one, but these little buggers are playing HAVOC with my bank balance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Inexpensive","review":"This a pretty wild little toy - it actually flies pretty well and can take all the abuse a beginner can and will hand out. It's small, so it won't knock over your wife's favorite vase. A previous reviewer remarked that the tail rotor lacks the power to control it, but there is a trim adjustment on the transmitter that takes care of this (unless his were defective). You definitely have to read the directions and it still takes time to learn to fly, but you'll be having a blast, even when it falls behind the bookcase (it is VERY small). The only drawback is that you get about 7 minutes of flying time per 30 minute charge. That might be a good thing - otherwise you'd be flying it around for hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Air hogs has way better choppers for the same money","review":"Peice of crap, would not trim out, crashed several times until it no longer took off due to damaged rotors. returned to the store for a refund and got the Sharpshooter model. much more stable design, trim actually works and it flies without crashing"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is for older kids or collectors only","review":"My two boys played with the helicopters and they flew around the house and crashed into everything and were broken within only a few days.

My son is very careful using remote control vehicles and is not rough. The first copter lasted 10 minutes until it hit a wall. The second lasted most of the afternoon until the propeller hit the Christmas tree branch and the plastic piece broke. It is a great concept but really cannot withstand normal bumps and blunders.

He plays with it every chance he gets (and I'm just as guilty!!)! It took a while to figure out the 'right touch' for the controls - they are very sensitive, so probably would be aggravating for a child. We placed a small amount of weight near the nose to help propel it forward better. Without the weight it mostly hovered. It has taken many, many crash landings and so far no damage!

It simply cannot accurately be turned and stopped like in the commercial. At first, flying this was challenging because the instructions say that turning left will make it go slightly forward, and turning right will make it go slightly backward. After a frustrating experience, I read that you can in fact adjust the forward/backward direction by bending the tail rotor to one side or another. I did this, and it turns out it is easier to fly when it is always going forward. Easier, but still not easy. The slightest wind will affect it drastically, and turning controls are very sensitive-sometimes the heli will wipe out because of it.

You can also only play with it for 5-6 miniutes and then you must charge it again.

He saw an ad for it on TV and wanted one, so I was excited that Amazon.com had it for a lower cost and free shipping. However, that was as far as the \\"good\\" went. My dad was disappointed to find out that not only could the Havoc Heli not pick up and fly with the accessories that came with it, but it had a difficult time flying without any \\"extra weight\\". This helicopter has no risk of creating any havoc. But, it does make a cute little paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I can think of many other better ways to spend 30 dollars than on this piece of garbage. The unit will not trim out, it is near impossible to fly because all it wants to do is auto rotate. (spin).

The kids were so excited to give them this awesome toy, but it was short lived. The second day one of the wings broke on one of the helicopters, and by the end of the following day, the other one wouldn't keep a charge or stop spinning in circles. I considered exchanging them, but I don't think I would have any different results, considering it was both of them that crashed and burned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible piece of junk","review":"We bought three of these for Christmas--what a HUGE disappointment. They do not fly worth a darn. One never ever got off the ground. The two that did fly could not be steered or controlled. They were endlessly bashing into the ceiling and then plummeting to the floor. They seemed fun for a few minutes until it became apparent that it was not a question of learning how to fly them--they just stink! Within two hours, the blade on one helicopter broke off after hitting the wall. All three went back to the store.Skip this one and get the Syma S107Syma S107/S107G R/C Helicopter - Bluefor about the same price. It's a MUCH better helicopter. You can steer it, control how high it flies, maneuver around the house--even under tables and chairs. The Syma helicopter even lands rather than crashing! I can't say enough good things about the Syma helicopter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even work!!!

The guy demonstrating it in the store made it look like a piece of cake.

It just spun. And not for long, either.

It worked great right away and took her about half hour before she could fly it nicely. One caveat is that it cannot fly outdoors during day time (infrared remote), so one needs a large empty indoor space. It's not 100% controllable, so small crashes cannot be avoided. So far (over a month) it's being holding up well (I had to use glue a few times) but overall it has been a lot of fun for the price. Battery life (5 to 6 minutes per 20 minute charge) is as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make the Man/Boy in Your Home Happy","review":"Got this for my husband for Christmas, and he has hardly stopped playing with it. So far, very durable - it has been crashed into lots of stuff and \\"caught\\" by the dog a few times with no signs of damage or impediment to performance.

Exceeded my expectations for quality and fun at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This toy was less than 24 hours old when the battery wouldn't recharge, so the helicopter would not fly.

Reason: It is designed for kids, but when kids use it, it is not mechanically designed to survive the first day of use.

He was excited and was extremely careful with it. He likes to collect toys, so after playing with it on 3 or 4 occasions he put it back in the box and onto his toy shelf. About 2 months later he took it out to play and it would not charge. The connection light (between helicopter and controller) doesn't light. There was no damage to the plane or controller and we followed all instructions to the letter. When I called the company in Canada the first week of April they told me the warranty was up and that I could buy a new plane (without controller) for $[...] and it would ship when it became available. I am extremely dissatisfied with the durability of this item. Non-functional after 1 hour of total play??? Ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great!","review":"Sure, it's hard to control. But then, so are frisbees and cats, but they're fun to play with, too! I've had mine for less than a day and I already have a little bit of control over it. Moreover, it's really interesting just to see the engineering that went into this little thing. I don't have experience with any other toy helicopters, but I really like this one. And yes, it would be more fun to have more control over where it goes, but for $40, I wasn't really expecting a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"sorry-but this is definitely not worth the price of $ 40 !!!Takes a lot of adjustment-then time to cool the Batteries after flying-then charging time-then ONLY 5 minutes of playtime-no fun for kids at all.

Loved this toy...must make sure it is charged before using.Problem is ,it is for indoor use and we live in an NYC apt. and this beautiful and delicate helicopter, strongly resembling a dragon fly and all it's beautiful gracefulness as it flies....was not tough enough to with stand the confined space and finally made it's way into a torcheire lamp, burned part of one wing, still worked even so and then.....poof....it just fell apart one day.

But indoors a lot of fun. I wish the blades were a little more durable. I've cracked two of them total from hitting into things or falling from high altitudes. But the body holds up pretty well.

I wish they had these when I was a kid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this thing is amazing","review":"Well worth the $30. Not for illiterates or heavy-handed lummoxes.

The smaller size and manauverability are what got my attention. I've had it for a few weeks now and am somewhat disappointed. It is not nearly as manauverable as I thought it would be, even with the small nose weights added. It basically just goes up and hovers around eradically. Having operated the Bladerunner helicopter, I was used to being able to land it where ever I wanted and having full control. I would consider this an uncontrolled toy and not a true remote control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy for a Reasonable Price","review":"I gave this helicopter to my 52 year old husband and 15 year old daughter for Christmas. It works amazingly well. Both had them up and flying in no time and were able to steer the copters through doorways and up the stairway.

After that there was no problems and the entire family had fun flying them around, even my 80 year old father and my 9 year old niece."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG disappointment","review":"The landing gear fell off as we took it out of the box. We carefully read the instructions, which wasn't easy because they read like they've been poorly translated from Japanese. Charging worked, but that was it. Mostly the helicopter just sat on the floor and spun. Following the instructions (we think), we tried the trim controls on the remote, but we might as well have been pressing the room's light switch for all the good it did. We tried trimming the tail according to the instructions, and the tail promptly broke. Piece of crap!

Two months later and I'm still playing with it almost every day. A little hard for a kid to fly as they usually just crank on the power and scrape the ceiling.

They had these things up in the air within minutes. It was very easy for them to figure out. These Helicopters got more play time than any of the other toys (Guitar Hero, Nintendo etc). Even more impressive is that they seemed indestructable!

Excellent value for what you get.","review":"They look a little flimsy at first glance, but after you try them you'll realize they're tough and fun to play with.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but disappointed","review":"Picked up one of these for my son, it was the first thing on his very short Christmas list. He was so excited for about the first 15 minutes until it stopped working.

It seemed like a really neat toy for the short time it worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fun Fun","review":"This heli is a blast. Takes a bit to figure out how to control, but once you got it, you'll be charging it over and over again and anticipating your next flight. The battery lasts exactly as long as my attention span (4-6 minutes). I liked it so much, I went out and bought the Air Hogs REFLEX. It's even more fun (but costs almost $40 more)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish you could steer it","review":"Bottom line: this is a neat little toy - and takes a LOT of abuse. As a matter of fact, I spent extra money to buy spare rotor blades - but have yet to use them - even after numerous crashes.The bad news: there's no way to make it go forward/backwards. You can control up/down and cancel out the spinning rotation (hence your two controls on the RC controller) - but there's no control to cause forward/backward motion.One reviewer said he put a small weight on the helicopter's nose to force a forward motion. But when I tried it - even with weights as light as a dime - it made the copter unusable in flight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for Old and Young alike!","review":"I bought this for my 8 yr old son's birthday. He totally flipped out being that he wasn't expecting to get it! He did have a lot of fun with it, that is until the adult men at the party took over the controls!! My best friend's husband bought one to take to work and plays with it daily. This is a pretty durable little helicopter, however, we need to replace the tail prop as it did break off after many crash landings. I didn't think it would have lasted as long as it has before breaking something. However, replacing the props are a quick fix to return to the fun! The top prop (whatever it's called) broke as well, but hubby used some 2 part epoxy glue for hobby airplanes and it worked just fine. It's well worth the money as it forced my son to use patience and learn how to fly it. He really has enjoyed it. Almost as well as the adults.... :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Havoc Heli that isn't worth it!","review":"Had great fun with the helicopter for one hour.

Typically the CIA classifies and stonewalls to death anything that would implicate them in any way. In this case the documents are out and the CIA can't deny it so they admit to some parts of it.

He also spends much of his time making Blandon, Ross and other drug dealers look like decent human beings when in fact they were nothing but criminals; but you understand why he makes them out to be good guys when you realize that they are his primary sources. Let's not forget the gaps where there are absolutely no sources, sometimes up to 8 pages without a source.

The only group I really wanted to hear was Weezer, but they were one of the biggest let downs on the entire thing!

THerre are some interesting versions of thier songs (Wave of Mutilation, The Holiday Song, and even Nada Surf doing Where is my mind), but the only reason ANY of these stand up is because of the Pixies song writing. All of the bands just plain suck. I'm hoping the less major label Pixies Tribute coming out will be better. These bands are just crap.

Superdrag's cover i like but their cover sounds a lot like the original. Eve6 does a great job by covering Allison in acoustic. Nada Surf does a very good job by doing a slower and quieter version of Where is my mind?. Weezer, in my opinion, does a better job of Velouria than the Pixies. Get Up Kids sounds like it's blended better than the original and sounds cleaner. Reel Big Fish's cover of Gigantic is ok but I am not sure if they are making fun of it or just trying something new.

He loves all of my imperfect parts, so I have no problem believing the same of Jake. I was also glad to see that this story was not a rehash of \\"The Horse Whisperer\\" - that part of the plot lurks in the background and is only used as needed to further the human relationship.

Even though its only fiction, it makes people who are not a size two enjoy the book.Its great how Jake finds her so attractive. They have the best chemistry together. Its great how she finds him after a ten year bad marriage. I think in our lives, we all want a man like Jake.

I also got a little tired reading about how appealing an overweight - plump woman was to the hero.

Wills is a good writer, and he CAN be a good historian. But when he deals with issues pertaining to his own religion, there certainly appears to be a big blind spot. The visceral replaces the analytical. Arguments give way to screeds. And political correctness displaces objectivity. Even for those of us who agree with his positions against the Roman Pontiff (I'm not Catholic), it's clear that this book should have been thoroughly overhauled, if not deep-sixed, instead of being published as is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polemics, Not Scholarship","review":"Readers of Papal Sin should be aware that, although the book bears a physical resemblance to a work of scholarship, it's mere angry polemics. Wills consistently ignores serious authors who argue--and, often, demonstrate--theses that contradict him. The treatment of matters like Vatican Council I and the Humanae Vitae debate will not impress anyone familiar with the literature on these topics. A pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is never bad to further the conversation regarding one's","review":"To be sure, Papal Sin is a one sided approach to many complex issues, and historical church situations. Wills will be criticised for this. Still, there are many more works done in more agreeable fashion that have been presented unquestioned. It is not news that the Vatican Curia is human and often weak. What is new is the forum for discussing this. Not a few Catholics have been put off by a Vatican \\"attitude\\" that reflects an almost disrespect for the everyday believer, as was done when the present pope declared that women in the priesthood could not be even discussed. I think that Wills has put his finger on a real , and unfortunate dynamic in the approach of the church in modern times. This does not discredit the church, and the true believer will find the avenue to love her still. It makes us better believers to understand the weaknesses. Will's book is a good tool for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another point of view","review":"Philip Jenkins' recently-published book \\"The New Anti-Catholicism: the last acceptable prejudice\\" discusses the startling phenomenon of self-professed \\"Catholics\\" who, while rejecting the basic elements of the Catholic Faith as it has been understood for many centuries and giving vent to the sorts of anti-Catholic diatribe one associates with protestant fundamentalists of the most hair-raising variety, manage to avoid charges of bigotry because, after all, they are \\"loyal sons and daughters of the Church\\"! Jenkins offers some useful criticisms of Wills' pronouncements and those of other dissenters who, while seemingly tailor made for membership in the Episcopal Church in America (or some other mainline protestant organization), perversely cling to an ersatz \\"Catholic\\" identity. This phenomenon is one of the more impenetrable mysteries of modern life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garry Wills' Book: A Structure in Deceit","review":"This book is nothing but an angry book about the Catholic Church. Just what religion does Garry Wills see as evolving from this effort? He doesn't believe in priests, doesn't believe in the Real Presence, advocates abortion, amongst other things. This isn't even a book about Popes!If Garry Wills considers himself a \\"Catholic\\" I think he should read the Catechism of the Catholic Church and see exactly what it means to be Catholic.Garry Wills has no faith in God.

This book, however, will probably not open a conversation. I believe it was Thomas Aquinas who advised disputants to take the opponent's position, so that one's own position could be re-examined and thereby solidified--or recast. Wills does not present a scholarly examination of the issues. I began to flip through the pages. People don't like to be shouted at--even those who essentially agree with the criticisms raised. I was disappointed in the presentation. I had expected argument and found vituperation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"selected\\" history that is misguided and jumbled.","review":"This book starts off promising, but takes two wrong turns after the halfway point of the book. First, the chapters on homosexuality and abortion read as ultra-lefist Catholic bashing until he seems to turn about face at the end of the chapters. Second, the last part of the book on St. Augustine seems out of place. I can kind of see what Willis was doing here, but it is a bit of a stretch. In sum, this book is \\"choppy\\" and frequently strays off the course of its purported thesis. It has its moments, but not enough of them to warrant spending too much time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Structures of Willsian Deceit","review":"This work is not a scholarly look at the papacy. It is a tantrum with footnotes by an anti-Catholic Catholic. While cooing how much he loves the Church, he systematically denies the most basic Catholic doctrines on Christ, Mary, and the Church. His rage know no bounds. He attacks the canonization of Edith Stein, claiming her death had nothing to do with her being a Catholic. In fact, she was killed because she was both Catholic and Jewish; like other Catholics of Jewish descent, she was sent to Auschwitz after the Dutch bishops denounced the Nazis from the pulpit. He claims that the majority of bishops of Vatican II supported contraception; in fact, they explicitly criticized contraception in Gaudium et Spes. He can't even get his facts straight on noncontroversial issues. Where does one find the infancy narrative in Mark? A sad piece of self-hatred, but his masters at New York Review of Books are surely delighted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Papal Sin","review":"If you are a Catholic hater, and want something to fuel your hate, this is the book for you.

The author is an accomplished wordsmith, and he has succeeded in writing a readable and entertaining volume. One wonders, though: \\"What's the point?\\" Is it really a man-bites-dog story that the human being is capable of deceipt? Or is it a great revelation that some who have been given power tend to misuse it. Lord Acton said as much, and much more succinctly. I conclude that Wills wrote this book just for the sake of creating a sensation. He failed. His findings should surprise no one. Nor do they have any bearing on the matter of infallibility. The Church has claimed infallibility of the Pope; she has never claimed impeccability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catholic Anti-Catholicism","review":"Will's book must make Dave Hunt and Jimmy Swaggert proud. In his evident, and long-running, anger at the Church for not approving contraception he attempts to undermine the authority of the papacy with its alleged sins. The authority of the papacy is no more undermined by these real or alleged papal sins than the presidency is by Bill Clinton's real or alleged sins. However, not only is this ad hominem argument a logical fallacy, it is also a theological fallacy, since Christ did not promise impeccability to his Church, only infallibility and indefectability. The result is that Will comes off as a purveyor of gossip, rather than a journalist. Both the faith and the papacy will easily survive this little temper tantrum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Misleading","review":"I was terribly disappointed with the content of this book. The author presents his \\"theories\\" as factual historical information. It seems to me that he wrote this book simply out of spite for the Catholic Church. Any scholar who is familiar with the history of western civilization and the Catholic Church's hierarchy knows these stories Wills presents, to be totally false. Several examples he gives in the book are completely fictional and give a powerful weapon against Catholics, if only his stories were fact instead of fiction. This book is a complete waste of ones time if they are looking to learn about the history of the papacy or the Catholic Church. Look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritually Challenged Hierarchy","review":"The roman catholic church is run by a bunch of spiritually challenged men who in order to save their own necks have distorted history, tradition, and scripture.

The problem is that he tries to sell the reader on a different vision of the Church, the Church of Gary Wills et. al. and he does this with all the zeal of a televangelist. No Roman Catholic, progressive or traditional would recognize Wills' new (or \\"reformed\\" to give him his due) Church. It would be a church without Sacraments as we understand them today, without teachings grounded in absolute truth, and where conceivably women priest may avail themselves of abortion. It is ironic how Wills' in \\"Necessary Evil\\" almost scolds us for not trusting big government, now cautions us against the Church structure. I don't think the Catholic Church needs to hide from its failures, both past and present and with John Paul II we need to seek forgiveness, but to ask us not to be Catholic is beyond what should be expected from us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative but Excellent","review":"I won't waste space here to repeat what the critics and admirers have stated here about Wills' book. Bottom line is that it is a thoughtful, mature and indeed spiritual book that takes a fresh look at the Roman Catholic Church. While sometimes a bit too arcane for me, I am nonetheless familiar with the wide spectrum of views of loyal Roman Catholic theologians on matters of faith and morals, and Wills brings home that reality. This might be a surprise to some who think Catholicism is monolithic in its thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and unfair","review":"The book is a simple bash the catholic church book by someone who disagree's with the church's teachings on a variety of issues . It points out sins of bad popes and it simply makes some other stuff up . It doesn't give a fair look at all the pope's in history especially the present one . If you already hate the catholic church and it's teachings this is for you , however if you want only the facts and not biased propoganda then don't waste your time or money ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceit","review":"If there is any deceit in the Catholic church it is on the part of Mr. Wills. It used to be that bigotry came from without now it comes from within. Mr. Wills is no longer Catholic and has no business receiving the sacraments. He wouldn't get them in my parish. If you want to know the truth about the Catholic church this is NOT the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age Religion","review":"A book about the New Age Spirituality and direct from Yale University. These are the same old thoughts half truths emerging from the global village. Do not waste your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Smug self-righteousness & sophomoric scholarship","review":"As a former student of Prof. Wills, let me speak on behalf of several other alumni, and say how ashamed we are of the gaffes and goofs throughout this book (I lost track after counting over two dozen). What can explain his arrogant tone and sophomoric style? We're all at a complete loss.Wills used to demand more from his undergraduates. But that was before he embraced his new faith as a convert to Democratic liberalism. Since then, he's embraced sophomoric apologetics for such infallible dogmas as gay rights, abortion rights etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another masterpiece by Garry Wills","review":"This book is a well-reasoned and compassionately critical history of the Vatican's methods of intellectual self-deceit. It deftly considers the sources of these 'structures of deceit', and their sequelae for the Church as a WHOLE -- not just the hierarchy. Every Catholic should read this book and seriously consider its points.This book also continues Wills' brilliant ongoing elucidation of St. Augustine's thought (which begins in Wills' \\"Confessions of a Conservative,\\" and comes to full flower in his recent book, \\"St. Augustine\\"). Here's hoping Garry Wills continues to bring Augustine of Hippo to contemporary readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wills trades-in RC for PC","review":"Coming from a protestant background, I didn't care about \\"orthodox opinions\\" as much as facts. Apparently, Wills cares little for either. As I read this book, I kept wondering if the author ever stopped writing long enough to figure out that he was writing about a faith that he no longer holds. Yet, it's not as though he lost his religion. He simply traded it in for a new one. This became obvious once I noticed how he unquestioningly accepts every \\"politically correct\\" dogma of democratic liberalism, and with such docility. Then, he turns around and uses his new-found infallible authority to clobber his old one. Honest and courageous? Only for fellow devotees and fawning reviewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Troubling, but it needs to be said","review":"Garry Wills is not a hatchet man. This book is not an unfair attack, nor are its criticisms unfounded. Wills discusses in detail the problems confronting the Catholic church today and adds some intriguing problems that are not yet widely discussed, but which probably will be in the near future.This book is a must-read for any Catholic concerned about the state of his/her church. Furthermore, the reader needs to ask the question that Wills is unable to address effectively: if a believer begins to reject elements of Catholicism on the grounds that they are impure or of strictly temporaly origin, is that person still Catholic?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading","review":"I have just finished this book, and have now read the online reviews of it. It really appears that most of those who gave it one star have not actually read it. One reviewer makes his own ad hominem attack on Wills for what the reviewer sees as Wills' ad hominem attack on the Popes. Actually, Wills' arguments are far from ad hominem: he is careful to base each argument on Scriptural authority and on the practices of the early Church. Looking to the early Church is hardly what one would call \\"PC,\\" as another reviewer does. An excellent and thought-provoking book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pope Gary?","review":"I found this book too shallow and too predictable to finish. This is yet another in a long line of books bashing the Church, usually written by cultural Catholics who lack the humility to truly examine their faith. Whatever spritit is moving Mr. Wills, I doubt it is a holy one. If you are looking for substance, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but Anger","review":"What I hoped would be an informative, well-written book turned out to be nothing but a vitriolic bashing of the Roman Catholic Church. Mr. Wills manipulates scripture quite well to uphold the points he attempts to make. Unfortunately, those even moderately familiar with scripture will recognize the manipulation, as entire verses on the subject are intentionally left unquoted. For example, Mr. Wills claims that the papacy \\"invented\\" the concept of the Holy Eucharist being the truepresence of Christ. If Mr. Wills had only quoted the apostle Paul completely, readers would have learned that Paul himself acknowledged this fact. I am not Roman Catholic, so my question to Mr. Wills is, if he doesn't like the heat (in the Roman church) why doesn't he get out of the kitchen?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Papal Confusion","review":"The convoluted series of essays by Wills really misses the point. The inherent hierarchy of guilt created by the Church is ignored and philosophical gibberish invades our logic. A tough read with little enlightenment. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious and predictable","review":"Gary Wills is a smart guy--his books on Chesterton, Lincoln at Gettysburg and St Augustine are first rate--but it seems he has come to accept the rather tiring and annoying liberal agenda of the late twentieth century. His last books (with the exception of the book on Augustine) are different versions of the same late twentieth century liberal narrative. In effect hee is writning the same book over and over again. It is true that like many liberaltheologians Wills wants to be his own Pope. One wonders why he chooses to stay in the Catholic Church--after all no one is forcing him to and he knows the rules. He reminds me of a tennis player I knew who demanded four serves because he did not like the first two. Sorry but the rules say two. If you don't like it go and make up your own game."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Klan does it better","review":"At least the Klan doesn't pretend to be intellectual when it is crudely anti-Catholic. The usual haters of the Church and morality will love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A counterfeit by any other name ...","review":"By exposing their more than obvious apostasies of the past, can the Roman Catholic church become a new and improved 3-dollar bill?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why This Book?","review":"What was the whole point of writing a book just to make people feel bad about their Church? \\"Papal Sin\\"? Come on, this book is not only totally biased, but it seems to bare no point, as Wills doesn't say that Papacy is evil or anything, he does say it has its mistakes though. But doesn't every religion have its mistakes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"same old rhetoric","review":"Same old silly agruments. We have heard it all before. I can't imagine why anyone would bother to write such silliness. I did not think that Wills carried around so much psychic debris...including anger and guilt...but it is obvious that he does...big time! Don't bother to read this book. Instead do some that would be more constructive...like shine your shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did it take him so long?","review":"As I write, somewhere on this planet a Christian is being murdered for the crime of being a Christian, as hundreds are every single day. Under those circumstances, Papal Sins is not a clever polemic, not a timely critique, nor a first-rate piece of work (Wills has never writtena nything first-rate; a piece of work cannot rise above the level of its source). It is, quite simply, a sin.Wills might want to think about that a bit before he next faces an altar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Addition for Small Households","review":"The EO1251 is particularly useful for 1-2 person households, as it is a terrific little oven and an adequate toaster. I can't give it 5 stars until the designers improve the setting knobs, which are stiff and provide too small a finger grip for turning, and add a second rack to provide more placement options. To get the most reliable toast results, one needs first to warmed up the toaster settings. While the Cuisinart convection oven gets the higher ratings, some users I know have complained of the need to vet the equipment thoroughly, as it gives off an unpleasant chemical smell on initial usages. Fortunately, the DeLonghi has no such drawback. I also appreciate the simplicity of its settings; it's easier just to turn a knob in the morning than have to face the Cuisinart's digital pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delonghi = defective by design","review":"We had a rude awaking today, our Delonghi toaster was on fire. I will never again buy any Delonghi product. The defective design is in the toast switch. It is mechanical. When it finishes toasting, it sometimes continues to the \\"Always On\\" position thus leaving the toaster oven on toast: very, very hot. We literally had a house full of smoke & a toaster full of flames. These Delonghi toasters need to be recalled. You were warned.Funny thing is, Delonghi makes an attractive product.Sad thing is, they can cost you your house or worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre performer, did not last","review":"Purchased this from Amazon in Dec. of 2005. Good looks, good control layout. Plenty of racks and such. Shape does accommodate a pizza perfectly.Problem areas: Thermostat is wildly inaccurate by about 20* too low. Convection fan causes a hot spot in the back of the oven, so it actually increases the chance of burning something. Adequate for minor toasting and baking chores, but no more than that - and certainly no faster than anything else out there.After 15 months of regular but no heavy use, it just died with no warning.Not a recommended purchase unless you also get the extended warranty, but even then, it's a matter of whether one can tolerate the operational issues and problems noted above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after six weeks","review":"I ordered this oven in mid-November, and it worked beautifully for six weeks -- made evenly-browned toast and heated frozen foods quickly. Then, suddenly, after six weeks, the unit completely died. Just wouldn't turn on anymore. I called the company, and was told I would have to take it to a DeLonghi service center, but there aren't any in Manhattan -- I would have to travel quite a distance to get it repaired. Given this turn of events, I cannot recommend this product -- and for anyone living in Manhattan, I wouldn't recommend any DeLonghi products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 3 weeks","review":"I am SO disappointed with this oven. I received it as a Christmas gift and used it several times over a three week period. I was thrilled with the way it worked, but last night in the middle of my dinner prep...it quit! I called the DeLonghi customer service number today and was told that without proof of purchase the oven was considered out of warranty. I am so angry I'm shaking. With poor customer service like that they certainly won't have me as a return customer. I will NEVER buy another DeLonghi product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely quit in less than a month!","review":"I ordered this as a Christmas gift. It was used as a toaster three times and as an oven once. After only a few weeks in use it died completely in the middle of trying to use it.

I guess this goes to the dump!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this has broken down in just a few weeks after purchase","review":"The DeLonghi E!1251 oven/toaster is lovely and I love it but it never works for long. I've been through two, the last one having broken down today, one month after purchase. It just shuts down, no explanation. And I can't find anyone here in Manhattan who can repair it. Why should it do this? I buy it and then I toast and bake and enjoy it and then - whoosh! It stops working.Any suggestions? Can I get a refund, or at least someone to help pay for the repair? By accident, you guys sent me two last month and I returned the second, unused one. I was going to keep it, figuring this would happen but I didn't want to spook it so I sent it back.HELP!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well until the knobs broke...","review":"just a couple of months in, the on-off dial quit working and the oven would no longer turn on.

I never found it to be good for toast as it took forever and toasted unevenly. But it came in handy now and then. However, two days ago I went to make some bagel pizzas for the kids and while the tick tick of the timer sounded, nothing else worked properly. I tried several outlets. Wasn't the issue. No lights and no heat.I usually read reviews before buying appliances. Either this was so new that the reviews weren't out yet or I bought on impulse. Either way, I'm disappointed. We've had this maybe 2 years...??I think I'll be checking out another brand for the next toaster oven."},{"rating":"1","title":"loved it until it died on me","review":"bought mine from Bloomingdales for about $60 about 1.5 yrs ago.

I bought this in November 2008 to replace it and on April 2009 smoke started to billow out of the vents of the oven as the wiring shorted out and the house filled with smoke. Lucky I was standing nearby to unplug it and rush it outside the house. I am a huge DeLonghi fan and have owned and used their products for decades with excellent results. This is the first time that I have ever had a problem. I noticed that I am not the only one here that had the oven fail prematurely. Let's see how well DeLonghi takes care of my problem. I will post an update if that happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was good while it lasted","review":"This toaster oven worked great while it lasted which is less then three years!

I bought the service agreement and it had to be brought it for service twice. The third time, Thanksgiving morning, it died again. The service centers are few and far between and although it cost $10 for the service agreement, it cost $40 each time for gas/tolls to drop it off and repair the piece of junk!!I will never buy and De Longhi product again.

It keeps perfect time.That said, the band that came with it tried to eat my wrist. My skin first got scales, then turned red and just got worse until I took the watch off.

It looks worse than the leather band on the $12.95 Wal-mart casual watch band that I wore for 3+ years. This watch now looks like a cheap knock off. The band is cracked and pealing already. The timepiece itself appears fine and keeps accurate time - so far.If the band is indicative of the quality of the rest of the watch, I am probably already on \\"borrowed time\\" with this timepiece.Citizen should be ashamed of putting something on the market like this.

As a few one-star reviews have previously commented, the \\"day of the week\\" complication would not work; the subdial was simply stuck on \\"SUN\\". Being the optimistic guy that I am, I exchanged the item and gave Citizen another chance. My disappointment turned to frustration when I received the second watch a few days later, and it too had a faulty \\"day of the week\\" complication.I'm sad, because I really wanted to give Citizen a good review and enjoy their product.

Is there something I'm missing???"},{"rating":"1","title":"only one worth watching","review":"hi all, I have been waiting for \\"The Mole People\\" to come out on dvd for a long time. I had it on vid, but gave away the player. I don't have much money now, so I am dissapointed that it's only offerred in this large, and largely worthless, collection. The Mole People is not typical \\"campy\\" 50's sci fi. It's interesting and intelligent, with wonderful and creative script, sets, costumes, make-up, acting, and even, like the narrator says at the begining, a message for all of us. I think some talented, blacklisted people found themselves working on this low-budget, B-movie type project and put their best into it regardless. So if you have money to throw away on the rest of the silly trash in the collection, by all means buy it for this one gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"More on technical difficulties","review":"I'm not writing a review of the movies here. Anyone who would order this set loves campy old sci-fi movies just like I do. I do not recommend this set because I can't play parts of some of the movies and I can't play any of others. So, I didn't get all of the movies I paid for here. Reading other reviews, I find that I am not alone. You don't find out that the discs are defective until after you open the package Amazon's policy is that you can only return them if the package is unopened. My advice is to buy and watch campy old sci-fi movies, but not this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Universal classics review","review":"The transfers of these films are nothing short of amazing. The Land Unknown, The Deadly Mantis, The Incredible Shrinking Man, Tarantula, The Monolith Monsters and Dr Cyclops are the best films in this set. Cult of the Cobra sounds exciting but it's a big let down same with The Monster on the Campus. The Mole People is an okay film but not up to the standards of The Land Unknown which is also in this set. The Leech Woman I have'nt watched it yet. The dvd's were lacking on extras but that's nothing new the video presentations of these films more than makeup for it and the packaging was porrly done but other than that it's a nice collection of 1950's sci-fi films and highly recommend it to sci-fi fans or fans of giant monster movies. A great way to start a collection of American made monster movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is a great set of movies. My fave is the shrinking man.

It is well-written and every chapter held my interest. There are many thought provoking concepts that make great discussion topics. They certainly do not make good debate topics unless you are much more well-read on the topic.

I'm not a Christian - I'm not even religious in any regard, but the ideas contained within this book should at least be heard and contemplated by thoughtful people of all persuasions.

It has that corporate \\"Buena Vista Social Club\\" feel about it. What really put me off is the initial interviews with the \\"real music fans\\" in the record store. These were obviously scripted responses(\\"No, who ARE The Funk Brothers!\\") to simple questions (\\"Do you know who The Funk Brothers are?\\") - also, the way it was filmed is mighty annoying. The director uses that \\"Ken Burns pan effect\\" throughout this film, and everything looks way too perfect. There are a couple of touching scenes in the old Motown studios, but overall I was left with a vacant feeling. Plus, am I mistaken, or is Berry Gordy almost completely absent from this film? Watch it if you're a hardcore Motown fan, otherwise just spend your money on a good Motown compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"DVD has \\"regional coding\\" and will not play on dvd players in US and Canada.

There is at least one ten minute jazz version, without a singer, of \\"My Favorite Things\\", from THE SOUND OF MUSIC on cd somewhere---so why couldn't the motown guitarists, drummers, horn section, be allowed to perform, finally, without a singer getting in their way?A phoney documentary for easy to please, nostalgic, baby boomers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Standing in the Shadown of Motown","review":"This is a great documentary for fans of Motown. I rented the DVD on a whim. What I found was a film with so much heart and soul that I have to purchase it as well as the CD. I especially liked Joan Osborne's rendition of \\"What Becomes of the Broken Hearted.\\" That is perhaps one of my all-time favorite Motown songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funk Brothers the Secret to Motowns Success","review":"I saw this documentary at the theater and was impressed by how much the musicians at Motown contributed to the overall success of the record label. At one point one of the musicians said it didn't matter who they had to sing those songs, they would have been hits just because of the music behind them. Then, they went on to prove it by playing live with several different singers. How refreshing to hear the music played exactly as it was recorded, with a little variation in the vocals. Yet, the Funk Brothers never got credit on any of the Motown songs.It also covers the move of Motown from Detroit to L.A. The musicians found out about the move when they showed up to the studio to do a regularly scheduled session. There was a note on the door saying \\"We've moved to L.A.\\"All in all, a facinating movie that was produced and directed very well. I hope the sound quality transfers well because it was truly excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't quibble. It's delightful.","review":"The anecdotes are priceless, the Funk Brothers are wonderful--kindhearted, hard working, with an ironic view of life. Joan Osborne and Meshell Ndegecello are aces. Bootsy is great fun. I agree with previous reviewers that Chaka Khan kind of stops the show with her lack of energy, and Ben Harper, I dunno, perhaps he is stoned? Overall this is an uplifting and informative look at a side of Motown few of us knew about in any detail before. The DVD transfer is EXCELLENT and the sound quality is A+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could stand in the shadow!","review":"I couldn't play the movie because there was some sort of regional lock on it.

The largely anonymous musicians who fueled this phenomenon are as you'd expect them to be: as reverently humble as they are abundantly talented. If you didn't live through this era, you need to see this film to understand almost everything you hear today. Either way, if you're not already hooked by the time scene 21 reveals the rhythmic origins of \\"I Heard it Through the Grapevine\\" -- and if that scene doesn't induce glorious ecstasy -- call the embalmer. You're already gone. These gentlemen created a footprint that the tides of time cannot wash away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew???","review":"Everyone should watch this dvd.

His goal was finally accomplished. These excellent musicians finally have a little slice of the notoriety that they have deserved since the '60's.

You finished the movie, and never had a chance to see how excellent it is, but your story was told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standing in the Shadows of Motown","review":"\`Standing in the Shadows of the Funk Brothers' might be a more apropos title for this music documentary that covers the life and times of an evolving clutch of some of America's best musicians. Motown IS Motown largely because of this posse of little known studio musicians- The Funk Brothers -that came to work at Detroit's Hitsville U.S.A., studio A, each day and night, amazingly ready to hit it at the count of four, in sync, on time, and always groovin'.The DVD is moving, foot-shaking, heart warming, funny and completely entertaining. A full assemblage of all the remaining little known Funk Brothers studio backup band augmented with vocals by Joan Osborne, Ben Harper, Bootsy Collins, and Meshell Ndegeocello do modern justice to historical masterpieces, but be prepared when Chaka Khan changes the mood at the finale. The second disc is as much fun as the first and whether you are watching or just listening, this is a great DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick shipment","review":"The shipment was received very quickly.

My wife just enjoyed singing along.Here The Funk Brothers finally get the credit they deserve for being the driving force behind all of Motown's greatest hits. The fact that this film featured fine visiting vocalists, such as Joan Osborne, Chaka Khan and Ben Harper, actually proves the point that the Funk Brothers WERE MOTOWN!If you loved Motown music in its heyday, you'll love this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The film was a long time coming , finally respect is given","review":"For many years , it was known amongst musicians that many of the great Motown songs had great backing bands .Not many people knew who they were .This film is about them - they are deservedly the focus .These guys were the supporting players and how often do those people get the attention ?

I thought the stories, like the pig feet and cigars, got a bit tedious, but wow! I loved the music. My only criticism of the music is to wonder where they found this guy Ben Harper, and why did they give him such fine songs to sing. He has no sense of rhythm, and he can't sing a lick.

This collection is based on the use of a flat matt stainless steel body, then embellished with hand placed enhancements, such as crystals, bits of gold braid, colored enamel, etc., thus creating a colorful, extremely well made piece of wearable, unique art that is joyful to wear.This collection is one of the first places I go to when I'm looking for something really special...and I have never been disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful 1990's performances, not the analog Melodiya's.","review":"Wonderfully colorful, authentic Russian performances.

Moreover, it's properly stylish, unlike those TUMI-style black bags that you see worn by travelling salesmen carrying Dell laptops in airports. It's thin, has lots of (flattish) pockets for magazines, walllets, cards, iphone etc. However keep in mind that it is thin, so you're not going to get more than say 2-3 books or magazines in there.My only gripes are with the power supply pocket which flaps outside the bag.

I found this CD, which features her fun side, not her guitar mastery, and decided to get it to see what it was like. It is so much fun. The songs are catchy and/or cute.

In other words, Larry offers no inside scoop at all. The book just rehashes the campaign in more or less chronological order, and I could've written it. Some book, huh? Along the way, Larry does manage to bungle a fact or 2 (E.g., claiming a wacky question during Gennifer Flowers' press conference was asked by a reporter, rather than the Howard Stern show flunkie who really asked it. I don't think Larry can bring himself to say the words \\"Howard Stern\\", so perhaps that was the problem.). If interested in the 1992 campaign/election, try ALL's FAIR by Mary Matalin and James Carville or STRANGE BEDFELLOWS by Tom Rosensteil instead.Update 2003: As of this writing, 302 used available starting at $0.01.

Not since New Forms, which I consider to be a MASTERPIECE of artistic genius co-mingled with technological wizardry, have I anticipated ripping open a new CD. In The Mode was OK, but lacked the fresh & cutting-edge vocal/musical arrangements lavished upon New Forms.

Listen to one song and you've basically listened to the whole album. No guest vocals either, nothing experimental or new. Just a plain album. A real let-down after his last album. The album had potential, but didn't fulfill my expectations. Get Aphrodite's last album instead. Much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little innovation","review":"Perhaps I'm not a true junglist, but I do not find anything really innovative or amazing about Touching Down. In reflection to Size & Reprazent's first release, New Forms, which at the time destroyed and rebuilt the whole meaning of DnB, I would say Touching Down is your average DnB album. Club favorites maybe, however Size's latest solo work leaves a lot to be desired on the creative side of things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let it grow on you.","review":"This is definately not a dark DnB album. Those who are fans of that kind wouldn't really like this at first. I myself like dark DnB. Listen to this cd a good 3 or 4 times and you'll see theres a lot of thought put into it. This is a CD that will strongly grow on you, it did with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drum n' Bass Isn't Dead","review":"So where has drum n' bass gone? LTJ Bukem hasn't changed a whole lot. Goldie and Grooverider are the masters but nothing really new from them. Roni Size keeps chugging along. This album is a masterpiece. Darker and heavier than New Forms. I was on a search for fresh drum n' bass and my search has ended. Get this album and lets help keep drum n' bass alive. Goldie and Grooverider, lets hear some new stuff. It's not too late for the masters to take back their throne. For now, Roni is sitting there. Also check out the remix album to New Forms called Replica. It's a Japanese import, and well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish illustrations","review":"I bought this book because it had such good reviews, but I was very disappointed with the contents. The title is fashion rendering with color, but most of the illustrations are black and white (very misleading). Plus the illustrations don't look very professional in my opinion.

While skeptics were confidently insisting that psychic abilities did not exist, highly classified programs were studying and using \\"psi\\" abilities. Having participated in this research, I can recommend Gruber's book as one of the clearest and most accurate reviews of this strange but true tale. In addition, his coverage of the contemporary world-wide status of psi research is exceptionally good. The prose is a bit awkward at times because the book was translated from German into English, but on the whole it is well written and an easy read. Several other books have been published that supposedly present the inside story of psi and the government. Most of those are outrageously distorted or just plain wrong. This book is different. I give it two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are You Fed Up With Cheap Tweezers?","review":"For so long I've lived with my old Revlon Tweezer and and it was time to give it up and get something a bit more substantial that actually would work. So after reading many of the posts and researching between the Rubis and Tweezerman, I bit the bullet and ordered one of these. All I can say is \\"wow\\". The challenge was on, could this tweezer pluck the teeny tiny white chin hairs? And it did it in one pluck, the first time. And I know this will sound odd, but the tweezer seemed to do it so quickly that I hardly felt it; so on I went to finish the eyebrows, upper lip and it did such a great job. I have to say that this has been the best investment I ever made. Now that I have it, I can't believe how long I suffered with drugstore junk. I know the cost was steep; but it was so worth it. So forget about the drugstore junk, this is top of the line and one of the best tweezers you can get. Just look at the ratings.

Although they look great and are made of quality material, they just don't grip that great.My first pair (which I bought for less than $10 at the grocery store) would grab single hairs that were barely visable. I find that these require a small bit of growth before they will grab on.So they're not that great for tweazing eyebrows, but they've worked fine for splinters and small tasks.I should have just gone to the local beauty supplier and tried some out.Live and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try: Bill's Sliver Gripper Tweezers","review":"Try: Bill's Sliver Gripper TweezersI have not purchased any other tweezers since finding \\"Bill's Sliver Gripper Tweezers\\" They are simply the Best, Easiest and Most Painlessly Precise tweezers I have ever owned....

Also the package you get with it is awesome! They even give you a case to put the camera in. It works great! The only reason why I dont give it a perfect grade would be because the batteries last only for a couple of days.

I felt it had no build, no climax, just kinda strolled along, and then, THE END. I more or less forced my self to finish reading it in stubbornness, and in hopes that the book would pick up, but no... throughout the book I found myself not really caring about any of the characters much.Now, admittedly, I am not Jewish, and and I have only a surface understanding of Kabbalah.

She takes great pride in her objectivity and care as a scientist, without being afraid to express personal beliefs, clearly labeled. Her style leaves something to be desired. She fears the reader will \\"unscientifically\\" draw unsubstantiated conclusions, and addresses this by constant repetition of more or less the same warnings.

Why couldn't she instead have recorded Mompou's \\"Variations on a theme of Chopin\\", a wonderful 20-minute work which is virtually unknown?Technically, this music is not terribly difficult, but Larrocha's slowly faltering technique make her tempos sound cautious, and interpretively the magic of her previous renditions on London/Decca is missing.Also, RCA's typically hard-toned piano sound is unattractive.

Sharon Sweet is a pretty good Elsa, although a tad shrill at times (prefer Studer and Norman). Marton is dramatically good but her voice is a bit too piercing. I like the pace of Davis' conducting and the lush orchestra sound. Sergei Leiferkus really bugs me with his \\"german\\" and his \\"S\\"s are awful.

Even Lieferkaus' non-diomatic interpretation is nonetheless clean and apt but good Heavens!! When is Marton NOT a liability?? Her Ortrud is incredibly disturbing- and not in a good way!

His articulation and tonguing are extremely heavy, giving the pieces a too much marcial style rather than a delicate solo part.

The door on this Cuisinart is attached and swings down, then you have to slide out the grate with a spatula or anything else you can find to avoid burning your hands.I much prefer the door / grate combination, where you can just grasp the handle, pull out the door, and slide the pizza onto a waiting pan.It's a little smaller and lighter than my old one, but I'm finding I'm using my oven instead - larger space, less likely to burn myself.Also, the instructions to preheat 30 minutes before using - not going to happen ever.For a gourmet / fresh pizza cook it's probably a good fit.

This is a collection of the same old success stories culled from the same old interviews and the same old articles. If you're really interested in the underlying changes in the business world that the Internet brings, read \\"Information Rules' by Shapiro and Varian or \\"Blown to Bits\\" by Evans and Wurstler.

Do not seek in-depth wisdom in it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad","review":"Although I found this book to have some interesting points, I also found it to be a big promotion for Siebel's business.

This means you shouldn't be afraid of theorems & their proofs, you should know some linear algebra, including some familiarity with n-dimensional euclidean space, as well as partial derivatives and elementary calculus. The author's Functions Of Two Variables could be profitably read before tackling the present book.The book is about the differential and integral calculus of multivariable functions, including a very nice introduction to the classical elementary diffential geometry of curves & surfaces. A bent on differential geometry can be perceived all along.The style is elegant and crisp and rather intuitive. All in all it is a very nice book. I didn't give it five stars because some of the stuff you'd expect to find in an advanced calculus book, such as series (including Taylor's series) and a careful discussion of differentiability, are missing.(This review is about the first 1998 edition)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Glasses OTTER DO THIS AGAIN SOON!","review":"Having seen these guys as many times as I have, I know that they throw down like no other.

I had been going without fabric softner because of all the dyes and perfumes. If she didn't have a rash, then she had a runny nose! This fabric softner works great and doesn't bother her at all. It's nice to have softer clothes again. The only down-side is that with natural fragrance, it doesn't stick to the clothes as long. But at least I am not worried about toxic perfumes and chemicals in our clothes! Plus it's better for the environment. Also, buying from Amazon makes it affordable so I can keep using this great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft and Sweet Smelling","review":"I have been using this fabric softener for almost a year now and I couldn't be happier with the results that I get.

I was unimpressed with the cleaning. After looking further I saw that Seventh Generation had been caught for not disclosing all of the ingredients in their products. Consumer reports had an article on this.Ironically, the company and its President, Mr. Hollander, brag about how their product discloses all of its ingredients, yet they don't even know the ingredients.This is because Seventh Generation doesn't manufacture anything themselves. They outsource it, to who knows maybe a company in China. The bottom line is they don't know what is in it since they don't make it. They are simply a marketing company. Don't buy into the hype and be ripped off.You can buy Tide Free & Clear or Method Products for a lot less.

Well, i didnt find that out until now, now that the bottle is almost empty.Well, i'll try the heat setting thing again, and if it works then i'm happy and the solution to my problem is solved.But if my theory is true that medium to high heat affects the performance of this product, if not totally eliminates the purpose, this is not a good thing, and an issue the Seventh Gneration needs to address."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes no scents","review":"I buy fabric softener for the scent, since modern detergent usually softens the clothes as well, and this leaves none in the clothes.

They should advertise it as \\"unscented.\\" Can't even tell I washed clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"As noted by previous reviewers, this product smells good on wet clothes but the scent disappears after drying (even line drying). It also does nothing to control static cling.

Together they uncover a secret about that long ago attack on Rachel's family..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read and well written!","review":"Vickie Taylor introduces us into a new world of Gargoyles, men who can shapeshift into animal forms and help protect humanity. Nathan Cross is a griffin, roughened and tortured from past lives and cynical towards what he must do. Rachel Vandermere is a smart, brave woman who is introduced into Nathan's world.I really enjoyed this book. It's not easy to successfully create a paranormal world with rules, terms, and history that is believable, but this novels does that and more. The writing is flowing and well done, and the emotions, want, and love between Rachel and Nathan is very apparent through the novel. I only wish that they had actually said \\"I love you\\" aloud...although, I suppose it's not entirely necessary since they are connected so, but it still would have been a nice plus.As I said, I just loved this book and am eagerly looking forward to the sequel, Connor's story called Flesh and Stone."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely different","review":"I don't think I have ever read a book on gargoles. Nice having a new take on the paranormal romance. I really liked the beginning of the book. Taylor begins with the six year old herione of the story getting her daddy to look under the bed, in the closet, etc. for the \\"monsters.\\" She really just wants all his attention for herself since there is a new edition to the family. The chapter ends when the same six year old watches her parents murdered as she and her baby brother hide in the cupboard beneath the stairs. A very dramatic beginning to the story. Definitely grabs the reader. I simple felt I could not put the book down until I discovered the reason behind her parents murder. It also set the premise of why the herione was so driven to find the \\"monsters\\" she witnessed killing her parents.Excellent book, I gave it four stars instead of five because I thought the story lagged around the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting world of Gargoyles","review":"This book has an interesting plot with the Gargoyles and their struggle for survival in the modern world. The romance and passion between Rachel and Nathan is good but the plot about the Gargoyles is very original and interesting. I especially empathized with Nathan Cross's struggle with his near-immortality and the personal choice he made before meeting Rachel. The Gargoyles are very believable and the readers do not need to suspend their disbelief to read this book. It is a rather dark story though so no breezy romance here. For those who enjoy romance and some paranormal, this is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way we make decisions naturally","review":"Sowell takes you by the hand and explains how and why people and institutions 'make decisions.'

Maybe it's only second to Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best writer of the 20th Century","review":"Sowell's perspective on liberal, enlightenment philosophies is the most clearly defined and explained work one could read. His book The Vision of the Anointed is my vote for best book of the 20th Century! He understands liberal \\"thinking\\" and demagog worship; he can expound upon their approaches and make the reader clearly see what is confusing to the intellectual mind: that is, What are they thinking? How did they get to that conlcusion? If you truly want to understand where our philosophies have become so distorted and entangled with the absurd, read this or any of Sowell's works.P.S.

I can fault it for disguising an opinion as research. The main premise of the book, that knowledge has a cost, is sound. Most of the pages, however, consist of Sowell's opinions on political issues. The connection of his arguments to the theme is frequently tenuous.The book is a long, wide-ranging compilation of arguments for conservative positions. The economic implications of knowledge costs is not dealt with thoroughly or rigorously, so Sowell has only done partly what he set out to do.The discussion on the ending of jitney-driving due to taxicab regulations brought an unfamiliar subject to my attention. This surprising position is refreshingly honest, because it is consistent with his economic ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Highlights Disc, But, No Match!","review":"Althrough this is a budget release of highlights from the 1970 RCA recording, it'll no match for the recently-released full price version, which featured narrations from Ms. Price, taken from her popular story book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Tale","review":"Fuzzy Rabbit was always Ellen's favorite, until one year she received an owl for her birthday.

The movie was OK and made sense only after I watched the interview of the director in the Special Features. I believe there is some substance to this tale, and not an altogether waste. I was struck by how sexless the movie is. The actresses are neither sensual nor interested in sex. Why would a group of women, alone, not talk about sex or men(or women)? Lee Lee Sobieski's talents were wasted in this movie. I could see Jena Malone trying to make things happen. I will probably watch it again to see if I agree with my own remarks.

So what went wrong?Well, I'm glad you asked. Weak story and and poor characters would be my answer. Frankly, a waste of money and good talent.If you're going to bring a bunch of characters together, then there needs to be a point, for growth for revelations for something to happen that drives the drama and action of the story forward. You could have even made Chloe's character a serial killer, and turned the movie in a totally new direction. And no, it's not that aliens needed to make an appearance, just that there was no drama.

I let a friend try the other pack*he is also not allergic* He broke out so bad and started swellewing we had to bring him to the hospital. After 15 minutes on hold (at first the lady forgot to hit hold apparently they were very confused) i spoke with a manager and the only thing they could say was a simple sorry and they would send me another half off.

At any rate, there's alot of good stuff here and I can't say enough about the smoking man episodes, they're almost astonishing.

I gave season 4 one and a half stars out of pity. The acting is ok and a few episodes are interesting. Most of the episodes are more like something you'd see from the show Tales From The Crypt. They substitute plot for gore and blood. A lack of imagination, lame plots, no humor, lack of creatures, and redundant themes make up Season 4 of The X-Files.Season 1 was good. Season 2 really good.

I liked the title, and since I had no other books on my nightstand (gasp!) I picked it and the sequel Earth Logic up too. I force-fed myself the first 60 pages or so and finally gave up and would only give it two stars. I say two because it wasn't offensive or stupid, just uninteresting.It was so boring that I can't really explain much about it, other than it's shamelessly derivative of the Lord of the Rings writing style (which I hated in its original form). There is one main race that occupies a land, with some fringe races living on the outskirts who are the magic-wielders. Then a big bad war-like race comes in and takes over as the evil oppressors.

I've never seen a Hindi book which is better organised or explains Hindi grammar and usage better than this one. The dialogues and many of the exercises form a soap opera type story about a Delhi family which makes it more enjoyable. There are also up-to-date Hindi-English and English-Hindi vocabulary lists in the back. The book does require that the Devanagari script be learnt so if you're only looking to understand Bollywood films, this isn't the book for you. The Hindi language is much better and easier read in its own Devanagari script so I would highly recommend learning it. I did not have any trouble learning to write Devanagari from this book but if you need extra help the other book \\"Beginner's Hindi Script\\" would work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The $$$$$","review":"I bought this book because I wanted something I could listen to at work and hopefully learn quicker by just constantly listening to the CD's.

Other than that I found the immediate start straight into learning the script and trying to fathom out the alphabet an experience best kept for the extremely brave. The book has not taken into account the average persons ability to pick up a language and throws you straight into a headbangingly maddening mass of stuff that you could probably do without - initially.

I had planned on getting a foreign language book to read in my spare time, I had planned on getting Arabic, but I somehow purchased this one. It caught my attention and kept it though.Despite my preconceptions Hindi is very simple to understand on a basic level, their are no tones, clicks or other oddities. Their is wide use of nasalized sounds, but anyone who has taken French would not have a problem with it. The real problem is how colloquial everything is. Every conversation uses words that a common person would use to speak with their friends. This isn't a problem at first, but when one looks at the sentence structure they began to wish that things would be easier. Their is very little info on things that would help a traveller to India in it, and I assume it was written for Americans or English who have Hindi speaking relatives who want to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, for those who have already studied Hindi","review":"An excellent book, but wouldn't recommend it to those who have never studied Hindi, unless they have a lot of ambition. This book is packed full of material, especially the first few chapters are quite intense. To really learn the language one should definitley learn the script FIRST, since in Hindi, everything is pronounced exactly as it is spelled. The romanized pronunciations in the book aren't that accurate, and often confusing.

This book deals with the ancient problem of the \\"unknowableness\\" of God by attacking it head on: We can't know God, therefore we must meditate on the Cloud of Unknowing which lies between us and God.Incidently, I think the reason many works on contemplation don't seem applicable to daily life is that many of them were written for and by monastics.

The latest model should come with iMovie 4, which is a great movie making program (sure beats Vegas and iMovie 3, which was a bad joke). I do recommend Office X and Virtual PC for compatibility reasons when you buy an iMac--plus Office X beats AppleWorks for word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation (although not for object-oriented drawing). This is also a good system for developing programs, using a scanner (iPhoto is a nice complement), working with audio (the 2003 model had SoundStudio but I don't think the new ones do), and burning CDs and DVDs.

It can become a big waste of time using the Rubis.

It also contains some excerpts from thinkers who opposed Mencius's ideas. Mencius (Mang) was a proponent of Confucius's ideas of benevolent government, and travelled around \\"China\\"(the warring states) trying to convinceKings and princes to adopt his approach of generosity towards theruled, renunciation of offensive warfare, and respect forofficial rituals and rites.The Style of english translation in this book is considered to be archaic and off-putting by some, as it was done in the 1860's. It is very similar in presentation to Legge's Analects translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"for academics only ???","review":"In this book the original chinese text and extensive footnotes take up about two thirds of each page, the remainder has to suffice for the english translation. This does not make for an easy read so unless you are a dedicated scholar I would look elsewhere for Mencius's views. That is what i will be doing, passing this version on to the people at Goodwill charities, I hope they can make better use of it.

She has given us a love story - a contemporary work sprinkled with sibling interaction, family connections and more than a few chuckles with a dialogue that mirrors reality. She explores relationships in depth and gives good insight into the male perspective. Her clever repartee among the characters gives a keen insight into their personalities.Reviewed by Maryjo Holland"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Trattoria\\" is a fun ride","review":"In \\"Trattoria,\\" Susan DiPlacido presents a different side of Las Vegas than she does in her other novel \\"24/7.\\" The setting is not a corporate-owned casino and its accompanying gambling lifestyle, but a family-owned Italian restaurant, struggling for survival, and a gambling of a different sort-on love and family. DiPlacido brings the reader into the lives and minds of her characters, their inner desires and fears. You're rooting for everything to work out for them, but just like in real life, you know all too well what's at stake, and that the odds for a happy ending are stacked against them. \\"Trattoria\\" is a fun ride and it was hard to say goodbye to the characters when I finished the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended especially for public library collections","review":"Stories from the Vaults: Season Two is an eclectic, family-friendly collection of episodes that take viewers into the historical mysteries investigated by the Smithsonian Museum and its affiliates. From the wonders of the rainforest, to the quandary of trying to preserve sculptures made of chocolate and soap (and guess which inherently unstable substance is harder to preserve - no, it's not the one that guests try to eat!), to surprising true tales of some of America's most notorious criminals, Stories from the Vaults both entertains and edifies. Highly recommended especially for public library collections. The episodes are \\"Let's Eat!\\", \\"Nature's Vault\\", \\"Crystal Ball\\", \\"going, Going, Gone\\", \\"Sex 101\\" and \\"Villains and Rogues\\" plus bonus mini-featurettes. Approximately 200 minutes, available on DVD and Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"tunes 5+ star, spoken word stuff 0 stars","review":"This is just an outstanding disk - at least, the actual TUNES on it are. On the Way Up, So Much More, Half the Time & others feature outstanding guitar playing, poignant lyrics, AND great vocals. The highlights are The Whole of the Moon - BOTH the live version (recorded at a subway stop - AWESOME!) and the studio version - and the fabulous \\"If Love is Not Enough\\" - Blues, funk, w bluegrass instrumentation. Bouncy, fun - great stuff. The only detriment, to me, are the spoken word tracks. These always get skipped over or programmed around on my player. Still, there are only a few of those, so they are far outweighed by the brilliance of the tunes. A definite buy - just learn to program your CD player to avoid the spoken word stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, Satch was fabulous, but...","review":"...there is nothing fabulous at all about this mess of a compilation.

They may be less funny but the stories are still fun to read. Even though this story has no laugh out loud parts it is dosed with some little humorous gems (Jimmy’s description of a Gulf Coast casino as feeling like he was in a Dukes of Hazard pinball machine).

Helma almost fits \\"the typical librarian\\" in the libraries of the past. She is over-organized, dedicated to knit-picky details, dresses in such a way as to seem almost invisible, and (possibly her worst character defect)she has no sense of humor.Ms. Dereske has written tongue-in-cheek about most librarians' favorite stereotype. The idea that Miss Zukas enjoys adventures that few people get involved in, much less staid and sober librarians is part of the fun. I have enjoyed all the murderous events that Miss Zukas has become enmeshed in and I'm hoping for many more. Go, Miss Zukas. The Dewey Decimal System, though inadequate, will lead us out of the vale of ignorance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helma and Ruth go hiking","review":"Helma Zukas' best friend Ruth talks her into going on a hike in the Cascade Mountains to celebrate Ruth's 40th. birthday.

Before he dies, he is able to tell them that he had a companion who may be in trouble, so Helma and Ruth decide to look for him. A blinding snowstorm forces them into an emergency cabin, along with a group of other hikers. This setting allows Jo Dereske to introduce a whole new set of characters who are an interesting change from Miss Zukas' usual co-workers ath the library. This is a well-written and entertaining \\"cozy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mystery here","review":"First let me say that I think cat lovers and librarians should be banned from reviewing Miss Zukas books. Show them a cat or a catalog and they lose all objectivity. \\"Out of Circulation\\" is a hugely flawed book not worth wasting your time on. For one thing, it is supposedly a mystery, but Miss Zukas DOES NOT solve a mystery in this book! She is stuck in a cabin with a bunch of likely suspects, no clues are revealed for her or the reader to chew on, and in the last 20 pages the baddie picks up a gun and declares herself. Nobody solves anything! Other problems: The names of people are ridiculously contrived. A suspect builds a snow cave, apparently in a few minutes in freshly fallen snow. This is an impossibility. I half expected the know-it-all Miss Zukas to say \\"Wait a minute, you can't build a snow cave in fresh snow\\" but that bit of reality doesn't intrude on the plot. I was shocked when I saw the other reviews of this book as I expected at least some bad ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obnoxious main character--but try and put the book down!","review":"If it's true that there is some of a book's main character in the author, I pity Jo Dereske's family. Helma Zukas is a self-righteous, prim old maid who seems to have a case of arrested social development. And her best friend, Ruth, borders on the unbelievable. On the other hand, it is pretty much impossible not to finish the first book, and then want the others in the series immediately. It's because we see touches of humanity starting to emerge from Helma Zukas...and we want to be there for the final unveiling. Also, some of her ways take many readers back to a time when social conventions were stiffer...but the world was a lot nicer place!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"This book has been absolutely WONDERFUL!

A very essential part of making hard cheese is a means to provide pressure, a press. This author refers to the use of different pounds of pressure, but gives little or no advice on how to achieve that pressure. For instance, she'll say, \\"20 pounds of pressure for 30 minutes\\". How??There is a primitive diagram of a cheese press that involves the use of a tree stump, but no real directions. It's very frustrating. The recipes are OK, but I'm sure you could find similar recipes elsewhere. This book is a waste of time if you're just starting out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing, but nice recipes.","review":"Quite a few recipes, many good, but as a prior reviewer stated, this book is confusing, especially with the hard cheeses.

Most beginner home cheese makers are going to use store bought milk and unless you have read & ingrained in your head the section about adding calcium chloride to store bought milk, you will fail with every recipe because it is not mentioned even as optional in any of the recipes. Also didn't care for 'packet' ingredient listings, a unit of measurement is more appropriate, the packet suggests everyone will be purchasing supplies from this author's store and everything is prepackaged for you.There is a great recipe varity, but i've had to mark up the book so much to include things that are missing it almost isn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheese making made simple.","review":"I rate the book 4 stars because, the book is well written and easy to follow when making many of the cheese products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"This book covered the cheese making process in depth, and I feel that I understand the process and have confidence in making cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"Now that I can finally make a decent cheese I'm amazed at how the instructions are confusing and at times missing necessary information.

I have made some yummy cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"incomplete info, requires author's ingredients","review":"The general info in the beginning is useful, but the recipes are very much lacking. The specifics of a recipe (such as indirect heating of the milk over a period of time) are not mentioned in the recipe, but must be remembered from the intro sections. Also, the book requires the use ingredients sold only by the author's company. For example, their \\"fromage blanc\\" starter isn't just the starter, but also includes rennet, which isn't mentioned anywhere in the recipe. So, if you haven't purchased the \\"cheesemaking.com\\" fromage blanc starter, you will be missing a key ingredient and not even know about it.Also, I found the author's website to often contradict her recipes in the book. Following only the book, I've had several failures. Also, there is no helpful information for troubleshooting to figure out where I went wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recipes not for beginners... but great information!","review":"I bought this after buying a cook book that had a basic fresh cheese recipe in it and thought. I love cheese... if it's so easy, I wonder how many different kinds I could make??? So, out to Amazon for a book. Great information, history, and recipes, but I was clueless and a bit overwhelmed as to where and how I should start...even where to buy the necessary materials. I'm sure if I was a SERIOUS student, this would be a gold mine, but I have to admit, I wasn't thinking about how involved cheese making is... my ignorance! It does categorize the recipes from easy to difficult, which is nice. I believe I know which section I will be referring to, if I ever get the bright idea of making cheese again. While it is an informative and interesting book, it wasn't the best buy for me - a lover of cheese, but not the work that must be put into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing time-waster","review":"This is a very frustrating book. The recipes are vague and often incomplete (e.g. in one recipe for stilton she has you putting the curd in a mold, turning it a few times and then later aging the cheese...but no indication of when it is to be removed from the mold). Quantities are often imprecise or missing. If you use the book in conjunction with her website [...] it's doubly frustrating, since there are tons of discrepancies between the book and the website. In one case I found three differing instructions for the same procedure between the website and the book. Perhaps this is a good book if you are experienced and already know all the ins and outs of cheesemaking but if you are a beginner and need clear step-by-step instructions look elsewhere. Home cheesemaking is time-consuming and requires equipment and supplies so you don't want to be working from a book as carelessly put together as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource","review":"Looking forward to putting this into practice and tasting the results!

There are so many typos that I actually stopped reading after 1/3 of the book. I really do not understand how Sun can publish such a book.A little technical note (to justify the title). It does not really teach you great (or even average) insights into EJBs. No real techy info on what the consequences are of using CMP vs BMP (only info from the spec),...It basically is just a rehash of the spec. The examples are for the Sun reference implementation, which would not be that bad if it wasn't half of every chapter (I want to learn EJB not a how to use a reference implementation which is not made for running in production!).

Many recipes start with a story of where it came from and how it came into being.I enjoyed finding out how Jack Daniel's distills their whiskey, about how prohibition affected the Daniel's family (they started trading mules), and about how one boarding house is so popular it is still a lunchtime spot that requires reservations.

Locate the seal you want to remove.2. Remove anything that will block/impede its removal (i.e. cam pulleys, crank pulleys, etc).3. Take the Lisle 58430 & insert the end piece (small black hook) into the seal. Adjust the silver bar so it is positioned against anything solid. And pry the old seal right out!This tool is basically a see-saw (from elementary school). Except the seal is the 1st grader on one side, and you are the overweight gym teacher on the other.

I was removing the camshaft seal on a 97 Corolla 1.8 and noticed the handle became bent after using it at this location.Not sure what caused it to bend as I did not apply very much pressure to the handle and the seal easily popped out.I'm still able to use it with the bent handle.

My previous Mr. Coffee spoiled me in that regard.But, the huge advantage this coffee maker has over any of the others that I have tried (and this will bring me back for the pricier model when this one wears out) is that Proctor Silex has actually designed a carafe that does not pour coffee everywhere but into the cup.

I set it up according to the instructions, connected to a Dlink Router DI-624.When I attempted to connect to the router via laptop, it would connect and then drop the connection after about 10 seconds.

Maybe my fault.I am thinking perhaps I need two of these, one at the router, and one at the laptop.

But I connected it to my Actiontec router antenna jack, hoping to boost its wireless range. After installing it, I saw no increase in range or performance. Instead, I was unable to connect to my internet service. I tried re-installing it and rebooting the router, but no change. So back in the box, it went.

Oh, and he also meets some pretty cool friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs better editing -- mediocre kids book with no appeal to older readers","review":"Leven Thumps contains some good, creative ideas and an approach to the story that could have worked much, much better. It is poorly executed and in need of not just serious editing but serious revision. This reads like a first draft that has been checked by the grammar sheriff only. There is a lot of \\"tell\\" that should have been creatively revised into \\"show\\" in a revision process that apparently didn't happen. One of the effects of that is that the characters, particularly the main one, Leven, are weakly developed and fail to generate any sympathy from the reader. I appreciate the realism of a mean childhood, but it seemed as if the mean minor characters were far more developed than the main character. This could be a good book with a serious reworking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay first book, Terrible series, just gets worse and worse...","review":"Okay first book, Terrible series, just get worse and worse...I bought all three and book two bugged me because it didn't have any boundries, such as a few birds can suddenly dig a ditch miles wide and hundreds of miles deep and every falls into it unharmed, on and on and finally hope, the last sentence of book two look promising.

The story itself takes a little while to get going but sparks and interesting journey once it has. Leven is similar to Harry Potter in a few ways (scar=white hair, Dobby=Clover, Both are unwanted by their families, etc.) The story takes a different twist with the land of Foo though. Foo is a magical realm and makes it easier to read the book with its dreamscapes and imaginative ideas.

And what parent does not want kids begging to be read to?It is the \\"orphan boy meets destiny\\" story line that gets a bit tired as a story line to an adult BUT it has a great female heroine and cohort that is able to turn anything into ice, and it is really not an old theme for kids.A great summer read for early tweens, lots of adventure and plenty of magical ideas tossed into everyday life.The unabridged audio of this is a 9 Cd car ride OR in parenting language- worth 2,000 miles of adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"leven thumps book 1","review":"the first book i think is boring there are multiple things i could think of to make the book better but the 2nd book i have heard is much better ive read a sample of book 2 and it does sound like its gonna be great!!!! cant wait to read the reat!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you get past page 60?","review":"I, too, got bored after the first few chapters, the characters got into more trouble and did not seem to learn anything.

What made Leven a decent person when all he'd known his whole life was scorn and ridicule? There was no explanation offered. The villian is interesting, but also lacking. Overall, this is a good read with many interesting and humorous bits, but Leven is no Matilda or Harry Potter.

I was extremely disappointed in this book. It seems like a good three quarters of the book finds the children wandering around the town. Leven is an almost identical type of Harry Potter with no scar but a white patch of hair, an almost house-elf on his shoulder, magical side-kicks, whomping willow, mean gardians, orphan, fighting against evil dark lord and his dementor like hinch men.

Combined with the music of Johnny Marr, this is truly one of the most sterling recordings in music history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential Smiths","review":"This album is probably the best place to start for the Smiths-uninitiated. Comprised of the perfect combination of self-indulgent melancholy and garish playfulness for which they have become famous, The Queen Is Dead shows off the Smiths' for the expert musicians that they were. Johnny Marr's melodic riffs are a foil for Morrissey's woeful and biting lyrics. Whether on a long car trip or just half-dozing in a darkened room, this album fits--and often dictates--the mood. I have listened to it regularly for a decade and it has never become tiresome. That in itself sets it apart from its more contemporary competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"So meet me at the cemetary gates...","review":"I've loved the Smiths for a long time now...I remember I borrowed some tape or another at the library and copied some of my favourite songs.

So recently due to the influence of an evil friend, I started purchasing the Smiths. This one has my absolute favourite \\"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\\"; I'm a touch morbid, but you've got to be. Plus it has fun songs as well.

These songs are immortal and leave an indeliable mark in British pop music of the latter half of this century. One of the last great groups hailing from Manchester, England. Making a bold statement against musical mediocrity, which nowadays is all we have, thank God for the Smiths!"},{"rating":"2","title":"timeless","review":"Though I would have to say that \\"Meat is Murder\\" is my favorite Smiths album there is no denying that \\"The Queen is Dead\\" is a masterpiece. Some essential Smiths classics are included like \\"The Boy With The Thorn In His Side\\" and \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\" but the track that made me fall in love with this album was \\"I Know It's over\\". I think the track displays every band members talents flawlessly. Marr's delicate guitar strumming, Rourke's smooth jazzy bass, Joyce's precise drumming and Morrissey's emotionally raw vocals.(When Mozz screams \\"Mother I can feel the soil falling over my head\\" I always get goosebumps) From begining to end the album is amazing. The Smiths were a musical phenomenon that happens rarely. There will never be an other band like the Smiths and this album is one of their grandest works."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 80's essential records","review":"Besides standing out as the Smiths greatest achievement \\"The Queen is Dead\\" is that rare specimen of an album that has several clear highlights(notably\\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\",\\"Some Girls are Bigger than others\\"and \\"Frankly Mr.Shankly\\")but works best as an ensemble piece since all the songs contribute to a flow that propels the record towards a quality well beyond the worth of the individual tracks.Also Morrissey's lyrics are better than ever,be it on the title tracks's rant,on the surreally comic \\"Bigmouth Strikes again\\"(\\"now I know how Joan of Arc felt\\"),on\\"I know it's over\\"'s downbeat sentiments or in \\"There is a light that never goes out\\"'s ultra romantic fatalism.And of course there's Johnny Marr's magical guitar to add that extra colour that made them so unique and compellingly vital in the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Seminal Record","review":"The Queen is Dead is one of those rare records that I can honestly changed my life. The first Smiths record I ever bought, this album made me realize what music could truly be like. Morrissey's lyrics were unlike anything I had ever heard. At 17, the words were like a bullet through my soul. Johnny Marr's riffs (not just on this record) will never be surpassed. The complete contrast in style between Johnny's incredibly melodic (happy) music and the unrelenting seriousness of Morrissey's lyrics creat a landscape which is hard to describe. At once exhilirating and contemplative, it's a match made in Heaven. To me this is the best album of the 80's. The Smiths were always a little too English to be Mega Stars in the U.S. but anybody with any sense realizes what huge gap there was (is) between them and every other pop group (U2 being the only exception-in a world/class of their own). If you refuse to buy this record, I have nothing I can say to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album to start with","review":"Ok, for the novice Smith fan, steer clear of the \\"Best-of\\" compilations out there. Most are uneven and they throw in a few clunkers that are really out of place, ala the 'Louder Than Bombs' album. Start here with The Queen Is Dead. It flows perfectly, and has 6 of the best Smiths tracks on it. After this album, pick up Meat is Murder, which in my view, is Johnny Marr's best guitar work. Barbarism Begins at Home is worth the asking price alone. Next up, check out their debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vinyl? Yes, Vinyl.","review":"I'm not going to talk about the songs on this classic album since it's been done to death. What I'll say is specifically about the reissue of the record. This is a HEAVY record, literally. You know when you put it on the turntable that it's not regular vinyl. What really jumps out his how the bass and toms of the drums have a fullness like never before and the tambourine is clear as a bell on the title track, though it's hard to tell if that's from the remaster or the much better 180 gram vinyl. Despite being an alternative album with distorted guitars, there's a warmth that comes out which never really is heard on the CD. As for the physical pressing, my copy has no problems at all, and the thickness of the vinyl makes ticks and scratches hardly noticeable. My only complaint is the company I ordered from shipped it improperly (not Amazon) resulting in one of the corners being slightly damaged. Still highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE SMITHS BEST CD","review":"I love this CD, to me it's a classic... it brings back memories from high school...some of the melancholy lyrics (like, 'I Know It's Over') can make you feel bad, that it feels good..LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"DOUGLAS WOLK IS A SHMUCK!","review":"the whole albums incredible and Morrissey was the best thing to happen to 80's pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"insidious? possibly. incredulous? probably. tremendous?

It is the recording that sums up the \\"original\\" alternative scene; a time when overlooked music like this was appreciated by a select few.It's a CD that demands to be played in its entirety each and every time.

In many ways, the sharp pop songs that comprise The Queen Is Dead represents the band at their zenith. The Smiths were fast and furious, and their four year streak resulted in many moments of brilliance that tend to run together, making labelling any one work as 'the best' a near impossibility. However, The Queen Is Dead captures Morrissey at his peak-he leaps from rockabilly to ballad crooner with suprising agility (and plenty of attitude), as does Johnny Marr with his melodic, precise guitar work. All the band's best elements form a solid stream of music that expresses everything from gay love on \\"The Boy With the Thorn in His Side'\\" to the out-reach odditty 'Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others.\\" It's a shame they disapeared from the music world so quickly- and yet it seems almost merciful. Watching them waste away into mediocrity would have been a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some albums are better than other.","review":"The Smiths are my favorite band ever. All their records are great and this one is an all-time masterpiece. The best lyrics I've ever heard. The best music I've ever heard. How do they know my feelings and my envies? This album turned my life into a better one. I just have to thank them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Majestic","review":"The Smiths, in their heyday, were never considered a great album group--at least by my sampling of their critics in the US who never got the point. This album proves those critics wrong. In its own way as important as 'Never Mind the Bollocks' or 'London Calling'. Melodic, often dissonant, with many influences on display, but at a time when the band seemed in full control of their complementary powers. It's hard to find anything comparable to Morrissey and Marr. Not Lennon and McCartney nor Strummer and Jones, but such parallels come close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of the 80's","review":"I know, superlatives are dumb and people will automatically think I'm a mindless Smiths fan who is unable to look outside his little Smiths world and see that there is other good music out there. And there is a lot of great great music from the 80's, it's just that none of it is as good as this. New Order may arguably be the best band of the 80's, though I wouldn't necessarily agree to that, but I don't think they've ever produced anything as comprehensive and perfect as this album (though as I just said, they are an awesome band). The Queen is Dead, The Boy with the Thorn in his Side, and There is a Light...are some of my favorite songs of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally the Queen gets her due...it's been a long time coming","review":"I am going to keep this short. TQID is and will forever be in my top 5 albums of all time. This original album, packaged like the day it was released, is absolutely spectacular. The sound is amazing (overseen by guitarist Johnny Marr). The format forces one to listen to album the way they used to and the way they should be listened. Buy this now...before they take it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Smiths at Their Best","review":"Some CD's take on a life of their own, and this CD is one of them. It is as close to perfect as any piece of music can get. Strong tracks, great singing--the entire package. The driven title track that opens the CD sets the standard, and everything meets the mark. How can anyone not smile while listening to \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\"--perhaps the best Smiths' cut ever--as he listens to lyrics like \\"and now I know how Joan of Arc felt\\"? \\"Cemetery Gates\\" will take you back to what you remember from British Literature class as you ponder the allusions present. \\"Vicar in a Tutu\\" is another track that inspires a grin--because it is so very true. And \\"The Boy With the Thorn In His Side\\" showcases Morrissey's vocals at their very best. The Smiths never achieved their rightful place in music in the States. Those who never caught on missed something truly dramatic. It's not too late, though; \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" can bring you to life as a Smiths' fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some bands are bigger than others","review":"Well, there is no emotion existing in a human being that is not touched and awaken by this outstanding piece of ART, I may say freely. This is what is pop all about. The humorous rage opening the album on \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" and living in \\"Bigmouth...\\", their greatest \\"hit\\" ever, endless sadness and self-pity on \\"Never Had No One Ever\\", the real POEM that deserves its place in any book of contemporary English poetry (\\"I Know It's Over\\"), up to the both cheerful and pesimistic \\"The Boy...\\"... Not to mention the real masterpiece of all times \\"There Is A Light...\\", with its verbal and melodic perfection. Not to mention all the songs one by one, each one deserves a word... No doubt, the best English poetry (behind the hatred there) lies in the verses of pop poets. Especially Morrissey. There is an emotion that never goes out (of style). I could not be more positive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm...","review":"This is a pretty swell album. I don't think it's perfect, but some of the individual songs are. The title track is pretty stunning, and the back-to-back I Know It's Over and Never Had No One Ever--possibly the Smiths' two bleakest songs, with the exception of Suffer Little Children--are most impressive indeed. But let's not forget the wonderfulness of the bouncy Vicar in a Tutu. What a song! And, of course, for the ultimate in melodramatic but genuinely affecting songcraft, there's always the gorgeous There is a Light That Never Goes Out. I don't think every track on the album is perfect, though. The single Bigmouth Strikes Again never impressed me much, nor did Frankly Mister Shankly. And I don't think the great lyrics are quite enough to save the melodically-challenged Boy With the Thorn In His Side. Still, it's a must for Smiths fans--some of the songs are genuinely flooring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"With songs ranging from epic to pop, and lyrics ranging from the poetic to the silly, the sardonic to the pathetic, this truly is one of the great albums. With the possible exception of the indulgent 'Never Had No One Ever', every song is a gem.Obvious pinnacles are 'I Know It's Over', 'The Boy With a Thorn in His Side,' and 'There is a Light That Never Goes Out', collectively some of the most beautiful music ever crafted. But the heavier 'The Queen is Dead' and 'Bigmouth Strikes Again,' serve as refreshing antitheses, while the acute 'Frankly Mr. Shankly' and 'Some Girls are Bigger than Others' fit in wonderfully.Highest Recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Album!","review":"When I first listened to The Queen Is Dead I did not like it. But then I decided to listen to it again and I fell in love with it. Johnny Marr's guitar is melodic and beautiful and Morrisey's lyrics make this album memorable and exciting.

Did I mention we listend to classic rock? Things started to change when I became a fan of Big Country, which I am to this day.... The Queen is Dead was dropped in my lap the first week I arrived at KSC and there was no turning back from alternative/indy music. Marr's guitars, Morrisey vocals, and the rest of the band had a groove, a voice, and general sound that is still being copied today. There is not a single Smiths record NOT worth owning. Go for it!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album, great remaster, but my copy's bunk","review":"I bought this album from a record store, sealed. Open it up, and there's little white specks practically glued to the record on both sides. After cleaning it up, the first cut, The Queen Is Dead, had several pops (popping at the same place every rotation), then a skip! The rest of the side played fine, but when I flipped over to side two, there's a series of pops on Marr's acoustic intro to Bigmouth Strikes Again.I've never had problems with any of the Rhino LP reissues, but apparently I got a bunk record, and to top it off, the store wouldn't exchange it or refund my money. I think I'll hold off on buying the rest of The Smiths vinyl reissues, thanks to getting burned on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Queen Is Dead\\" is Especially Dark","review":"Just reading the lyrics in the CD booklet is enough to send one into the depths of despair. Mr. Morrissey seems a talented poet and often makes allusions to poets that are truly great, but his songs indicate a level of depression that would make Sylvia Plath seem like a happy clown. His collaborator, Mr. Marr, is the more talented partner. His music is light and infective, unlike Morrissey's sad, sad songs and banshee wail. This reviewer especially enjoyed the music to \\"Frankly Mr. Shankley\\" (also Morrissey's best outing)and \\"The Boy with the Thorn in his Side.\\" The bottom line is that \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" has excellent music, but depressives, alcoholics and impressionable children and adults should not buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZzZZZzzzZZzzZZZzZZZz","review":"The Smiths are going through some weird mini-revival now that all the emo kids and trust fund college students are trying to impress their friends with their taste in the \\"classics,\\" but guess what? This album is still as mind-numbingly boring today as it was when it was first released. This sounds like U2 trying to sound like Joy Division. Only nowhere hear as good as Joy Division and only slightly better than U2. Somebody needs to slap Morrissey and tell him that smug cleverness is not the same thing as attitude and that putting psuedo-gothic song titles on bland pop songs don't make you deep. I really can't stand this stuff...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is Dead","review":"This crappy band, The Smiths, killed music. This album was horrible. The 80s produced some great artists like Rick Astley, Milli Vanilli (who WERE talented, back off haters<3), Culture Club, etc. Then this horrible Smiths abomination comes along and makes this cringe-inducing album... and they killed music. From there on, great 80s music stopped being made. Culture Club called it a day and Rick never had another hit song. Morrissey is a jerk for destroying music. Luckily the 90s produced some great bands like Bush, System Of A Down and Limp Bizkit. Still, because of this album music will never be the same again."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO ARE THE SMITHS????????","review":"Someone gave me this album said \\"It will change your life\\"It did I needed months of rehab to get over the awlfullness of this album, that singer can't remember his name, he can't sing, give me Bon Jovi any day.Also where are the meaningful lyrics \\"Now I know how joan of Arc felt\\" What the????Give me Celine Dion anyday!!!!!!She is the queen of Lyrics \\"Near far whereever you are\\"BRILLIANT!!!!!!!That guy from The Smyths could only dream of lyrics like this!!!!!FACTAlso get into acts like Good Charlotte, Busted, and Mcfly, these are the true and greatest genius's of music, this is just whingy noise, not music.Also buy U2's lastest album, it is MILES BETTER than thisTRUST MEpop Idol is the future, this should be left to gather dust in the past!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.SThe E stands for Expert!!!!!!SEE YA"},{"rating":"2","title":"I told my doctor to read this book or she is fired!","review":"I too have been under treated for autoimmune hypothyroidism and have continued to struggle with symptoms. This book explains an approach doctors can take to treat the symptoms and not the blood work. I already had been asking my doctor to work with me. She says she has reached her limit for the highest dosage of thyroid medicine she will prescribe for me. I told her that her limit was my starting point and that she needed to listen to my list of symptoms and basal temperature test results. She would not listen. Finally, I said either read this book that has given me hope or your fired. I've already found another doctor willing to treat me not my blood in case she doesn't read it by my next visit. I'm hoping she will read it and get some insight into how she can better serve her Thyroid patients even if she is not my doctor any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Comprehensive Book on Thyroid Disease","review":"I have read many, many books on hypothyroidism including most of the ones rated as five stars by Amazon.com. This book was the most comprehensive and informative of all of the books I've read. If you're going to read one book, read this one. Not only does it discuss the thyroid and its complications and affect on all body systems, but it goes into detail about blood test levels, tests you should have, mind/body healing, a diet to follow, the level of vitamins and minerals we need on a daily basis, etc. I am the kind of person who needs and likes to have all of the information I can access to help myself. Although I have finally found a doctor that knows as much as me, - for years, I did not. Now my doctor and I share information.If you have a thyroid problem, this book is well worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many unsubstantiated statements","review":"I stopped reading this book when it said that low self-esteem is a possible cause of thyroid antibodies. I'm a research psychologist and am very familiar with psychosomatic research, so I feel qualified to say that this is complete hooey. There are too many sections in this book that smack of unscientific thinking and unsubstantiated comment. I bought this book hoping for practical advice, and there is some of that. But there is also a fatal overdose of hippie stuff. A better book is Mary Solomon's What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Hypothyroidism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere!","review":"Having thyroid problems for 16 years and reading almost every book out there concerning the thyroid, I can't recommend this book.

I got my copy as soon as I could and read it from front cover to back. This is a very informative book; one that people with thyroid conditions should add to their library. I read an interview with the author and realized that this is a book that I needed to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another 12 step book","review":"The author denies that your thyroid problem is your own fault, telling you you need to get involved with all the medical aspects and tell your doctor what you need. If your doctor doesn't listen to you then find another doctor. Monitor your TC levels through blood tests (if/when you can afford them). Then the last chapter is all about how much Thyroid therapy can help (as in 12 step programs) to discover that your stresses and life problems probably started the whole thing in the first place. Athough it is NOT YOUR fault. All the while insinuating that it, in fact, IS your fault.Weird book. I would NOT recommend it unless you're very young and have never heard of a 12 step program and have 24/7 hours a day to monitor your progress. Then, go for it.Otherwise, find a better alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed at the content of the book. The emphasis being on more of a \\"eastern\\" medicine approach to dealing with the disease. I felt the title of the book was a misrepresentation of the content completely. Meditation, visualization and proper diet are all valid ways to combat the disease but the book did have the flavor of a introduction to eastern religion.

For starters, Act I is not given complete. The first scene with Ilia's opening aria, for instance, is simply cut. Richard Lewis, who was a wonderful tenor stalwart in opera and oratorio in his day, is too old to be singing the Cretan King. He is past his prime, sad to say.But what is worse is that the playing and singing are stodgy except for that of Josephine Barstow as Elettra who, true to her character's name, is electrifying. And even worse than that, the recorded sound is glassy and almost unlistenable, at least to my ears.I would think twice about buying this version.Scott Morrison"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be very afraid","review":"Scary, scary, scary. Richard Lewis is twenty years past his prime, Barstow sings in Urdu (sloppily), Betley seems to have thought she had been contracted for Adriana Lecouvreur, and Goeke--where in the WORLD did they find HIM? And then to use him in Zauberflöte and Giovanni as well--WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? Primitive production values and a surprisingly rough and ready orchestra in the pit (what's their excuse?--this isn't Lulu, after all) round out this festival of awfulness. When will Amazon finally introduce the zero-star rating this kind of disaster deserves? For a decent Idomeneo, try the Met (Pavarotti, von Stade, Cotrubas, Behrens). AVOID THIS ONE AT ALL COSTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have never finished it","review":"So dull, I have never finished it. Supposedly Barstow is worth it, but I have never gotten to her arias before becoming too bored. The Idamante is a tenor and the scenes are not in the order I am used to. The Idomeneo I am used to begins with the scene with Ilia's aria and then Idamante's entrance and aria. If I remember correctly, this one begins with Idamante finding Idomeneo on the shore, so perhaps the first scene I am used to, is simply cut in this version. I don't know, but I certainly enjoy the Met's Idomeneo video with Pavarotti in the title role much better. I have watched that one through quite a few times. Another great recording of this opera is on cd with Ian Bostridge in the title role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting performance, but somewhat truncated","review":"This Glyndebourne performance of Idomeneo from 1974 is of a somewhat truncated version of the opera, but it has a good cast and it held my interest throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"this is my favorite recording of Respighi's Pines of Rome. it is very clean and crisp, and the last part is great to listen to as you take off on an airplane. try it sometime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER WINNER FROM ANDRE WILLIAMS","review":"ANDRE WILLIAMS AMAZES ME.

The formula used to be Allantoin, Dimethicone, lanolin oil, and Propylene Glycol in an Emollenient base. Whether I got too much sun or my skin was too dry, it made my skin feel wonderful. Now the formula contains Deionized water, Stearic Acid, Peg 2 Stearate, propylene glycol, isopropyl myristate, dimethicone, lanolin oil, mineral oil, triathanolamine, allantoin, methylparaben, propylparaben, fragrance and it just doesn't feel the same.

There is much more, but let's stop at that.Jackie's guys are also wonderful. The ensembles were terrific fun, especially \\"Would You Like To Swing On A Star\\", on which the swinging is in full swing! Delightful jazz arrangements throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why opera singers shouldn't attempt standards","review":"I'm a fan of Marilyn Horne, but this recording was truly a mistake. These songs are *so* overdone anyway, they really ought to be shelved for the next 50 years. But on top of that, Ms. Horne is rarely in tune here, and if you add to that Thomas Hampson and Jerry Hadley, you won't be able to fast forward through it fast enough. Kudos to Spiro Malas, who manages to come off unscathed. When you've got Marilyn Horne (in her repertoire), you don't need any of these beasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"for GOOD reason! (I couldn't give it 0 stars and have page post)","review":"Short and NOT Sweet!In case you're wondering why this is only going for $2. for new copies from secondary dealers, is because it wasn't worth the $16.00 it originally was priced at! What a SHOCK when I got this home from the store and put it in my machine!I gave it away in a grab bag at work!All I can say is: \\"Miss Horne, I am so sorry that you allowed this to be released...it's worse than the stuff that Callas/Di Stefano did at the end.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical uses of the book","review":"As a serious amateur and frequent lecturer, I have found the Cambridge Guide to the Constellations serves multiple purposes. As a guide for understanding the boundaries and key features of the constellations, it has no equal. It provides significant detail in concise useable capsules. This is exactly what is needed when planning a night of observing or a lecture to any audience. In addition, the author has provided us with numerous significant facts, lists, and historical anecdotes which can enrich our understanding and provide quick material for lectures or special presentations. I rarely plan a talk without first referring to this book. It will be a ready reference to all astronomers for many years"},{"rating":"1","title":"If your just learning, try a different book.","review":"If you're just getting started, this is not the book for you.

One of a handful of novels I've finished in a single sitting, and one of the best novels I've read, ever! Period, end of story!Honest, dark, and perfectly paced.

So what...its Brian Keene!!!","review":"Terminal, a roller coaster ride of great proportions!! Brian Keene does not need monsters, vampires ect... to write a good thriller.

If you like Brian Keene you will love this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME READ","review":"This book was an awesome read, with an interesting twist, and very well written. I could not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far From His Best...","review":"Sadly the last two novels written by Mr. Keene (Urban Gothic, and this drivel), have been far too \\"urban\\". While it is obvious he and I are near the same age, and share (or shared...while growing up) many of the same pastimes, his recent books show he either spent too much time in the inner-city, or was one of those people who liked to seem \\"street\\"...even though he is far from it. This story was slow, and often dull, another shame given his previous works. If your a fan of Mr. Keene, then please skip this one. Only by giving him a flop (and this is one) will he return to writing quality horror fiction. Sorry but this is just plain bad writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great photo quality!!","review":"I was worried about spending 500.00 for a printer, which I knew nothing about, but after reading reviews on Google.com I felt comfortable about doing it. The quality comes out great. You can't go wrong with getting this printer. One thing I did notice, it left a scratch on my prints, when I printed 4X6 images. I have not had a chance to see if it was a one time fluke or what. I'm waiting for more paper to arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRINTER! POOR REPAIR SERVICE!","review":"I bought the printer 6 months ago and after a few months of great pictures there was a white line that developed on thepictures. I had a 1 year warranty to get it repaired and so I sent it to the Olympus Repair Service via mail in great condition. It only had an internal problem. A few weeks laterthe repair center sent me a letter stating that the product's mode dial was broken off, the front CVR cracked, the front door cracked, back cover broken, dented in back. That was completely wrong! It was in fair condtion when the printer was sent there to NY to have it repaired. I rate their service zero stars! I recommend not to buy this product. It was a simple repair that turned into a nightmare. It costed $230.00 to get it repaired. I spent $299.99 for that printer. The company Olympus is a rip-off!I wouldn't buy there products! 1 year warranty! That is so untrue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Compatible with 64-bit Computers","review":"This is a good printer, however, be forewarned that it is not compatible with Windows 7, 64-bit computers. I contacted Olympus and was advised that no printer drivers exist (or are planned) that would enable the P-440 to work with such Windows 7, 64-bit computers. I would not recommend this printer unless one intends to use this printer with a \\"legacy\\" computer that will never be upgraded. Frankly at $900, this printer is too expensive to be considered a 'throwaway.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaw dropping piece.","review":"It's a beautiful piece of fossil, still isn't so good at dark environments.

Since I bought the book based on the five star rating, I feel the need to balance them out.First off, the book has an appeal. If you've ever been in high pressure sales- insurance, auto, etc.- you'll love the way this author captures the pressure of these jobs. The first of the novel is great in this regard and the story itself has a good premise.But I was unable to finish the book because of the writing itself. I get the feeling that the book was vanity published by a rich business man. The writing itself gets very redundant and is shot through with cliches. It also occasionaly switches from active to passive tense. In some books this works. In this case it pulled me out of the story.As much as I respect the author for doing it on his own, I must say that he should've sprung for a good editor as well as the publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"repeticiuos","review":"The author reverts back to all the things that have happened throughout the entire book. Repeats constantly of his hatred for the mafia and the families involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there an editor in the house...anybody?","review":"I've discovered some great self-published ebooks but this is not one. I was in the Cayman Islands when I bought this because it was a prequel to the one set there and I was hoping for local color. Hmm. An entire novel in bold typeface without paragraph indentations? Really?! Has the author ever looked inside a REAL novel to see how it's done? Random line breaks galore, grammar-school level punctuation errors, dialogue that rings as true as an after school special, and a ho-hum narrative that tells, tells, tells. Vastly overpriced at 99 cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Middle of the road","review":"The information presented in this book was organized efficiently, however some of the information was not presented effectively to describe the processes. The sidebar notes were very helpful as were the end of chapter reviews. Overall, I learned a great deal using it. One improvement is to make the code available for the programs contained in the book on a CD-ROM or via website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice affordable watch","review":"I have bought a number of watches from Watchzone. So far so good.I would recommend buying from this seller. Highly advisable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this was...","review":"Fantastic - the entire volume, that is. My favorite would be \\"The Lady With The Toy Dog\\" by Chekov. These stories vary in length from extremely short to moderately short. They are perfect for nighttime reading, when I am winding down and don't want to pause in the middle of a full-length novel. Some stories were more interesting than others, but I can't say that I disliked any of them. I actually \`discovered' a couple of \`new' authors to look into.Of all the \`international' short story collections, the Russian collection is my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP!","review":"CHEAP LOOKING AND ALSO MADE OF CHEAP LEATHER.IF YOU LIKE GREAT LEATHER, SUCH AS THOSE MADE IN ITALY, SPAIN, BRAZIL, YOU WILL NOT FIND IT HERE."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun, well-written story from an experienced war reporter","review":"As I opened this book I told my girlfriend that if I didn't like the first sentence, I was going to put it aside and read no further.... the pressure was on.\\"It wasn't until the Orient Express was nearing the Hungarian border, about two hours out of Vienna, that I found I was traveling on the passport of a murdered man.\\"Brilliant! Needless to say, I continued onward, enjoying the book to the end.Passport to Peril is a lot of fun, and offers an interesting perspective on circa 1950 Hungary, at the time a mysterious place few Americans had hope ever to visit or to know, the author exploiting his particularly adventurous career as a reporter. It's a window into a past age, as well as a wonderful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading author","review":"This book is not by the Robert B. Parker of \\"Spenser\\" fame.

Unfortunately it was a different author with the same name and did not meet my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fakeout","review":"The key point here is that this is not THE Robert B.

Parker?","review":"I had actually finished the book before I read the back cover to see that I was mislead about the author. The book was just OK - when I thought the \\"living\\" Robert B. Parker was trying his hand at a noir novel, I thought that was great and I bought the book on that basis. The book was weak and when when I found out that I had been intentionally mislead (come on - how can it not be intentional?) I was disappointed that Amazon would be involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE","review":"Consumer alert: This book is NOT by the author of the Spenser series.

When I got it I found out it was a potboiler about the CIA, and written by some other Robert B. Parker. I've been a Spenser fan since the beginning, and one would think that this book would have come up in all the searches I've done over the years. I have to conclude that it was dragged out of bad-book limbo to take advantage of the real Parker's passing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuipd","review":"If this is not the Robert B.

I've always been fascinated by Mary McCarthy, and have read much of her work. This biography enhances McCarthy's work by highlighting specific passages and relating them to McCarthy's life, which shows a true commitment not just to McCarthy, the person, but to McCarthy, the artist. The text is well-written but also objective and filled with intricate details that truly illuminate the author's subject. If only all biographies could read this way: engaging, astute, insightful, and smart. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like walking thru mud","review":"I bought this book because it was the selection in a monthly reading group for which I belong. I also bought it because I am a huge fan of Mary McCarthy and her straight-forward, no-apologies style of writing. However, I was deeply disappointed in this book.To be honest, I never got past the first chapter. I just couldn't. Carol Brightman may be a brilliant biographer according to some, but to me she is akin to a Literature Professor with far too much time on her hands. She attempts to intellectualize a woman who lived by one credo: honesty in all things, no matter how ugly it is. Brightman uses heavy language and scholarly processes that bog the reader down and make it impossible to love a brilliant woman like Mary McCarthy.If you want to know about Mary McCarthy skip this biography and instead, go read one of Mary's many books and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Vedova Scalti","review":"I had never heard of the opera before - it's very charming.

Although a bit on the noisy side when reading CD-ROMs (but what 40x or greater drive isn't?) I have found little else to complain about.Not only is this an excellent DVD drive but the included HollywoodPlus Real Magic DVD decoder card is a definate plus. It gives you full-screen playback on both your PC and TV. The TV out is great, as it bypasses your graphics card, allowing you to watch DVD's on your TV without altering your computer's display settings.

We gave it to her on that date and when we put it together, it would not work -- not even the lamp bulb would come on. She was so excited to receive it and we were humiliatedand depressed that it would not work. We were very disapppointed and are now working to return the lamp; the return policy is not helpful and there is no phone for the manufacturer or Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this with the stroller and an additional base for our 2nd car. Very expensive and already our 4.5 mo old is outgrown it. The fabric is not breathable either and she sweats a lot in it. The hood is also very short and does not give much coverage on the carseat...it's also very heavy and not very easy to load and unload in the car. One other thing...I've noticed other mommies can rock their babies in their carseat but this one does not rock very well at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't go by reputation alone","review":"I went by the reputation of the Peg Perego carseat in choosing an infant car seat, but I wish I had spoken to more parents. Although it's an attractive car seat, convenient for taking a sleeping baby out of the car, and worked well with the stroller system, my daughter outgrew it by the time she was two months old. The seat is narrow and she often seemed cramped in there. When putting her in, there was not a way to keep the straps from falling under her, which meant fussing with her to pull the straps out from under her. The material was not breathable, and she was often sweaty when we got her out, even after a short 15 minute car ride. We eventually purchased the Britax Marathon...wish we had done it in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great infant carrier with a few drawbacks","review":"I really like the weight, color, safety ratings and package of the Peg Perego infant seat and stroller, but there are a few drawbacks. The infant seat has low height and weight maxs, the handle is a bit hard to move and the latching into the stroller takes a bit getting used to, but the biggest drawback is needing the base to use the car seat. When the Grandparents want to take her out, or friends offer to drive, they either have to use a different car seat or we have to move the base (a pain). My daughter loves the seat and the strollers, but in retrospect I probably should have gone with Graco - at least the car seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sturdy but too heavy......","review":"I bought this because I got the primo viaggio stroller. WRONG idea, just because it matches, I should have been smarter than that! My baby gets very cranky in it, it sits up too high, so her head gets stuck forward while I am driving which is very alarming and the baby wakes up pretty upset, making choking noises. The only thing I like is how tough it seems, and when she's already sleeping, and we're shopping, I don't have to pull her out of the car seat-I just snap it into her stroller and she's pretty good from there.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, there are a ton more with better features!"},{"rating":"1","title":"attractive, but uncomfortable","review":"i am a new mom of a 4 month old boy. we got this car seat based on no experience with children. i liked the way it looked, and all the car seats looked the same to me, anyway! our son hates this car seat. he cries almost every time we put him in it, i suppose because it is not comfortable for him. he is only 15 lbs. and already seems to be too big for it, even though it is supposed to go up to 22 lbs. it is awkward and heavy to carry. live and learn, i guess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Violent But Thats What I Love","review":"The back cover says: \\"The most violent and explicit book you will read\\" . I have to agree to a point, (Richard Laymons \\"One Rainy Night\\" is worse in my opinion). The villain(s) are very sick people. I haven't read anything else by Johnstone but I would like to one day. Like the other reviewers have said it is a gory battle of good vs. evil. I would recommend this if your looking to kick back and read something that doesnt take alot of thinking. I gave it 4 stars for the fact that the story kind of takes a weird turn in the middle with the whole neighborhood cult and vigilante business but overall it was a cool book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIght Mask","review":"Book was delivered in the conditioned promised but that is the only positive about the book.

I'm only using it for Skype, so I didn't install all the software, just the drivers -- Skype can handle it from there.

The installation program gibes you the option to just install the drivers, I liked that.Win XP has no problems recognizing it and it work perfectly with Skype.

Tech help at Logitec is the canned variety (if your question/problem isn't listed, tough luck) and has been no help. The camera itself works fine -- it works without a problem on my home desktop computer. The issues appears to be in the software: I loaded the software on my laptop (as the printed instructions emphsized) where it doesn't work, but I did not load the software on my desktop where it now does work. The problem might be the result of high resouce requirements of the software that some other reviews have cited. Anyway that's just a guess from one who's not all that technically literate.

I was fooled by the \\"Deluxe\\" in the name. I've always expected \\"deluxe\\" to be of a higher quality. Since it was Logitech, I trusted... more fool I. There was absolutely NO comparison. While I didn't expect the same level as on the more expensive - but reasonable for the quality (Pro 9000), I wasn't expecting something worse than anything I've ever seen. It was in the package new but of course I had to open it to find out what it was like.

Write acceleration works too, about 5x faster with the cards that sport this feature. This camera also has phenomenal battery life, especially compared to the D1.I can't think of any negatives except that I needed to buy a new flash and pay for Nikon Capture, you would think for a camera of this price they would throw in the software.I've waited a long time for this camera and am very happy.

What's more, he was one of the very few great opera singers who could sing light music convincingly, and he had the gift of making you feel that he was singing to you personally, and that he meant every word and every note. This CD is a treasurable memento of Hadley's art in operettas and musicals. Among the highlights are songs from The Student Prince, where he rivals Mario Lanza (who was thought to 'own' this operetta) in vocal beauty and surpasses him in sensitivity; there's even a 'duet' (Golden Days) where Hadley's voice blends seamlessly with Lanza's recording. But my favourite in this collection is undoubtedly 'When I grow too old to dream'. I don't believe anyone has ever sung this song more movingly and beautifully, a fitting memorial to a great singer whose life was tragically cut short but who left us enough to be grateful that he once lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptionally low quality","review":"This is the worst watch I have ever owned, almost no feature is designed in a reasonable manner. The buttons are over sensitive, making it almost impossible to get a single click. I would often need to stall in mid-run in order to get it going or halt it on water stops. The operation system is ridiculous, the time setting feature is on the same cycle as the time and stopper, making errand bumping the time almost inevitable. According to the temperature reading Chicago has one of the most temperate and stable climates around the world (exactly 74F). Worst of all, after the first drops of rain the clock just died (i.e. no display, no sound no response). The only positive thing I can say about this product is the external design is convenient if you like to clip your watch on your running gear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Dead, Cheap Device","review":"*I ordered this stopwatch and it arrived with a dead battery and no replacement. In addition, the quality seemed very poorly made. I decided to buy another stopwatch rather than to replace this one; I think that most any stopwatch you could buy would be better.

Previously I used an electronic tuning fork device from Tuner's supply to match my tuning audibly by listening for beats. I'll admit that method worked for 25 years for me, but I like the Korg CA-40 better. I get the tuning done a lot quicker with the Korg visual method than with the traditional audio method. I even tune each of the three strings per note on the treble section of the piano with it. Listening for beats is OK, but centering the needle is easier for me, as I'm a performer and not a professional piano tuner."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my daughter","review":"We bought my thirteen year old daughter a guitar and bought this tuner to go with it.

He hummed and hawed, but there was something discordant about his spiel, that didn't work out in the end. Which brings me to the Korg CA-40 Large Display Auto Chromatic Tuner. I reasoned, If I already had a tuning wrench, a tuning device would get me the rest of the way to exact pitch correction.The Korg has all the necessary features: stand-alone design lets you tune any instrument--guitar, piano, strings, whatever--watching the needle and LED lights for spot on precision without having to have an extra hand to tend the tuner. It has a 1/8th\\" plug for in-line tuning too. Turn it on, and tune. It's that easy. No operating manual needed. Intuitive and simple. The price was surprisingly affordable.So now, I not only have the Korg, I have a piano that stays in tune. I'm glad to have the Korg CA-40.

The one negative I have is that the display is not backlit, so it is hard to see in a dark room.

This performance is more colorful and less dark in sensibility.Buyers who really enjoy this music and who are not adverse to owning more than one copy of a piece would be wise to also grab a copy of the Dances performed by the Philadelphia under Ormandy. (Before it is deleted.) On an inexpensive budget label it still remains the champ for sheer majesty of orchestra sounds. The piece was composed with the Philadelphians' huge orchestral weight in mind, and their performance shows off just how fabulous an orchestra they were. The opening fortes alone give the effect of unlimited reserves. Sort of the Caruso of orchestras if you will.

He then suffered what appears to be a nervous breakdown and pretty much lost his capacity to make worthwhile music. This 1972 recording falls into the later category. For the Brahms look to Fleisher/Szell, Gilels/Reiner, Richter/Leinsdorf, Serkin/Szell, Anda/Klemperer or a handful of others depending on your taste. For the Rhapsody look to Rubinstein/Reiner, Wild/Horenstein or Katchen/Boult. All of these are head and shoulders above this recording by Cliburn. For a good example of Cliburn at his peak, try the disc containing Tchaikovsky No.1 and Rachmaninov No.2 with Kondrashin and Reiner on RCA Living Stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's that banging on the piano?","review":"Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody has to be one of my personal top ten favorite musical works, but I can't bear to listen to this recording of it. Cliburn plays like he has a 16-pound sledgehammer in each hand. I forced myself to listen to it a second time, thinking something must have thrown off my judgement, but Cliburn's playing actually made me wince. Several times. Kondrashin and the Moscow Philharmonic turn in a very martial-like accompanyment, presumably to justify their esteemed guest's interpretation, but it's still all a dreadful experience.Nothing can justify Cliburn's similar approach to the Brahms. Or make me want to hear it again, for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"u-mm,,,,,I can't.","review":"Cliburn's Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini,,, It's unpleasant. I also love his Piano Concert No.1 of Tchaikovsky and No.3 of Rachmaninov. But,,, In this Live, Cliburn seemd to maintain melodies. But, therefore, he lose further his music. And now he had mere time what he was compeld to-. It is the same for us--lisners. Kirill Kondrashin--He has a positive talent for orchestral accompaniment surely. But he has no way to assist for Cliburn. Cliburen's clumsist piano lose his balance. He barely matched with lowest speed of Kondrashin's orchestra. I couldn't listen this music until the last.The reason why I can't bear his pitiful playing.

The reader can truly see the tragic events through the eyes of a beautiful young girl. Several times while reading the story, I cried for this child who has fallen through the cracks of our society. As a mother, I desperately wanted to jump into the pages, rescue this little girl and hold her safely in the embrace of my adult arms.Cathy expertly shows the reader the reality of incest and child abuse.

Immediately upon meeting a character, Rei would ask them - \\"who do you think is the killer? do you think it is your boss\\" etc. If you read this book, you will understand how unrealistic the main character is as an investigator. Also, the dialogue is stilted. Sometimes there is a use of informal contractions, but in the same conversation, characters will switch back and forth from formal language. However, this book is a very interesting description of modern Japanese culture and may be worth reading for this aspect alone. Unfortunately, I became impatient with the way this book was written overall, and could not get past the first half. Perhaps the author should simply write nonfiction accounts of Japanese life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Floating Girl","review":"I have read all of Sujata Massey's books and enjoyed all of them.

And I could not finish reading this 4th book. From my point of view - I am a Japanese woman - , Rei Shimjura is not a half-American, half-Japanese. If this girl had a 50 % Japanese blood, she could have been a little bit nicer to Japanese citizen. Her intrusive attitude got worse and worse, so I can not share the feeling and activity of her at all. If this girl really lived in Japan with her relatives and loved ones, her attitude would have been different.No wonder her books are not popular in Japan. Her 1st and 2nd books were translated in Japanese, but not after them. Sorry Massey-san, you might have planned to sell your books in both U.S. and Japan. But Japanese people are not necessarily so fool... In your books, there are many Japanese things, but not much of Japanese heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rei was a turnoff for me","review":"I haven't read any of the previous books, and when I opened this one, I liked a Japan I could recognise; but the style became really tiresome by the time I was halfway through the book. Who cares for a litany of brand names after a while? The story would have worked equally well without them.And I was pretty put off by a Rei Shimura who made incredible leaps of 'intuition'. Japan's full of people. Why should any particular passerby be the people she's looking for?It's a mystery. There are bound to be wrong conclusions and red herrings along the way. But with the way Rei makes her conclusions, I couldn't even respect her as a detective.All in all, disappointing.

Not real.The doctor and the nurse discuss the vampire victim like she were the only patient in the entire hospital. They look too fresh and manicured, which comes off as very fake.Sorry director of this movie, you missed too many things. Not worth moviegoer time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightfully Awful","review":"My personal opinion? I can't help but compare my bitter disappointment of this movie with that which I experienced when I purchased Stephan King's Gunslinger Series, and Dean Koontz's Ice Bound. In those instances I was left thinking that surely somebody else must have written those books? What were they thinking?? Novel vs Movie, but the comparision comes to the same conclusion, to myself anyway. I guess it's a mistake to expect a certain level of excellence, regardless of the name attached.This movie is so badly done that I can honestly say it was a painful experience!

Why didn't this vamps buy a blood bank or get the homeless. In LA there is plenty to live off. They won't be missed. That part really piss me off. The main villian didn't have any real plans. There is black vamp chick. She was always yeahing and dude was like yo. I just want some booty. I don't what was worse the vamps crew or vamp helsing crew. You just wanted both of them to died.

But, this book is a product of intellectual laziness and should never have been published. If Sherman were alive today he would be on trial for war crimes. Patton was a competent commander in a sea of incompetence. Patton never fought in a battle where he did not enjoy numerical, supply, and complete air superiority. He never had to rise up to meet a foe as an underdog. Patton fought in battles that were largely mopping up operations against inferior foes. The cult of Patton does not make sense when his efforts are examined empirically.Trying to attach noble attributes to a war criminal and grandstanding personal promoter are laughable. Working for money is a necessity, but I did not expect Mr. Hansen to use his name for easy profit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travesty","review":"Lionising Sherman while dismissing Grant as a plodding General is laughable.I am far from being a knowledgeable military historian but even I know the reason Sherman's March was so successful was because George H. Thomas destroyed Hood's army at Nashville, leaving him no effective resistance in his front.It was Grant who destroyed a CSA army at Chattanooga and captured two others at Donelson and Vicksburg and was the one man in the Union Army to consistently win victory after victory by sheer determination and will.The March was an excellent logistical triumph but Hanson's chapter on Sherman could be dismissed by a high-school student.For a real look at who was responsible for the Union's triumph read John Keegan's essay on Grant in The Face of Battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanson's book is a triumph!","review":"With \\"The Soul of Battle\\", Victor Hanson makes the leap from military historian/classics professor to a true visionary on the values and sacrifices that make or break a free society. He examines the careers of three great generals who fought tyranny, using war as a mechanism for good to triumph over evil. Those who believe that all war is always bad will not like the conclusions, but will not be able to dispute them either. If you liked Hanson's earlier works, you will likewise enjoy The Soul of Battle. However, you will come away with a deeper message and a transformed view of the role of a crusading free people against the forces of evil and slavery. This is a masterful work that belongs in every thinking American's library...not just those interested in military history."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Soul of Battle","review":"Reviewer Kelly J.

I really WANTED to like this book. The (stated) premise of the book is strong, and bringing Epaminondas's exploits to a wide audience seemed pretty interesting to me.My problem was that right from the get-go it seemed to me the author had a pretty weird tendency to draw political parallels between ancient Greece and today which just aren't appropriate or realistic. They weren't key to what he was trying to say, either, so I probably could have soldiered through the book. I put it down, though, since it was distracting trying to figure out where he was really coming from.I admit that his dismissiveness toward Alexander and Grant seemed borderline childish to me, the way it was written. Perhaps that also made it hard for me to take the good parts of the book seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with Victor?","review":"I will say up front that Victor Davis Hanson has written so very good books on the ancient Greeks, but what's with him on this one? He has some good ideas, but to claim that the crackpot Sherman was fighting to end tyranny makes me wonder if Hanson's head was full full of his family wine when he wrote this. Sherman could have been tried for war crimes according to the laws of war in his own time. Sure, he was a pioneer in total warfare, just as Lenin and Stalin were in mass murder.Sherman was an insane scum-dog, nothing more. Had his side lost he would be held in the same regard as other desperate losers such as Hitler. The real fighters of tyranny in Sherman's day were the citizens of the South who had to endure his uncivilised methods of behaving towards women and children, both black and white. Stick to what you know Hanson; you are lost on this one!

I bought this because I was trying to stay away from all the bells and whistles (LED lights, digital displays, etc.), but I expected the best functions.My gripes: 1) the width of the slots is just adequate to fit traditional bread. If you have a wide loaf, say rye, it won't fit. You have to turn it vertically and flip it halfway through. 2) the slots are thick enough for bagels and such, but they do not adjust (clamp down) for thiner pieces. So if you have a thin slice, it will lean at an angle instead of standing staight up-and-down in the middle. 3) The toast does not sit high enough in the slots.

After 8 years of higher education (no, not dim, just got 2 degrees and a Masters), this is unquestionably the most difficult-to-follow and poorly edited textbook I've ever had the displeasure of using. This is the quintessential engineer-trying-to-write-a-book book. Hardly a page goes by that isn't absolutely overwhelmed with call-out boxes, \\"Important Reminders!\\", unnecessary inset notes, diagram indication arrows flying all over the place, and general layout chaos.

This is brilliant and inspired music - the instrumentals even top \\"Olinda Road\\" from the first album -- \\"Stars in the Morning Sky\\", \\"Emme's Island Moments Theme\\", \\"Debra Anne\\", \\"Cavatina\\". Barry's genius for harmony in diversity continues with the title cut, blending Irish pipes, Slack Key, and Charles Ka'Upu's ancient and moving chants.

It is called Bounce, Shake, Move,Swing, this song is good for all you dancers out there but for me the song was a bit to repetative and did not have the smooth sound and harmonization that i love about Boyz II Men.

I thought it was Michael Jackson at first (who is it by the way?)After 'Evolution' many are totally put off the guys (seeing as the whole album was totally depressing to listen to) but this one makes me believe that they are back (fingers crossed).

I will always love them for ballads first, but the more up tempo songs on here are just as good in their own right. This is the group all the others want to be like, and from the sounds of this album, looks like they'll have a high standard to live up to.

In a nut shell, this U.S. submarine not only takes on and destroys every submarine and surface ship the PLAN can send at it, but it also destroys many of Russias most advanced submarines, operated by Russian sailors.

Everything the US sub does works perfectly. Everything the enemy does fails.I gather that this is a novelization of a computer game.

Rock' comic book. No character development, the enemy is inherently evil and incompetent, and the hero kills everybody while complaining about what hot sweaty work it is. Even the techno talk is repetitious. Definitely a low point for Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy sinks himself","review":"I can't believe how poor this \\"novel\\" is. SSN is totally devoid of character development - the writer (which was probably not Clancy) did not even bother to name the Cheyenne's officers. Dialogue and action were monotonous (open doors one and two...), and featured the Cheyenne single-handedly annihilating the entire Chinese navy.I now know that it was meant to be a guide for the SSN computer game. Should definitely not be a standalone read. I like Clancy a lot, but this one will not be making my book shelf.STAY FAR AWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS A WASTE!","review":"Trust me, this book is a total waste of time and money. this is not like clancy! I reccommend all other clancy books but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"After the first few battles, you knew that the Cheyenne was not going to get killed. It was about as interesting as watching someone else play a video game with cheats enabled so they couldn't ever be killed. Don't waste your time on this book. Tom should be embarrassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Scam !!","review":"This book has no stroy line whatsoever. It is a chronology of incidences all strung together. I'll tell you how bad it is...I could have written this book with little effort. Only one character has a name - The CO of the boat. The other officers and enlisted are referred to by title only. Mr. Clancy used his reputation to pull off a fast one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One SSN Defeats Entire Chinese Navy","review":"This has to rank as one of the worst novels ever published. The premise is unrealistic, the story lacks emotion, and each chapter is a mirror image of the previous one. Send sub out, sub sinks everything in it's path, sub doesn't even get a scratch, sub returns to rearm. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I am a self admitted Tom Clancy junkie and had read all of his books, with SSN being the sole remaining piece. I am quite frankly having a difficult time believing that Tom Clancy actually wrote this book. While there are some very fascinating peeks into the inner workings of a submarine, the book is repetitive to the point of boring, has unrealistic and not believable fiction. Each of the battle sequences seems to be the exact same, with minor variations. The fiction regarding the location of the legal Chinese PM, the response of the Chinese people to the naval conflicts, and the method of transportation for the Chinese PM back to resolve the conflict are down right silly. Unless you really really really want to know some random facts about how a Submarine works, I would advise avoiding this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this one!","review":"What a stinker! Except for Captain Mackey, none of the characters had names, faces or personalities. I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did. No suspense, no character development, no plot. I am almost ashamed to say I read the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One dialogue: over and over and over and over....","review":"After the first attack, nothing changes. Same cut and paste dialogue. \\"Make tubes one and two ready in all respects, including opening the outer doors.\\" This book went on way too long, and had a predictable conclusion. Is this the same guy that wrote \\"Red October\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"From now on I will read the reviews","review":"2/3 of the way through this book, and no plot, no suspense, no character developement. Our countermaasures always work, theirs never work. Boring, Predictable, un-beleivable. Then I brought up the reviews! At least I'm not alone. If only I had done that befpre buying I could have saved my time, money, and respect for Tom Clancey."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Dissapointment","review":"As a total Tom Clancy Fan, I am sad to say that this book is as awful as it can be, to say it's boring is a understatement. If Tom Clancy thinks he can use his fame to sell garbage like that, he will lose his readership very fast. This is definitly the last time I spend money on this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor beyond belief","review":"I've always depended on Mr. Clancy for great character development, plot and realism.

I wish they had negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to fill 300 pages and not get anywhere.","review":"As someone who has enjoyed his books immensly, I was beyond disappointed with this book. I don't think that this book is targeted towards his usual audience. Very dull writing. No true plot. No characters. No real action. Hmm no real anything. Good thing I bought it cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I like Tom Clancy but this is not him. Even in the Amazon listing it doesn't show it but the fine print at the bottom of the cover says \\"Created by Tom Clancy and Martin Greenberg\\".Either Clancy is cranking books out too fast or he's selling his name.One chapter might as well be a cut and paste of the previous.I've read two books now that were \\"co-authored\\" by Clancy and neither was worth a damn. I will never buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, predicable","review":"If you like wrestling, Rambo or Superman, you'll like this one. It is Superman in a Submarine.

I bought it in an airport to read on the plane and got more entertainment out of the flight safety card. I'll never read Clancy again until he repays me for this travesty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Belongs in a software box, not a bookshelf","review":"Having read so many excellent Tom Clancy books, I can't help but feel cheated. While I still consider Clancy a great writer (how many other authors can write 1,000 page \\"nailbiters\\"?), SSN is truly a waste of time, money, and paper.From what I understand, this book relates to a software game he made. This story should've been in the box with the game manual, not as a book. Clancy could've been ahead of the curve and written a thriller about WWIII involving China and America ... instead he wrote the same boring lines over and over again. No thought, no involvement, and no interest on the part of the reader. SSN was a real stinker. I wish I had read the reviews here before I bought the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying it.","review":"I bought this book because I expected to receive a well written novel on par with Clancy's other works. It ain't! There is NO character development. There is NO coherent plot or story. The technical info isn't there. What the ---- is this anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"how about 0 stars","review":"One star is too much, how about 0 stars! If you are unlucky enough to have bought this book,and have not read it yet, save yourself some time and pick out any chapter and read it. After you read that chapter, throw the book away,you have read the whole thing. The endless redundacy of \\"make tubes one and two ready in all respects\\" and \\"units from tubes one and two running hot,straight, and normal\\" is mindless. Maybe you get a mindless book, by writting about a video game. Has Mr. Clancy written his last great novel? I don't think so! Has he written his last sequel to a video game? I sure hope so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy at his worst","review":"Tom must have been really bored when he wrote the book. UN sanctions against China? With China a permanent member of the UN Security council it would be rather difficult to get the UN to take ANY meassure against China.As far as submarine strategy is concerned, the book is full of errors and inacuracies.

Clancy shmoozes with military personnel, gets interesting inside info, and then further ingratiates himself by writing extremely flattering books about them. I'd like to believe that a single SSN could take out most of the Chinese Navy, but I'm a little skeptical, and the bit with the deposed Chinese leader was just too much.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst \\"Clancy\\" book yet.","review":"This is by far the worst book ever \\"created\\" by Clancy. I'm not sure why he even puts his name on the garbage that has been released lately as it is sadly evident that he had little to do in writing this book. The plot is marginal at best and is not built up at all. The characters have no background and do not have any allure to them. The techno babble is over the top and repetitious to the point where only a submariner could understand most of the book. Don't waste your time or money on this book as you'll be thoroughly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"This book disapointed me.

And that's the ONLY character that there is...everybody else is just 3 or 4 letter job titles (OOD, COB, etc.). Part way through I waxed nostalgic for Hunt For Red October...which had GREAT characters...and SUB scenes that kept you glued to your chair... Moral: it is important to distinguish between books written by Clancy (where he's the only name in the Author slot) - and books that Clancy has lent his name to for economic reasons (which have multiple names in the Author slot). Grab up all you can of the former - and as few as you can of the latter.

It definitely did not deliver.While the action \\"scenes\\" were quite fun, they were also rather repetitive. There was very little plot, and no character development. The end result is a story that is about as believable as a Rambo movie. I very seriously doubt that the entire Chinese navy, which was being constantly augmented with Soviet boats and crews, could be eliminated by a single sub. I don't buy it, and neither should you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A war submarines fight in a war against China","review":"Tom Clancy's SSN is about a submarine Cheyenne and her crew in the Pacific Ocean that has been put out to watch for other Chinese war ships or submarines. When America is forced to go to war with China, Cheyenne is given the order to destroy any Chinese ship or submarine that they find on their never- ending battle throughout the Pacific. Towards the climax, the crew learns that the Russians are selling Typhoon Class submarines (the largest yet created) to the Chinese, which has already put them into the ocean. This book combines interesting facts about submarines and the ocean with an adventurous story by Tom Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Sub to the Rescue!","review":"Carrier group out of the picture? no problem, send in super sub!Seas full of enemy subs? no problem, send in super sub!Russians getting involved? no problem, send in super sub!No character development? no problem, send in super sub!No plot development? no problem, send in super sub!Clancy loosing it in a big way? Maybe there is one thing super sub can't save."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money or The Time","review":"A dime store \\"novel\\", at best, which, after reading a few pages, I realized was not anything close to a real book. Should not have been represented as a new Tom Clancy novel and certainly should not have had the promotional references to character development on the back cover. Repetetive passages about perfect submarine kills with no true represetation of realities of life at sea, maintenance or weapons problems. I fault the bookstore for displaying it as a Tom Clancy novel, and I fault Tom Clancy for not clearly labelling this as NOT a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy didnt write this .. his pet orangutan did","review":"Here's a brief synopsis of this \\"novel\\":1) Captain Mack Mackey (Imaginative name isn't it) is assigned the most advanced submarine ever made for the US Navy.2) US and China go to war, and Mack is thrown into action.3) Mack spots a chinese submarine. he fires a torpedo. he sinks it.4) Mack spots 2 chinese submarines. he fires torpedos. he sinks them.5) Mack spots 3 chinese submarines. he fires torpedos. he sinks them.6) Mack spots 5 chinese submarines. he fires torpedos. he sinks them.7) Mack spots 1,000,000,000 chinese submarines. he fires torpedos. he sinks them.......Throughout this novel, the SSN submarine never faces a single challenge or sustains any major damage. one submarine takes out pretty much the entire chinese submarine fleet. At least this novel has realism going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"If you haven't read this book, here is the complete plot.1. Make tubes one and two ready in all respects including opening the outer doors.2. Fire torpedoes3. Sink enemy subs4. Evade enemy torpedoes5. Lather, rinse, repeat.The only good thing about this was that I spent only a dollar on this book at a garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This being my first Clancy book, I had hoped for better. The story goes like this: starts one mission, tubes one and two readied, shoots down another submarine. Another mission starts and the same thing goes on and on like a broken record. This may be what submarine life is all about -- repetition and boredom -- but if only the author gave it a chance to be interesting. I was really dissapointed when I read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly turned me away from reading altogether!","review":"I am sorry to have to write this about one of Tom Clancy's books, but I must.The book is so UNREALISTIC. The situations that it is in are so untruthful. If these were to actually happen, the Cheyenne would have died before I stopped reading it, aroud page one-hundred. It can meet up with any number of submarines and attack, kill and defeat EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM!I am sorry Mr. Clancy but this book, is a definate FLOP compared to your others, in my personal opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad to See Tom Clancy going so far down hill","review":"This was probably the worst Tom Clancy book ever. He used to take the time to research for accuracy now all he seems to care about is ginning out books no matter how unaccurate they are. It was just absurd as to how the battles went. So easy for the Americans it took all enjoyment from reading the book. I am usually a big fan but this was just totally sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Clancy has no respect for his readers","review":"This is one of the worst books I ever read. I did not go further than page 192. Platitudes, repetitions, and military jargon diarrhea are what this book is all about. Where is the plot? The Chinese Navy is portrayed as providing \\"sitting ducks\\" for the glory of USS Cheyenne. Feeding a computer with randomly chosen Navy manuals would not have produced worse reading.Never again will I buy a book by the same \\"author\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless Repetition of Same Torpedo Launching Sequence","review":"This is possibly the worst book I have ever come across. Obviously, SSN is about submarine warfare - launching torpedoes to sink the enemies. Repeat the same battle scene once, twice, ..., 20 times, does that give you a novel? It would be nonsensical even as a computer game. As a book it is, simply, a waste of paper in the environmentally conscious world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy's worst -- don't waste your time or your money","review":"Readers should be paid to read this one -- not have their hard-earned cash separated from them on a pretense. Amazon refused to let me review this with zero stars, but that's all this one deserves.I'm a sucker for books about submarines, both fiction and non-fiction, and have read many entertaining novels on the subject, including Hunt for Red October, which was my first exposure to Clancy, and which I can still point to as a great example of the genre. This one, however, was utterly horrendous. The book was the same scenario, over and over again, horribly repetitive, utterly unimaginative. Outside of a very few, the characters didn't even have names, but were referred to by their billets (the XO, the weapons officer, the sonarman, ad nauseam). I kept reading until the end, figuring it had to get better. Boy, was I wrong. I'll never get that time back again. What a rotten way to spend a summer day."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way.","review":"On the basis of the many hours of great reading I have enjoyed from the pen of Tom Clancy I refuse to believe that he had any part in writing this amateurish waste of time. The book is boring, grammatically flawed, repititious, lackluster and totally without any redeeming feature. Clancy could do better than this during a visit to his dentist, indeed, to his proctologist. Don't even think about wasting your time or money on this miserable waste of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a book?","review":"Nothing but a long repetitive string of cliches and utterly stupid commands like \\"Navigator, plot a course to take us to starboard of the Spratley Islands.\\" Clancy, never really much of a writer beyond technocratic jargon, has become very, very lazy. The idea for this novel (war with China) had lots of promise, more than \\"Red Star Rising\\", but it wasn't developed much beyond a poorly written and sketchy outline. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a linear video game","review":"Not a bad read, but the plot is simple and 1 dimensional. It does describe the technical aspects of submarine warfare, but the plot was repetitive. Enemy subs sighted, go to them, destroy. The video game would be more exciting, with more variations. And for $15, this book wasn't really worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes great kindling or a paper weight","review":"This book reads like someone playing the CD game with the cheats on. China loses 3/4 of their navy and the U.S. loses one helicopter and one outdated sub!? While I enjoyed the technical aspects, this book could put the dead to sleep. Search, fire, kill. Search, fire kill. Kill, kill, kill. At some points I began rooting for the Chinese in hopes of a plot twist, but no such luck. Unless you're looking for a manual on how to win a one-sided war, leave this snoozer in the bargain bin where you found it and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbecomingly dissapointing","review":"Truly a letdown from an otherwise master of storytelling. To its credit, the book hits high marks with its accurate technojargon. However, there is really no story to be told, no characters to build, and as such, no impetus for the reader to turn the pages (other than to see if there actually will be some story/character development). I am not sure if the book is written to tout the videogame, or to ride its coattails. In any case, Mr Clancy has himself raised the standards high above such blandness, and cannot expect his readership to embrace such mediocre storylining, albeit amidst brilliant technical detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"An obvious promotion for his computer game.","review":"Only in a computer game could a single submarine sink 60+ ships without a single bit of damage. No character development to speak of and very predictable. Made a great coffee mug coaster while I was reading Computer Gaming World (hence the 2 stars)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This book feels like an idiotic computer game set at the easiest setting. The most ridiculus is not having one submarine destroy almost single-handedly the chinese fleet, but having the USA military command send it to do so. Absolutely worthless. Compare to Red Storm Rising if you are interested in tactical and strategical military action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jingoistic Trash","review":"After playing Janes 688(i) game I got exited about submarines and bought this book. This book is trash. Its just a chronicle on the stupidity of the Chinese Navy. One is reminded of the TV series \\"Combat\\" where the Germans runs out from cover and yells to the GIs \\"shoott me! shoott me! The book just reads like a computer game, 60+(from what I read here) kills to nothing . I threw the book away in disgust before I finished.

Meanwhile I'll wait for the mission pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive chapters, some pretty action","review":"Pretty much disappointing. If you don't have the computer game it's a waste of money, otherwise it's probably nice to see what tactics were used in each of the 15 scenarios.Probably a hell of a help for those playing the computer game.Lacks in character development, unsatisfying read.In short: BLAH! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOORING!","review":"About as interesting and exciting as a boxing match between Mike Tyson and George Burns. \\"Hey Mack there are some ships over there lets go sink them.

This book is a series of repetitive phrases and prose that might well work in a novel if and when one is written around this story line. I have read everything Clancy (and others using his fame) have written, and enjoy his work enormously. Even the weakest of the other novels have characters - I had read half this book and couldn't name the hero's exec. officer, nor any other character in the book. One dimensional is putting it mildly. This book should be enclosed with the cd rom game, perhaps, as value added merchandising. It should not be sold as a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I am not alone","review":"I am glad that I looked at the reviews on this book. I am about half way through it and keep getting lost in the Navy and submarine acronyms. I was beginning to think it was me! The book is definitely not one of Clancy's best. Normally, I recommend his books to everyone. However this book might only be of interest to former Naval personnel. I wonder what audience he was addressing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally surrealist and without suspense","review":"It was a real pain to finish reading this book. How can just one sub make the whole Chinese navy sink ?! And there is absolutly no suspense.In brief this book is really disappointing and poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing","review":"A rather disappointing book from master writer Clancy, which resemples a \\"shoot-em up\\" game where all enemy submarines are easily killed by a US submarine (USS \\"Cheyenne\\") in 15 highly unrealistic scenarios. The class 688I boat is able to sink more than 60 Chinese submarines with astonishing ease. Her torpedoes never fail while Chinese weapons always miss their target and fall victims to decoys or mulfanctions. Clancy would have made a better book if the Chinese were reacting defensively and didn't have such an outraging incompetence as to have a diesel electric submarine in a war zone with its snorckel not operating! I'm interested mainly in the tactics of underwater warfare and here Clancy gives only a few tips. a very one-sided and completely unrealistic fictional book where Americans do all the damage and Chinese play the role of the siting ducks."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to write a book using a word processor","review":"I gave this book a one-star rating. If I could have given it a lower rating, I would have. There ought to be a law against wasting trees in this manner.As I read the book, it struck me that the battle action sequences were all cut and pasted from boilerplate text. The plot was plausible, but the story as it developed was not. The story is repetitious and even boring in places.In the past, I've bought Tom Clancy's books on the strength of his name. I'll not make that mistake again. This one was a total let down; I don't care what excuses the author(s) choose to defend their work.

A far cry from Tom's other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Again USA USA USA USA","review":"It never ceases to amaze me how Tom Clancy can continue to write with one aim in mind..... to promote the United States. The book is simply about a series of Chino-American submarine engagements. There are some political factors thrown into the mix for good fortune as well but the storyline is very thin. Once again the American submarine defeated all enemy vessels with ease. This is never the case in submarine warfare from which I can speak with active and professional experience. Don't expect anything enthralling once you open that cover.... you'd be better trying another from his range such as \\"The Hunt For Red October\\". This book was still too pro-USA but at least was well written and an entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"SSN: a dud tin-fish","review":"Tom Clancy's \\"SSN\\" is a book written around acomputer game.

This book has to be his low-point. I know submariners that threw it away before half-way through. I'm still trying to figure out how one submarine can travel half-way around the world, destroy several Chinese targets, and stop for supplies before the rest of the U.S. Navy can even get ready. It will be a while before I pick up another Clancy book. I give it one star becasue I can't get lower."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lousy excuse for a Book even if it is a good Computer Game","review":"Simply put, this is one big commercial for his computer game. If you buy the computer game, the book might come in handy. If not, you're wasting your money.This is a series of fifteen chapters which apparently correspond to events in the computer game. There is some common thread throughout the chapters, mainly that we are at war with China over the Spratley Islands and that Clancy's sub skipper, one Captain Mack Mackey, goes about various missions as we go to war. Tom Clancy in his introduction, freely states that the book is modeled after the computer game but he also says that his goal is to give the reader \\"a strategy guide to submarine warfare\\". There is some strategy. The strategy is to sell the computer game. Take the \\"interview\\" with his friends... a significant amount of that interview discusses how closely the book follows the game. Enough said.Dont buy it unless you're going to buy the game too."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Ouch\\"","review":"It was painful trying to make myself finish this terrible book.

Seems as if Mr. Clancy only put his name on the cover, none of his usually brillant characterization or plots are between the pages. One sub destroys the entire Chinese navy plus a few Russians.

While the concept is great (short story presenting a problem then kids pick from 3 multi-choices after reading a scripture), I often find it frustrating for a couple reasons.First the 3 choices are often 2 ridiculously obvious non-choices followed by the third obvious answer. Second the scriptures used are often either irrelevant or such a stretch fit to the situation presented as to be irrelevant.It seems to me that the author had a great idea but got caught mass producing 365 situations. Hate to be a party-pooper, and happy that the book fits for some, but 'forewarned' for others who may find it like me. Strongly suggest a pre-read prior to purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but choices are dopey.","review":"We enjoy this book purely because we love laughing at the stupid multiple choice answers where it's so obvious which one you should pick. 99% of the time it goes something like this:Bob's friend broke a promise. Should Bob:a. Scream and hit his friend.b. Run away from his friend and never speak to him again.c. Forgive his friend.Yeah, pretty much just a waste of time.To add to that, the scripture references often don't even relate to the situation at all.Good idea, but falls ridiculously short of being even close to a good use of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept, but ...","review":"I agree with the other reviewer. The bible verses often do not seem to fit the story or they aren't appropriate for the age group. Often, my daughter (age 8) would \\"get\\" the intent of the devotion, but would then be confused by the \\"scripture answer\\" in the back of the book. I also find it tedious to keep flipping to the back for the answers. However, it IS a great conversation starter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"The book contents are good.

Although the 4 year old is not quite able to do all the devotions about school situations, he has been able to answer the ones about lying, working hard, sharing, helping out, etc. Even my older children, who haven't been in school, are able to work through the school situations from what they see in the kids around them or what they struggle with being homeschooled. I love this book for helping us to reinforce Biblical principles we have been teaching our children. The Scripture fits well and leads to AWESOME discussion on what it means and how it fits. The best thing parents can do when reading this book is to make sure they understand the Scripture so they can add to the discussion. I highly recommend this book and my kids do also as they are always begging to do more every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talent","review":"A few years ago, I went to Encore and this book was being displayed.

Once in a while, when I have recovered from the previous try, I watch like 10, 15 minutes but then again I get so bored and annoyed that I have to turn the player off. I seems to be a kind of road movie where reality blends with dreams and daydreams. The pace is so slow, the direction is so poor and the dialogues are so bad! But the most annoying ingredient is the music. The score is so incredibly ill-matched with the movie, I have never seen anything like it. Where you would expect a kind of light-hearted, somewhat animated music, there are those depressing layers of sad strings that would better fit a psychological thriller or a documentary on sand in the desert.I like the main actor a lot and the trailer of \\"Love Comes Lately\\" was modestly funny and witty but the actual movie, unfortunately, is very odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad for me,mabe GOOD for you !","review":"The actors did a great job I just didn't get the tradition's .

And Patti LaBelle? Well, she is the patron saint of masturbatory yammering. On the other hand, Brian Setzer cuts loose on \\"Jet Song\\" in a way that'd be certain to put a smile on the face of Mr. Bernstein. There are some nice interpretations, but all in all, it has an inorganic, overproduced, Yamaha DX7'y sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"I echo another listener's sentiments: \\"what have they done to 'West Side Story?'\\" This recording takes the absolutely beautiful music of the original musical and mangles it almost beyond recognition to offer up a modernized, rap-infused version for the culturally devoid listeners out there.

I bought it because I love West Side Story. Unlike others here I am totally able to look at this with open eyes. The stand outs are definitely Brian Setzer, Little Richard, Chick Corea and Steve Vai. Somewhere by Aretha Franklin is soulful. Overall a fun CD, let your hair down a bit, variety IS the spice of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Interpretations of One of Broadway's Best","review":"I have had this one since its release some four years ago and still feel that it features some truly unique versions of the principal songs from the musical. Each of the artists involved brings his/her individual talents to the front in renditions that are simultaneously original and respectful. Being a fan of all the performers, I can only be biased in my review. When an album features the likes of Aretha Franklin, Patti Austin, Patti LaBelle, Chick Corea, Selena, Phil Collins, Trisha Yearwood, Michael McDonald, and the one-and-only Little Richard, it can only be deserving of five stars. And when the music is from the greatest Broadway musical of all time, it can only be a winner.This is the way that I am sure that Bernstein would have enjoyed hearing his timeless melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"When our high school decided to do West Side Story, it was questioned whether the original music would be modern and catchy enough for the young performers. Thats when this C.D was mentioned.After hours of reviewing, we decided that all songs on this C.D (Except I feel pretty, Officer Krupke and Somethings coming) were perfect for a young cast and audience.Although people were a bit touchy about the idea of losing the originality of Bernstein's classic composure, we managed to wow audiences with a modern version of a classic musical.The traditional dance scenes were replaced with Latin and Break dancing, and costumes created to adapt to modern fashion, and let me say that we well and truely lifted the roof with this stunning modern performance, without losing the original power of the musical.This C.D is a MUST for any true West Side Story fan, because it remains brilliant without losing artistic integrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Songs Of West side Story","review":"This is a great cd, it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them.

I have to say I like Kelly's no-nonsense and variety approach better. She gives me a tough workout and does utilize plank position and pushups, but not overdoing it, and I always feel so good afterwards with sore muscles but NOT sore joints.

Late on the scene I am, but better late than never...The quality of the weaving of celtic rythms and quality singing from superstars makes this outing very refreshing.My favorite on the CD is Mick Jagger in his great vocals on the soung LONG BLACK VEIL. i have heard many covers of this, and MJ does a very good job.If you enjoy quality music, this will def. make you smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great group, great guests.","review":"It's hard not to like a \\"Chieftains\\" album. They're pretty much THE name in traditional Irish instrumentation. It's even harder not to like when it includes guest artists such as \\"Sting\\", \\"Sinead O' Connor\\", \\"Marianne Faithfull\\", \\"Van Morrison\\", \\"Mark Knopfler\\", and \\"The Rolling Stones\\", among others. I'd say every one of these match-ups is a good one, and even though \\"Tom Jones\\" may seem out of place here, he still does a good job too. I must say however, \\"Sinead\\" does possibly the best performance here, she is just perfect for her 2 songs. Of course despite the major help here, it's still very much a \\"Chieftains\\" album, and they're so very good on each track, you don't forget that. This is soon to be re-released also."},{"rating":"1","title":"From them, a huge disappointment","review":"The opening track is an awesome collaboration with Sting. I thought that if the rest of the CD was that good, I'd love it. It isn't, and I don't. In fact, there are only two tracks on this disk I really like. The only other song I liked on it was the very funny Changing Your Demeanor (who knew Derek Bell could honky-tonk like that?!). The rest of it just doesn't work. Tom Jones does such a hammy job of Tennessee Waltz, he ruins one of my all-time favorite songs. And I'm sorry, but Mick Jagger singing The Rocky Road to Dublin is just wrong.A rare misfire from a usually rock-reliable group of musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing???","review":"I hate this CD.

It just keeps growing on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a weak track on it!","review":"Every collaboration on this album is pulled off with verve and energy. Perhaps the most impressive thing about this disc is that with so many flamboyant guest stars, it could've deteriorated into a gimmicky experiment; instead, the Chieftains are able to truly collaborate with each artist. And the artists seem to be eager to do so...listen to Sting sing in a Scottish brogue on the first track, for example... Sinead O'Connor's time-stopping rendition of \\"He Moved Through the Fair\\" is nearly a capella, with only the softest of pipe trills to support her amazing vocals. It's my favorite track on the disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best C.D. s ever!!!","review":"I loved all the songs on this C.D.

I fear that part of its attractiveness is the fact that it is so thin. I think that for the right kind of personality, this book is inspiring. I could see giving this to a person who perhaps needed a self-esteem boost or was trying to define their self-worth. However, there are just not enough common themes to resonate as a development guide for everyone. I lost patience with some of the long-winded passages; for example, there is one where the author relays an entire conversation with someone which could be an insightful tool but in this case it felt like filler. The book also plays into the current trend of parable-style books which is becoming trite. In this case, its cutesy visuals using circles as metaphors becomes tired and makes the book feel as if it is not quite aimed at an adult audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much psychobabble","review":"The Nibble Theory has some interesting illustrations.

This time you command a single underdog spacecraft, but with a serious amount of ongoing customization to the ship possible through continued research. The individual missions are more challenging than before as well, since the underdog status forces you to employ the \\"right\\" strategy or else. You can't just slug it out toe to toe using a superior force in most of the missions. It can be a bit frustrating from this standpoint if you get stuck for a solution.

I burned through one entire $38 roll attempting to do just one window panel, and my 8 year old learned some words that I was hoping he could avoid until at least 5th grade. A waste of time and money.

I will say this, the plates and the glide were super smooth - that was a good thing about it; and it also heated up as fast as all other flat irons i've had.

(FYI, he didn't specifically recommend this one, but suggested I look on Amazon for a ceramic BaByliss iron in this price range.) I had been complaining that my cheap flat iron didn't get my hair straight enough. Thankfully he told me about this brand b/c I was almost to the point of shelling out $100+ for a fancier one. This iron gets hot quickly and straightens my hair easily. My hair is naturally wavy (not kinky curly, but definitely not straight) and this iron can straighten out my hair from that wavy state pretty easily. It has a removable comb on one side to help smooth/guide your hair through the iron. I've tried both ways and find the comb helpful. For under $30, this is a great iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babyliss Pro BAB2490","review":"Took 9 days to receive. Hate it. While it straightens your hair it leaves it looking frizzy.

I have been through probably 10 different straighteners in my lifetime, and this is by far the best. And it's so affordable too! I have thick, curly hair, and this straightener does wonders. It doesn't pull your hair out either. My first one lasted about 3 years, but finally died after having been dropped a bazillion times. I replaced it with a Conair Infiniti that looked almost identical (Conair Pro manufactures Babyliss), but it did not live up to the Babyliss straightener AT ALL.

Her hair in down to the middle of her back and slightly wavy. This iron is awesome. The comb attachment really helps keep her hair straight when it is pulled through the iron. I help her right now with it and, when we are done, it looks like it does when she gets it cut and blown out at the salon. The iron has on/off switch and adjustable temperature setting.

I set the temperature between 390 and 420 and after about ten minutes of using the flat iron (and getting my hair pulled out buy the comb on the flat iron), I began to smell something that smelled a little off I looked at the flat iron and plastic around the plates were melting.

She sings a song about killing him for vengeance, while he falls in love with this fiesty slave. Well sung and played by all four of the principles. It remains on my \\"desert island\\" list of 6, out of about 120 operas I have seen. If you love Verdi, as I do, you won't regret buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for Verdi fans...Probably coming up again??","review":"Most of the production is said here. I just can say that this is probably the best opera of those \\"minor operas\\" verdi wrote. Picture is very good, considering the quality resolution at that time. The stereo sound is worth it. There's no choice to change or switch off subtitles.This production is from 1991 and from Image. Now, when there are many productions from LaScala coming up, and the \\"I vespri Siciliani\\" (from Image too) was re-released by Opus Arte, i guess we can have this opera again in the market.

The warm hearted witch teaches a cold hearted duke how to laugh and love. She tells the duke she was a witch on her wedding night and had to prove it to be believed.

Alec is so staid and proper, so concerned about even a minor scandal -- and he unknowingly marries a witch, a very clumsy one. Sometimes Alec is verbally cruel to her, but it comes from his upbringing and generations of Duke's just like her starts this novel -- wow, do things change by the end. Joy's natural optimism keeps her from giving up early in their relationship. But who can resist all those pink rose petals? Oh, my goodness. A delightful paranormal that is emotionally satisfying without taking itself too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickly Sweet, No Depth","review":"This book was solidly mediocre. Character development was not great. The lead heroine was too upbeat and hopeful, and it was hard to believe she fell in love with her hero so fast. The \\"hero\\" of this story was unpleasant and unlikable, with few redeeming qualities. It was tough to root for him, or for them as a couple. Not much action or intrigue, but okay if you like sickly sweet heroines who have no problem pining after their man and enduring ridicule as a silent martyr. The plot attempts to get the heroine caught up in ludicrous consequences of poorly controlled magic, but scenes were nowhere close to laugh-out-loud funny. There are a few good romantic moments, but they don't make the book worth reading. At only $0.99, I won't say it's a waste of money, but there are certainly better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"There was a lot of dragging in this book.

What a dissapointment! The story starts out interesting enough, but goes nowhere. The heroine is entirely too sweet, perky, and naive, and tends to thrive on emotional abuse. The hero (a zero in my book), is an emotionless, cardboard snob that is almost impossible to like or even identify with. The plot is practically non-existant. Believe it or not, I ALMOST finished it before I realized that it was taking me twice as long to read as other books.

It has explicit sexual scenes that could have and should have been left out. When you read the description of the book you think it will be like the television show bewitched that is set in the late 1700's. I thought it would be a romantic comedy.

I laughed out loud many times while reading the book and it was the first historical romance book I have ever read where I found myself discussing particulars of the story to my husband--it was that funny, that good!So, my only disappointment w/the book is that it ended, it was that good.

But then I'm a sucker for Beauty and the Beast type stories anyway. What I'm not an avid follower of is paranormal, the dark seamy stuff. Jill Barnett's Bewitching is as far from that as can be, in spite of heartstopping mistakes and English pigheadedness (on the part of the duke, of course!)You'll love Joyous and, eventually, Alec, \\"her Alec.\\" Treat yourself to an emotional ride with a most satisfactory ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this foolishness...","review":"Let me just say I love books that have magical themes and involve witches, etc.,. This was well written and some of the situations are truly humorous, but the book was just not well plotted and the characters were beyond foolish. Oddly enough if the element of magic were removed from this book it probably would have been better (a country bumpkin, fish out of water type story, not original but it still can be done well). The heroine is just an idiot, and NOT charming as I suppose she was intended to be. I finally gave up on her when she accepts a sleigh ride as an apology for a terrible affront from the hero.

It appears to charge OK in the D300 charger, but, like other reviewers, the D300 just shows the low battery symbol when it's inserted and won't operate the camera. Now, after purchase, I hear of other similar experiences.

Mostly decided on the keyboard because of the number pad and 2 USB ports. I wanted to replace my Mac's original keyboard which didn't have a number pad. The problem appeared when I tried to plug in my iPod. There was insufficient power to charge/load it. Also, I have a card reader that needs power. Can't run that either. I won't return it as the trouble wouldn't be worth the refund less shipping. My husband thinks these are USB 1 ports instead of USB 2. Box doesn't specify.

I figured since they make Mac keyboards that the company would be smart enough to use the same shade of white. They did not. Not only that, but the white mouse is a DIFFERENT white than the keyboard. Three different whites was just over the top, so I returned this set to amazon. Now I have a black keyboard and black mouse. They don't match the eMac either, but the contrast looks better then using components with three different shades of white."},{"rating":"2","title":"Macally Keyboard and Mouse","review":"I've only had this product for 2 weeks but so far I'm pleased with it.

My last Macally only failed because a friend spilled wine on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"USB Ports Do Not Draw Enough Power","review":"I purchased this keyboard set when a spilled cocktail took my Apple keyboard out of commission and I didn't want to pay $50 to replace it. This, though it lacks the aesthetic qualities of newer keyboards, is a perfectly fine replacement EXCEPT for one thing: the USB ports on the keyboard don't draw enough power for an iPod to function (sync, charge, transfer music). They also don't draw enough power for my USB scanner to function. Since the existence of USB ports on this keyboard was one of the major reasons I chose it over other options (I was also considering wireless keyboards, most of which don't have built-in USB ports), this is a major letdown. I will probably keep it, out of sheer laziness, but be warned that the USB ports here are effectively useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The keyboard lasted 2 days now does not work at all.

He covers those aspects quite well, bringing out an interest in the subject, particularly for people who would not normally read his other material.Unfortunately, his writings on astral projection and other occult topics is supported by a weak cast of predictable characters and a stereotypical plot. In fact, all the requirements of a predictable plot are fulfilled - the hints of romance, the conflicts within the groups, even the backstabbing villain.The only reason to read The Committee is as a light preview to Buckland's other writing on the occult."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Return of Good Music","review":"I love this album.

Honest and straight forward, this book takes you from stage one (you have an idea) all the way through the proper way to write your script to how to sell it (stubborness is the key!). The best part is that the author has one of his complete screenplays at the end of the book. It comes with annotations and is a big help for a visual learner like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impeccable","review":"Unless you enjoy battering your head against the wall, read Keane's book before embarking on your project. Soup to nuts and three desserts - he gives the reader everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on Structure and exercises","review":"I got so much out of this book.

Keane is very clear about the steps necessary to write a consistent, engaging script. At the same time, Keane encourages the reader throughout the long and daunting process of writing and revising. I really enjoyed his list of recommended viewing and the way he refers back to these films throughout the book. I used Keane's guide as a reference for writing my first feature film, which subsequently went into production. I also recommend his book to all my students at the film program I run at Harvard University."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book to read if you're taking your laptop to Hollywood","review":"There are hundreds of books on the business of writing screenplays, and I've read plenty of them, but I'd say this is the best. Christopher Keane tells us how to refine an idea, how to develop characters, how to get a plot moving, and how to keep asking the right questions at every step along the way. He illustrates his points with examples from movies, both contemporary and classic, and he fills the book with anecdotes fro mhis own career, so it's fun to read as well as informative. Now that I've read it, I'm ready to start writing that movie I've always dreamed of."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tools you need to get started!","review":"Chris Keane's book is absolutely powerful for the screenwriting novice, such as me. His instructional approach is easy to understand and encouraging. He explains how to begin -- how to keep motivated -- and how to pursue. His simple exercises show how to develop your story, character and structure -- then, he lets you know what to do next. Mr. Keane is a gifted writer and an excellent instructor. I highly recommend this publication for anyone wishing to achieve a screenwriting career."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Place To Start","review":"No one wants to sit down and spend weeks and months writing a screenplay that no one will touch. Lots of people have fabulous ideas that never get anywhere, and Chris' book is a great guide to finding a way to give those ideas shape. He knows what works, what mistakes beginner screenwriters are likely to make, and how to break everything down so it doesn't seem quite so immense. I found myself, after my first screenplay was finished and I had moved on to rewrites and other projects, pulling it back out and using it like a troubleshooting handbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful --especially historically","review":"Working in the IT field, I found this book to be very helpful-- especially from a historical perspective--explaining the various highspeed options available.

As is well known, he could be eccentric in this period, often too slow and self-indulgent. Those flaws are at their worst here in the Sibelius Sym. #2 form Vienna and the Elgar from London. But the other Sibelius, particularly Sym. #7, shows real depth of feeling and justifies Bernstein's expressive indulgences. The Four Sea Interludes are moving for being part of the last public concert he gave in Tanglewood with the BSO, and the orchestra plays wonderfully for him. The rest of the performances fall somewhere in between these extremes. They will all remain controversial, I imagine, but there's a great deal of enjoyment to be had here if you know what you are in for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eucalyptus drowned by other (mal)odors","review":"The bath soak had a hint of eucalyptus that was overwhelmed by rancid odors.

The instructions are clear and concise and we had the two units assembled and piggybacked together in less than ten minutes. The leveling legs are a plus and help the unit sit squarely on the floor. Or, raise the back legs to tilt your bottles down to keep the corks moist. This rack will hold any sized 750ml bottle, even those Pinots. In fact we have four Champagne bottles on the bottom rack.

More than any other symphonic output, or for that matter, any other genre of classical music, they are central to the core of classical music. Perhaps if I had listened to this set earlier in life, I might feel differently about it. But to it so recently, I just can't summon any enthusiasm for it. I find it bloated and pretentious. Both Bernstein and the Vienna deserve better than this and, together, they owe us better.No one summoned more majesty for Beethoven than Bruno Walter with his pick up band. And then there is George Szell's classic cycle, perhaps the best ever to capture the heart and soul of the music. For modernists, ther is Sir Charles Mackerras in live recordings with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra/ Philharmonia Orchestra. Norrington and the London Classical Players is very good. Finally thre is a young, vital Bernstein with the NY Philharmonic.Please check some these out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The eternity of Beethoven","review":"Listen Bernstein ahead of one of the best orchestras in the world is pleasure, contemplation and time of profound inner journey before what is great and eternal.I recommend all people sensitive to music and also to those who will not be able to stop listening to Beethoven"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, uninspiring...","review":"I had great hopes for this book and it is indeed, easy to read, as another reviewer stated.

I also feel the clip part is going to break instantly and the part that comes out so you can hang it jingles at any slight movement. I know it is only a clipboard but I was so excited. I am now interested about the other reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"Frenquency of Souls was an enjoyable novel with well crafted and belivable characters.

In addition, short interview comments by Petersburg residents demonstrated the strong, lingering hard feelings natives harbor about revelations in Edgar Lee Masters' masterpiece.Unfortunately, this DVD, which is neither thoroughly nor accurately described by Amazon, is a hollow representation of something, but it does not do right by Spoon River Anthology. It is nothing more than a few dull recitations performed on a dull set by uninspired actors doing an easy gig for a few bucks. Viewers will gain no insight from this ripoff. Skip it! Better yet, Amazon: Drop it from your catalog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoon River Anthology","review":"This was wretched! I feel like I was taken. It's a waste of time.

I'm not sure how that is legal. If I buy \\"Pet-Tabs\\" from my vet, they're always Pfizer, but when I ordered these I realized they were quite different and didn't know why until I realized they were made by Virbac. The Pfizer tablets seem to be of higher quality--moister, denser consistency, darker color. Overall, fresher. The Virbac ones are paler, dryer and more powdery when broken apart. Buyer beware..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This helped my puppy when she couldn't gain weight","review":"A puppy was given to us when she was 4 weeks old. She was very healthy but she just couldn't put on weight after she was off her puppy formula. I don't know if it was because she was taken from her mother too soon, but these vitamins really helped her appetite and she was able to get to a healthy weight. I gave her double the recommended dose until her weight was up and then I maintained it with just one tablet a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what's in em, crack for dogs?","review":"These tablets must have something special in them, my dog was super hyperactive after eating them. Bouncing off the walls, very crazy. I'd like to believe she gets enough vitamins from her daily food, so I can't account for the strange increase in craziness. It wasn't just energy, it was like she had less focus and was much more distracted. When I stopped feeding these to her, she went back to normal. These tablets are made in India according to the package, not sure if that has anything to do with anything (I'm one of those paranoid dog owners that won't feed my dog anything from China - haven't heard anything specific about India though). Anyway, I'm sure these are working well for others, just my two cents on my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog approved vitamin supplement","review":"This is the only vitamin supplement that my finicky teacup Maltese will eat.

Not only does it produce a great liqueur (sp?) for some very hard-to-brew black teas, but it maintains heat very well, and somehow seems to prevent otherwise bitter teas from growing bitter too quickly. (it will, of course, grow if you keep the brew in there long enough). I AM careful (maybe needlessly?) not to wash my teapot with soap for fear of doing something to the glaze, and thus only use it -- in general -- for one kind of black tea (most often different grades of Darjeeling -- somtimes Ceylon). I don't know what you'd use for green teas -- I'd try some sort of purple clay unglazed (probably not the brown betty), but this is the top of the line for black teas.Definitely one of my prize collections, and I recommend this for any tea lover out there!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marcuse translation is an excellent translation.","review":"Marcuse's translations are always excellent, and this one is no exception. It is not flawless, but it is excellent nonetheless. I have read this translation several times, checking it against the text from which it was translated. There were no grammatical errors to be corrected. I chose to word some sentences differently, to suit my regional native Spanish, but speaking as a professional translator, this translation is well crafted. I would have to disagree with the Horn Book review. This translation is well executed.

I used butter all the time so my pancakes wouldn't stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't heat, terrible product, manufacturer should be ashamed","review":"Griddle doesn't heat properly. It starts to heat up, and then stops. I've removed the plate and tried a number of different ways to get the product to work. The manufacturer should recall this item. It's shameful that someone can sell something like this...it was a gift, and we will never buy low-end Rival products. Throwing it away, and it is brand new out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rigal GR250 Griddle","review":"I would not recommend buying this griddle...the non-stick surface burned through the first time I used it making pancakes at 375 degrees...I tried treating the surface again with additional oil before cooking pancakes again at 350 degrees...the surface deteriorated even further and the third time I made pancakes they stuck badly to the surface and I gave up...I am going back to my cast iron griddle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT non stick","review":"Cooked with this griddle 3 times and returned it. It is NOT non stick as advertised. Everything sticks, has to be scraped off regardless of lubricant used (Pam, olive oil, bacon grease, etc). Too bad, really, because I did like the size, controls, and removable griddle plate. But, not worth leaving part of the food stuck to the griddle or breaking egg yolks because they stuck. FYI - I washed by hand, not in the dishwasher. Luckily, I did not have any trouble returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very cheaply made griddle","review":"This is hands down one of the worst cooking purchases I have ever made. The nonstick surface degraded after the very first use. I still use it but end up ruining a few pancakes in the process. Now the only way to get the pancakes to release is to coat with a thick coat of oil and turn up the heat to 400."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor execution","review":"I was very disappointed with this griddle - ended up returning it. Putting pancake batter on the cooking surface cooled it by almost 100 degrees (according to my IR thermometer), and it was very slow to reheat -- resulting in badly cooked pancakes. It appears to me that the removable/washable cooking surface means the temperature sensor isn't close enough to the cooking surface, so it reacts very slowly to changes in surface temperature -- it takes a few minutes before it even notices that the temperature has dropped and turns on the heat.I was also disappointed with the size. Too narrow to cook medium sized pancakes side-by-side, and too long to conveniently fit on my counter. Shorter and wider would have been a better choice for me, so that's what I'm looking for now, although I would have kept this one if it had done a good job of cooking pancakes.On the good side, it did an excellent job on a grilled cheese sandwich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Heat Up","review":"I bought this griddle and was excited to give it a try. I was cooking sausage at church at our men's monthly breakfast alongside one of the old griddles. On the highest setting, this thing took twice as long to cook and never really got anything crispy. I tried it at home on bacon - same thing. I took it back and exchanged it for an identical model - same results. The readout says 425 degrees, but it is nowhere close. Buy this only if you like to warm things up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this griddle","review":"We figured we would spend a little money and get a good griddle that would last. Bad idea...the coating started falling off within 3 or 4 uses. We primarily cook turkey bacon and panakes. The pancakes stick so bad that there are large chunks missing from them when you take them off! We tried spraying it with Pam, but that did not work. Even the bacon sticks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy product, do not buy!","review":"Similar to other's experiences, my griddle's non-stick surface burned through the first time I heated it to 375 to cook pancakes. In just 3 uses, using only silicone type utensils on it, pancakes stick so bad they are ruined. Rival is absolutely useless with customer support. IF you read the reviews and still choose to try your luck, save your receipt, you will need it to get Rival to accept your product back."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply awful!","review":"Tonight for the last time, I attempted to make french toast using this griddle. It was a disaster again. Pancakes are a mess, and cheese sticks like glue. I got out my nonstick Calphalon skillet to see if something was wrong with the oil I was using to season the griddle, or the egg substitute, but in it I could have turned the toast over using my fingers. We've had this griddle for about 6 months, and it has progressively gotten worse. The instructions said it could be washed in the dishwasher which I did a couple of times at first. The nonstick finish is just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"overhype and very very poor sound","review":"Nilsson is out of tune, Bjoeling struggles with every note above G,and Tebaldi can't handle the high tessitura of Liu.

Bjoeling's Nessum Dorma is a disgrace to Puccini's greatest aria. Sorry, I have to return this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No prize for this old Turandot","review":"Nilsson was in bad voice. Bjoeling way,way, past his prime and needed ultra extra microphone that sounds fake. Tebaldi couldn't handle Liu's tessitura. And the noisy, poor 1959 sound conducted by a second rate conductor.Go for the Nilsson/Corelli 1964 live recording. That will blow you away. Nilsson was in super voice, he and Corelli fight to see who holds the longest high C. Wow.Another great is Sutherland/Pav/Caballe. Mehta is the real star in that one. Although Sutherland has the most beautiful voice I've ever heard although not a consonant in sight. Yet she has the voice Puccini would have like as the heroine-a Italian trained sound rather than Nilsson's Wagnerian one. Caballe is the ultimate liu.Anyway, take your pick. But not this one. Bjoeling is too tiny a voice and kills the piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'ts hopeless, you can't hear anything, and the tape hiss","review":"This is the worst Turandot I've ever heard. The sound is so bad that I have to return it. Take my advice, look elsewhere. The VHS marton/domingo is gorgeous. IT is the best. But Marton does scream her head off.

I bought mine because the one I had only had room for two vials, and I needed room for 3. When it came it looked cheap. The bottles don't sit tightly into the foam so if you stand the case on end, the bottles fall and hit each other. The freezer packs don't stay frozen very long. The pockets for syringes, etc. are too small. The velcro tore on one pocket less than 3 weeks after I started using it. Even the zipper is hard to close around the corners of the case, and you have to continually be pulling one side of the zipper down over the corner to zip it.I will invest in a better case and spend the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately Skin Tight!","review":"I really like this product, when I ripped throught the packaging it's all that I expected.

It hugs the phone completely, protects the screen with the flip screen case covering and the letter keys are easily manueverable. Thought it does take a little time to get used to the skin covering on the launch buttons.I haven't used the holster yet so no comment on that. The only flaw to this item is that the company knew that there are slots for both the SD memory card & SIM card. But unfortunately they didn't provide allotted slots in the skin. So therefore you have to cut them out yourself. Overall I still think it's a good investment cause it protects your expensive phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pain in the butt","review":"this holster is hard to use, bulky, and the flip up screen is not going to last long.

It fits the phone perfectly (unlike some of the other cheaper ones, where the button impressions don't match up well-- so annoying). It doesn't make the phone bulky like some of the leather cases do.

In LOST HIGHWAYS, as in both IF WISHES WERE HORSES and THE LOVES OF RUBY DEE, her prose is warm, witty, delightfully quirky, and thoroughly honest -- just like her characters. She allows her characters time not only the luxury of being human, but enough time to fall in love for the reader to not only enjoy the ride, but to accept, without a doubt, that the couple has made the right decision. Don't expect to find lots of \\"hot\\" lovescenes here, but rest assured you'll find a lovestory that'll just make you feel good about being a member of the crazy human race."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a fluffy romance novel...","review":"This was definitely a cut above the general \\"hot and steamy\\" vein of romance novels (Which I won't read)...The voice of our wonderful main character is full of doubts, wonder, insecurity, and overall goodness that makes this book what it is. She considers her actions, God, and reflects on what makes a person who they are today.The plot is of course nothing extraordinary, but the details make it something special. As a horse owner, I appreciate the drama queens and emotion of the horseshow, and the rather suprisingly non-competitive nature of our Rainney.This is a book I have read twice, and looking forward to reading other Matlock books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughter, tears, and cheers","review":"I adored this book.

If we are going to have a conversation on race, we must hear different voices. The Myths that Divide Us is an important voice, providing a substantial bridge from the history of Jim Crow to the statistical racial dead heat identified by Abigail Thernstrom.

This novel is also a portrait of an era in 19th century France after the exile of Napoleon to St. Helena. The powerful, witty epigrams that appear in page after page of gorgeous prose left me almost as intrigued by the talent of the author as by the unexpected twists in the exhausting love life and fascinating careers in church and state of Julian Sorel. The language of the Gard translation was truly a joy to read -- it was lyrical and rich. Stendhal's novel is an astonishing but lesser read masterpiece from the salons of Paris, which produced Moliere, Balzac and Proust to name only a few.

I found the pacing in this novel awful. Scenes that should build dramatic effect for pages (a duel, for instance) are brushed over in one paragraph. Worst of all, perhaps, is the way Stendhal handles the courtship between Julian and Mathilde, which is totally ridiculous. Part of my problem may be that I've been reading a great deal of Tolstoy, who is brilliant, and never makes the sophomoric narrative mistakes that define The Red and the Black."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW CAN ANYONE READ THIS GUY????","review":"I am a book lover; read ALL the time, and thoroughly enjoy the classics; that is, until I came upon Stendhal!!!

And any garden writer worth her (or his) salt can come up with \\"how to do it\\" and \\"plants to choose\\" text to make the ideas a practicality. So why the paucity of ideas?

The personal accounts of how Paul's songs have affected others show how God can work through, not only His Word, but through the songs of those that love Him.

The Avent Isis worked great for me, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convenient or useful!","review":"Just as the other mothers have stated, nothing about this pump is beneficial. It was given to me by a lactation nurse, but it was more trouble than it was worth. Only once was I able to pump more than one ounce (it took almost an hour), and I hurt so much afterward nursing my son was agonizing. I only needed it occassionally, but this was such a waste of time I bought the pump in style, which is amazing.This is not comparable to the more expensive Medela pumps, so if you want something that works with little discomfort, invenst in the pump in style or similar model.

This mount was perfect for the fit on top of the TV. Only problem I have with it is the front two \\"peg feet\\" are steel with no padding, so I suggest getting some foam pads to place underneath them before placing it on the front edge of your TV as they will scratch it. The rear feet come with double sided adhesive foam pads that work well. I personally only peeled off the side to stick to the shelfs feet and left the paper backing on the side touching the TV since I wasn't sure how hard it would be when it was time to remove it. Overall works great and is very reasonably priced. It has enough adjustment options to accomodate most new projection TV's but not the newest super slim cabinets and definitely not a plasma or flat screen LCD."},{"rating":"2","title":"***Use it with your PS3/XBOX/Wii***","review":"I used the \\"upside down\\" technique that was talked about in one of the most helpful reviews listed. Since my TV is slim, the back legs do no \\"clamp\\" against the back, but the front lip does hook under the tv lip where the screen ends and the plastic frame of the tv begins. I have my PS3 on the floor, which looks terrible when you have a nice setup and a nice entertainment center, but with this beauty mounted inverted, it now has the center channel in the front and the PS3 behind it. It basically hides the PS3 and the wires behind it. I have a 42\\" Panasonic TV and it looks very slick like a floating platform above the TV with a true center sound now. My wife loves that it hides my \\"gaming thingy\\" as we are in our 30s and not trying to show off my video game system to our friends and family :) It was either this, or PS3 in the bedroom and buying a new Blu-Ray in the living room.

I found the Omnimount and not much else. I was a little worried when a reviewer said it was not designed for the newer shallower TVs. Well, it turns out it is. Maybe it was redesigned, but the instructions show you how to attach it to three different type of TVs - deep, shallow and drop back (not sure if these were the exact names).The shelf is quite wide, so it looks like it could handle much bigger speakers than mine, or maybe a cable box. Still, it blends with the black TV case and looks real nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisified customer","review":"The product is marketed as a solution for placing a center speaker on a television.

Works great. The \\"sticky\\" feet that come with it basically make it so once the feet are pressed against ANY surface, they ain't moving! So its probably best to get a helper to hold the shelf in place while you positing the back feet and then lock them in place.I read one review about a 30lb center speaker pulling this shelf off. The sticky feet are so sticky that I can't imagine them giving way, but then again, NOBODY should be using a 30lb center channel, IMHO. Even my left/right Bose 201's don't weith that much....combined!Overall, a nice product that works well with rear projection TV's and I would imagine with CRT TVs. If you have a super skinny LCD or Plasma, there just might not be enough meat on the back to prop the shelf up. I have my back feet on the shallowest/thinnest settings and they just catch the back of my Bravia. So I have to imagine that anything thinner than 5 or 6 inches will be too thin to use this shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for narrow televisions","review":"I have a Sony 60\\" 1080p 120Hz Rear-Projection SXRD HDTV-KDS-60A3000 and this allows me to mount a 35# center speaker on top of it.

If you use it the \\"correct\\" way, you have two large metal rods that drop down over the front of your TV screen that looks bad AND can damage your screen (stupid design), they are just too big. However, by flipping it over and using the small front lip effectively does the same thing as using it right side up with the 2 metal rods dropping down. The two rear feet that are adhered to the back of the set grip very well. Two things though, #1 - Don't go over the weight limit of the shelf! my center channel is 17 lbs and the capacity is 30. #2, position the speaker as far forward as possible distributing the weight towards the front."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and nice-looking!","review":"For the money, this unit can't be beat. It was very easy to assemble and it should last forever. It also looks nice, though one won't be able to see 99% of it, and that's a good thing because you want people to see the speaker, not the shelf.I haven't purchased my new TV yet, but I hope to be mounting this by next month on a new 1080p Samsung 50\\" DLP. I am sure it will work perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts","review":"All I got is the actual shelf and a manual. Everything else including the legs and all the assembly pieces were missing. I returned it to Amazon for a refund.This is not the reason for the bad rating.

Even if the rather large, heavy-duty product could have been mounted on the TV, in any given position, though, I would still want to return it.

I followed the mounting directions carefully (I write directions/procedures for a living). It was on top of my Sony 50\\" SXRD, with my 20 lb. Polk Center Channel Speaker, for exactly one day before everything came crashing down. The legs snapped off at the attachment screws up by the shelf and my speaker came crashing down behind the TV, hit the wall, and almost pushed the TV forward off of the stand. If I hadn't rushed to catch it, it could have ended up face down on the family room floor. From my experience, I would say that you can't trust this thing with anything over 10 lbs - if that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy local and count the parts before leaving","review":"I bought this Omnimount from a local national electronics chain. Once I got home and unpacked the shelf, the front two pegs that hang over the front of the tv were missing. I returned to the store to exchange it for the same item.

Unfortunately three of the same episodes in the first video were the exact same epsidodes on the second volume. One would have thought that there would have been no chance of overlap between the two videos, given that there were enough different episodes from two seasons of the show to choose from.

This was a very poor job of packaging these volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and poorly designed","review":"Unfortunately, this trike falls well below expectations when it comes to a toddler using this to learn to ride a wheeled toy. The front pedal's circumference is too small for a toddler to generate adequate leverage to propel the trike forward, so, like another poster stated, the cheap plastic tricycles are a better option. Another flaw is that the pedals are too small, and my daughter's feet consistently slide off of them. Kettler developed a fix for this; they are happy to sell a set of toe clips to you for an additional $20. I would choose a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great design","review":"We have had this bike for a while now, and I frequently have to tighten the steering bolt as my daughters seem to keep loosening it up.

Our son is a tall child (38\\" tall and 38 pounds) and has trouble pedaling this tricylce. I think the problem is that the trike is too low and too heavy. He rides the more typically designed trikes with ease (trikes with a higher seat that allows the child to pedal down rather than out). This trike is more like a recumbent exercise bike which is a lot harder to pedal. We've also been very disappointed with the handle bar. It constantly twists out of alignment and has to be readjusted and the pedals skip which might have to do with the auto free wheel. Kettler USA, however, has been very easy to work with and their customer service has been excellent. They replaced the handle bar with no problems and questions asked. But, we are going to sell this very expensive trike and look for something that's easier for our son to ride (and probably cheaper!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitively no good for pedaling","review":"I thought that my two years old daughter was not able to pedal yet, until she used her friend's tricycle and she started pedaling like a professional.

One would think that spending so much for a trike would pretty much guarantee hassle-free use and maintenance. Wrong! The biggest hassle was when we needed to pump up the rear tire. There is no easy way to do this and Kettler's description of how to do this is really a joke. If you ever get a flat on on one of the tires, be prepared for a pain in the butt process to get it inflated again. This just isn't very well thought out.

Even though we raised three active boys, it is by far the most complicated riding vehicle we have ever put together.

It is well built and hopefully will last a few years, through any siblings she may have. I also like the big tires and the rear basket. She,of course, loves it,which is its most important feature. It is supposed to grow with her until she is five, but is seems a little small for that - I could be wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rear-wheel steering explained","review":"The whole time I was researching this product, I thought that the rear wheel steering was linked to the front wheel - countersteering to provide a reduced turning radius. And I couldn't see from any of the photos or the owner's manual how that was supposed to happen.Since neither Amazon's nor the manufacturer's description makes this clear, here's how it works:The rear wheel steering is only used when the parent is pushing with the pushbar. You lock the front wheel, unlock the rear wheels, insert the pushbar, and you can steer it from behind. When it's the kids turn to drive, you remove the pushbar, lock the rear wheels, and unlock the front wheel.Maybe it's just me, but this certainly wasn't clear from anything I'd read online."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bike great for kids","review":"this bike is amazing, we have a dirt driveway, and it has no problems. the handle is very strong and easy to push around the bike. the lock out features are also great.

Now, he's almost 3 and still has a lot of trouble pedaling, not because he can't pedal, but because the pedals are still not close enough. He's about average size for his age. Also, it is difficult to navigate when pushing this trike. On the positive side, the air filled tires make it a nice ride. If I had to purchase a trike again, I would save my money and buy a Radio Flyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Over praised Fiction","review":"Ghost Town, Robert Coover (7/02): This is an amazing novel in that it is simultaneously juvenile and pretentious. This attempt at a Beckian version of Cormak McCarthy succeeds on no level. The long drawn out prose are neither poetic nor sparse. The re-visioning of the cowboy myth, by portraying a violent grotesque environment, only come off as silly and has been done before. I could not tell whether the frequent, homey existential quips by the cowboys were supposed to make fun the of the genre or were meant to be profound. Yet, they succeeded at neither. In short, this is another over-praised novel by an author of noteworthy intentions but little original skill needed to pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I ordered two of these tapes as a birthday present.

Dr. Shapiro does not include choices for meat and poultry, saying that they are bad for you and soy substitutes are so much healthier. Be that as it may, if his program is truly about personal choices for weight loss (as he claims), then he should have included options for meats and poultry.

This is the greatest product my dog has ever taken and it has drastically improved her quality of life and just for every day getting around. with No Side Effects that I can see!

I'd been giving them glucosamine chondroitin for a couple of years and they thrived. I made a mistake and ordered the Cosequin tablets and they've suffered since they've been taking it.

He had a malignant tumor removed just over a year ago and we were afraid the cancer was back. We received the Cosequin DS 9 days ago and within just 2 to 3 days we noticed a marked improvement.

I bought her a Temperpedic bed too. After about 6 weeks of the recommended dosage, she no longer walks with a limp. She has no problems at all getting out of bed in the mornings and we take 3.5 mile walks about 3-4 days a week and she is fine. She is no longer on the narcotic pain killer.

We started using it and almost immediately we noticed significant improvement in our dogs mobility and no leg instability. When I ran out of this product last month I needed more but wanted to find the best price. I did at Amazon- getting three times the amount for the same price as I did from our vet.

I don't know how much it actually helps, but it doesn't hurt, and if there's even the slightest chance it will help my \\"kids\\", well, I'll take it. They're on prescription meds, too, but the idea behind Cosequin is that it will help lubricate their joints and preserve what they've got. They like the tablets, which is great since the tablets are the size of horse pills. The worst part is the start-up month, since you have to give extra. After that, it's not so bad cost-wise.

We've come to expect much from the Berenstain Bears -- foremost: a lesson. This book details a frustrating situation that leaves the parents exhausted. Instead of going to bed like Papa Bear instructs, the kids dilly-dally around with toys, baths, books and more. The parents present a disunited front and the kids respond with chaos. In the end, Brother and Sister put Mama and Papa to bed then stay up to read books. The respect and obedience usually present in these stories is missing. In its place is whining, excuses and procrastination.I may have liked the book more, if I had bought it with different expectations. But with these loved characters, this story merely disappoints. I'm returning the book before reading it to my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointed Berenstain Bears fan...","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this book.

Teach a lesson? There is no moral in this book; Mama and Papa simply fall asleep reading to the cubs.

I bought this book to address the problem, not to reinforce it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"I would love to ask the authors what in the world they were thinking!!!

I couldn't believe it when I read the story - that is seriously how this ends?!?! No helpful lesson, no wise words to encourage your child why to skip the bedtime battle and just go to bed like mom and dad ask - nope, apparently the lesson here is if you run your parents ragged enough, they'll fall asleep and you can stay up.

We'll just refer to a story, and she remembers the lesson. Not so with this one! I bought it in a Scholastic book order, and it'll be donated to my daughter's classroom tomorrow! Moral of the story: whine and drag your feet long enough, and you win! NOT a lesson I want to teach my own kids. I agree with other reviewers who said it just seems \\"off\\" from the other Bear classics, and it's probably better than 2-stars for just readability factor, but for what I was looking for (a book with a lesson taught, what I've come to expect from BB), it fell way too short of the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was'nt too pleased...","review":"Was'nt too pleased with this cookbook.

Thankfully we seem to be seeing the slow reemergence of this important topic. I call it a must read for any young single person hoping to marry one day AND for everyone else who is already married- husbands as well as wives. When BOTH parties in a marriage follow the biblical standard and purpose of marriage it is a beautiful and blessed thing! If you want your own personal ministry to carry Gods seal of approval, you must have your own household swept clean and put in order. This is a book that will motivate you to do just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upsetting","review":"Basically I didn't realize feminism and Christianity couldn't mix. I guess I had always disregarded those parts of the bible that said women are inferior to men, but little did I know feminism was a tool created by \\"wimpy men\\" because of course women aren't capable of actually doing anything cause a man is always the one responsible for them and their actions. So with that said, I found what I read of this book demeaning and insulting to women and the fact that things written 200 years ago are still being used to fix modern day marriages seems a little backwards. I mean we don't still throw babies on rocks to punish people(Pslam 137), in fact we consider killing a baby that has not even come out of the womb wrong. The book twists the bible to fit its needs without any thought to women's development of person-hood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for Hyper-Calvanistic Caucasians","review":"There are so many problems with this book. Let me point out one. Wilson stats that it is a sin for a woman not to take own her husband's last name and makes his case by twisting scripture. Well what about the millions of Asian believers who by their culture keep their family name? This has nothing to do with definance or lack of submission in their culture. So I guess all of are dear sisters in China are in sin based on his lame agrument that Eve took Adam's 'last name' of man. What a joke. I, as a non-Hyper Reformed believer who tries to let scripture form his theology, attempted to come at this book with an open-mind but I cannot stomach Wilson forming scripure through his theology. He does it over and over again. Let's not do Biblical Gymnastics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book on Marriage","review":"This is by far the best book on marriage that we have ever read.

There is hope in these pages for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is a Christian Reconstructionist","review":"BUT if you are a Christian looking for what the Bible says about marriage you need to look elsewhere (there are plenty of excellent balanced books by Christians on this topic).There is just enough Bible verses BIble principles in this book to fool most Christians unaware of the teachings of Christian Reconstructisim and its dangers. Wilson is a strong Reconstructionist--which is nothing less than Christian Nazism. God's Word has much to say about those cursing Israel.This is SERIOUS dangerous movement followed by many leaders within the homeschool movement (see \\"The Road to Holocaust\\" by Hal Lindsey for a real eye opening about the Reconstruction/Dominion cult). Christian Reconstructionism is not Christian; it's a cult and needs to be treated as one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as easy as it looks or they say.","review":"I found this sealer to be difficult to use. It is very difficult to get a good vacuum seal due to the clumsy method of putting the bags in a nozzle.

I like the weight (340g) and shape. The grip sits well in my hand, and the throw is solid. The only problem I had was that the hole the adapter screw is supposed to thread into didn't line up with the hole in the adapter. I ended up filing out the hole on one side to make it line up. There are a couple of tricks that might make installation go a little more smoothly. First, before inserting an adapter, thread in the retaining screw and then back it out again. This will help clear off the excess material around the threads. It's supposed to help keep the screw in place, but there was so much on mine that it made it very difficult to screw in. Second, figure out which adapter to use and thread in onto the shift lever part way and back off again before actually trying to mount the knob. This will help the knob go on a bit easier and straighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product","review":"I received this kit with little expectations considering the price in the market compared to other kits.

I just finished reading it during Passover, and would like to share my impression. There are few exercises in this book, most of the book is filled with a bunch of stories of Wendlinger's childhood. It seems very self serving to write a book that people will buy as a kind of \\"self help\\" book that does not even pretend to offer help between the book covers. I don't want to give this book away and have my friends suffer through it, so I may just place it in the recycling, or let my hampster give it some personal attention, if you know what I mean.I'm sorry but this book wasn't worth the price, or the time it took to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total and Complete Zzzzz...","review":"Where to begin, where, let's see. First off, \\"Dr\\" Wendlinger writes a book about how to improve your memory abilities, but bases this work on his own untested, unprovable opinions. It lacks credibility on all levels, but I would actually recommend this book for the untrained uneducated masses because they might, by trying one or two of the \\"trigger\\" be happy about a childhood memory. Why take credit for someone else's memory. I really enjoyed reading about Bob's life, but because this was a memory book, I felt cheated by the lack of references and exercises that should have helped me improve my life and lifestyle. The book is small, and lightweight. It's written on this strange paper that gives off a strange book odor. Don't say you weren't warned.

I am a pre-pregnancy size 6 and I ordered the s/m size based on the waistline.....WRONG! I am in my 35th week of pregnancy and this thing barely would fit around my lower abdomen. Not only does it run small, but it also fold and wrinkles anytime I move so it is not much help. If you are shorter or petite, the waistband is VERY wide in the back and can be ill-fitting (does not conform to the curve of your spine).

It helped a teeny tiny bit, but the construction is such that it just can't provide much support (it's a little heavier-weight than a bra, with no additional elastic).I bought the other one, by loving comfort, and was thrilled. It's a little bit more intimidating, perhaps, and less, uh, sexy, but it really works in all the ways that this one didn't. It slings my belly up nicely and takes over the work for my pained muscles.

I almost wrapped it twice around me and proceeded to do a half day of work at my home office.Which leads to my next point: this product is not made for sitting, which is a shame, because I just can't take the thing on and off, as I go through my day. Who has time for that? It rolled and bunched, defeating the purpose of getting a belt that is supposed to be more discreet under clothing.Maybe I'm just one of those weird pregnant women whose belly is proportionally too big for her frame.

The music is shallow and repetitious. In today's fast media you need more from video/music art. It is like the film maker had no tripod. and this gives a \\"art collage\\" kind of feel, (which is where he may have wanted but it, just seems a little thoughtless and convenient) Its little more than a collection of shorts, poorly edited (with bad in-camera and easy Mac effects) with shaky slow motion footage of bland scenes and dull music.Great saxophone though, Mete Erker.It seems like a nice video diary and would be nice for memories of a trip. but to sell this seems strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expecting more than that...","review":"This movie is fine, but he image quality is not good, the sound terrible and the message was confusing.

Now, we live in Papua New Guinea, so I had to have the tabs shipped to friends in the US, who then forwarded them to us. But it was definitely worth the hassle! Chivas is running again! Before, he would walk slowly, sit down every so often, but he is now, he runs around the island, chasing our 18 months old puppy Missy.

After about a week and a half of giving her 1.5 tablets once a day, she isn't 'toe-touching' any more and moves so much better.

Some of the articles are interesting, but overall the reader is left with a feeling of disatisfaction and that the author's personal views color the final work. My own direct experience of researching some of the teachers mentioned suggests that the author has not gone that \\"extra yard\\" in his research. All of this is a shame. Maybe he could produce a revised version with greater attention to detail?"},{"rating":"1","title":"a missed opportnity...","review":"I looked forward to reading this book, but as time progressed I felt increasingly that the author had a great deal of preconceptions about the subject. The detail about some of the \\"masters\\" was sketchy at best and the book did little to shed light on the substance of what they purported to be teaching. All a bit of a shame when this book could have been a valuable research tool. I also understand that the author lectures in Buddism which may account for a \\"less than neutral\\" account of some of the teachings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Johnny can't think......","review":"Another book on comparative religions so filled with bias and self-centered sarcasm one can hardly read from cover to cover. What has happened to our educational system that this sort of thing passes for intelligence? No wonder \\"Johnny can't read\\". If you want to learn about the influence of the East on the West from this perspective, skip the cost of the book and simply search the internet for dirt on the particular religion. What a complete disappointment. Andrew Rawlinson never seemed to come close to the lofty title much less most of the religions he criticized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that exciting","review":"I read this having seen some previous reviews, but unfortunetely found it to be a tad dull and self indulgent. Now I have no doubt that the original intention was good, but the author seems to fixate on dtail that is not alltogether useful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"650 worthless sheet (of paper)","review":"The mixture that Mr. Rawlinson makes on this book is everything but \\"enlightning\\". The encyclopedic style is just on the surface, since the author focuses more on the personal details of the lives he choosed to write about, than on their specific spiritual standpoints. That makes this heavy book more a gossip than an academic work. It's tricky too, because it seems to put an impartial span of spiritual liders of the West, but, what he really wants is to advice about the deviations of this people. Which is not bad at all, if only he had the tools to do it. Instead, Mr. Rawlinson puts all in one bag and you get truly interesting perspectives (like Frithjof Schuon's Religio Perennis or \\"trascendent unity of religions\\") paired with plain crazy people.So, this book is not a help at all; the charts are not clear and have some mistakes here and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake information based on personal vendetta","review":"Having attended many of Rawlinsons's lessons, I see this book as an outcome of Rawlinsons personal vendetta against anything that was threatening to him during his live. He never was allowed into the inner circles of what he tried to research for the very reason of his egoistic and selfish personality, being a man in great need to shine as Mr. Judge or Mr. Sheriff (sharif)Rawlinson does not understand what he teaches/preaches. He is a walking dictionary, filled with facts, can draw on these facts like a computer, but what really counts... he does not live what he teaches, it's all rather fiction, he is a walkie-talkie of the finest order.... i.e. a kind of perpetum mobile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few examples of unenlighteded wanna be's","review":"i know in detail about how bogus two of these people pictured on the cover-the others i dont know but......."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the heavy lifting is done...","review":"JM has done a great job of camping in the stellar, and not so stellar camping destinations of Georgia doing the heavy lifting for the rest of us.Each location has all the information needed whether interested in hiking, swimming, boating, etc. JM's descriptions are true to form for each location.

I spent 8 years in Georgia exploring the state to all four corners, and my favorite memories were derived from this book! It was everything I had hoped for in a camping guide as a newcomer to the state. I used it for multiple sites and always found the information to be \\"spot on.\\" It was such a welcome relief knowing I was assured of options that didn't have me arriving at an unfamiliar campground after a long drive, only to find nothing but giant rigs, generators, and Japanese lanterns!Now, I have moved to Texas, and I just ordered the same title for Texas. I can only hope it offers half the gems that I found in Georgia via this handy book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Resource","review":"My husband and I enjoy tent camping, and we've found this book a great resource for camping in Georgia. We have been to about 8 or 10 of the campgrounds featured in this book, and each time we've found the review spot on. We also enjoy having the book with us, as we make our own notes and personal observations in the margins - which is very helpful for referring to later.The book includes valuable information of not just the park as a whole, but also advice as to where in the campground is best for tents and gives a review of things to do in the area. It helps us know what we'll need to pack (i.e. buckets to carry water, or are there spigots at the campsite?). I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys tent camping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed at all.","review":"I found this book to be extremely one-sided. Dr. Wofford repeatedly bashes any and every other religion other than Baptisim by making underhanded comments. It barely kept my attention and while reading it I found my mind wondering. He even states his own personal opinions. If you read it because you have to read it for a class or study, good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Frying Pan","review":"The only problem I had was food remaining in small pits in the bottom of the pan. Because of the pits, you need to clean th pan with a brush. I was able to cook omelets successfully in this pan, but turning would be easier in an omelet pan. Also purchase the handle mit, it is necessary.Since I am familar with making metal castings, I believe the pits were caused by metal slag, not an inferior casting mold. The cooking surface has not been finished in any manner, as cast iron frying pans used to be.

Carefully read, her \\"best methods\\" approach, \\"research-based\\" book is neither supported, cited nor properly footnoted within the confines of her book. In spite of that fact, her books are being implented as if they were \\"Bibles\\" in numerous districts throughout the USA. In fact, the bureaucrats of the state of Illinois are requiring that we teach her methods!Most of the material covered in her books is so very basic that most any teacher does a great deal of it already while this author gets rich.Teaching is an art not a Patricia Cunningham book.I recommend that you save your money and buy something creative and thought-provoking to make teaching exciting and not (any more) exhausting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insincere","review":"I used to value Allington's words, but having heard him demean and disrespect colleagues as well as the disconnect between his spoken words and his written words, I would suggest that there are far more valuable books to spend time reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, especially for primary teachers","review":"Pat has done a masterful job of combining the best balanced literacy practices into one easy-to-manage program. Her 4Blocks model is a surefire way to ensure that your students are learning from all angles. My only criticism is that the guided reading block does not quite fit for grades 3 and above.

However, beyond second grade, books are much longer, thus making it impossible to expose your students to such a wide range of levels each week."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"You have to have the Blackbyrds in your music libraray.

This book is an excellent primer on the geometry of fractals, chaotic dynamics and cellular automata. It is written for a popular audience, although the authors were not afraid to include the appropriate equations when they were needed for a full explanation. Many examples of how fractals and chaos can be used to describe the physical world are included. A large number of figures are used to demonstrate the consequences of the equations.If your background in mathematics is limited to basic algebra, then there are areas of this book that you will struggle with. However, if you are determined to learn, you will be able to do so. It is one of the best introductions to fractals and chaos that is available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading this book will make your next 50 years will be even better!","review":"I checked this book out of the library a few weeks ago, but this is a book that I simply must own.

It's 47 pages long."},{"rating":"2","title":"More eclectic....high profile creators!","review":"The stories in Volume One of this series were based on fairy tales. Volume Two is far more eclectic, with a wide variety of styles and some pretty high profile creators.Kaz teaches you some \\"Strange Cartoon Lessons\\" on the endpapers, Maurice (Where The Wild Things Are) Sendak offers \\"Cereal Baby Keller,\\" Jules Fieffer gets you \\"Trapped In A Comic Book\\" and Crockett (Harold and the Purple Crayon) Johnson tells the tales of \\"Barnaby.\\" My favorite story by far is \\"Pretty Ugly\\" by Ian Falconer and David Sedaris.I'm not quite sure that Volume Two lives up to the standard created by Volume One. That's not to say it's not a great book, but it seems a lot less focused (not necessarily a bad thing though...). But, like Volume One, it's fun-fun-fun for all ages!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Light on content and actual instruction","review":"Though this item boasts a book, 3 CDs and one DVD, I found it to be far from a complete learning system. The book has only 2 pages covering notation, one page describes the violin itself and a mere 3 paragraphs are given to holding the bow and the instrument. If you are a beginner, there simply is not enough introductory material to properly introduce basic technique. On the DVD, an unemotional presenter monotonously delivers little substance. For example, she advises that the bow hair should be neither too tight nor too loose but never tells the viewer how to determine what is too tight and what is too loose.The accompaniment CDs are unmusical and sound like the piano part is played by a computer.Your money will be better spent taking just one lesson with a professional teacher near you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"When possible, I borrow instruction books, CDs, videos, and DVDs for learning a musical instrument from the library to try before I buy. This set was available at my local library.In the case of \\"Step One Teach Yourself Violin: A Complete Learning System\\" I give it two thumbs down.The instructor on the DVD begins playing scales on her violin then tells you play along. Unfortunately, neither she nor the book tell you where to place your fingers on the strings or what you are supposed to be playing. The instructor, in my opinion, is not very friendly or helpful.I equate her teaching methods with a child entering the kindergarden, being handed the complete works of Kafka, and being expected to read and undertand it before they've learned the alphabet.The only thing I learned from this method is not to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - Not a beginners course","review":"I am very disappointed in this course. I had such a desire to learn to play the violin but could not find an instructor in my town. I decided to purchase a violin and teach myself. I knew absolutely nothing about a violin and thought this course would take me through the steps. When advertising a \\"teach yourself\\" course should mean that it will start you from the beginning and explain everything. This course does not. Did not explain what the Letters were on top, where do you put your fingers, and does not let you know what page she is referring to while teaching. Immediately takes you though a scale exercise without teaching how to start or where to put your fingers. I had to go on youtube.com to help me answer some of the many many questions I had. It would also help if the camera was showing the fingering and where to start...none of that. This is not a beginners teach yourself course at all. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful ripoff","review":"It is a totally misleading product. A music teaching item should have fundamentals in detail, and then individual practice items carefully produced to help in getting to know the notes on the instrument. This item treats the learner with virtual contempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Poor Method","review":"Firt of all, when I ordered this item, it was supposed to arrive two weeks later. It did not. It took it another two weeks to arrive. Anyway, when it did, I was happy to receive it. I enthusiastically opened the package got its contents out, and started skimming through the book. I was extremely dissapointed. If it got to cover important material, it covered it in just a few paragraphs. In no way is this a learning method that will actually help a begginer violinist start playing the violin. I returned the item that same day and instead bought the Picture Yourself Playing Violin, which is by far a better method.Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor scholarship at its worst","review":"I have to agree 100% with the above review.

I grew tired of reading about Mallika Chopra's life of servants, nannies, and cleaning ladies. I'm quite certain that if all mothers in the world (including those in North America) led lives of such privilege, they too could write books such as these with completely unrealistic expectations about what it is to be a mother. I also did not find anything she said particularly deep, inspirational, aware, thought provoking, or compelling (as other reviewers would lead you to believe).If you wish to read a feel-good book that sets you up for some sort of \\"perfect\\" idyllic (i.e. unrealistic) picture of motherhood, than you'll love this book, though I hear that you can read the same in most Reader's Digest magazines."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a worthy","review":"please dont buy, not worthy.

The flavor was more like tart cherry than cranberry--maybe that is due to the combination of cranberry and apple. Quite tasty--don't brew too long or it can become sour!Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag.

This particular flavor is definitely more suited to be a hot tea. Even then, the apple flavor is very faint, and the cinnamon flavor seems stale to me. Not sure that's the right wording - the cinnamon flavor tastes a lot like the flavor in cinnamon gum, rather than the cinnamon flavor in a pastry or something.

The two charts, \\"Self-Differentiation: Healthy Behaviors for Leaders in Conflict,\\" and \\"Mature vs. Immature Behaviors in Conflict\\" are worth getting the rest of the book just to know how to apply the charts. Steinke's sequel to this book, \\"Healthy Congregations,\\" is also valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rob Thomas Down Under...","review":"First heard these fellas while visiting Sydney last year.

The material was not very sturdy and I felt like whatever compression was taking place came from the seams. No matter how tight I put it on, it still felt like there wasn't enough support where I wanted it the most. The material also snagged really easily when I washed it.

The picaresque novels of Grimmelshausen and Beer are still very readable and enjoyable, and in fact Grimmelshausen's \\"Simplicissimus\\" is a work of considerable structural subtlety and philosophical depth.

The irony involved in that event actually taking place is just too sweet not to savor.The choice of This Island Earth for the subject of Mike and the Bots' theatrical premier was truly inspired. MST3K was always being attacked by die-hard movie buffs for maligning little-known cult favorites, so it was only fitting that they chose a major classic of science fiction cinema to mock in their very own movie. Not only is this film hilarious, but it serves as a warning to film fans (like myself) not to take our beloved classics to seriously. Nothing is sacred, but it is hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"This Island Earth\\" Gets The Royal MST Treatment!","review":"Our friends at MST3K have made it to the big screen!

I remember waking up at a specific time everyday I was sick just to watch it. I became a huge fan, and you can immagine my excitement when I found out they were making a movie. So there I was, a little 3rd grader in a old Portland theater watching the coolest movie and for some reason I just seemed to blend in. Finally, all those B-movies get it where it hurts. What a waste watching them without a normal guy and 2 robots mocking them every 5 seconds?

Mike Nelson's pretty funny, as is the 'bots and Dr. Forrester. There are some pretty funny jokes as well. The movie being watched is the 1955 classic, This Island Earth, which isn't actually a bad movie. It's just that Mike and the 'Bots make it funnier & easier to watch. Now onto the DVD. Just like the previous 1998 Image DVD, there's no extras, but whether there are extras or not, it's still worth the buy. However, I must admit that the widescreen presentation is good too. So if you can find this DVD, get it. Also, as for bonus features, I could probably assume that a special edition will come out eventually, but who knows?10/10.

MST3K: The Movie finds Mike Nelson and his robot pals Tom Servo and Crow stuck watching another awful sci-fi flick, this time being 1955's This Island Earth. While the film's total running time is quite short at being less than 75 minutes (compared to episodes of the series), it is a hysterical 75 minutes of running commentary to an old, bad movie that will have you laughing out loud. Fans of the series already know this, but for those uninitiated, the MST3K movie is a welcome entry to Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Likewise, to learn more about each character within the Chinese, you need to look up each one by radical and stroke count rather than going directly to the character (since the Chinese part of the dictionary is sorted by pinyin, with a radical/stroke index).TheCollins Chinese Concise Dictionaryis very similar to this, but has that one glaring problem fixed, and is therefore much more useful. Its extra inch of width and half inch of height is definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinese to English part is quite good","review":"I am a Chinese grew up in Hong Kong and finish high school before I came to America.

My comment here is only regarding the Chinese to English part: when I compare this dictionay to Pocket Oxford Chinese Dictionary ISBN 978-0-19-596-8330, I found that HarperCollin Pocket Chinese Dictionary has better and more Chinese phrases and idioms than the Oxford one. For me, I enjoy relearning those common and traditional Chinese phrases and idioms more in the HarperCollin dictionary.However, for beginner/intermediate students wanting to learn Chinese, the Oxford Chinese Dictionary may be better overall:1. The typeset is a little bigger and easier to read.2. It has both Simplified and Traditional words.3.

TAOTAO was the first, and is the spine of all my Harington reading - but this one is easily the one my *girlish* heart loved most. It is the best balance of Harington's wild fancy and his talent for character development, and it is the book that feels like he must have had the same breezes in his fingers that live in Nail's trees.

Harington develops his settings very competently, occasionally eloquently (see Pangburn's review of 8/7/03). There is plenty of plot. I was very interested at times, and I can see how some readers might love this book. However, his characters are not really developed, and I just could not take them seriously. When he describes life in prison, he does not have the skill to transform despair and horror into art. At other times the plot reads like a TV script. Enjoy the book as a kind of historical novel, if you can, but this is not good literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting.","review":"An acceptable package (no booklet), with good sound recording.Dilermando uses steel strings, and this enhances the popular roots of his inventive.

The hard plastic clips hurt my ears alot after extended wear (>30 mins). Also, the 70% noise reduction advertised is very misleading. Background noise is actually made up of many different sounds at different frequencies. After using these for commuting on bus and train, I found that these earphones are VERY effective at reducing certain sounds (70% definitely possible); and, completely useless at reducing other sounds. While sitting on the back of a bus (by engine), I found that it reduces the higher pitched engine noises very well. It did nothing to reduce the lower (bassy) rumbling of the tranny and wind. It also does nothing about conversations around me. I found that I had to turn the volume up much higher to hear my mp3 player than I did with my Sony Fontopia ex-81s which uses passive noise reduction via silicone ear pieces.

The tune \\"Wallflower\\" by Dylan is one of Doug's best ever; the only problem with the album is there are a few too many covers, but his version of \\"Faded Love\\" is outstanding. A little more country-oriented than some of his other albums, this is certainly one of the best. If you're new to Sahm and enjoy his country material, then pick this up.

She has several interesting chapters in which she gives critical interpretations of popular films and television shows, however, they fail to make up for the dullness of the entire book. She is overly critical of previous methods of feminist criticism, while at the same time almost cocky about her own superior viewpoint. In the end, she never actually has a viewpoint of her own, except that someone else should pick up the ball and develop a new feminist methodology. Her wordiness seemed to be nothing more than a cover for a lack of original thought. This book is definately not for the new student of feminism or for the skeptic. There are many other enlightening books on the subject. Unfortunately this is not one of them and it would be terrible for the book to turn off any more people to the subject as it did myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"I discovered Jonathan Butler on XM Radio.

I think the intention was to build up suspense, saying that he had interviewed Syd, while In fact, it was no more than a doorstep encounter (borderline harassment) that is already all over the internet. Which brings me to another point : you may read a good 90% of this \\"book\\" on the internet as part, or all of, various Syd-related articles, I recognised the descriptions word for word, as I knew I was not reading it for the first time.

Featherstone does an admirable job of describing the tactics employed by English archers in the period of their ascendance in European warfare. He also provides some details on who became archers and their place in English society. Short but clear descriptions of battles like Crecy, Poitiers, and Agincourt round out the picture. Featherstone has a pleasant writing style, although he uses a lot of technical terms regarding bows and armor that I think most people will need to look up in an unabridged dictionary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy for real Punk fans","review":"This CD will never fail to amaze you.

Thus it must be turned on again and again. Very annoying.4) the batteries are drained quickly.

His reference of the literature on animal behavior is impressive, however, his vast essays of his own opinion were a bit tiresome. When he took on a Dr. Spock attitude about raising children, it was especially boring and sometimes infuriating.

Masson reviewed the scientific research on animal behavior. He then presents a few examples of how male animals nurture (or fail to nurture) their children. Masson's hypothesis is that if an animal father (from carp to penguin to wolf) takes care of his children, it is because of a conscious choice to be involved in the childrearing process. If, on the other hand, a male animal is not involved in child rearing, that too is a conscious choice, although usually by the mother to keep the father away. He then sympathizes with the poor male who must miss out on the wonderful joys of fatherhood.Fatherhood is a wonderful experience for humans. Whether other animals also experience this or any other emotional response is well worth exploring. Unfortunately, this book doesn't come close to addressing the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! BURNED UP!!","review":"I bought one of these units a few months ago.

I contacted Porter cable and they sent me a new set that also leaked. I went to a reapir shop and they said that PC had problems with their fittings and recommended a higher grade brand which stopped the leaking. The gun never jams, always works as advertised.

In general, Danny Elfman sticks pretty close to Herrman's original music, but he speeds up the tempos and adds noisier orchestrations for the more exciting parts of the score, adding to its intensity.

Very, very slow. I entered the character creation screen--and got disconnected within 10 seconds by the server. Tried many servers many times. Same story.

The world is static, monsters drop the same thing time after time (if you can get it to drop). Alot of the items are on creatures that spawn once 8 hours or more, so if you ever want to get an item...either have 3 full days of playing time without sleep, or buy it from another player who spent 3 full days repeatedly killing the creature. Downtime from regenerating health and mana starts at a tolerable level...a couple minutes, but after you get a few levels it increasingly gets worse (in excess of 15 minutes in some situatations after each kill). Fights generally take a minute...definately not a fast pace game. If you want to solo, this is not your game, one is forced to group with others at higher levels.

If you want a good Online RPG, play Ultima Online, it's a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Correcction","review":"Sorry but I have to post this to defend myself after the lie spread by someone else here. I did not swear when Verant suspended my account, they just plain didn't like what I said, and thats the truth.They will ban you for whatever they please.I also see that she said her highest character is level 10... well Mine is level 44. So I do know what I'm talking about. This game is a total waste of time, literally.PS: The higher the level you get in this game, the worse it gets. I will never buy a Verant created game again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential but...","review":"The whole game centers around collecting items by sitting and waiting 8-10 hours at a time in line with other players who want the same item from a rare creature that may appear once in a week.The game has lots of potential but this focus of the game ruins any potetntial for roleplaying or strategy. It consists of lots of boring sitting and waitin for rare creatures to spawn and squabling with other players so you can get your character the best items. There dont seem to be any other goals in the game.It could be a lot of fun if a comapany that had half a clue about gameplay and fun took over management of the game.This will never happen so it will never be."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID!","review":"This game cannot be called an RPG. No one roleplays. The whole point of it is to kill and get stuff. There is no storyline at all. Period.Oh yeah. As if it gets any worse, its addictive too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever-crack","review":"EQ is the best game i have played. i have played Ultima online, and Asherons call... they dont come close to the fun i have had in EQ. many of the bad reviews are from people that are burned out or out to ruin the reputation of EQ because they were banned for doing somthing they shouldent have been doing (harassing other people, exploiting bugs etc.) EQ is usually patched weekly, adding new aspects to the game as well as reducing bugs. in defence of verant GM's there are approx. 2500 people on each server and usually about 3-5 GM's. these guys are usually pretty cool if you dont push them to hurry up. every time i have called apon a GM, they have always been helpful. the only reasons someone should not play this game is if they are married and their spouse does not play also :) it will put an end to any relationships very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING","review":"This game is the MOST addicting game ever made. They give you the first month free so you can get through the first \\"What is going on stage\\" and get straight to the addiction. But the game IS worth the 10$ a month!!! You will not mind the time is takes to get the levels to move forword because you will love every second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lancefighter Strykestorm, Paladin of Karana ( Karana Server)","review":"This game lasted a very short time for me. It takes forever to Level at the higher levels. I am currently level 26 and quitting the game. There are 60 levels now with the addition of Kunark. At 26, it will take me 7hours of Real Life time to level up. And a friend of mine who is level 52 says it will take him weeks to level up and he is a constant gamer. If you really feel the need to waste time, this is your game. I highly recommend you find a faster, quicker game to play, since this game will take you over 50 days of play time, yes 1200 hours of play time to reach level 60 at the very least. Well, there you have the most time consuming waste of time. I am heavily dissapointed in the way this game turned. After 8 months of play ( I'm a student so i dont have too much time, but about 3hours a day ) i had two characters, level 26 and level 19.

Now that this is said, I'm officially kicking the EQ \\"habit\\". Which is exactly how EQ is tailored. It has the necessary \\"hooks\\" to keep you coming back for more, while taking your money and offering very little in return. The online gaming community in EQ is neither supportive, nor friendly......heck, I got yelled at for saying good morning to someone in ooc \\"out of character\\" chat. And, this isn't about Role Playing. This is about Leveling. Which makes one wonder why they call it EverQuest. It should be called Everlag, Everlevel, Evergripe.......you get my point. Trust me, from one RPG fanatic to another......Kick the habit before you lose too much more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game Fine Ruined by Poor Customer Service","review":"The game is nice. The potential enjoyment will be ruined by poor network service and absolutely horrendous Customer Service. You will get dumped regularly from the game servers. You will have billing problems.

We are not making you stay!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"do NOT buy this game as a gift!","review":"Don't buy this game (the orginal or any add-ons) as a gift to anyone you truly care about. This game is addictive and time-consuming, and it can destroy people's lives, relationships and careers. Ulimately it is an empty time-waster designed to make money at the expense of people's time, exploiting human tendencies to egoism and procrastination. Verant make money from monthly subscriptions to the game, so it is in their interests to make it compulsive. The game is designed so that you will not enjoy it unless you spend substantial amounts of time playing. There are people who play up to 18 hours a day 7 days a week, which doesn't leave much time for Real Life. You have been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service and Waste of time","review":"I have found that this game becomes a waste of time and very bid source of frustration. servers have been down just about everyday and they still have yet to fix some of the origanal problems in the Everquest but insist on releasing an expansion just to cause more problems.

However, listening to these now familiar songs recorded, I like them even better. They make me HAPPY. Further, this is one of those 'the more you listen, the more you discover is there' kind of disks. Great songs, played pleasurably well, and truly creative production...I'm so glad \\"You're Not Asking the Right Questions\\" is finally out and available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible edition","review":"Sometimes getting a Dover Edition can be a godsend. They're cheap, well-built, and often reproductions of good editions.But this isn't one of those times. The print is small and the pages are tiny. It does not stay open well at the piano. To be sure, the actual notes are most probably the same as any other, more expensive edition. Nevertheless, most good editions offer large pages and clear, good-sized notation. I suggest the pricier Henle or Peters editions.As a study score, this is certainly a good choice. But to learn an entire rhapsody from it?

She likes soothing things to help her go to sleep. But this is not soothing. It is so loud that she can't fall asleep to it and there is no way to lower the volume. I suppose if I hooked an mp3 player up to it that I could adjust the volume on the mp3 player itself, but haven't tried it yet.She rarely uses it (just when she and her sister are playing house).Oh and it makes a whirring and clicking sound as the scene moves.

The music is a bit loud, but I saw a tip in a magazine to put tape over the speaker- so I tried it and it helped! I love the mp3 player option too. So cool. It plays for a reasonable amount of time, enough for my little one to fall asleep. I like the look as well. I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"I love this product! My daughter loves it too. She would not sleep in her crib until we got this. I lay her down in her crib now and she watches it until she falls asleep.

No doubt it may lead a few people to a more up to date interpretation of the civil war era than they are used to.The most valuable aspect of the book are the annotated bibliographies following each chapter, which will be great for sophmore in college looking for a book list at 3 AM.Some readers of this book may be surprised to discover the war had something to do with slavery. Outside of the slavery issue, the author rarely spends much ink on other topics of the war or reconstruction-he barely touches on reconstruction at all, though this is supposed to be one of the points of the book.Pick it up at the library for the bibliographies, find an area of interest, grab a real book, then read on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Rate Historian Tries to Re-Write the Civil War","review":"An economic interpretation of the Civil War and anti-Lincoln that is the main points of this book and why this book is off, way off. Hummel's writng is not too bad and the bibliographic essays at the end of each chapter are interesting. However, his history is off as is most revisionist history.

There are more compilations of this band than they have albums, so making a choice is difficult (unless you buy them all...), and getting the \\"regular\\" albums leaves you short of many tracks only released as singles.I found this disc to be second-best, still short of \\"A Band From Geordieland\\", which has 24 tracks, and about 30 minutes more of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sander seized up after 4 hours use","review":"I bought the sander about a year ago but hadn't used it much until recently.
