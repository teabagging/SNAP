The book was four or five different stories that were never finished. The only thing that tied them all together was one boy, Jody Tiflin. The book in my opinion had no point.

The physical condition of the book was somewhat disappointing because it was delivered without the the illustarated cover shown in the adverisement picture and the promised collector's case.

What time I have used it it seems to work well and can give the user a wealth of info about his vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another gadget","review":"Thought it would be useful but after one day of watching the display bounce around with the numbers, it really isn't very accurate. Even with the cruise control set, the \\"miles per gallon\\" jumped around so much, you find yourself watching the gauge instead of the road. The other thing that relly sould be noted is that the voltage showed 11.5 volts indicating possibly a dead battery cell. Since my battery was 3 + years old, I figured it was time for a new battery, thanks gauge. Well, before I took the plunge to buy a new battery, I checked it with my battery load tester and two other volt meters. The result was 13.2 volts on the volt meters and the battery passed the load test just fine. Therefore the ScanGauge II got the AXE (sent back). Most of the info on the gauge is a duplicate of what is already available on the vehicle, and the accuracy is questionable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really excited to get this gadget. Unfortunately it did not work for me. When I tried to see the average MPG, the numbers being displayed every 2 seconds were absolutely random: 31.5, 91.2, 28.4, 75.2.....and so on. Then I tried to get data for a trip; the gauge started recoring and after 3 seconds it stopped. When I pulled over and looked at the dial it had NO DATA... I tried to measure it several times....no luck. Bummer! I drive a 2007 Nissan Sentra. I wish this item would have worked. Amazon.com does not have exchanges on this item, so I just did a return for a fuill refund.

I know now many high price cars no longer have them and I'm just about sold on the idea that they're not necessary. Nevertheless I'm too old and been relying on one too long to change. With this device I now have one and it's WAY more accurate than the ones that are factory installed. In addition I like seeing the voltage the battery is putting out. I just installed it today and the other gauges I have displayed are RPM and speed. Don't need the last two as the car has these but it's nice knowing that the ScanGauge agrees with the car instruments. I'll use the MPG stuff if I ever figure it out. The cable was really easy to hide. I placed the device atop the steering column. It sits below the instruments. The light is not really bright enough to see well in the daytime especially with dark glasses. Way cheaper then my first idea which was to put in a coolant Temp. gauge from under the hood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works as advertised until it died","review":"This little data logger was great while it was working.

The Prius, with its cluster of gauges, has taught us how to drive more economically. I hoped adding the ScanGauge II to the 4Runner, a gas hog, would help reduce our gas consumption. While it is full of interesting information I'd have to say it has not helped at all with increasing our mileage. What has helped is what we learned from the Prius.I like the gauge and all of it's options. I keep it and wouldn't want to be without it because it is novel. It is very expensive though. There are cables and apps for Android and iOS that will allow you to do the same thing but with color graphics which I think might be a cheaper and better option these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality and functionality","review":"Excellent design, easy to use, and no batteries required.

I really needed to drive as fuel-efficiently as possible to offset the poor mpg of this large SUV. This product provides real-time mpg data (as well as several other pieces of driving data). This product has made me much more aware of driving habits.The data provided is far more comprehensive than the trip computer on my 2006 Acura TL. For example, my Acura provides average mpg until I hit the reset button. ScanGauge provides instant mpg, average trip mpg, average day mpg, average tank mpg, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scanguage II","review":"Simple installation, provides more info than needed, but simple to set up to see what you want.

More contrast in the display would be the only improvement I would suggest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for the car enthusiast","review":"I saw a review on Mojo channel where the reviewer used the MPG display to increase mileage.Based on this I bought one and I'm not disappointed.I can see this easily paying for itself in less than a year.The real time MPG display allows you to tame that lead foot and get awesome mileage on a long run.I did an 8 hour drive last week and must have got conservatively 5MPG better fuel economy. You do have to work at viewing the display and feeding it back to that right foot. Very easy to install - under 5 minutes.If you're not a gadget fan then don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great way to save money!","review":"I've used the ScanGauge for almost a month. Wow! What a difference it's made in the way I drive. Not only has it shown me how jackrabbit starts have impacted my mileage, but I've also learned the most efficient routes to take to and from work. Coming to work the way I'd always done cost me about $1.80. Taking a different route, even though it was off the Interstate and dealing with traffic lights, has shaved that to $1.41! The trips I took to the store were costing me $0.94 on my old route. With the new route it costs $0.73.Then I did some experiments with highway driving. What amazed me is the MPG difference between 55 and 65 MPH. At 55MPH my Kia Sorento gets about 24MPG on the highway. At 65MPH that drops to around 21MPG. Then at 75MPH (the fastest we can drive on the Interstate in Colorado) it goes down to 18MPG.So this little gadget will pay for itself in about 6 months of normal driving. Not a bad investement at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My method of mounting the scangauge II","review":"Love the device, and have nothing to add about that. I did come up with a great way of easily mounting the scangauge, though. I took apart a dead hard drive and took out the two extremely powerful magnets. I slipped one into the headliner of my car, and I heard it slide somewhere above my head. I took some black duct tape and taped the other magnet to the scangauge, and when I touched it to the bottom of the headliner, the magnet in the headliner rushed over and mated with the scangauge magnet. After that I could slide the scangauge to the exact position I wanted it, and it stayed there. The magnets are powerful enough that I can push the buttons without having to worry about moving or dislodging the gauge. Simple and amazingly effective..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best part to modify to save gas is the driver","review":"Since I started using ScanGaugeII, my average gas mileage (1999 Nissan Maxima 5spd) has gone from 26 to 29 MPG, just by knowing what helps and what hurts my mileage. I keep mine set to IGN, MPG, MAP, AVG. This tool makes it easier to determine when you should shift for optimal mileage. Turns out I was actually shifting too early most of the time. Amazon is the cheapest place to buy one of these, and if you use it properly, it will pay for itself pretty quickly in fuel savings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geeky but not so good","review":"I've purchased two of these. While they have a geek factor when you first get them, you soon learn they are not suitable for a warm car nor a cold one - the displays freeze up requiring them to be unplugged and replugged. Gets annoying after a few days. Also, the company does not respond to email about this or any other problems so if you wish to throw $160 out the window, by all means do so, but recognize you will get a quirky gadget that is almost never accurate (requires constant adjustment), whose display and internals are not well suited for the automobile environment and where there is no customer support if something goes wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great window into what is going on in your car","review":"The ScanGauge II did just what it was supposed to do, was easy to install and connect, and it took right off.

In this particular album, recorded in 1986, she collaborated with some of the best musicians in the easy listening/jazz field, like George Benson, Herbie Hankock, Steve Gadd, Gil Evans, Michael Brecker, Ron Carter, in order to record the old standards that her generation created, like Il mondo,poesia,ancora,aria,canzone per te, e penso a te,la voce del silenzio etc. She created an atmosphere of deep,bittersweet melancholy, and all that you want to do is switch off the lights, take a big glass of drink and listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith Rewarded","review":"This touching story about a woman's perseverance in working with a nearly unresponsive child is a heart-warming story that will remain with you for years.There aren't that many movies which are really, truly inspiring, but this is one of them (and one of the best).Highly recommended, but keep the kleenex handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired and fearless","review":"Gieseking may be inconsistent at times in these performances, but the sections of sustained inspiration rendered in light, sometimes extraordinarily fleet playing make owning these CDs mandatory.

Having never heard of Diana Krall, I took one look at the picture of her on the cover and thought, \\"I am NOT going to like this.\\" She has that sugary, Debbie Gibson look.But luckily, her voice sounds nothing like she looks. She has a smoky, sultry voice that fills every cranny of the room when you have her on the stereo. And on top of that, as a pianist she has that rare ability to find the nuances in the music that others miss. As a musician myself, I am incredibly jealous.Now, I just have to get some of her other albums, so that I can have more than one in my 5-disc player at all times. Diana Krall is easily now one of my top 3 female vocalists of all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Would Make Nat Nod with a Smile","review":"\\"All for You\\" is the album Diana Krall came to prominence with in 1996. It scored a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Vocal Album and although it lost out to Cassandra Wilson's gem \\"New Moon Daughter\\", remains one of the best releases of the talented Canadian singer/pianist.Krall's piano skills shine here as on none of her other albums. She has a reputation of hitting fewer notes with great effect, but on this tribute album to the great Nat King Cole her pianism reached heights close to virtuosity.Both on uptempo songs and ballads her style emits joy and intensity and, unlike with her later release \\"Love Scenes\\", the listener is not falling asleep at the end.This is Krall pianist at her best and singer almost there as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"To be honest, I'm only 13, and I absolutely love this CD.

But my personal favorite is Baby Baby All the Time. Ms. Krall's voice is hypnotic and soulful, and completes the range of songs perfectly. I also really enjoy Deed I Do, If I Had You, Frim Fram Sauce, Errand Girl for Rhythym, Hit that Jive Jack, A Blossom Fell, and well, you get the idea.

Her performances, esp. her sometimes shy, disconnected live performances, can sometimes be criticized for displaying no dynamic range. Every now and then it wouldn't hurt to use what sounds like a powerful voice and sing out a little, and show some power, hit a high note. But in any event, no one is better than Krall today at what she does. A dynamic pianist, a sexy, well-in-control singer who caresses the lyric. Of all her albums, this is by far the best, with the best jazzy numbers. The upbeat is in full force, beginning with Nat King Cole's Errand Boy for Rhythym. One of my favorite CDs even long after its debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"my thoughts about: All For You","review":"All For You is one of five Diana Krall CD's in my collection, I must admit that I enjoy the other four equally as much as this one.

At first I thought it was just packing material, but the stacker cannot hold shape without a form for the floor. I'm sure we can cut a piece to fit, but this was a dissapointment.The stacker comes with a plastic clotheshanger for hanging.

Unfortunately, I don't speak French and, of course, quickly found that linguistic mastery does not necessarily transcend language (sometimes, though - Eco, for instance).It might be an important work of literature - historically. And Flaubert seemed to do an excellent job of inventively portraying the many revolting traits of his denizens. Regardless, or possibly because of this, the book left me cold.

Madame Bovary is one of the greatest anti-heroes in all of Western literature, as she leads the reader through a tragedy that explores the extremes of ambivalence. Masterful and compelling. An absolute must-read.HOWEVER, this particular edition (published by General Books LLC) is absolutely atrocious. I have never seen a book so rife with typographical errors -- it's like reading a Kindle transcription gone horribly wrong.

The songs on \\"A Camp\\" veer from smooth and sweet (Frequent Flyer, Angel of Sadness) to hard and corrosive (Oddness of the Lord, Hard As A Stone). To Persson's credit, she carries off both very well. However, some of the more uncertain tracks, like \\"Walking the Cow\\" and \\"Silent Night\\", don't quite work.

However, I always get the feeling on reading his works his God is a very wishy-washy one.The conversations seem to reveal a God who is basically what Walsch would like God to be; God is sort of like a friendly grandpa, all we have to do is take some time off from our day and talk to him. While I would certainly agree God's love is important, his version of God is very hard to believe, as are his 'revelations.' How can we know what Walsch claims to experience really is God? God seems very vague and changeable in Walsch's book, and strangely conducive to our wishes and shallow.While Walsch may stumble on truths, like much New Age material it is very vague, to the point where virtually anything can be said about the realm of spirit, even if they are mutually contradictory. Such a faith is a bit too soft-headed for my liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Home with God (Neale Donald Walsch)","review":"Definitely the right content to close off the CWG series, with amazing perspective on the meaning of death, dying, and its relation to life itself.It will give the reader a 'good' feeling about what will happen when the time is there for him/her self.

Songs like Not Dark Yet, Every Grain of Sand, Born in time, Brownsville Girl, Series of Dreams, and the recent Things Have Changed (which did not appear on an album) all sparkle like diamonds discovered in a rock pile.

I'm 59 years old, and when I put this in my CD player, it is the 60's again. It gives me such pleasure to hear such fabulous music still coming from Bob Dylan--and some hope, too! Maybe we really can be 'forever young.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Song Writing in Years","review":"\\"High Water\\" belongs with some of Dylan's best. \\"Sugar Baby\\" is also wonderful. The rest of the CD is fun and sounds closer to Tom Waits than the Dylan of the mid-sixties. Great to hear a legend back with the same edge that we've come to expect from his songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add this to the essential list!","review":"This is my favorite Dylan album since \\"Blood on the Tracks\\". Witty narrative rolls off of Bob's tounge like gems from a pirate's bounty. Does he even write these lyrics down? After the excellent \\"Time Out of Mind\\" I was worried Bob was sinking into a dark mire of bitterness and pain, the end seemed near. But now he seems reborn and fresh combining his sage venerable self (something he could do even in his twenties), with his youthful vigor. What an icon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real music","review":"Like a man delusional,Gone mad from drought,I cried at the presence of water,Down in the dead well.Dylan makes the rest of the so-called performers on the current music scene look like no-talent novices. Finally, a work of sheer musical genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not just about voice, its about soul","review":"I'm amazed at the fact that decades go by and some people still insist on reviewing Dylan's work on the grounds of \\"good voice\\". Some of the hollow pop artists that are being released these days have beautiful voices, too bad they have a complete lack of soul. \\"Love and Theft\\" is one of Dylan's best because of its sincerity. A simple truth in Dylan's mouth will always sound more beautiful than all the overproduced lies being played nowadays on the radio. Do yourself a favor and get this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictably unlike any other album he's done","review":"This is my favorite Dylan album next to Desire. The adorable songs \\"Moonlight\\", \\"Floater\\" and \\"Bye and Bye\\" struck me first and it is amazing how beautiful Dylan can make that growl of a voice.Upon further listenings, the more intense and lyrical songs began to work on me. Songs like \\"Mississippi\\", Highwater\\" and the hilarious \\"Po' Boy\\". Again, it is probably strange to hear this, but Dylans voice has never sounded better. Time Out of Mind bummed me out and sort of turned me off to his \\"New Voice\\" but this album set me to rights.Lets hope Dylan is crafting another trilogy like the one he did in the seventies with BOTT, Desire, and Street Legal. Best album in years"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan's Love Letter To The South","review":"I'm a big fan of Dylan as a performer, songwriter and musician. The production on this record is the best he's ever had (by conincidence, he twisted the knobs on this one). You have to lean in to listen to what's going on. The narratives go from external, describing something to the internal. One of the things Dylan has always done best is crib lines from old blues and hillbilly and British Isles tunes and illuminate them in a different context. The themes of this CD are regret, forgiveness all filtered through Dylan's interpretations of various native Southern musics without being hokey, obvious or lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun","review":"I'd say this is one of Dylan's fluffiest albums yet lyrically, but it knows it's light. The music is wonderful. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this is Dylan's longest running band. This album is a good sampling of what you'll hear musically at his shows these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Music","review":"I liked this album. I'm not sure what any of it is about, but I liked it. When I think of Dylan, I think of him as a song writer/story teller: The Hurricane, Joey, Masters of War, Times They Are a Changing, etc. I know what those songs are about. The lyrics are compelling. Most of the time on this album I can't really make out what Dylan is singing about, or at a minimum I'm not compelled to listen. But... it still sounds good. Dylan has become primarily a great roots rock musician, and this album is filled with bluesy, jazzy tunes that are simply fun to listen to. It's worth buying the version with the bonus CD because then you've also got right there the evidence of what he used to be able to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"JESUS HAS RETURNED & HIS NAME IS BOB","review":"IF THIS ISNT THE FINEST EXAMPLE OF THE CRAFT OF SONG WRITING I DONT KNOW WHAT IS!!!!!

The man was always unexpected and even in the past he did real bad records. I can forgive this man for anything, after all he wrote \\"Lay lady Lay\\", \\"Sad Eyed lady of the lowlands\\". \\"Visions of Johanna\\" and another 100 masterpieces.

I like to listen to Dylan again. Like so many others from the 1960s, he somehow lost his creativity (after \\"New Morning\\"). How to interpret the title?

The whole album is a reminder of Dylan's mastery of lyricism. One point that I'd like to make, and it could be thought of as a personal point, is that Dylan's voice isn't awful or half-awful. If he can't sing, or if the effect his voice has is so awful why do his songs carry across various feelings, emotions and moods? I think Dylan has been unfairly picked on for having an individual approach to his delivery, which I consider to be one of the true approaches in modern day music.You must listen to Love and Theft if you in any way appreciate blues and rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"It gets better every time I listen to it.

This one was definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Love and Theft\\" Aptly Named","review":"\\"Love and Theft\\" was aptly named as it stole my heart away! This new music from Mr. Dylan was the most joyous surprise and delight. I have played nothing else since first hearing it. It is like it is what I've been looking for but not knowing what it was I wanted. This is it!!! Mr. Dylans'voice in this album has a bluesy-jazz quality that expresses such feeling. I just love this man and love his music. I know it's been said before but here it goes again: this man is an absolute genious. Why his music isn't played on the radio is the question I'd like answered. He won a grammy for the album \\"Time Out of Mind\\" and I didn't hear one song from it played on the radio. Same for \\"Things Have Changed\\", the song he won an Oscar for last year. This music needs to be played on the radio, like new music used to be. People need to hear this. Mr. Dylan deserves praises and accolades and I hope he gets them."},{"rating":"2","title":"song and dance man, indeed","review":"we've heard dylan the poet, dylan the stylist, dylan the troubadour....now it's dylan the song-and-dance man. those looking for another \\"blood on the tracks\\" may be disappointed. this is a whole new \\"stage\\" for the bob-ster. it is a gorgeous album, but in a different way than \\"time out of mind\\" or \\"blood on the tracks\\". this is the first album that seems like it's totally bob's--written and produced by him (produced under his alias \\"jack frost\\"). this is what true americana music sounds like. yet it probably won't get a lick of airplay anyplace. if you like his live shows with his currently incredible band, you will dig this album. warning....don't take it too seriously...it's silly in spots... just kick back and enjoy it. you won't be disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best got better!","review":"While Time out of Mind was a fine work, this one is as goodas anything he has ever done, blonde on blonde.Sounds like he want back to the basement but thesound is terrific; no low-fi bootleg recording here;the backing band is the best he has had since The Band."},{"rating":"1","title":"another disappointment","review":"I agree with Mr. Chickeneater (see review)--Love & Theft was overhyped by the critics (as was Time Out of Mind). It sounds a lot like 1990's Under the Red Sky, which, a few cuts excepted, isn't very good either. And I know it's lame to complain about Dylan's voice, but it's more grating than usual here. In an interview, the poet David Berman (also of the great band Silver Jews) talked about how he had only recently started listening to Dylan's catalog and was pretty disappointed, saying that \\"there should be someone better.\\" I think Berman's right on target. For all the acclaim Dylan's garnered over the years, even his best records are marred by clunkers or rewrites of older songs. The critical pendulum may have swung back in Dylan's favor, but that doesn't mean his records have gotten any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Great Songs","review":"Mississippi and Sugar Baby are great songs, up there with the best Dylan has done. However, the rest of the album, while listenable, isn't all that memorable. Still, I suppose it's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still, after over 40 years performing and recording. The same cannot be said for '60s peers like Paul McCartney or the Stones.Overall, Time Out of Mind was better, although that too was a little overrated, with only Not Dark Yet, Standing in the Doorway and Trying to Get to Heaven truly belonging to the canon of great Bob songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wacky","review":"Seems all the \\"new\\" songs were pulled from baselines of his old songs.

However, has anyone stopped stroking his ego long enough to realize how bad this album is? It has one good song on it, \\"Mississippi\\" and that was written for Sheryl Crow. I wish she had sung this version as well because it would be much better than hearing Leon Redbone sing it. What is Dylan doing with his vocals on this album? Give me Nashville Skyline anyday of the week. Also, Tweedle-Dee is about the most ridiculous song ever penned. I know that it's probably really deep and about the 2000 election or something, but its called Tweedle Dee. I think I'll write a song about Humpty Dumpty and see if Columbia will market it as a topical song about 9-11. It's interesting to see how forgiving we are of aging rock stars.

I'm baffled by this sort of aural pollution, but I know that there is no way anyone would get signed on the basis of this rubbish if they didn't have a 40 year career behind him.

He will forever be remembered as the greatest poet / writer / folk balladeer. THEFT, because now he is using that well earned fame to steal our money. This album is just plain awful.

Then for awhile I thought NO, it's his best album since Highway 61.Then, like Wittgenstein, I changed my mind again, undergoing a paradigm shift, and realized that it is actually his best album since Freewheelin'...As far as the Theft charges; Malcolm Lowry once said - \\"If you steal from one person, it's plagiarism; if you steal from everybody, you're a genius.\\" Case closed, the Judge done hammered down his hammer, and we can all leave the courthouse and amble on down into the sunny square outside, where Bob is playing, his guitar case lying open on the bench. The sound of bees fills the air in the background.Bob has mined the hills of folklore again, and shown us once again what varied and colorful Mother Lodes there are to be found in the Folk.

If \\"Time out of Mind\\" was the vision of life as mortal, \\"Love and Theft\\" is that dirge turned inside out -- when all there is left to do is dance, reminisce, get silly and make puns. It's \\"How does it feel?\\" merged with \\"something is happening here but you don't know what it is\\", put to the music of \\"The Basement Tapes\\" and \\"Planet Waves\\" and even \\"Saved\\".The guy just has more tricks up his sleeve than any other working singer/songwriter out there. Let's face it, when they unearth the heart of folk music of America 100 years from now, they are going to look at \\"Good as I been to you\\" and this album as key examples of the treasure trove of Dylan's work.Let's hear it for it him, in between all the touring and who know what else, he stills gets himself in to work in the studio and walks out having gotten his job done. Right on, Bob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"When I first bought this album, I wasn't TOO pleased with it, but after taking a break from it for a little while and listening to it again, I love it - I can't get enough of it now. I would have to say that my favorite tracks on the CD are Mississippi, High Water (for Charley Patton), Moonlight, Po' Boy, Cry A While, and Sugar Baby. This CD just keeps getting better every time I listen to it. If you're a fan of Dylan, this is a definite must-have album - one of his best. The lyrics, music, and just about everything about this album is amazing. You should definitely give this album a chance; it deserves your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major letdown","review":"After all the hype, this was the biggest disappointment of the year for me. Dylan's dabbling in Tin Pan Alley or Stephen Foster-type songwriting just doesn't cut it. He doesn't have the voice. This kind of thing has been done to death and with far better results by the likes of Leon Redbone. I was hoping for more of the type of thing he did on Time Out of Mind or his Oscar-winning song for Wonder Boys. This is silly posturing on the part of a true musical original and trendsetter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The critics loved this CD, but they're probably the same ones who keep voting the now tired sounding Sgt. Peppers record the greatest thing ever recorded. This is Dylan trying to sound like Bob Dylan 60s revisted. Despite his tremendous talent, Dylan can't carry it off. The CD mainly recycles his old ideas and music. It isn't bad, but it is not very compelling or convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was going to write a review...","review":"...but then I read benshlomo's, which I think sums things up pretty well. I don't agree with all of it -- maybe I listen to too much Pere Ubu and Captain Beefheart, but I've never thought of Dylan as not being able to sing -- but it essentially makes all the points I would've made. So go read his, and save me a half-hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like Bob is stuck on Leon Redbone","review":"Honestly, I love Time Out Of Mind, but this CD just sounds like outtakes from those great sessions. No original ground being broke here. Better to invest in Live 1966 or some earlier Bob. Or how about some of Bob's earlier contemporaries, like Richard and Mimi Farina?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but this is Dylan goes to Vegas","review":"This album has some terrific songs -- \\"Mississippi\\" is worth the price, in fact -- and Dylan sound relaxed and the band sharp. So why a bad review? Well, on the whole, relaxed is not how Dylan is at his best. He was relaxed on \\"Under the Red Sky,\\" too. The repeated efforts at cocktail swing just don't work for me, though clearly many people like them; he can play this stuff, sure, but why would he? It's a little like an aging lounge act -- someone below actually referred positively to the Dylan cover of Dean Martin songs, but I fear the comparison can hardly be flattering. The annoying part is that the good songs on this album show that he hasn't lost his touch overall and that the harm is self-inflicted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing too exciting with few good cuts, A Dissenting View..","review":"..and melodies that are pretty weak. A few old 3-chord blues patterns,the same gravelly voice, and the background arrangements all seem too much one and the same. Some of the lyrics are interesting,but that's as it should be. \\"Moonlight\\" and \\"PoBoy\\" may be the only two that rise above mainly average songs from country/folk/rock tradition...But at the age of 60, at least Bob and the gang are still trying. This album shows the generally dismal new sounds aging rockers can produce, and it sounds embarrassing when you consider that they're still basically producing material for people now nearly two generations behind them, and with all the disparity of life experience that suggests."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was suprised by my reaction to this.","review":"My favorite Dylan period was from Bringing It All Back Home to Blonde on Blonde. I remember the first time I checked into the possibility of listening to Bob's newer music. I clicked on a link at Amazon, and my first impression was that his voice was unbearable. Recently, after seeing the great reviews for this cd, I decided to take a chance and order it anyway. Am I ever glad I did. I really love the music. It's got what I would call a sort of '50s rock sound....but you can never really describe Bob Dylan's music, can you? I was also suprised to find that Dylan's new lower vocal range quickly grew on me - as soon as I put aside the expectation of hearing the Bob Dylan from the '60s. Being open minded is very important when it comes to music, and I'm glad I chose to give this one a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Back","review":"I bought \\"Planet Waves\\" at 16 when Dylan began to tour again in 1973 and loved it (does anyone still listen to \\"Planet Waves\\"?) I immediately went out and got \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" and the whole Dylan archive. Later, in college, I turned on all my friends to \\"Blood on The Tracks\\". But then I lost Bob or moved on to something else. I saw \\"Love and Theft\\" at the store and felt compelled to purchase it - I figured I'd listen once and store it away. After one listen all I play is all 12 tracks of \\"Love and Theft\\" again and again. Just as I used to listen to every track of \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" or \\"Nashville Skyline\\" or \\"John Wesley Harding\\" over and over and over.\\"Love and Theft\\" is warm, confident, challenging, breathtaking, and like all of Bob's great albums enhances our perception of America and of ourselves.

Anyone who grew up in the 80's will remember hearing their straight-to-the-point rock, all over the radio airwaves. Led by propulsive drumming and the no-nonsence vocals of Jimmy Marinos, they left behind a legacy of great 80's power pop.

The band has a new album due out Sept. 9 titled \\"61/49.\\" If you buy this collection, you should try the new album too, because from what I've heard of it on the band's website ..., it's a more up-to-date, full sound than much of the older stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size doesn't match product description","review":"When I got this table I was shocked to see that the table measured 24 inches wide by 24 inches deep.

It actually has somewhat of a variant storyline from Valis but there is so much original work it doesnt feel repetitive. Anyone who is a PKD fan should try very hard to find a quiet night alone, no distractions, and just merge with the book. It is told from 2 viewpoints, Phil's and his best friend, and each takes up where the other leaves off. It is very well done and by the end you will definitely want to re-read some of his later work.

Not sure why. Radio Free Albemuth is a good alternative, in my opinion, to VALIS. It's classic PKD but more accessible than VALIS. The idea behind Radio Free Albemuth, similar to all of PKD's stories, is brilliant: there was once a link between humans and a higher intelligence, helping humans to advance. The link has become tenuous and is about to be lost forever, thanks to the fear and stupidity of some humans.

It is indeed a nice introduction to the subject. I confess I did not finish it for some years, because I got stuck on trying to make meaning of the Christoffel symbols. But nobody else's books made me feel comfortable with those, so the fault is not with the author. Eventually (after a graduate course on General Relativity), I finished the book.This is a lovely book, written with appreciation for the reader as well as the subject.

The griddle has riveted handles and heats/browns uniformly with no hot spots. The glass cover allows you to keep food warm or steam cook foods like sausage and hotdogs while simultaneously browning. The griddle can double as a serving tray if cleaned thorougly after cooking. It's easy to clean.

I like that it's all stainless steel and that there's no teflon coating to worry about. Also, it does retain its heat, so once it's hot you can cook the pancakes faster...The only thing I have to mention is that the original price listed was over $100, and the final price was so discounted to around $35 that it seemed like such a bargain. Well, it's a bit of false advertising. The box it comes in is one of those with infomercial graphics spinning one of those sales pitches like, \\"MSRP $100....but you get it for only $35!\\" It's true value is between $30-45, given the prices on similarly priced pots at a discount homeware place in NYC last week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Griddle","review":"We have only owned this griddle for a couple of days, but I can already tell that it's going to be a more or less permanent fixture on our stove.

The March 10th session is as stunning a piano trio session that you'll find anywhere in contemporary music. Eric Reed is an excellent technician and player, and that comes out best on the session where he was unencumbered by contributions from trumpet and alto saxophone.The April 19th session has a solid rhythm section, and some good contributions from Nicholas Payton .For me, however, Wessell Anderson's contribution on sax. is intrusive and over-busy, whilst the inclusion of his composition \\"Blues to come\\", sits uneasily with the rest of the material on the disc.No Reed completist should be without this, but hit the programme button and get the 7 piano trio tracks first"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This album contains songs that will appeal to all moods-it is made up of music that is slow, fast, upbeat, and gentle. In addition you are treated to Mr. Eric Reed's talent that will carry him through many more albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I have an Eric, with a side of Eric please?","review":"The first piece I ever heard Eric Reed play was Longhair's Rumba. Shortly before he began, he said he really wanted to master ballads, because that shows true piano talent. Then he proceeds to rip the music apart and reassemble it just in time to conclude it with the final two chords. The improv was simply outstanding yet, at the same time, the construction was perfect! The only thing that makes this album fall short of perfect is not enough Eric. There are players out there with a \`me and my Steinway' complex. But it's as if in an effort to stay modest, Reed sometimes serves us up shortfall, letting those under his tutelage shine bright, all aglow in his bandleader-slash-teacher moments. Okay, but...Eric, you are perfect, so how about less tenor sax, less percussion, and just Eric, washed clean, wearing communion white, with maybe a little bass on the side? (Buster Williams, maybe?)

The guest apperances were by people I don't know or care about. The content was somewhat funny, but skits can't compare to the hilarious segments from Cartoon Planet or the pieces on the previous 2 CD's.If you are a SGC2C fan, you might like this cd but that's a stretch.

The third time the trap didn't even bother to shut. It sat there in the morning, still open, with the peanut butter stolen by my rat. Finally I placed a small bit of peanut butter on a rat-sized glue trap and place the trap against one of my baseboards. Mr. Nibbles was caught in about 3 hours.

Then it's all downhill.","review":"\\"Call me Ishmael.\\" It's undoubtedly one of the most widely recognized opening lines of any classical novel. Unfortunately, it's also the best line in the book. This is a vast, slow-moving work in which all of the action takes place in the last twenty or so pages. Most of the rest is a more or less inaccurate description of the whaling industry and the anatomy of whales. The sea is perhaps one of the most colorful and compelling backdrops for a novel filled with tension and power, but Melville fails to communicate either of these except in rare moments. Coupled with this is his failure to fully develop what would have been some very interesting characters. One of those rare cases in which the movie was better than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"(...) Awesome Book Review on Moby Dick","review":"This book was a very good one. But it had alot of big and unusual words in it. They do not interdues Moby until you get half way thrue the book.The words were ity bitty. they used an accent as if you were in there country. This book was a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Novels Ever","review":"An over the top piece of work, one of the world's best novels and certainly the single best American novel. Melville points out to us what at some repressed level we all know yet won't allow to occupy our psyche's: that our world is a dangerous and mysterious place where evil masquerades as good. Melville was so far ahead of his time on so many issues like racism, the environment and slavery that it's no wonder he died broke like other tormented visionaries like Van Gogh. Melville's style makes it a tough and challenging read, no doubt, but it all works to deliver one profound and critical message after another. A must read if there is one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait to read it again!","review":"Most books I don't think i'd want to read twice but I'm definitely gonna read this book again because it was one of those books you gotta read twice to enjoy it thoroughly.

Slightly scary, I may say, especially when the average number of books this year were 13. Well, indeed some parts of the novel are simply delightful. Any reference to the cultural clash with Queequeg, or any description of the landscape, the sea, the people, were delightful. And then, in the middle -yes, encyclopaedia entries. \\"It's a bit misleading,Mr. Melville, what the h. do you want?\\". Until I had to revise it for an essay. The thing is, take all that \\"flat passages\\" again. Think of the Pequod's fate. Does it ring a bell? Ishmael, as a Cassandra, spents half the book prophetizing what will happen, and nobody seems to listen. When you read it twice, Moby Dick is simply one of the best metaphors of life. If only it weren't so tiresome..."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a novel","review":"Probably anyone who picks up this book already knows the story of the whalers against the whale, driven by Captain Ahab's obsession with killing Moby Dick. But there's a lot more in this book besides: it's a treatise on whales and whaling, it's a novel about friendship, and it gives you all the excitement of an adventure story. In some ways Moby Dick is very much a nineteenth century novel along the lines of the work of Jules Verne--it is full of lengthy asides intended to instruct the reader. Although this tendency slows the pace, it makes Moby Dick a more substantial novel than it would otherwise be, and worthy of its status as a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suberb, atmospheric book of biblical proportions.","review":"A suberb, atmospheric book of biblical proportions. It is a journey through Melvilles obsession, as well as Ahabs, and presents a robust and romantic metaphor on oligarchy and the power and influence that psychopaths in charge exert over their crew or army. Fury like Ahabs has an almost indominatable force. Men like this have lead many unwilling accomplices to their graves. If it was't a whale it would have been something else, a mountain, a country, possesion, endless wealth, the lust to usurp and dominate.I loved Melvilles rambling passages about whales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting tidbits","review":"Moby Dick is Moby Dick, and this book is filled with interesting tidbits before and also scholarly articles about Moby Dick, which is nice (even though I didn't yet read them)."},{"rating":"1","title":"2smal2read","review":"I bought this book for a friend in jail. Alas, he was unable to read it because the font was too small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"Moby Dick is an overhyped, monotonous, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual piece of crap, in other words an English lit major's wet dream. It's the absolute meaningless ramblings of a half wit, not some great intellectual masterpiece. Maybe Melville was the Justin Bieber and \\"Twin Peaks\\" of his day, talentless and meaningless but few will admit they were fooled."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the WORST book ever written","review":"I hate Moby Dick. I hate Captain Ahab. I especially hate Herman Melville for writing this novel. It was not popular when it was initially published, and I don't understand why it is popular now. This book is not a fine wine, it does not get better with age. The story is overblown, the characterizations are horrible, and it is impossible to connect in any way with what you read. Had Melville cut this book down to about 25 pages, that would be bearable. Unfortunatly, he never stopped writing, and if he were alive today, he would probably still be adding onto Moby Dick. The only people who like this book are english teachers who derive a feeling of moral superiority from forcing others to read this incredibly bad novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst classic novel I ever read","review":"I have a degree in English Education, and my son in law is an English major. I thought this book dragged on and on, was loaded with tedious detail, and was a waste of time. If it had been condensed into three short chapters, it would have been much better. I finished reading it only because I am retired and it was on my \\"classics to read\\" list. When I told my son in law that I was reading it, he told me that he could not finish it, that it was awful.If you want to read a good novel, this isn't it. I would give it 0 stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Dick\\" is a \\"bitch\\"...","review":"Moby Dick is not a fun book to read. The prose is old-fashioned, and that is partly what vitiates the pleasure (cf. Ivanhoe). Primarily, however, it is boring, plain and simple. There are endless digressions, and asides, and plot-sabbaticals. Very easy to put down. Undoubtedly an amazing intellectual feat to pull off (hence my five stars), but still...I'd estimate that 1% of high-schoolers assigned this book end up actually reading it. Can't blame them, either. To be fair, the last twenty pages, when Ahab and Starbuck have their final tete-a-tete, and Ahab famously snarls to his finned nemesis \\"From Hell's heart, I stab at thee!\\" do cause a frisson. And I don't regret reading the book...it's a great laurel to rest on, but I will never pick it up again. Eh, give 'er a go...if you finish it, you'll know that you're a man, not a boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HARD READ BUT WORTH IT IN THE END","review":"Moby Dick is one of the rare novels where I think that you should go and see the movie first before reading it. The Plot of the book becomes very hard to follow with there being over 200 hundred chapters in the book(1-10 pages long)so you should go and see the movie so you can know the plot and know what is happening so when you read it you won't get lost. Herman Melvile provides incridible details almost as if it really happen. This can make some people think the book is boring but Melvile seperates the 500 page book into over 200 small easy to read chapters so when you get bored with what Melvile talks about in one chapter you can just skip the whole chapter and not miss anything big in the book. Melvile kind of makes the book long with his details but towards the end it gets really exciting and the ending is the best you will ever read. I promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Moby Dick is the most BORING book I have ever read! I think if you made it into a short comic strip, you would have liked it. But this 550 page account called a novel? No way, man. I implore you, do NOT read this book. If it's required, then do so. But if you have other options, turn to those. We were given a list of books in English class, and I chose to read this. After a week, I was just in page 103. It was needed the next day, so I panicked and switched books, and bought War and Peace. And I finished that book in 8 hours of straight reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually unappealing","review":"I should have checked what this publishing looked like inside before I bought it. The layout is not attractive, at least to me. The Penguin edition is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hyena","review":"Sitting in a small room overlooking Mount Graylock on his farm in Pittsfield, Mass, Herman Melville was a magician. There are no words to describe the ineffable, and Moby Dick is *the* novel for anyone who has ever been on a quest; anyone who has wanted to know something that loomed just out of sight.Sure, Ahab hunts the whale...but these chapters pale in comparison to Ishmael's own quest: knowing what the whale is. He is the greatest narrator in the history of fiction. The two chapters: \\"The Whiteness of the Whale\\" and \\"Moby-Dick\\" are matchless, as are \\"The Hynea\\" and the humorous \\"Bower in the Arsicades.\\" One can envision Ishmael covered in tatoos of the whale's dimensions.Is Moby-Dick tedious? Only if you're reading it as cetology. But as allegory, it is a tale of limitless drive--even self-consuming drives.Best book ever..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate notes!","review":"I've read Moby Dick several times. I started trying to read this edition, and by Chapter 20 I switched to the Oxford edition. I've found the best way to read the book is with a heavily annotated edition, because of the amounts of reference on the surface of and buried beneath the text. This Penguin edition is so lightly annotated that it's useless. If you are a casual reader, the notes won't begin to address all the questions you will have. If you are a more serious student of the work, the notes too lightly address things that any search of the Wiki can explain FAR better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Moby Dick may seem daunting at the outset - a huge, rather difficult read - but it is an amazing novel.

This is not one of those sorts of classics. This book is a classic because it is a classic, not because it is any good. Oh, I suppose if one could get past the fact that it was written by a man being paid by the inch, you would find a story/allegory buried somewhere inside. But you would have to be extremely patient, enjoy torturing yourself, or just want to be able to say that you've read it in order to get there. It pains me to think of all the good books which were probably written around the same time which have faded into obscurity, while this dreck has become a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whale minutia","review":"Have heard for years that MOBY DICK is a great American Classic.

The characters are good, and the story is an interesting one. And I can hardly imagine more descriptive narrative regarding the whaling days of Nantucket. In fact, that is also the worst part - Melville can be a bit boring when goes to lengths about this set of sails or masts or whatever. But if you stick with it, you can pretty much picture a whaling vessel at work, which is quite an achievement. It's a piece of history preserved largely by this one man.So the story suffers a bit when he goes off on multiple chapters about the ship details, but it remains a good story. And Ahab is a fascinating character - he is surely crazy but in many ways also pretty inspiring. He is the quintessential man that won't give up..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best things in life come to those who wait","review":"Patience is a virtue; and if patience is needed to truly appreciate Melville's Moby-Dick, then virtuous am I. I admit, there were many places in this novel where I \\"just wanted to get through it\\". However, when the reader takes a step back to truly examine this work, it soon becomes an obvious masterpiece. For myself, the most interesting aspect of Melville's writing is his tendency to use Biblical characters: Ishmael, Ahab, and even the ship \\"Rachel\\" searching for her children. There are literally hundreds of links to their Biblical counterparts. This was most fascinating for me to discover. I challenge readers to see this novel as more than just a story, but rather, a work which calls for in-depth examination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moby Dick","review":"I was excited to order Moby Dick for a long camping trip west.My daughter had an assignment to read it over the summer, but shecan't read in the car without turning green.

It sounded as though he was reading it for the first time. The voice he chose to portray Ishmael was one of a drunken sea salt instead of a school teacher off on an adventure. All sense was lost of the meaning of the sentences with his arbitrary screeching and bellowing.

Despite being of prodigious length, the book is well-paced and moves along nicely except for the odd insertion mentioned above.

There were a couple of times where I just had to put the book down and go do something else.

Interesting? Not for me.Most surprisingly, I found the story to get boring once they went to sea.

I am sure many readers assume that Melville is wholly dark, sonorous, grave, and somehow \\"important.\\" There is that, of course, but on the whole I found the language of the story consistently lighthearted - even breezy at times. This narrator captured it all - the highs and lows, the humor and the pathos, plus a rich and diverse assortment of memorable characters. When I originally read the book, I eventually began to feel that finishing it, alone, would be the reward.

Problem is whale is stronger than the man and drags him into the sea.I've given away nothing. The suspense is not in not knowing what will happen, but in how Melville tells it.Readers without the patience to enjoy an active psychological drama will be bored, but try to see past the drudging of sea life and into the souls of each character.Man vs. man? Man vs. nature? Man vs. God? Hard call which this is, but it is all of those conflicts wrapped into one.I fully recommend this book.Anthony Trendl"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always wanted to read it!","review":"Very enjoyable classic. Great sea tale. Does have some long technical sections about whales that the author uses to bridge from action to action that are tedious. Just read around them if you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"IS MOBY-DICK GREAT OR TERRIBLE?","review":"Melville certainly aimed for the stars here, but what did he come up with? Certainly some of the most beautiful imagery and language since Shakespeare. But what else? A poorly drawn main character (Ahab) with whom I feel no pity whatsoever. And yet I mourn for Starbuck, Queequeg, and others. An exasperating tale - yet one worth reading in the final analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes the classics are the best choose...","review":"I think the first pages are very funny, maybe the funniest begining I've never read. At same time, it is the perfect resume of the book, a resume about \\"how to live your own life\\".Like in many other classic-books (Treauser Island of course), the author show you thinks like the walk of life (the journey on the ship, the sea) the fate (the white whale), the friendship (Quequeeeq, you have to read the first time Ismael show him), the stupid and nonsense hate (Ahab),etc... And the author do this with an accurate style, whit humour but with a complete and exact construction of the actors, the sea, the whales, the hunting,... You have to read if you like the sea, the adventures and to live your own life. I recommend this classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant Writing and Fascinating Characters","review":"MOBY DICK is a great American novel about whaling in the nineteenth century. It is a very long book which contains almost too much incidental information about whales but it is fully redeemed by its intriguing characters and realistic descriptions of whalers in action.The two main characters are Captain Ahab of the Pequod and Ishmael who is the narrator of the story. Ahab is obsessed by a desire to hunt down the giant whale Moby Dick which cost him his leg during an earlier voyage. Ishmael is an experienced young seaman who is new to whaling. The tale focuses on the Pequod's long hunt for the huge sperm whale.Melville is an elegant writer. I recommend MOBY DICK mostly for that reason. The book has so many strengths that the lengthy treatises on whales and whaling are really a small price to pay for such a worthwhile reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful action and emotion","review":"About 200 pages into the story, it is thoroughly enjoyable. The writing is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"it gets old quickly","review":"I started reading this book expecting a story about a mad man hell bent on getting revenge on the famous white whale, Moby Dick. I did get this but I also got a very strong narrative which fascinated me at first but become annoying towards the end of the book.Due to this narrative the book has over 100 chapters and it is now safe to say that I am very knowledgeable of the whale fishery.I carried on reading this book because I loved the way it was written and in turn, the way that the book made me feel. It is very dark and gothic and I wasn't surprised at the many references to Coleridge's \`Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner.'It's a book that I can say I have read but it was tough going and I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A torturous tale. Read if you like punishment.","review":"For readers of good fiction (Rushdie, Conrad, Steinbeck etc.) this outdated and outmoded novel is an arduous and pointless effort. There are many better books on sea adventure"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moby dick----- boaring or just long","review":"I personally do not like this book because it was so long. it does not have a bad story line. So i suggest that you read the younger version no matter what age you are. The only way you should read the full thing is if you really love to read, have alot of time, and like alot of boaring points. In this book there is a whale and some men. the men espesially one man was after the whale. i will not give away any names. The whale overpowerd the people all except one. the end was not that good eather. i suggest this for older people who do not have much to do. except read a long book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad narration","review":"If you care at all about this vital novel, don't purchase the audiocassette version of Moby Dick read by Burt Reynolds. I could hardly bear it after listening to the first tape. Reynolds' accents--often what come across as drunken rants--are sometimes impossible to understand, and he makes Ishmael sound like a silly old salt o' the sea. A great work brought low."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Classics Cannot Be Written Better!","review":"Beyond a questionable doubt, Moby Dick is Melville's and American History's Greatest Literary Achievement. No other novel questions our existence as living, thinking human beings better. Though true that the plot chronicles the quest of a mad captain seeking vengeance upon a beast that maimed him, the book's deeper meaning of our relations to the universe cannot be ignored or the literal magic is lost. The novel addresses themes our of souls, relationships with each other, religions, morals, and ideas with such purity and genius that no other medium but the written word can convey it so beautifully. Moby is God, Ahab is Man, Starbuck is caution and religion, Stubb is ambivalence, Queequeg: trust, Fedallah: the devil. Read it or lose out on the best thing that you ever could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be wary of who reads the audio","review":"Be sure to avoid the audio version read by Burt Reynolds. His pseudo dialect is almost beleivable, however he is way over the top emoting and blustering through the dialogue. Then he continues on in the same monotonous bombast to read the prose sections as if they were also dialogue. The problem with this is an extremely irritating sing-song pattern, combined with his squeeking, yelling, and mumbling. It lacks all respect for the dignity of Melville's prose. Buy the unabridged version read by Bill Bailey. It is not exciting, but it is not irritating and does not get in the way of Melville's prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously over rated.","review":"Man, lots of the reviews on here are pretentious, talking about all sorts of hidden messages of the book that don't exist. Herman Melville was a whaler, and wrote a very long and boring book about whaling. Seriously, this book is not an adventure. It is 540somepages of boring whaling details. I don't think half the chapters (there are about 100 some chapters, most about 2-20 pages long) are necessary to the story of the book, but are just filler about whales and whaling because the story is lame. I suppose perhaps not much happens at sea from day to day.This book is over rated, and shouldn't be as well regarded as it is. Read something fun like Dostoevsky instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tired old tale - Save the damn whales already!!!","review":"This book is HORRIBLE! Classic, my eye!

I read this book over the course of 2 days and wrote a 50 page journal on it in the same time. I hope to never read it again. No narrative drive, no interest. Symbolizism yes, but that doesn't make a book. No wonder Melville flopped as a writter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to read","review":"His writing style and sentence structure are poor.

Maybe the ending is good. Maybe Ishmael and the whale become lifelong friends and live happily ever after.I do not know because Mr. Melville wont stop rambling on and get to the POINT.There is a nice picture of a whale on the cover of my copy anyway so that rates this book as TWO STARS. The rest is mostly junk. Back to the drawing board!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic, but a medicre one.","review":"This book is supposed to be the book to end all books. All other symbolic books or classics are held up to Moby Dick and normaly receive an unflattering comparison. Hearing all this wonderful dogma, I went out to read Herman Melville's MOBY DICK. I found it dry and inconsistent.Moby Dick is a sea-faring tale by an author who adamently denied any symbolic inflection whatsoever in his book. I found it very jumpy, whereas Ishmael would divulge his thoughts on many and varied subjects such as the nature of whales. Suddenly, you find yourself a month ahead of where you thought you were. The insigts on Ahab are masterful, however, as well as the symbolism. (Melville would kill us all.) That is the only thing that saves this book.If you will take some advice from a fellow bibliophile, don't bother to read this \\"book to end all books.\\" It's not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moby Dick or the white whale","review":"I have been going back and reading some of the classics that I should have read while in school. IMO this is one of the worst written. This guy is the ultimate master of the 'run on' sentence. He seems to know all the punctuation except the period. Over uses the comma and dash way way too much. Most of the book just over describes almost every type of fish in the ocean. One of the most boring books read or written. Glad I was smart enough to skip this one in school. I should have had him in my Lit class. His writting style would have been much improved.john"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Do not read this while operating heavy machinery...","review":"Because it will put you to sleep.

Don't listen tothe powers of established academia: this book really is dull. I thinkthat people say this book is so great because they're afraid of havingan original thought. A thought like \\"this book is reallybad.\\" Yeah, the \\"symbolism\\" is so deep. As deep asthe sea. So deep that it makes me ask all the Big Questions of humanexistence.

Very dull","review":"I have to start by saying that I like long, involving novels by great authors (e.g. Tolstoi, Dickens, Hawthorne). I actually expected to love this book. Instead, the best I have to say is that I liked parts of it. The chapters focusing on Ahab are replete with drama and a gorgeous sense of tragedy-the stuff of Greek drama. Then Ishamael, as narrator, takes over and discusses the minutiae of whaling and even whale physignomy. I don't care. I simply was bored. While I can understand on an intellectual basis the way this story is structured,I have to agree with those reviewers who said the book was a mess when it came out.I have read one other work of Melville's, namely Billy Budd. I hated that too. It could be that he just isn't my cup of tea.

I particularly enjoyed the one about you have to be \\"uncouth or un-intelligent\\" if you don't like this book. Now, that's not absolutely true. It's only mostly true. For those of you that were wondering, the biblical references and the protracted prose are all parts of a much larger, grander scheme, and if you wail and knash your teeth at these alone, it just shows you didn't really understand what the book was about. If you don't try and enjoy it as both poetry and prose, you will fail miserably at enjoying it - it is an immersion completely unlike anything else. And if you spend a lot of time at it and eventually put it down without finishing, thinking it stupid, you obviously didn't try very hard to understand it.

The story is fantastic but the book itself can be so boring that you end up skimming through chapters. Give me a break, how many chapters should be devoted to the differences between the types of whales? It is an old classic though and prior to Hemmingway many writers, not all, devoted a multitude of pages describing minutia but Melville goes beyond that. He is like Dickens. I'm really happy that I saw the movie which is devoted to the story line and not the book.

For example, I bought this in 2007 and ran my company payroll through it. Now that I want to print W2 forms for 2007 I HAVE TO BUY THE 2008 UPDATE - This is BS !!

I use Steve's methods for grounding and clearing before I leave our home, or before important meetings, as well as before giving Reiki of course, and find that my mind is very calm and clear for whatever I am about to do. This book is a must-buy for any serious Reiki Healer at any level, and the next two books in Steve's Reiki Guide series, Reiki the Ultimate Guide Learn Reiki Healing with Chakras and Reiki the Ultimate Guide Learn New Reiki Aura Attunements, are even more powerful and exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a recently attuned level I practitioner, I hoped for some good, solid education on the actual practice of Reiki. Instead, more than half of Steve Murray's book concentrates on full-page photos of himself doing attunements or drawing symbols over his clients' heads. The very few actual instructions he gives are wishy-washy (do it this way, unless you want to do it another way). I did enjoy the (very short) chapter, with no photos or illustrations, on using Reiki to contact spirits.In general, I think this book is a list of very vague hints about the wonders of Reiki, each of which might be expounded on in another, and then yet another, of Mr. Murray's books or CD's or videos. I won't buy any more of them. I've found infinitely more helpful information in a Yahoo group devoted to Reiki."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"I was greatly disappointed with this book.

What an excellent massage pad ... that lasted less than one month. I then bought a second one, because this is one plush, wonderful pad, with everything you could dream of a massage pad being. Definitely the best pad I have ever bought, and I have been using these pads everyday, usually for hours at a time for chronic pain, usually Homedics, and they always lasted for months. I never even returned them even though they were still under warranty because I used them so much, that it wouldn't be honest to do so. The second one of these I bought, one of the motors quit working after one day! For this price - one month? That's just terribly awful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The late Dan Fogelberg goes progressive with the help of friend Tim Weisberg!!!","review":"What a great album from the 70's!!! A totally different album from the late Dan Fogelberg,actually his first collaborative effort,as flute player Tim Weisberg gets second billing!!! Lots of great styles of music on this one,as a lot of it is instrumental,Includes the now classic The Power of Gold(great lead guitar solo by Fogelberg as well great flute playing by Weisberg!),as well as a awesome rendtition of the Hollies Tell Me To My Face,and don't forget Twins Theme/Intimidation,and the other great songs that round off this classic album!!! This isn't your run of the mill Dan Fogelberg album!!! Great spin!!! Two thumbs up!!!

It was written in 1978, however it has a timeless quality to it...beautiful melodies and instrumentals along with 3 songs containing profound lyrics.

The Power Of Gold -- 3 Stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Muzak?","review":"Some of the instrumental pieces on this album would sound natural floating through the speakers of a hotel lift. They are rather pretentiously titled, and not much more than pleasant tunes. Tim Weisberg's flute only adds to that impression. But if you're a fan of the flute, you may disagree. To me, it gives this a very \`seventies' feel. Quite fun though, if you're in the mood. Dan does put vocals on a few tracks, most notably the rather overdone and fairly unoriginal \`Power of Gold'. Best stuff on the album is when Dan covers songs from the sixties and does a nice job. This album is the more appealing twin of the more recent \`No Resemblance Whatsoever'."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major snoozefest","review":"This is nothing but glorified muzak, perfect for the elevator and/or dentist office.There is a superb cover of Judy Collins' \\"Since You Asked,\\" and an admitedly catchy number in \\"The Power of Gold\\" but the rest of this is nothing more than a insomnia cure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faux Jazz Lite","review":"\\"Twin Sons of Different Mothers\\" is little more than faux jazz lite -- easy listening for those who think they are hip, but just can't bring themselves to listen to the real deal. If you are new to Fogelberg pass this one by in favor of \\"The Innocent Age\\" which is a much better display of his songwriting talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Break away from the ordinary boundaries","review":"I first heard this album in the summer of '78. I thought it was unusual to hear, of all things, a jazz flute? Anyway, this album is one of many which proves the talent and versatility of Dan Fogelberg. It's a shame that when we see \\"Best Of\\" and \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums that they only contain the old, worn out top 40 hits of the past- not that they aren't and weren't good, but if you have never heard some of the lesser known compositions of Dan Fogelberg, i dare say you have no idea of how fluently poetic and lovely some of those works are. Anyway, back to this album- Tim Weisberg and Dan Fogelberg blend together so well that it sounds like two old friends having a good time. It works because of the versatility and talent of Dan Fogelberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ageless","review":"I had a Grand Torino Sport 1972, fully loaded Jamin stereo and listened to this when I was 17 and trippen... now?

A fearless protagonist pits himself against the cutthroat world of a law firm where he must sort out friends from enemies - and we are there every step of the way!

The opening scene of the protagonist finding his naked boss dead at HIS desk hooked me. The story events were as well-paced with mounting tension as any of the long-established writers of legal thrillers. I've never been to New York, but believed the place and people Keeley introduced to me.

I read \\"Mahogany Row\\" & I will tell you this....John Grisham can rest easy. This is one book that you may judge by it's poorly designed cover. The story is like something you'd see as a movie of the week on some obscure television station...but bad. What the book lacks in content it makes up for in...pages....with words. What troubles me is that despite the quality of this book, somehow I felt that the author is actually a very intelligent person. Keeley shouldn't give up writing....he should just learn more about it.

I don't get how she could've not only made it as a \\"designer\\" but also managed to get on TV with her own show. What? I have to admit that whenever her show is on pbs, I watch it just to see her outlandish, impractical, and rather ugly craft ideas... such as wrapping men's shirts around vases and tying them w/ ribbon!? Spreading dry coffee grounds into a baking dish full of water, stirring it around, and then dipping the bottom of a glass into it--then using it to \\"print\\" circles onto craft paper to create a table covering?! First of all, the technique didn't work and looked like a dirty, coffee cup stained piece of paper---so ugly, I'm sorry. There's always something SO bizarre and weird on her show-- which is what compells me to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melissa in Bakersfield","review":"I AM A BIG FAN OF KATIE BROWN SO WHEN SHE CAME OUT WITH HER FIRST BOOK, I BOUGHT IT EVEN THOUGH I WAS NOT REALLY INTO MOST OF HER ENTERTAINING IDEAS. WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT HER DECORATING BOOK, I WAS EXCITED TO SEE WHAT SHE HAD COME UP WITH. WELL, I WAS COMPLETED DISAPPOINTED BY IT. I PUT THE BOOK BACK ON THE SHELF AND A FEW DAYS LATER, I CHECKED IT OUT JUST TO GIVE HER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND MAYBE SEE IF IT WAS REALLY THAT BAD. WELL, NOTHING CHANGED. I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW COMPLETELY OUTLANDISH THE MAJORITY OD HER IDEAS WERE. I WOULDN'T DECORATE MY GARAGE WITH SOME THOSE IDEAS.

But, this book was really disappointing. Full of ideas that are overly trendy and that I would quickly tire of, if I even liked any of them enough to attempt them. Somehow her personal style is not translating well to her books. Is her publisher encouraging her to aim for a less sophisticated look?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Katie Brown Letdown","review":"As a huge Katie Brown fan, I was disappointed with this book. As a truly eclectic decorator, I am open to any possible source for design...scrap yard, junk yard, garden, etc. But, come on, a coffee table with a base made of coiled up garden hoses? A hard-cast clay sandcastle? Not to be totally negative, a few crafts, and that's what this book majors in, are cool. The corseted pillow, for instance, or the bright lights, big city illuminated table. This book is a good choice for newlyweds or students, first-time apartment dwellers on tight budgets. And for truly hip urban cats, I would recommend Pad: The Guide to Ultra Living. If we could give half marks, I would give this book two and a half stars for effort.

Since Samir discusses how the sale of Mother Earth News and its decay thereafter, the interview with Shuttleworth should be enormously helpful to the entrepreneur dreaming of publishing a magazine.Still, this book is one of three I will keep stocked on my reference shelf in the event that I launch a magazine.The book is an excellent companion to How To Start A Magazine by James Kobak and to Starting & Running A Successful Newsletter or Magazine by Cheryl Woodard."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much help","review":"I was looking for info on step by step diagnostics of sensors.

I would like to add that I read this book shortly before a visit to Burma nearly 2 years ago. The insights gained, both political and cultural, were extremely helpful to me during the visit.One of our guides, herself a Shan, was well educated but unaware of this book and expressed a great interest in reading it but I had not carried it with me.

These live sessions, are pristine in compare with the Mosaic live set (that is important but only for those who have it all). If you play some instrument, you could learn from these live recordings and even develop your own individual style. I have been there. First, I just listened. Than, I started playing some of his tunes-compositions. I am still in the process of learning. You probably need a lifetime to study Parker's music in depth. On the other hand, you could just sit back and enjoy some fast, bluesy, sophisticated and lively playing: The watermark of a real musical genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"great music -terrible editing","review":"I strongly support the 3-star review. This set is not the good source to listen to these broadcasts. Orrin Keepnews has deleted many announcement bits, but what is worst, many announcement bits where Bird played behind Symphony Sid.All of this to include the 1947 Carnegie Hall concert, which is in plenty of other issues, and four 1950 tracks which don't represent the complete session, just arbitrarily the small segment acquired by Savoy in the 1970s. The complete 1950 session is also to be found somewhere else.The Japanese version of the Royal Roost material is fine but hard to get. A new one in a 4CD box devoted exclusively to the complete Royal Roost performances and including various truly appropriate bonus sessions surpasses it and has just recently appeared in Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent story of a girl fighing for her rights","review":"When I first read this book, I had just finished touring the Holocaust Museum in Wash.

It is the first book I have seen with somewhat detailed descriptions of non-US forces which served with the UN. While it doesn't really tell a story or elaborate on the personalities involved, it fills in a lot of the little details many books about this early Cold War conflict overlook or neglect.

They are old recordings, early versions of some of their best.Exceptions to this are \\"Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone\\", \\"Jersey Bounce\\", and \\"Woodchopper's Ball\\", which are not too shabby in quality and energy. Dorsey's \\"Tiger Rag\\" is also not bad, but not of the greatest recording quality.\\"Chatanooga Choo Choo\\" is the standard Miller hit which is available anywhere with better quality.

Reproduced from a live recording in 1979, the remastering alows for studio sound while retaining the dramatic intensity found mainly in a live performance. Special mention must be made of the prayer in Act I \\"Spirito creator su lui discendi\\". The soloists in this recording may not be as familiar as Domingo, Marton, etc. However, they bring this unjustly forgotten opera to life in a special way.

Set in a time (early 1970's) and place (Key West) that many consider to be the \\"real Florida\\" (i.e., Paradise Lost), this film is a funky classic that captures the essence of tarpon fishing on the fly. The cinematography is magnificent and the main characters include three of the top American literary talents of the late twentieth century all of whom share a sense of the quasi-religous experience that is tarpon on the fly.

Aud Torvingen doesn't appear to just murder an abuser, she tortures him to death.The second premise is that people involved in child abuse (and the foster family fit that category) can be left in charge of a child.An intriguing moral dilemma for the reader would be whether Aud is capable of making sound moral decisions by the end of the novel. Unfortunately Stay is not that kind of novel. Aud is always right, even when she's committing a murder. So in her universe there are no grey areas, only stark black and white divisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"A detective story with a lead charcter who rocks!

I admired her first heartshattering, atmospheric, and highly resonant tragic novel, \\"The Blue Place,\\" starring this same lead detective character. That novel has the palpable sense of impending doom and unavoidable, inevitable destiny from the very beginning and this wished-for follow-up of Aud's state of emotional and mental health is pure prose poetry of being in the state of grief. I could identify. The 'mystery' novel part of it is negligible, a McGuffin, it's not about that, just as the first novel really wasn't either. The dead lover is so present in her thoughts and heart that it almost reads like a ghost story at times. Aud is not a great detective by any means, but she is a woman of action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin Robinson CD excellent much as his live performance","review":"Justin Robinson is a rare and extremely talented jewel among sax men.

About Aurelio Baldor he is the Cuban origins no Indian or from the Middle East. He was a lawyer and mathematician during the Cuban revolution. He died in 1978 and his family now lives in Florida.

So, if when you take the CD out and put it in your stereo with the volume up high, don't come cryin' to me that your ears hurt. Just because they're loud doesn't make them good, but the extremely creative writing that Prokofiev has with the Muti-Philadelphia combo makes this the greatest recording. There is no doubt, no other brass section has the muscle to master Muti's ambition. These pieces showcase the trombones especially, and when you have Glenn Dodson, Joe Alessi, and Charlie Vernon, you know they will be heard. But never fear, they don't sound bad in any way shape or form, it's that this will probably be the loudest thing that you will ever hear. They and Muti bring out the Russian in Prokofiev and the tragicness in Shakespearre and you don't want to pass this up before there are no more copies of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"too large","review":"Much too large!

Haven't heard much Sublime so I guess they're next.The peak of this album is the fantastic usage of F.Zappa's \\"I'm the Slime\\" on Luke, that by itself is a cool song but with a little help from the slime is a masterpiece.Nicely sung, playfully played using many instruments (which I for one love) and rapped with a cool that noone will resist.Some of the solos is a bit out of place, where the song'd be better off without. But, it's a great album and I'll bring it to the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome album","review":"When you buy this, don't expect quite the same as Sublime, but it's still awesome in its own right. Some songs are remniscent of Sublime but there's a lot more dub and reggae. I can't say the singer is quite as good as Bradley but he's still quite good and I love listening to this album on my ipod. It's worth the money just for \\"Sunny Hours,\\" \\"Listen to DJ's,\\" and \\"Lonely End\\" but the other songs are awesome too and this CD is a hell of a lot better than 99% of the crap they play on the radio. This is one of my newest favorite bands in its own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars at best","review":"The Long Beach Dub Allstars had a fabulous first album, Right Back. That cd had sick reggae and dub right from the heart. Wonders of the World seems contrived to me, and I blame the producer David Leary of the butthole surfers. He produced sublime's self-titled which was as we all agree a great album. However I would guess that Brad Nowell was more at the helm of producing in that session then the Allstars were for Wonders of the World. Wonders of the World has a similar sound to the sublime self-titled album and right back seems separated from it. Basically what I am saying is that Right Back is a great album and follows up for sublime, whereas Wonders of the World is cheap and plastic and I am honestly bummed and disappointed and I don't really know what went wrong with this recording it really [isn't good], buy right back it is really really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get over it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Ok, im really gettin pissed after readin theze reviewz.

I hadn't listened to a Julie Wilson recording for many years and I purchased this one believing that she would be as enjoyable as she was when first I heard her. Either my tastes have changed, or Julie has.She hams her way through this familiar stuff as if she doesn't know what the lyric is about. It isn't that her voice is bad, it's just to much voice for Cole Porter's music. Her reading of \\"Most Gentlemen Don't Like Love\\" is an example of the over-acting that is evident in every selection on this CD.

Ready to head somewhere else and get new set.Features that are breaking our back:1) Unreliable caller ID- usually \\"no data\\" or \\"incomplete data\\"2) Backlights come on for no reason, many times per day, can't have this in our bedroom or a glowing blue light will come on many times of night, from the phone3) Wireless internet DOES get disconnected sometimes when the phone rings (so how is this DECT supposed to help us?)This is enough- we've given it a good try and ready to move back to 5.8ghz with maybe Panasonic or AT&T;."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Sound Quality on Any Phone I have Ever Owned","review":"We purchased this phone explicitly because we wanted a system that would not interfere with our computer wireless system. Well, I have to admit that feature works fine. On the other hand, and certainly more important for any phone, the sound quality is simply horrible. Callers have to repeat what they have said because the audio is so clipped and muddled. The problem is not our wiring - other cordless phones work just fine. Save your money - this system is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's fine unless you want to hear!","review":"We've owned, or should I say, suffered with this phone for more than a year.

Disappointing purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for DECT, poor display and Caller ID","review":"I got one at the local Circuit City, as the only DECT phone w/o an answering machine I could find.I agree with other reviewers: this is a marginal phone. The LCD blue-on-blue is very hard to read from a distance or an angle. The phone works fine, but the Caller ID on the remote handsets is very unreliable. It displays \\"INCOMPLETE DATA\\" about 70% of the time. I called tech support, getting the usual clueless Indian who worked from a script. I tried resetting the phones by disconnecting the battery, returning to factory defaults, and disconnected every other phone. Same result.Sorry, Circuit City, this one goes back; Caller ID and readability are too important to me. I should have come to Amazon first and read the reviews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1980's-Style Memory Feature","review":"I thought this would be nice phone that had the features I wanted, without a raft of useless \\"features\\" that would get in my way. That was true--the phone works quite well in almost all respects. It has one serious design flaw however: it can remember up to 50 phone numbers for you, but you have to manually store each of them in a numbered memory location. Want to call \\"Jane\\"? You have to either remember which memory number you stored her phone number in (was it #29? or #16?), or you have to scroll through all the memories in memory number order (NOT alphabetical order). Want to store a new number? First you have to scroll through all the memory locations to find a vacant one to store the new number in.Come on, GE, I haven't seen a phone that worked this way in decades!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No more running","review":"I bought the set of two telephones and completed it with a single one.I placed one in every part of the house, we run a home business, so I don't have to run anymore to catch the phone. It's easy to work with.I also like the nice model and color. A little flaw is the fact that the Caller ID doesn't work all the time, even not when it works on the basis phone to which the basis station of this product is connected. I found that a little odd, maybe the numbers have to be in the system first to be shown a second time?What I do like is the fact that I can push a \\"do not disturb\\" button to have all the phones silenced at once. This comes in handy since we also work internationally and this way we will not be disturbed in the middle of the night. There the answering machine of our basis line will take over. Although there are a lot of options, I still didn't use of all of them but I'm sure I will do so shortly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tinny, too lightweight, too hard to see & it doesn't work","review":"Went in to the local big box electronics store armed with my consumer magazine ratings to buy a digital phone for my land line and saw this model with multiple handsets. Although not shown on my ratings, this DECT 1.9GHz model from GE caught my attention and the packaging box displayed the exact feature list I was looking for.After charging the batteries for sixteen hours, I began programming the phone with a minimum set of numbers to test. I could not get it to answer a call from my cell phone on either handset with any audible ringtone. Called tech support which advised me to turn off my household Wi-Fi (Isn't this what a DECT phone is for?). I did, and the same non-response. I returned this phone today and will choose one that is on the consumer magazine rating list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compared several phones - GE's audio very poor","review":"I wanted a phone with the following features:- didn't interfere with home WiFi network- had a headset jack on the handset- had a mute button- had an answering machine- could keep good quality while roaming 1 or 2 rooms awayI tried two sets of GE 6.0 phones, and both suffered from faint, tinny, clipped audio. Words that were perfectly understandable on other phones were simply not there on this one. Also, the buttons aren't actually lit - the light is a ring around each button, but not the button itself. So it actually makes it HARDER to read individual buttons in a darkened room.I was very disappointed in this phone.Of those I tried: GE, Uniden, Panasonic and AT&T;, the Panasonic was the best. All features work, Panasonic audio is good, and the buttons and beeps are nice and responsive. Only complaint about the Panasonic is that there is no display on the base unit to show how many answering machine messages are waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I'm returning my phone immediately.

Shame on you G.E. for putting out such a terrible product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with WiFi","review":"Similar to the comments above, we purchased this phone as we switched from Voip back to a standard land line. Only problem is, there is no audible ringtone for incoming calls. Called GE support and they mentioned to disconnect the phone and try connecting it again. GE said sometimes there are interference issues with VoIP systems, which I no longer have. After \\"rebooting\\" the phone...still no ringtone. GE Support suggested I return the phone, which is exactly what I'm going to do.

Maybe a bit less rocking than some of his efforts, and missing most of the Heartbreakers, Highway Companion remains a album you (and your kids if you have any) will enjoy.

Great CD, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually 2 1/2 stars","review":"This is rehashed music. It's as if Petty needed to record to make some money. Many of the songs are very similar to earlier releases. Some of the riffs are similar. I guess there's nothing wrong with that. But, it's more of a different version of an earlier song. Jeff Lynne's contribution is as expected. He puts in the fillers and keeps the songs linked together. There's not much here though. I love Petty. To me, the last two releases have fallen a bit short. I bought both. Couldn't resist ever buying a Petty release. The production of Jeff Lynne had me anticipating greatness. But, there is no greatness here.

Well what shall i say, i fell for it and ordered it online. Now!!! being a tom petty fan i took the trouble getting it before anybody else here in india, because it takes ages for new albums to get here. Result - Alas! the task at hand was that of trying to finish listening to all the 12 tracks and then chuck it down into the Cellar. I was waiting on track after track expecting something better to come up But was immenseley discontented. Saving grace! seems to be the only grace on the whole album. I feel some of the tracks were improvised straight lifts from his previous heartbreakers ventures. This record is going to Catch dust in the cellar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like fine wine","review":"Like fine wine Tom Petty keeps getting better and better with age. He's also mellowed quite a bit as well. Gone is the hard edge that once had him thought of as New Wave or even punk. He's now settled into a nice folk/rock/country blend that still works. His skills with a phrase have never gone away and the dripping with emotion voice still remains.Highlights of the CD include the radio played Saving Grace (with it's nod to believe it or not ZZ Top's LaGrange) and Big Weekend (sounds like a Traveling Wilbury's tune). There are others though that deserve a listen like Flirting with Time (with a kind of almost Everly Bros. feel) Down South (with great lyrics about going home) and Ankle Deep (just a fun little song). It's not for everyone. Like many of his albums, there are misses but usually his fans find his misses fun enough to listen to. If you're a fan you probably already have this, if you kind of like Petty go out and get it. If you were never a fan, this probably isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete masterpiece for Tom","review":"This is one the best new releases from an old rocker in years!

See, things that are timeless are stuck in every decade, thank goodness.Highway Companion is beautiful. Simply beautiful. The lyrics, melodies, and prouction are timeless. Lynne creates a sound that doesn't sound like 70's Petty, but that is OK. Harrison's Brainwashed allowed Lynne to calm down a tad, and he now uses his pure talent to make good sound great.Petty and Lynne are a winning combo. Bravo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treading water at best","review":"I listened to this album and I don't understand how people can say this stands with Tom Petty's best work. Same chord progressions, middling to plodding tempos - the whole thing sounds tired and vacnt of any new ideas musically and lyrically. I am a fan of Tom Petty, have seen him live, and was really diappointed in this album. I expected more - maybe a little fire to go with these new insights. No song is really bad nor is any song really good. There's a sameness to each song which causes the whole album to seem boring.

He hasn't really made a great rock album since Full Moon Fever. The first track, \\"Saving Grace\\" is classic Petty. The rest of the disc is pretty much a melancholy, introspective album and the last 4 tracks are complete throwaways. I still love TP to death and his live shows are not to be missed. But I just prefer to hear Rock and not this toned down, Dylan imitation. It took me a while before I developed a fondness for \\"Wildflowers\\". Maybe the same will happen for this disc but I've listened to it 6 or 7 times now and I really don't have a desire for repeat listening. I guess Tom is following in the steps of Clapton. Age mellows a person and maybe Tom is just writing songs that reflect where he's at in life. I miss the Tom Petty I grew up with!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious Rip Off!!!!","review":"Record companies can't figure out why people get music online and don't want to pay money for the CDs?

I own ALL of Petty's album, and this type of BS is what he was singing about when you listen to his album \\"The Last DJ\\". The record companies are trying to get people to actually buy albums, but then they want to d!ck around with everyone. I'm sure that if they would have released this on the SAME day that they released the regular edition, the hardcore fans & collectors would have bought it... but NO... they wait over 2 months until the regular edition is out to put out one with 4 BONUS tracks, so the hardcore fan and/or collector will have to buy a 2nd copy of the album to get the 4 extra tracks.I gave this item 1 star because it is a RIP OFF... but otherwise, Tom Petty is always a 5 star musician, and this is one of his best albums!

But when have record companies ever been so thoughtful? I'll just look for these elsewhere, and if I don't get them, oh well. The original CD can be had for around $12 and is a 4 star CD. This rip off amounts to $18 ($26 list!) for 4 songs! They know this is marketed towrds Tom Petty fans, and what fan hasn't already bought the CD? And who cares about leather packages and postcards! May the record company enjoy it's ride down the tubes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smitten","review":"I love this CD. I was singing along to \\"Flirting with Time\\" and \\"Down South\\" the first time through. After a few days I was completely smitten with the first four songs (still am) and had developed an appreciation for the rest of them. Now, a few weeks later, just about any one of them can be found bouncing around in my head at any given time. \\"Flirting with Time\\" is my favourite though.I've got all Tom's albums and I love most of them but here's what I think Highway Companion has going for it: creative and stirring lyrics, a theme (time passing) that nearly everyone can relate to, choruses that draw you in and demand you sing along, Tom's wonderful and familiar voice in excellent form, and a silky-smooth musical sound. These elements combine to create a feeling that even though time is passing everything is as it should be and it's all ok.It's a gift and I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice companion, but...","review":"Five quick points:First--Tom Petty fan from way back.Second--this is his best album in years.Third--most tunes are solid, while ALL the lyrics are.Fourth--BUT...there is a certain monotony to many of the vocals and arrangements. TP said he didn't work very hard on this album, and it shows in the production and execution. Maybe working a little harder, getting more nuance in his vocals and guitars, using something besides a slide guitar for the lead of almost all of the songs -- you get the idea.Fifth--Now that he's got his middle-age funk out of his system, it's time to get back to ROCKIN' with the Heartbreakers. Let's face it: how many people come to their sold-out shows to hear ballads? They come to ROCK and PARTY, and nobody does it better than TPHB. I'm dying for MELINDA, BLACK LEATHER WOMAN, and any other rockin' tunes he's got up his sleeve to COME OUT ON AN ALBUM!! Time to KICK OUT THE JAM.

I don't like the style of writing or lyrics in this album. Besides 2 songs, maybe 3, you have to try to think to hard to understand the meaning of the songs.

I'd decided where I wanted the author to go and had a quiet tantrum when he didn't. I guess I've just got to grow up.The more I thought about this book, the more I liked it. The characters were rich, in the sort of intentionally caricaturish way of Sinclair's Babbitt. And although our lead character sometimes kicked on his line like a tuna at sea, the reel drew steadily in through his superficial, plastic world to a thought-provoking conclusion.I guess the author thought a few of the dangling things he opened the story with weren't necessary for the flavor of the finish.

A surreal, at times mystical, revelation of modern times. A man witnesses his growing helplessness within the framework of a society which not only fails to discover his \\"illness,\\" but is smug, self-satisfied, and all but divorced from their own humanity. Lightman's visual portrayals and his incredibly delicate imagery are profound indications of his sensitivity to the dehumanizing influences that surround us. He has no quick fixes, even though in one passage his character, Bill Chalmers, strikes out at the crass materialism which tempts his teen-age son. This is far from being an unrealized novel--it is most certainly one of the most honest and cogent portraits of our society that I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very puzzled...","review":"I was extremely bored by this book and had to make serious efforts to finish it.

Why am I puzzled? Well, what was the message of this book? It made absolutely no sense to me, and I couldn't find any cohesion whatsoever. I could understand the e-mail and chat passages, as well as the Socrates story, but what did one have to do with the other? Or with Bill's illness/problem/poisoning/whatever-that-was?

But Lightman really let me down with this last book. The charm and joy in his previous conceptual and intellectual play is completely lacking. The joyful scientist has become a modern cynic and this I could have certainly lived without. There is no joy in \\"The Diagnosis\\" and if Lightman's statement in this work has any accuracy on the current state of the modern world, then by his own premise the book should have remained unwritten.

If you are looking for a good summer read, this is NOT it. While the author's observations regarding today's fast-paced, technology dependant society are amusing at first, they quickly grow tiresome and boring.

The whole album is full of handclaps and beats that are almost the same, vocals are really annoying and boring. And the so-called \\"punk attitude\\" is sooooo fake. Trust me, there are hundreds of better records in this kind of mood (pretended mood) For example: Adult, Miss Kittin, Mount Sims, Tiga, etc, etc, and a very long etcetera.

Peaches is the rawer of the two, but it's very entertaining. Not as melodic as some works, this has attitude to spare, and strikes me as one of the better synthesis of punk and synths. The Enhanced version also has a very dark remake of Berlin's \\"Sex (I'm a. .)\\", that works very well. The enclosed video on disc 2 also two videos of \\"Set it off\\", both with a lot of style and attitude. I'm enjoying the disc. It has a very \\"live\\" feel to it, and it's about as raw as I've heard synths used, while still maintaining a sense of the \\"song\\" vs. just noise and chaos."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO WAY!","review":"Don't believe the hype!!!! this is mediocre!

I purchased a much more expensive J&M mike which picks up nothing that is farther away then about 1/8 inch. Garmin could have said in their write up for it not to be used with motorcycles.

The wire is easy enough to conceal down the pillar and the Garmin mount has a mic input (my 760 does anyway) so you don't have to plug it into the GPS itself.It comes with various mounting methods. The only weakness is that the ball & socket which holds the mic to the mounting clip is easy to pop loose.I strongly recommend this if you really want to use your phone hands free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work in my vehicle","review":"This mic works but almost everyone I talked to said it sounded worse than using the built in mic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound quality","review":"This product is great for the hands free cell phone user.

I took the product number from Garmin's web site and searched for it at Amazon, my favorite on line store. It became available from a supplier using Amazon, so I ordered it. The price was very reasonable. Only problem, when I went to use it the jack was not the right size for MY Nuvi, which amazed me since the item I selected was an accessory for MY Nuvi, suggested by Garmin (someone there needs to test what they offer to see if it works right I guess). So I trucked over to Radio Shack and got an adaptor to make it fit and it worked perfect! Looks funny with the adaptor, and the Nuvi won't close with it plugged in, but at least I can replace the terrible built in mic with a real one.

Do yourself a huge favor and save some money in the bargain.... Bluetooth in the Garmin 765T is NON-FUNCTIONAL, in every profound way. I was unable to carry on cellphone conversations and got bad reports from everyone I tried to talk to. They said the audio was distorted and I was \\"in and out\\". Sooooooooo, I bought the Garmin external microphone, hoping to solve the problem.... It too proved to be a waste of money and is of no benefit, whatever.

There are a plethora of 'end of chapter' problems with derivations & applications to solve. The book is going to be confusing and tedious, even for computationally trained neuroscientists. For me, this book is a reference only. The format is similar to Thomas Weiss' Cellular Biophysics 2 Volume Set.

Brecker really nails this one, and the rhythm section's in the groove.I always liked Song for Bilbao, it's great to hear with the sax playing the head.Around when this came out, I felt a few of Brecker's recent efforts were just ok. With Tales, he puts together a CD I would rank with the very best of his jazz performances.It's a well done production, and I like the flow from beginning to end.

As such, his distaste at the moral ambiguity of the Cold War and post-Cold War conflicts comes through in his novels, as it does in Mamista. However, morally ambiguous plots do not have to leave the reader wildly groping for closure, as this one does.All too often, one sees movies that start well and then struggle to end well. That perfectly describes this book. What a waste. What a pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deighton can write good books; this is not one of them","review":"This book was a huge disappointment in every respect. The characters were very promising, but the story went absolutely nowhere.

If you're planning a career in Mathematics or Physics, this book is probably necessary to your education, but unless you're truly brilliant, don't be surprised if you need qualified instruction to understand it.

The vitally important (1956) fifth appendix is missing, as is the earlier 4th appendix. The reason for this is obvious. Penguin have merely re-published that part of the real thing which is now already more than 70 years old, and, therefore, out of copyright.Even the quality of the employed paper is at, or below, newspaper standard.

It suffers from numerous spelling and typographical errors, but more importantly, the equations and diagrams are atrocious! I believe they scanned all tables, equations, and images, and then enlarged them. The images are all blurry and poorly printed. Some of the equations are unreadable because the parenthesis or square root signs are so blurred.Unfortunately (as other reviewers have pointed out), Amazon lumps all reviews for a work together, even for different printings. I'm convinced that the 5 stars for this book wouldn't be showing up for this specific printing. I encourage you to be sure what you are buying, and to preview the book first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't already know the theory, don't bother...","review":"I hate to be the only one to not give the book \\"5 stars\\", but this is simply not the best book to buy if you want to learn the theory of relativity. The book is certainly worthwhile if you want something simply because it was written by Einstein, but God bless him, the old guy just couldn't put the idea accross as well as many modern authors. Maybe something is just lost in the translation, I don't know..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come back later","review":"Even though this book is marketed (and meant) as an accessible exposition of relativity theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not as easy to read as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than high-school knowledge of the relevant subjects. Maybe this was true in his time, but nowadays the book demands way more than that. I'm myself a grad student in the field of literature and I simply couldn't follow the presumably basic mathematical demonstrations Einstein relies upon to make his points. Some concepts are also less than obvious for the non-specialist ('galilean coordinates'?). This is not to say that the book itself is not good, but that it is targeted at a readership which is not necessarily trained enough to benefit from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly OCR'ed copy with no indications of which of the many editions this was copied from","review":"As I understand it Einstein updated this book many times, but there is nothing that indicates which edition this is. The multiple scanning errors make one suspicious of how closely the text adheres to any of the original editions.I'm returning this one and looking for a real edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why translators need to understand what they are translating","review":"It's great that Dodo press produces out of print material, but really! I counted 25 serious errors in the formulas in the first two-thirds of the book. Most of them come from the substitution of a I for a 1, which is this context is confusing. Subscripts which I cannot illustrate here, move up to get mixed with exponents and \\"minuses\\" are indistinguishable and mixed up with \\"dots\\" meaning multiply. The spelling is atrocious with multiple misspelling but when a mathematical \\"shell\\" gets translated as a \\"mollusc\\"....yes, literally, really and repetitively, then it is time to get a translator that has some idea of what he is translating. One of the greatest works in human history should be treated better than this.John Riedl"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master never fails","review":"This book is probably the best place to start in understanding the theory that revolutionized science. It is lucid enough for practically anyone to understand. I should know, I'm still in junior high school and I understand it. Einstein conveyed the nature of his own genius into a prose that clearly explained nearly all there is to know on the basis of modern physics. The Cosmological Supplement was, in my opinion, the most interesting part. Natural science is an amazing branch of knowledge and some even say that physics is defined as the only true science. I reccommend this book to all readers who are interested in Einstein's work and even those who don't have a clue. It is all just basic science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad printing","review":"I have an old copy of this book with different publisher and would like to buy a new copy as a gift for my brother. When I got the book, I am so disappointed with its printing quality. The font sizes are different in different pages, and some of the lines in the letters are just not visible. Instead of giving my brother the new book, I would rather giving my copy even though I has already written all over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro even for non-science types","review":"I believe in reading primary source material. You can't get much closer to the source of the theory of relativity! My high school math and science classes did help me through this book.I like it because it's not my normal subject matter. Einstein helped me think out of the box in terms of how things in the world (and universe) relate. Even though I won't remember all (or any) of the equations, I'll definitely remember his wonderful word pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relativity the special and general theory","review":"I have reas this several times to be sure I understand the theory It is good exercise for the brain"},{"rating":"1","title":"Relativity as explained by Einstein","review":"Languge used to explain his case difficult to understand in the extreme.

A different edition would probably be a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful which copy you buy","review":"Do not buy the copy of this book with ISBN 978-1452841212 !!! You have been warned! The equations which are set out as images (ie any that require more than simple typesetting) have not been printed, and the text just shows the file name instead eg. eq1.gif.

Stine","review":"Night Games never reached any great heights and I don't think many readers will be satisfied with the weak ending of what was a very predictable novel and not at all the high quality of the majority of Stine's work.In Night Games a gang of kids run into a former friend they haven't seen for a year. He invites them to accompany him on his night games of vandalism and terrifying locals. Being losers these kids readily agree. They all hate their math teacher Mr Crowell so target him for frequent night games, justifying it as vengeance for the way he treats them. Diane the main narrator of the story starts to question if Cromwell deserves the increasing severity of their tormenting until too late she realises just how deadly serious some of the gang want vengeance.Read one of Stine's other books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible characters...","review":"The characters are so dull and come off as unsympathetic. The plot of the book is fine. However, it's not one of R.L. Stine's best.

Its good to see that some bands are finnaly realizing this. THis badns great. My fav tracks are WHisper and Movies. You should run out and get this CD. It would ahve gotten five stars if not for the fact that Michael Jackson [is in it]."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good CD","review":"Alien Ant Farm is a very good CD. It has a good sound and a good everything else too. It is a good first cd for the band and I think that it will become a very popular band in the future. I was really impressed by smooth criminal. It is a very good song and there are only a few tracks that I skip. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think that it's missing something.

So I went to one of those stores and searched for some cool music to listen on my laptop...maybe even on the plane...so I picked up Alien Ant Farm, which there'd been lots of talking because of the song Smooth Criminal.Me as a heavy rock fan think this album is not listenable. Annoying chorus just make it impossible to like this album. Maybe it's something for people who like this kind of happy-rock music. In my opinion this album is very weak and cannot create anything that sounds good...maybe in the cover Smooth Criminal, but that's pretty much it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smooth, But Not Smooth Enough","review":"Alien Ant Farm! They're awesome right? Well I beg to differ. Although there cover of smooth criminal is some good music. The rest of the CD is well let's just say not good.

Anyway if you like smooth criminal buy the single and not this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excuse me, where can i find the nearest alien ant farm?","review":"alien ant farm does bear a striking resemblance to fellow rockers papa roach. reminiscent of the infest album, it was that hard striking guitar sound of 'smooth criminal\\" that drove me to the cd store. however, anthology does not dare to compare to roach's bestselling infest. Don't get me wrong; the cd itself is pretty good stuff and it would be unfair to review it based on how it compares to Roach. some tracks have a punk type feel and others have a light metal sound alot like incubus. basically, if u like incubus and most importantly if u like Roach,then this cd is right up your ally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth criminal !!!","review":"This Album rules.Befor I bought it I heard a lot of bad reviews. But those people heard smooth criminal and thought the rest of the album would be like that. But its not. Its got catchy tunes and depressing lyrics, such as in Death Day. My 3 favourite songs are, Death day, Attidude and smooth criminal. If you like Staind, you'll love these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Song Writing","review":"You know I see a lot of bad reviews on this CD. I really like it. I heard about them through Smooth Criminal but the rest of the CD shows a band with lots of potential. I find that most people I meet dislike about anything good. Look at my wide range of musical interests and tell me if I do not have good taste in music. I also recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but more morbid than you'd think","review":"Let me begin by saying that I love \\"ANThology\\", and think it's one of the best albums of the year.With that out of the way, one needs to be aware that the content of these songs is a lot more depressing than \\"Smooth Criminal\\" and the band's antics would lead you to believe. Don't get me wrong, I love it, but when you realize that their two singles (\\"Movies\\" and \\"Smooth Criminal\\"), which about breaking up and a grisly murder, respectively, are the two most upbeat songs on the album, one can easily imagine feeling uneasy about the rest of the songs. In fact, the best song, \\"Death Day\\" combines breaking up with a grisly death and still manages to include morbid humor (i.e., \\"Papa's got a brand new BODY bag\\").All in all, \\"ANThology\\" is a great album, but you may need to listen to it several times before you get used to the mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your cash","review":"AAF does a great knock off of \\"Smooth Criminal\\", but that's it. I went out on a limb and bought this disc hoping for more rocking tunes. WRONG, the rest of this CD, AAF's own material, is depressing [and] whiny ...

These guys also aren't afraid to do things for their fans, a thing that major rock bands rarely do.

I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful new rock","review":"I saw these guys with Linkin Park and Taproot a few weeks ago, and they blew me away. I got this CD and IT blew me away. Alien Ant Farm is part of a new generation of REAL, FRESH rock music that includes the deftones and At the Drive-In. None of the Green Day-style punk posturing of Blink 182 and SR-71, none of the sissy-rock corniness of 3 Doors Down and Nine Days, none of the excessive rap baloney that takes away from the music of Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park.

The songs arent bad but they are just soooooo forgetable and boring if you want my advice i would by some propper metal such as slipknot or cradle of filth.

Then theres \\"Movies\\" which is one of the songs you cant get out of your head. \\"Courageous\\" is one of the harder songs on the album but its still really god. \\"Summer\\" is definately one of my favorites on the cd. The lyrics are great. Flesh And Bone is pretty good. And I also enjoy \\"Wish\\". I dont really like \\"Attitude\\" too much.

My 7th Birthday Party, and who to my surprise rolled up right after Bobo the clown, a group called Alien Ant Farm. Yep, they played a rocking 8 song set for my 6 and 7 year old buddies. They literally tore it up. They had to stop after a while though because, Billy spilled his Kool Aid on Jeff, and my mommy had to clean it up, but after no time, they were right back into the kicking set. Only one thing kinda bothered me, i did get a little tired of the 8 different rendition of \\"Smooth Criminal\\". There was the version without drums, the version without guitar, the version where nobody played.

No Way!","review":"BrilliANT this album is not. I made the mistake of choosing to buy this album as it only cost a few more dollars than the single. Now I know why. I love Smooth Criminal, I think it is a sensational version of Michael Jackson's classic song. Buy the single instead of this album as it's the only good song on the entire album. When a band you've never heard of before has it's first hit with a cover you have to wonder if they're going to be one hit wonders. I don't think you have to wonder any more after listening to this album. The other songs are nothing like the style or quality of Smooth Criminal and are really just fillers. The lyrics are included in the cover but formatted in a layout where they are on top of each other making them difficult to read. If they couldn't produce a decent CD you'd think they could atleast get a decent CD cover done.

Yet the Rod Laver has not changed it is still the same shoe it was 30 years ago, much like you ask how could you play tennis with a wooden racket how could you wear these on the court?The shoe runs true to size and is wider than Nikes.

She is amazing during this period of her career, more than now.The sound quality is also quite amazing, capturing details and producing clairty in the huge intense moments. The ECO don't sound chamber like they sound like a real orchestra for once!Accardo provides powerful accompaniments and joins her in the Double to great success!-I don't know why this recording doesn't sit with other reviewers, but it's what I was looking for with these concertos, and it's what I got!EXCELLENT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yucchh!","review":"All it takes is the first three bars of one of these concerti to realize that the performance resembles that of an excellent high school orchestra led by an old man, both of whom are afraid of offending anyone by performing something by the revered Master with spirit or personality.

That's what this book focuses on. The book should be called \\"Mathematics Meets Mechanical Technology\\" since it focuses on solving mechanical problems involving gears, levers, pulleys, linkages, movement and mechanical transmission of power. This book was one of many on a graduate mathematics reading list which is why I chose it. It uses math but is not mathematical. Nothing beyond high school math (algebra, geometry (not the proofs), and trigonometry) is required. If you are a hobbyist, like to build mechanical devices, want to supplement a kinematics discussion in physics or applied math, or studying engineering then this book is useful. I don't think this is useful for someone who is only interested in \\"pure\\" math. It is not a casual read as it focuses on problem solving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emergency phone power when you need it!","review":"The SideWinder charger is a device that should be in a lot of folk's luggage.

I do not own the album myself (since it is so hard to find or when you find it is extremely expensive) but I borrowed it from a friend once and listened to it enough to say that this is arguably the best Don Giovanni I have ever heard. You do not listen to any music here; you listen to THE story Mozart wanted to tell and this was made possible by Allen's incredible interpretation as well as the harmony of the rest of the cast.

His interpretations of classical music set to the electrifying beauty of the guitar are well pieced together and performed amazingly.

Kasdorf has captured the experience of woman who have grown up, and asserted their person-hood in a world where they are viewed as sexual objects; and where the church has rarely been a help, and often a hinderance. Not for the faint -hearted or those looking for 'inspriational poetry' this collection of poems speakes deeply to me as a woman, and as someone who is strongly religious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doing it again","review":"He's done it again, you just can't seems to get enough of this cd, & so with his other previous cd's as well, although I think superhero does not fit on that cd...face it brian's not cut out to do upbeat music, but further on he is a genie in disguise & surely a poet...SIMPLY THE BEST."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST PRODUCTION, QUITE RUSH, BUT STILL, BRIAN MCKNIGHT","review":"Brian is back!!! but maybe too soon.

As I've said I think this CD is good, but worst than brian's last one, and I truly think Mcknight lost a great opportunity to do the BEST, to give out his BEST, to join perfect art and perfect production on it. Anyway, he still have time , and surely he will, cause he knows how to do it. Listen to Crazy Over You, it's just a perfect example!!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gentle hero","review":"Brian McKnight's lastest SUPERHERO is a laid back R&B album with pop sensabilities. Brian's voice is a little grittier than usual but still has a smooth quality to it. SUPERHERO is a little bland at first but it quickly picks up the pace. Brian should stay away from those uptemos. He's at his best with the ballads. He's a natural balladeer and he shines with each one. The midtempos also serve hime well. The title cut \\"superhero\\" is a nice surprise. It's Brian's first attempt at a more rockish sound and he pulls it off well. SUPERHERO is a great, relaxing, laid back album that anyone would enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd grew on me","review":"I remember when I first picked up this album I didn't think much of it. After listening to it a couple times it really started to get into my head.This cd has a good mix of fast tunes (Groovin tonight, Don't know where to start) and vintage Brian mcknight ballads (Still, Everything).His collaborations with Justin T, the St. Lunatics, and Nate Dogg were all really well done and are sure to get you up and dancing.My kinda girl, Love of my life, Everything, and Biggest part of me were my favourite songs on this cd.It may take a few listens but this cd is full of great songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Brian Mckight !!","review":"...Brian Mcknights new cd is Awesome.His style haschanged a little on this one(which is great).Yes he has someof your orignall Brian Mcknight songs but he also has a newsound on some songs like the album track \\"Super Hero\\",peoplethis song is \\"NICE\\" it has a pop feel to it(yes I am a blackperson).A wonderful new Brian Mckight Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate To Break It To Ya...","review":"This is not Brian McKnight's best work, in my opinion.

This time he added alot of, well, punch to his album. He has a great mix of songs that you can jam or just chill to. My favorites on the cd are still, love of my life, everything, and for you. Brian Mcknight has such a good voice, and he keeps coming up with such great albums. This album might get up to being one of his best albums. He is definately a leader for the R&B era. His style has not changed, but been varied from his earlier albums to his later albums. This album is a major hit, listen to some of the samples, im sure all the songs will make u wanna groove to the beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always loved Brian McKnight @}->---","review":"Brian McKnight still remains one of my all time favourite male R&B; singers. He's not only good to look at, but his voice is classy and beautiful and his music is romantic, cool and tight. He is so talented yet so underrated, but to his fans, he doesn't often disappoint.While I've had this cd since it's release, it did take one or two listens to before I really decided I loved it. It's full of great songs and there is no bad one here. In particular I love, Don't Know Where To Start, Everything, For You and the title track Superhero. I never get tired of listening to him, and I never get tired of this cd. It's beautiful and a must for all Brian McKnight fans.

Also - they tape the shirts together with clear tape, inside of the packaging, and there doesn't seem to be a pattern about where they put the tape and it stretches the shirts when you take it off.

This is a purely Italian cast who understands the jokes here in an Italian manner -- pure Buffo. The cast here is so much better than American, English, French or Spanish singers of \\"Pasquale\\" on other labels, giving us beautiful Italian sung by Italians, conducted by Italians. Muti keeps the buffo, but also humanizes the characters rather than go hogwild with stereotypes. This definitely is the first recording of \\"Don Pasquale\\" to have in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fun","review":"While Riccardo Muti may be one of the premier Verdi conductors in the world today, the effervesence of this light Donizetti comedy almost completely eludes him. The score under his baton becomes quite leaden. He is not helped by the cast; Mirella Freni was past Norina at this point in her career and she wisely avoids high notes even though she does try to exhibit some of the character's personality. Gosta Winbergh is adequate as Ernesto while Leo Nucci's Malatesta tries to bring some life to the proceedings. Sesto Bruscantini is a surprise - his Pasquale is heavy-handed and lumbering: a definite comedown from his Cetra recording of the role 30 years earlier. All said, the champagne is quite flat here and it would be better to look elsewhere if you want to hear this opera with all the panache Donizetti intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"RE: \\"POR QUE COPIAR A LOS CHILENOS\\"","review":"OYE ESTUPIDO, EN QUE CABEZA CABE QUE LOS TACUBAS QUERIAN IMITAR A ESA BANDA DE MIERDA QUE TIENEN \\"LOS TRES\\" QUE NADIE LOS CONOCE FUERA DE CHILE?

The way they tell stories, which also shone on Bizarre Ride, is what sets them apart.

A brick to warm the armchair traveller.","review":"I did originally choose this book because of the great reviews, and because it was one of the most recent publications. It is a fine tome to read for those who are planning a trip. Long term planning, I mean -- read it six months before you go, because that's how long it takes to read and digest all the information. Or even better -- read it and don't bother to go. This book has so many photographs that you barely need to see the stuff for yourself. It weighs about six kilos, so don't plan on taking it anywhere with you.Otherwise -- a good review of history and valuable detail. It was worth poring through before I moved to Moscow, but a smaller, handier travel guide would be a better reference while traipsing through the city's well-kept secrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow Dawn redeems the Willow saga after shaky start in SM","review":"After Shadow Moon, I was a little nervous about trying Shadow Dawn, but as a fan of the movie Willow, I had to find out what was going to happen next. The pace of this new one was definitely more even, and Claremont was able to paint a clear picture of the action. Elora Danan takes the center stage literally and figuratively; she is the main character of Shadow Dawn instead of Thorn Drumheller, appropriate enough since it is obvious that this trilogy is her story. It also becomes clear how this hunted and hated Sacred Princess is supposed to be the savior of the thirteen realms. This book takes a place on my bookshelf among few other all time favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadow War, Book 2","review":"Things began to get confusing following the myriad trails of all the principal characters. It seemed repetitive and unnecessary. I wanted to resolve the confusion by going to Book III.

Overall, the story could've used a bit more polish and a pinch more originality; an entire scene in the book is blatantly stolen from the film \\"Braveheart,\\" while clumsily palliated in a story-within-the-story. While \\"Shadow Moon\\" gave us the future of the Willow saga so many of us had grown to love, \\"Shadow Dawn\\" stumbles along until finally reaching a morass of odd story twists and dragged-out characterization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting better, there's some hope yet","review":"Better than Shadow Moon, but not by too much. The writing has improved, the characters are slightly more believable. But I still get the impression that I've missed something. The ideas flow from the authors faster than they can absorbed by the reader. It's like watching the T.V. with the sound off, you are only getting a portion of what is meant. I commented that the first book, Shadow Moon needed an impartial, unfamiliar editor to ask questions and to fill in the blanks for us. The same goes for Shadow Dawn. I finished the book as unsatisfied as if it had been put down in the middle. Again I ask \\"What was that all about? What happened?\\" Maybe part 3 will be better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Sorsha and Madmartegin?","review":"I loved the movie, so when I heard about the book, I rushed to find it. I am absolutly obssessed with the movie and probably the reason I loved it so much was the humor between Sorsha and Madmartigan. I really liked Willow too. The book was good, I'll give it that, but I will always love the movie more. Why did the writers and George Lucas turn Willow into a cold, killing sorcerer, not the kind, self-concious farmer I fell in love with? I was so sad when I found out they killed off my two favorite characters! Why get rid of 3/4 of the reason I wanted to read the book? I thought the beginnig was hilarious because in my mind I could see Sorsha and Madmartigan (Joanne Whalley/Val Kilmer) fighting and making up. I was terribly disappointed that in this book they disposed of two of the greatest characters and substitued others that did not have that special quality"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never read anything like this!

I previous reviwer complains about the character of The Lord of the Dance that appears. What this woman does not relize is that the Lord of the Dance is an old celtic song about celtic/christian mythos and was meerly used by Mr Flatley as his center piece of music for his show. The character has nothing to do with Flatley or his show but I can understand why people not into celtic music or tradition may assume it is from Flatley's show.Try these books they are quite good but do not look for a repeat of the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice script, poor development into a novel","review":"The way I see it, George Lucas wrote a nifty script and Chris Claremont tried to turn it into a novel, but gave up after his first draft. There are so many disjunct segments that don't flow into the next segment. Lots of nice descriptions, but the plot isn't carried along well. There's even a cut-and-paste paragraph 3/4 through the book that was used 1/4 of the way into the book. And the Braveheart reference brought me right out of the book to roll my eyes. I just couldn't get into a book that uses another story from a totally different genre and can't carry the plot along. I faithfully read the whole thing, complaining all the while... my husband tore up the book when I finished it and threw it in the recycling box. I wasn't heart broken at all. I wouldn't want others to waste their time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down, but when finished, you've missed something","review":"A fast, easy read. The futher I read the faster I found myself picturing the story. The story is a little complicated with a lot of traveling from one sceen to another and back.

For if she were to fufill her role as Sacred Princess, they really deeded to develop the character quite a bit more. as you read each of the main dream sequences Elora had with Kieron ( the first one a lot more than the rest ) you get this urge to go back to the front to look at the illustration of the Great Realms and how Elora is connected to each of the circles..Suffice to say..I eagerly await Shadow Star, and the eventual movies..(you dont think Mr. Lucas took the time to develop the story and put his name on it if he didnt plan to make them into movies eventually, did you??)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"First one was so bad I couldn't make it far into this one without giving up on the whole story.

Too much description, not much action. I kept reading, though, hoping the next book in the series would be better, only to be disappointed. I skipped pages at a time just to get to some sort of dialog or action. The brownies supposedly had a great wit, but there was no evidence of it in the books. Too bad, they could've been a great plus, like Tas the kender in the Chronicles series. As far as the Elora, the wittiest she ever got was by sticking her tongue out in response to any lame jokes the brownies made. In conclusion, don't waste your time with these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but Not Durable","review":"I bought this Kon plush a few months ago through Amazon and within a few weeks of buying it, the button came off and an arm ripped off.

Not many bands are working in this territory and I give Sentenced FULL respect for putting out such an honest and real record like this. You won't be wasting your money here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Songwriting Makes Crimson a Must Have","review":"I can't express how much I love this album. From the melodic intro's to the most catchy, brutal riffs in metal today, Sentenced has created a masterpiece they may never be able to top. From the opener 'Bleed In My Arms' to the closer 'My Slowing Heart' Sentenced weaves a dark, emotionally draining concept album of epic proportions. The vocals on this album are just amazing, and the harmony guitar nicely compliments the beautiful but bitter melody lines that make up this love gone bad tragedy. There is not a weak track on this album. In my opinion, the strongest are 'Killing Me Killing You' and 'Dead Moon Rising' along with the opener and 'Fragile'.

The album is worth every cent for just one song \\"In the wee small hours\\". I honestly thought that the man was preaching to me. The only reason to not give it 5 stars is because 5 is reserved for the Coletrane collaboration and Song's from the Heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was I disappointed!","review":"I read the reviews and figured this receiver would fit my needs. What I didn't expect was to have to take it to a repair center as soon as I got it to fix the loud hum from the speakers.

I wish I had never bought it.Update: I'm too angry to write anything, nor do I want to waste any more time, I'm just going to write off the 90 bucks I paid, but if you even think of buying any product from Sherwood please read this review for this receiver:NIGHTMARISH experience with this receiver, August 4, 2005Reviewer: LC Ricker \\"baking mama\\" (Portland, ME) - See all my reviews"},{"rating":"1","title":"sherwood rx-4107","review":"The remote would not work with the first reciever, so I sent it back for a replacement.

I haven't even bothered to check out all of it's functions because I don't need to go that far to know that I'm not keeping it. It sounds terrible. Yes, it's a cheap receiver and I knew that when I bought it, BUT...There are plenty of highs in the treble end, but on the bass end, turned to it's maximum, it sounds no better than the car-brand stereo in an automobile. There simply is no bass. I'm not expecting to shake the floor here, but there is very little to nothing in the lower registers. Bass guitars sound just like the electric guitars. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to set up","review":"I still have not gotten it to work with my CD player, tape deck, turntable or speakers.

The radio does not function at all and because I do not use records, the only thing that this receiver is good for is to play CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A receiver that won't even receive local FM stations","review":"This receiver's scan feature for finding stations wouldn't even pick up local stations no matter what we did with the antennae. Most features required using the remote, which is bad considering most people have a tendency to misplace their remotes. Don't lose the instruction manual - without it you will be lost. The instruction manual had a picture of the remote with a description of how to use the buttons but the problem with that is the picture was on one page and you had to flip the page to see what the button did and most times it required you to push several buttons so by the time you flipped back to see where the next button you needed to push was located it timed out and you had to start over. I love remotes but I also want to be able to do the steps manually on the unit itself. We are keeping it and will use it elsewhere in the house and get another higher priced more user friendly receiver for our entertainment center needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dimensions are wrong","review":"I bought this to fit in a 4 1/2 inches high area.

I have a medium size living room and only wanted a two speaker step-up. I purchased a pair of Sony 3-way speakers (Sony SSF-5000 Floor Standing 3-way Speakers) which are rated for 150W, 8 ohms and this receiver pushes them easily. At half volume this system shakes the walls. I am very happy with the mids and highs and more that satisfied with the lows.

The speakers were fine, the actual stereo was done. With Amazon Prime I got it in 2 days, hooked it up and bang, it works. It gets plenty loud, remember I have small speakers and don't wish to blow them up, I could have sworn that the min system had more bass, even with this thing maxed out on bass it is not much, but it could be the speakers again.All in all the $90 I paid was well worth it, as there were other way more expensive options.I can't review durability as I've only had it like 2 weeks, but my brother has had this model for a few months and it still goes just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit Working","review":"Receiver suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason.

I like the straightforward controls and easy programming. I only give it four stars because for this price there HAVE to be drawbacks somewhere, although I haven't found any in the three months I've owned the unit.It is worth pointing out one feature I appreciate, having a one year old toddler on the loose.

I purchased my unit in early 2009 and it was defective out of the box. It would come on for a few seconds, then shut itself off and no amount of tinkering helped. I called customer service but they were not able to help me so I packed it up and sent it back. They sent me a replacement about 10 days later and it worked great for a while, but just AFTER the warranty expired, the replacement is also shutting itself off, just as the first one did. I believe there is a flaw in the power supply that causes this but what ever the reason, it should not do this so wanted to warn anyone considering this item about this defect. If it had been only one, I would just think it was a defective unit, but when 2 of them do the exact same thing, it seems that it is a design flaw.I recommend that you purchase a different stereo unless you like replacing them frequently. Happy shopping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value Receiver!","review":"If you need top performance - look elsewhere. If you want a reliable solid performer at a great price this is it!

Recently, I purchased a Sherwood RX-4109 receiver...designed in the USA an manufactured somewhere East Of Eden...for my exercise room when an integrated amplifier from my college days finally gave up the ghost. An inexpensive multi-format DVD player is the signal source and the Sherwood is hooked to a competent pair of bookshelf speakers. The RX-4109 kicks out enough decent sound to compete with my Nordic Track and sounds better than I expected it to. If you're looking for exceptional value and good sound, the RX-4109 will not disappoint. It is a genuine bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SYSTEM!","review":"This system does everything (I) want it to do. Up to 5 inputs and tuner. Controller works great and is easy to use. The only con is that THIS IS NOT SURROUND SOUND! This only has right and left speaker differences.

It's stripped down by present standards -- two channels only, no phonograph input. It's dead quiet and extremely clean sounding. I can't hear any emphases or dead spots in the frequencies. The tuner is exceptionally good; I am surprised at the success I'm having with it in a poor reception area, with only the antennas that are supplied. Appearance and quality are fine: nice black steel case, solid buttons, one big old volume knob. It was all I needed, so I'm very pleased. Going to get another for a computer amp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work Out of the Box","review":"Hooked up the speakers and plugged it in. Standby lite came on.

Returning it to Amazon in exchange for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy Customer","review":"The receiver worked fine for about 3 month.

These are garbage,and not even worth their $89.00 price. I know of 2 other poeple that have purchased these,and have had the same experience with them that I have. The audio quality is worse than any receiver I have ever heard. Comparable with a boom box in quality. There is also no way that these put out anything close to 105 watts per channel. Not even close.Save your money,and spend $150-$200 for a decent 100 watt receiver. Common sense dictates that you aren't going to get much for $89.00,and this Sherwood receiver proves it. A pretty $89.00 box with bad sound...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this receiver","review":"I would be embarrassed if I was Sherwood.

Because of this experience I will never buy a Sherwood product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Serious Re-engineering","review":"Receiver cuts out when volume is raised.

Broken after 6 months.","review":"I bought this to use as a simple amplifier for my computer. I didn't need any extra features so for the low price this seemed like a good choice. It wasn't. There is a high frequency hissing noise coming from the amp to the speakers, although the headphones sounded ok. This hissing is common in cheap amps it seems. I could live with the hissing, but the whole thing stopped working after about six months of light use. I wish someone made reliable low cost power amps for stereo speakers and headphones! I guess I'll have to pay extra for a reliable 7.1 receiver which I'll never use the extra features of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Sherwood product of the past.","review":"The first receiver failed to deliver acceptable Am or FM reception and was returned as defective. The replacment worked fine for three days and then delivered reception too poor for comfortable listening. The replacement Sony works perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good receiver/amp","review":"For the money one couldn't go wrong on this receiver/amp. The price was right and Sherwood has been around for a long time now. A 105 watts per channel is more than adequate to get the people in the next county to get up and applaud. Just make sure you have speakers that can handle this power. For around $117.00 out the door how can you go wrong? I may buy another one just to have on hand for a present to give."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reviews on here are correct.","review":"After reading the reviews on Amazon which were all excellent, I went ahead and purchased this receiver.I am totally impressed with the sound and clarity.

The receiver is straight forward and does what it is intended to do well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent overall but radio reception is terrible","review":"Purchased this a few weeks ago and it appears to be a decent receiver. My major complaint is that the FM reception is virtually non-existent. I live within 15 miles of downtown Atlanta and usually have no problems pulling in many stations but this thing could not pull in even one station.To be fair I drove the receiver to another location across town and experienced the same thing. Terrible reception. I ensured that the supplied el-cheapo antenna wires (both am and fm) were attached properly and experimented with placement.My other concern is the speaker feeds on the back of the receiver. Seem poorly designed to me.I will say it's a good looking receiver and the sound quality while playing CD's and DVD's is good. Nice remote also.I rate it as a poor buy due to the reception issue.For the price it's ok if your not interested in the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"No radio stations","review":"I thought this was a great buy for what I wanted and was very excited to try it out.After I hooked it all up and tried to tune in radio stations I could only get like 2 stations and I even put FM antenna out the window.Too bad,if it wasn't for that I would of kept it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal","review":"Stereo arrived when expected and worked without any problems. Slightly annoying in that when you turn it on, you don't hear sound for a few seconds and then hear the unit select the last selected speakers A or B or both. Considering the rock bottom discount price, I almost expected a ripoff of some sort. The unit works great. I've got it hooked up to an outdoor inground speaker system and I was surprised at the sound quality. Perhaps if you are a sound expert, it maybe low end, but for your average user, is delivers a reasonable sound quality. Inputs and outputs where sufficient to allow me to hook the unit to my cable box and dvr/cd player and if I had more things to connect it to, it appears to have plenty of additional inputs. I will eventually expand the unit and add a 2nd pair of speakers for indoor use. The unit allows me this flexibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what I wanted","review":"I wanted a receiver so I could listen to the radio and CD's in my living room. I did not need surround sound nor did I want to buy additional speakers. My home has on open plan so I'm not just in the living room sitting and listening. It works great. Its a little more difficult to set up preset stations but that is easily forgiven because the sound quality is better than my last unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality, great price!","review":"One of the very few products on the market that does precisely what it says it does. Easy to set up and very easy to use due to the remote control included. We only have it turned up to 13 or 14 but the sound goes far beyond that number so the power in this little asset is truly awesome. Be sure to use it with all you peripherals as it has plenty of hookups for them. Great quality, great price, what more can you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Receiver of Merit and Value","review":"This receiver seems to be a great value.

It could be construed as a Chorus and Orchestra borrowing a some jazz players for their next album, and it should be classified in their section."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price.","review":"Very good mostly acoustic set. Great harmonies. Very mellow but in no way sappy. Slow at points, some cliche' & definitely nothing truly new here but honestly, how many things in the music industry haven't alredy been done? It's actual instrument based music with melody and harmony. That may not be new but it's definitely classic. If you are a fan of these things you will like it. And check the prices on the used items. Practically a no risk buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling...","review":"This is appalling, the models are terrible, the animation amateurish, and the texturing ugly (horrible misuse of procedural textures).

It makes you wonder why he would slam the incredible 3D done in Final Fantasy when he isn't even in the same league and probably never will be. The illustrations and textual layout are not as clear as they should be. If you want to learn the basics, you can get something from this book. However, a good book shows you how to get good results. The results he achieves in this book are subpar.Many other books do far better.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst looking renders I've seen in a published tome","review":"I'm stunned that the author claims to have success in this industry given the absolutely horrible work he passes off as being professional in quality. I'm very serious that I have not seen such poor quality in ANY other book. I teach 3D and have seen much better work from novice students. My only conclusion is that the author completely lacks the capacity to be self-critical of his own work given that he obviously believes his film-in-progress merits serious consideration. Do not be misled into thinking that any of the work shown in this book would be acceptable commercially."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"When i saw the firt pictures of this book, I was totaly chocked..

While the content may not be in it's final stage; I think the major problem most would have with it is the fact that it claims to be professional work instead of merely educational examples like most books. I've always found its better to learn with \\"real\\" examples, so while I don't know how good the film would do they are excellent learning tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"The Archduke Trio is a work of sublime beauty, one of the great works of all chamber music. This is an outstanding performance and recording in every way, with flawless ensemble and even the great Perlman for once not dominating but content to contribute to the synergy that comes from the three instrumentalists playing as one. And while I am not the biggest Ashkenazy fan in the world, sometimes finding his playing too flat, he is wonderful here, conveying a serene sense of beauty and holding the work together admirably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"I've been studying the Japanese language on my own for six years now.

As certain English words have different meanings depending on context, that context is also mentioned here as not to confuse with others. Words with same kana writing but different kanji are written in separate entries as well.A quick reference for translating from English to Japanese is also included in the back, but since it's only the dictionary form, you'll have to conjugate it before using it.Grammar notes, counting suffixes, era tables in Japanese history are also included.You'll need a separate reference for kanji, by the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for novice English Speaking students.","review":"You have to be careful before buying this book.

The first is very poor padding on the bottom of the pack. My backpack fell off my suitcase while standing in line at the airport, landing on the bottom. The computer screen cracked as the result of a two foot drop. The second flaw is that the zipper that closes the computer compartment can be separated from the body of the flap covering the computer. The nylon shreds and releases the zipper entirely. This is most noticable when the body of the backpack is full with other papers and the corner of the computer pushes on the zipper. I have had two Ogio metro packs (got from my employer) and both failed at the computer pouch zipper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness","review":"Pretty much everything about this backpack is great. It lacks a little bit of space but its not enough to make this backpack unbuyable. It has a lot of compartments labeled and such all around it.

Both look great, are well made, and comfortable and the side-entry zipper for a laptop is convenient. The Metro is fairly compact and can hold up to a 14\\" laptop. The external pockets seemed small but I found they held everything (computer power supply, Blackberry, cables, GPS) perfectly and were designed to prevent things from falling out if a zipper is not closed. Several interior pockets allow you to store/organize small items and protect them from damage. Unless you need to carry a lot of stuff or have a larger computer, the Metro is a really good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"OGIO Metro Backpack","review":"When my oldest son purchased an OGIO Metro Pack I thought it was a well thought out backpack. It seemed to be the perfect backpack for our needs so I ordered two more, one for both my younger son and myself. After just two months all three OGIO Metro Packs are coming apart at the seams. Either OGIO has compromised their quality or we were stuck with a shoddy knock off. Before purchasing these backpacks, both of my sons had OGIO backpacks that lasted well over 3 years of hard wear. I'm very disappointed and unfortunately did not keep the receipts. I guess the lesson here is BUYER BE AWARE OF ONLINE PURCHASES. When ordering through Amazon.com, you never know if the company that you end up ordering the product from is truly and authorized seller of the product that you are ordering."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty nice","review":"i am happy to have gotten such a great backpack i can tell it will last a good while. i am taking it to Africa so it better last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This bag is good, but none of the zippers work.

Take for an example, in describing Ampere, he does not even mention about the Ampere's law!!! I think at least in describing various physicists, he should at least state briefly about what contribution of those hysicists. Just on sentence about the equation of the laws would make this book far more interesting!

This is an insult to one of the best pieces of music ever written and the compoisition is much more complex then it is very given credit for. The harpsichord player needs to be a very trained muisician as some of the parts written for this instrument can be considered to be mind boggling in its complexcity and remove one single note and the entire composition for this instrument falls apart. This is a work done by a master composer and should not be missed or dismissed merely because it is not avantgarde enough or that the general public takes it to their hearts. This is a tremendous master work and even if he is not as an accomplished composer as the greats, Mozart, Wagner, Bach and the like, he has still managed to create a piece of music that is truly astounding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A golden CD","review":"A must-have for Bolero lovers.

I beg to differ. Yes, there is a Zen element to the film, as well as a definite nod to the Noir genre. Of course, there as also acting, directing, and plot. All of these named elements of the film were shallow and amateurish in my humble opinion. And by the way, just because the lines are delivered excruciatingly slowly and there are long pauses between the lines does not make it more Zen. After viewing I looked at the awards and critical acclaim quotes on the cover of the DVD, as well as viewing again the glowing comments on amazon, and wonder if they all were made by friends and family members of the film's creators, a little too anxious to like this movie. I hesitate to negatively review things, but I wanted to throw a word of caution to others considering purchasing this movie. It may be worth seeing but not worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to do your Zen homework first","review":"I have just started studying Buddhism and Zen, so I could smile at the Zen humor.

A koan cannot be figured out with logic, so be prepared to feel confused (koans are supposed to confuse you) about how loved ones die and leave us heart broken, people in general just die, people commit suicide, and how all of us are slowly dying.

So I drove five hours to St. Louis to see it the day it opened there in late October! It was just wacky enough to light me up. Next, I purchased the DVD and showed it to about 33 people, describing it in my invitation as a campy, zany, fun-filled, yet lesson-based film. Despite the low budget and occasional moments when the music level was too high (during non-speaking parts), the original music is fabulous and the message comes through at the end. It has what films I really like have: character development, though only one character needed developing. It's an inspired concept done with hutzpah, integrity and passion.

Production values - ok. Script - ok. But it seems to be about itself, and i don't think that's zen; I think it's narcissism. I felt what it attempted to communicate was disingenuous.

On five diverse but almost consistently intense movements (\\"The Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost,\\" \\"Compassion,\\" \\"Love,\\" \\"Consequences,\\" and \\"Serenity\\"), the two tenor saxophonists, pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and both Elvin Jones and Rashied Ali on drums create some powerful, dense, and emotional music. Unlike some of the live jams of 1966, the passionate performances never ramble on too long and the screams and screeches fit logically into the spiritual themes. This would be the last recording of Coltrane with Tyner and Jones. Review by Scott Yanow"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coltrane's most important work","review":"Meditations is Coltrane's most powerful, carefully crafted, and important piece of music. Like all monumental pieces of art, it requires a great deal of dedication and effort from the listener. In this way, it is not unlike Joyce's writing from Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. Once the listener is prepared to give such attention, the rewards of Meditations outweigh virtually all jazz records before or since. This record has the beautiful lyricality of Coltrane's earlier recordings and the complexity and emotional intensity of his post-1965 work. Furthermore, each performer is playing at the peak of his ability, unlike some of Coltrane's less successful later pieces. There is plenty that is accessible here for those less acquainted with Coltrane's later works. Meditations, along with Live in Japan, is the best representation of later Coltrane, and in my opinion, one of the most beautiful pieces of music in our century."},{"rating":"2","title":"To A Music Fan from Folsom CA","review":"Don't throw it out - e-mail me at postmaster.co.uk and we can arrange its adoption."},{"rating":"1","title":"what-a-mess...","review":"This record is horrible!

Superficially, \\"Looking for Orthon\\" can be read as a biography of the late flying saucer contactee George Adamski, but it's much more; Bennett probes the innards of 20th century society with an intellectual and literary dexterity seldom encountered in popular works on UFOs. Bennett treats Adamski's bizarre story as the multilayered mythological enigma that it is, recreating the circumstances in which Adamski, good-natured opportunist and hobbyist astronomer, supposedly met a man from Venus. Bennett argues that Adamdki's claimed contact rattled Western society's ontological bedrock, regardless if it actually happened. There aren't very many books that address reality-challenging issues as ably or as wittily as Bennett's. \\"Looking for Orthon\\" is a must for anyone seeking the roots of the postmodern condition, and destined to be a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Great and ideal, However","review":"First problem was end screw caps came loose in speaker.

The lyrics are honest and brutal and continue the conscious black man theme that has been part of their groups unique appeal. They come across as older, wiser rappers covering the current scene of hip-hop, politics, and current events.This is a perfect snapshot of how they see the world and what's on their mind unencumbered by the need to \\"appeal\\" to the masses (whatever the media means by that).Although I don't agree with everything PE stands for, I respect their opinions and enjoy their art."},{"rating":"1","title":"54321 BOOM!!!! And then the rest sux!","review":"Ok, at long last Public Enemy has finally let me down by allowing a bunch of sub-par average, non-innovative, non-avent guard, DJ's mix there stuff up. Even DJ Spookie's mix was not that grand. Everything sounds like beats that I discovered in the early 90's.On the other hand, this album is only a couple bucks used, so I would HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest buying it if only for 54321 BOOM which is perhaps one of the best PE tracks ever to come out! Not only are the beats right on, but the lyrics are some of the hardest I've heard yet!And for the note, my review has nothing to do with me not being flexable to change of sound. Infact I LOVE the new PE (Whirl Odor) even though it has club friendly sounds, mainly for the fact that they are not your mere average club beats (they are very multi-layered) and of course the lyrics once again only get harder and harder and harder, and more direct and to the point as we aproach the last times of this world(lyness)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Publisher","review":"I was looking forward to having my own copy of Little Men, but the copy I received from publisher Hard Press had many grammatical and spelling errors.

Hehe, well, in my opinion anyway. If you liked Little Women, you should read Little Men. If you thought that Little Women was too girly or feminine, read Little Men.

The whole story is about all these little orphans. There was Nat, Demi, Tommy, Dan, Franz, Emil, Ted, and little Rob. There was more but the girls are all stupid. It's a story about a bunch of orphans that have there own little special talents. The story is really a cute little story, but lacks a sense of plot. There's no action. I really think this book is so boring I fell a sleep every 5 minutes. Don't buy this book! If you don't like action and you like all that cute [stuff] read the counterpart, Little Women. Out of a 5 star review system, I'd give this book a 2.definetly not a must read. The only part I liked was the ending.

You could even see the house and the rooms!! I know what every room looks like and how to get there!I could see the boy's foot when he hurt it and I could see his face when the doctor had to fix it.I love this book!!

I hated this book so much I never wanted to reopen it, I couldn't help put it down. It took me weeks to read this book when it usually only takes me 2 days to read a book.

However, there are twelve boys and two girls. The author takes you through six months of the year with the children. People will laugh at their antics and in the same token will be touched by the love and respect with which they treat each other. Each child has his or her obsticals to overcome and each has their own good points. The author makes you feel as if you are in the school with them the entire time. The reader will be drawn into their world and wish he or she were really there.

If anything, it just underscored how Jo should have accepted Teddy!

What a disappointment. I hit the wall about p. 20 and could never find a way to get involved. The characters were uninteresting and the situations dull, and I had to force my way to the end. I haven't had this much trouble with a book in a long time. Since this is a minority view, I would only ask: Is this book the best introduction to Jane Austen? Should I have tried anoter title -- Pride and Prejudice, say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elinor and Marianne....What great sisters!","review":"The dual natures of these sisters is what truly makes this novel special. Their natural differences and their abilities in the end to overcome their inborn instincts demonstrate Austen's talent in creating interesting and dynamic characters. For me, this is Jane's best novel (I have not read them all). There is so much to learn from these characters! The men in the novel are complex and interesting as well. Recommended reading. (and yes, the 21st century reader will need to be patient with the language, but the novel is well worth it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The narration is lively and captivating.","review":"I have listened to all of Jane Austen's novels in the unabridged audiobook form. Sense and Sensibility (narrated by Sarah Badel) is my personal favorite. Every character has a wonderfully distinct voice. The narration is lively and captivating. You will love it! Pay particular attention to the voice Miss Badel gave to \\"Robert Ferrars\\"....it's hilarious!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arguably my favourite Jane Austen.","review":"The book tells about the remarkable family of Dashwood whose family home was located in Sussex. The book is about two sisters who are as diametrically opposite as two can be. Marianne is the younger sister, and she is eager, imprudent and excitable. Elinor is much more sensible than her young sister, and her voice is always the voice of reason. But it's the world that Ms. Austen always brings to her pages that is so captivating. She more than many others can create a little piece of the world that the reader has the privilege of discovering and then learns to love, just like Ms. Austen's characters do. This is what puts Ms Austen's books so much above the norm in this particular genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Fantastic book. I saw the movie and wanted to read the book, which was a fantastic read. They had there struggles but it appears that they were very strong women. One was level headed, one a romantic and the youngest sister had good role models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title should be Senseless, Sensibility","review":"It is remarkable how the women of the period had to put up with so many different pressures then of today. Consider that there was little of entertainment other than board games back then. Or why else would all these women engage themselves with so much frivolous talk and innuendo. With nothing to do for a \\"career\\" than to find the right man to marry, what else was there to do? It is a interesting picture of the times. The woman's honour having to be at stake if they chose wrongly. Marrying into money, and caste never mind the female biology. But at a few times the women gets together had gossip like hens while others suffers in silence. The illustrations were a nice touch too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Like Mark Twain Said...","review":"It is a great pity they allowed her to die a natural death.The story is about 3 daughters and a mother who are reduced to visitors at their own home after the father dies, which allows the son to inherit the estate. After that, Austen pulls in this idea about Sense and Sensibility.Let's put it this way: NOTHING HAPPENS! Elinor and Marianne fall in love with two men, who end up breaking up with then off and on throughout the book until the end when one of them actually marries one of the men. And it is the most boring piece of garbage ever to be written. I'm going to burn my copy after I'm done with it, which should be soon. This book is for women. Not for a man such as myself. I do not recommend this book to anyone not trying to fall asleep fast. It goes well with My Antonia as being good fuel for a fire. Never read this, this is crap. I don't care who you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sense and Sensability","review":"This is a classic story that really makes you rethink why we are here and what our purpose in life is.

It arrived in a timely manner as well. In great condition. i was expecting the small print version like the others I had been given from Barnes and Noble and was so pleased to recieve a book of full size, hard back, quality paper and a decent size print. No need for glasses or squinting ---- just yet. A lovely addition. I'm not so thrilled about the art work, but then again I don't like any of the art work in the stories I have. It always ruins my character in my imagination. Happy Reading!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding listening!","review":"The audiocassette of \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" read by Sarah Badel is truly outstanding. I love S&S anyway, but Ms. Badel's reading has enriched my understanding of it enormously, especially Jane Austen's sparkling dialogue. I don't know how often I laughed out loud (at Mrs. Jennings), or exclaimed with worry about poor Elinor and her carrying of everyone else's burdens. No, I'm not crazy, it's just that Jane Austen read aloud by an expert, articulate, dramatic reader does that to a person. I highly recommend this for those who listen to books on tape; you will cherish every word.

I have to admit, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. At first, I thought all the little sidebars were a little annoying, but as I got further and further into the book, I found myself actually looking forward to them.This book is a classic written in the beautiful prose of the 18th Century writer, Miss Jane Austen. I can't remember the last time I had read one of her books, but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this book. It even inspired me to rent the 1995 movie with Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant in it. I love the contrasts between the two sisters, the overly dramatic, romance-seeking Marianne, and the calm, steady, level-headed, Elinor.I look forward to seeing more books like this from Bethany House. This is a great way to get re-acquainted with the classics.This book was provided to me free of charge as part of Bethany House Book Reviewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book--poor copy","review":"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is an excellent book by one of the great authors of all time. However, the large-print volume (issued by Pavilion Press) that I purchased for my wife is one of the worst-bound books I have ever seen. The pages literally fell out as she was reading, no matter how careful she was. There are also numerous typographical errors throughout.

It was about a widow lady wanting her two marriageable age daughters find a suitable husband. All the players in the story seem to have this same pastime and providing tmes and events where it can take place. The verbage was in old English, sometimes with different meanings than today and the narrater didn't always make voice changes to distinguise who was talking. It became more interesting toward the end and I'm sure in the day it was written it was a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, strong melodic music","review":"\\"Sense and Sensilibilty\\" was fortunate to have Patrick Doyle as the composer. The songs are beautifully written, with strong tones. Even if you've never seen the movie, it's easy to imagine what happens in the movie when each song plays.

There are also two songs sung by soprano Jane Eaglen."},{"rating":"1","title":"a five star book with a 0 star critical apparatus","review":"Sense and Sensibility is a work of wit intelligence and genius--the critical apparatus and here I mean the work of modern critics is the work of those \\"favored\\" by stupidity. With the exception of Raymond Williams important article from \\"Keywords\\" --the critics are informed by a feminism that might be called Sexual Stalinism. Critics with agendas are always reductive, unreflective and in the case of one essay unpardonably vulgar. I name no names. William Empson's exploration of \\"Sense\\" \\"Sensibility\\" \\"Candour\\" and \\"Candid\\" which are briliantly investigated in his Structure of Complex Words apparenty was not deemed worthy of making the cut. Jane Austen would have had a good laugh had she read the sanctimonious essays that befoul this edition. If you are a good reader trust your own responses and get another edition. Of course if you are a member of the academy this edition is indispensable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again with the sisters!","review":"Although this book is not about the two sisters of \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the primary characters are two sisters (which will remind you of Jane and her sister), Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Again, as in \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the underlying theme is marriage. There is a lot of misunderstanding due to partial, or erroneous, information. The sense and sensibility is shown in how the sisters handle the different predicaments.The cast includes, among others, the sisters, Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and John and Fanny Dashwood.This edition has the complete text and not much else. The introduction has some historical information about the author and about the publishing of the book. There are only two pages of this. The margins are small, so taking notes within the text will prove difficult. It is easy to carry around and seems to put up with a moderate amount of abuse.I do recommend this book. The edition is worth the price, and the story is indeed a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formatting doesn't work for my Kindle","review":"I decided to buy this instead of downloading a free version because I liked the idea of the active/live contents page, but I am disappointed. The formatting looks like it was done for a larger screen and not the Kindle I own. Every line of text flows to the end of the line and then what's left of that line flows to the next (only one or two words usually). This happens for every line in the book. It's too hard to read and annoying, so I will definitely delete this copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sense and Sensibility","review":"Jane Austen wrote 'Sense and Sensibility' under the name 'Elinor and Marianne' in a series of letters, between 1795 and 1796.The story follows the Dashwood family of the deasced Mr. henry Dashwood, his two daughter in particular, Elinor and Marianne, who in the end make suitable matches.Read this book plenty of times.

In all circumstances, Elinor never once demonstrated her misery in front of Marianne when she was having problems. This also shows how very shallow and selfish people were in Britain.

I love them all, and own them all. Every time I re-watch the film or re-listen to the audiobook, I find a little something that I'd missed in the several times that I've read and re-read the novel. Kate Winslet is charming in the film, and it carries over into the audiobook. If anybody enjoyed her performance as Marianne in the film, they should absolutely listen to her tell the story. Not only does she prove that she can be Marianne flawlessly, but she vocally creates all the other characters with delightful aplomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate Delievers Again!","review":"Excellent book.

This was to be the first time I could read it on my kindle and I chose what I was led to believe was an annotated version. The annotations were especially important because this was the book for study and discussion at the annual Jane Austen Tea at the JASNA Society in Burlington, Vermont.There are no annotations with this kindle version. I was mis-led, sadly disappointed and ill prepared for the delightful tea and celebration of Jane Austen's birthday.Annotations promisedAnnotations deniedLike a sugarless sconeA rock on your lap"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Readers Must!","review":"I had the pleasure of reading two of Jane Austen's books, Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, and loved both of them. Austen writes in such a romatic way that you wish you could be there in person to experience every word. Anyone who found the book to be boring, needs to re-read it again. It speaks of honesty, integrity and love that is lacking in todays books. Elinor in, Sense and Sensability, was a strong and smart woman while on the other hand, the younger sister, Marianne, was weaker but became a stronger individual because of the strong bond between herself and Elinor. Every young girl should read Austen's work because it protrays love as good and bad and shows that no matter how much someone can love you, there maybe a hidden agenda behind that affection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen was a writer of her time...not this one.","review":"Jane Austen wrote about what women in her time lived through. Marriage and society. Unfortuantly, in present times those subjects can become tedious after the 400th page. If you are not up to an extremely slow book, do not read Sense and Sensibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated the book","review":"I'm sorry the book put me to sleep, it took over a 150 pages until something interesting happened, stayed interesting for a few chapters and then got boring again. I'm sorry I thought the book was the biggest waste of trees ever. If it wasn't for the fact that I had to read the book I would have never picked it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun that just the text by itself, if that is possible","review":"I own both Insight Editions of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" and I only wish they had continued this series to include all of Jane Austen's major novels - Northanger Abbey, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion. The notes in the margins provide historical context, insights into Jane Austen's own life, and chatty asides from the editor that make you feel like you're reading the book along with an intelligent friend or book club. It is a fun introduction to Jane Austen's books for those new to Austen, and it's just another way to enjoy this classic book and really feel a connection to and a part of the kinds of conversations of \\"Janeites\\" JASNA meetings and book groups. It is an accessible edition of the book - less academic than the Norton Critical Edition, without compromising the experience of just reading Austen's books for fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine romance","review":"This was my first Jane Austen book and initially I was unmoved - even bored - by the torturous romantic entanglements of two well-bred Regency young ladies. But the elegant prose, twisting plot and amusing characters won me round. Austen, I belatedly discover, is one clever writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Jane Austen's works are always engaging, entertaining, heart-warming, and funny. So well written and so much more true romance than any dime store novel ever could attain to be. The only downside is that this copy seems to have some glitch where it will double a sentence and place that 2nd sentence a few paragraphs later but it's in a way that it's obvious it doesn't belong there. The only thing I could figure was that in the hard copy there is some book print style picture with a quote from the book under it as would be typical in many books of this type and that in the kindle version it just doesn't show the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Austen","review":"I adore Jane Austen in audio. I think I'd have trouble reading the actual books but when one is able to listen to someone read the book to you and let the words wash over you in that way it is fantastic.

You can lose yourself in the manners and customs of the time.

The \\"insight edition\\" includes \\"trivia, notes, and inspiration to amplify this beloved classic.\\" I agree wholeheartedly with that assessment and believe you will as well. Some of the English ways and words are very well explained in the insights. This was very helpful to me as I found the original book hard to understand in some places. The insights help make everything clear and easy to understand. Anyone who loves Jane Austen will enjoy reading the added notes in this wonderful edition. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past chapter 1","review":"Enjoyed Harwin's first book but couldn't get past page 21 in this one. The main character, Catherine, is just about the most unsociable person yet. Her interaction with family and others borders on rude and obnoxious. I enjoy a good mystery where the main character at least has a level of consideration but this just annoyed me from the get-go.Sometimes I can get past this and give the book another 30 pages but this was too much for even me. This is not to say I don't enjoy books where the primary character is rough around the edges and prickly but this was just annoying to the point of not wanting to put up with 272 pages just to see if it would get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberation Music Orchestra CD Comments","review":"The sample segments on the website are misleading.

My wife was afraid that the second sink would explode so I replaced both with a porcelain type. This item is dangerous and poses a health risk in the even that exploding glass cause skin lacerations. I would under no circumstances recommend this item and believe that Amazon should refund me for both of the sinks I purchased and remove this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sink exploded for seemingly no reason","review":"I was excited to find this sink - exactly what I was looking for and a great price. It installed easily and worked great for a couple of weeks.

Have no idea why, but definitely won't buy another. Very strange!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality sink","review":"The sink is built solid, price is difficult to beat and the final result when watched with their waterfall faucet is very pleasing. The whole kit was less than $150 bucks, and it looks like a million dollar.

My teenaged daughter brushed her teeth on Christmas Eve and left the room 10 seconds before we heard a terrible explosion. We entered the room to find tiny shards of glass everywhere, even embedded in the walls! Not one piece was left attached. Never, never buy one of these sinks and if you have one, get rid of it. I am thankful that my daughter was not still in there. I can't even ponder what would have happened to her face and eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not from Italy, Poor Quality","review":"This necklace was not Italian as indicated.

The only downside is that this book (there are 2 volumes actually) is so large it is hard to manage. I got a copy for my 10 year old granddaughter for a trip we are taking this Summer. She has been dazzled and is working her way through (finding the photos that attract and then diving into the chapter text). It has also become an addiction for me. If you are going to Florence, get this book and read it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Photography with Wrong Lighting","review":"As a coffee table book-- it is OK -- big and colorful pictures...However, I was quite disappointed.Many oil paintings in this book are photographed with flash or just wrong lighting: glare seriously degrades the contrast and saturation of the images.The indoor sculpture photographs are horizontally lit. They appear flat and illegible.The poor lighting even ruined Michelangelo's works: the highlights appear where shadows should be.The photos of outdoor sculptures are great -- they are shot with natural lighting.Regrettably this ambitious project is not that great -- and if I had a chance to see it before buying, I would not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bra & skeleton for children???","review":"I love the idea of this book, but after buying it & studying it further, I have decided to trash it.

BUT when I saw the first page with the \\"see inside\\" feature, I was taken aback at the skull and bra. As an opening page??? Not for my young daughter. I'm disappointed, because I like Joan Steiner's books. I would buy it if those two elements were gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloween Skeleton?","review":"This book is very clever, the artist uses various objects in a 3D collage to create several Christmastime scenes: Winter Wonderland, The Nutcracker, Santa's Workshop, Grandma's Kitchen, Christmas Windows, Cathedral, Dollhouse, Toy Train, New Year's Eve. Be warned, however, that the objects themselves are not necessarily \\"Christmas-like\\"- In the very first scene, a winter landscape, a large Halloween Skeleton is used to create the mountains-- complete with creepy-looking skull, missing teeth, etc. This is something that can be very frightening to small children and you might want to take into consideration before purchasing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Show off?

The images are superior to anything I've yet seen and if you're tired of narration and/or music, needing nothing but the natural sounds, this is positively the best production on Glacier NP that is available and if you have a proper Blu-ray player and 720p+ monitor it should be strongly considered for a \\"demo disk\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the LP, not the CD","review":"I was contacted by the vendor to be told that this is not the CD of the show, but the LP.

Yes, it's inexpensive and you do get what you pay for but these did not even work. The metal is some soft steel and the jaws flex as you crimp yielding very poor crimps. Also, as this is meant for crimping pins I had assumed that the jaws would be designed correctly: one side is slightly larger than the other to crimp the insulation, and the other side, slightly smaller to crimp the bare wire. They are both the same size, even though the two piece jaw design could have easily accommodated the proper sizing, so the wire insulation gets smashed to crimp the bare wire or you don't smash the insulation and the bare wire is barely crimped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only two bucks, but....","review":"I am glad this book was only two bucks, as I found it to be virtually unreadable.

There are sections that greatly disturb. Even if you think the horrors of Nazism have all been learned, being reminded of some of the evil brings about new terror and pain. And there are sections when the narration seems to bog down in legal details, arguments, and discussions. Lawyers specializing in international law would find these sections to their liking.

The book could have been condensed to half its size, and that would have made for a much better read. You could skip a page or two and not miss anything important. I found myself bored with the repetition and rushing to get through it. Basically, it's a bunch of words speckled with a profound thought every 100 pages or so.

I purchased the RCA 2542RE1 phone for my 2 line business. I carefully researched the product, and read so many reviews. I really just felt like that there was NO WAY that a 4 line phone would not let you answer a call on line 1,(even though I had been warned) and someone else answer the ringing line on the 2nd phone- but it is true! As I am on line one, and line 2 is ringing, all I can do is let it ring- it will not even go to an answering machine- my customers probably think I run a shabby business! There were people who said this, but I just knew that they had to be wrong.....so, shame on me for not listening to what people said. DO NOT BUY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confirmation of Inferiority","review":"Thanks to all you on this page.

It's hard to overlook the strange production on this album. I would rank it 2 stars because under all this strange studio techno stuff there is some real music.

It's nothing sort of blasphemous. To have a fat and uncouth John Travolta portray the loyal Archangel Michael (whose name, by the way, means \\"who is as God\\") is just stupid. In the movie he drinks, smokes, leers at women and even sleeps with one. Very unangelic! Even if he does justify his actions by saying, \\"I'm an angel, not a saint,\\" it still dosen't make any sense. He is an angel, not a human and therefore above such behaviour.

Although the overture was written when Mendelssohn was 17 and the rest of the incidental music was written during his early 30s, the music blends together seamlessly and conveys a uniquely magical atmosphere. Unfortunately, few conductor's fully capture this fairy-like atmosphere, but Andre Previn does. The only conductor who compared with Previn in this music was the late Peter Maag, but Maag recorded only excerpts of this music, whereas Previn presents the complete score. Other pluses of this recording are the excellent singing (in English), both by the sopranos and by the children's choir.

It was a misgiuded build-up for some sweet stories, and fine films. \\"Gold\\" was well done, with the most graphic street stuff. \\"Boy\\" was OK, but there was some bizarre approach that ultimately rang true and satisfying. \\"Into the Night\\" was fine; the best was \\"Build\\", written, directed and starring the very attractive Greg Atkins. All of these films are about deception, and, getting past that, the gay life may survive. \\"Into the Night\\" may be the best depiction of it all. Recommended for the film purists, and, happily, doesn't include the horrors that real street hustlers face on a daily basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boys Briefs 4","review":"Not a DVD series Tha I really cared for.

Seems either he or his son would forget important things when they camped and then unable to get them back. Still it was very interesting and I bought his second novel about the Artic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"This is the story of Don Starkell's incredible 12,000 mile canoe Trip from Canda to Brazil using various river systems and unfortunately a lot of dangerous coastline. A journey he started with his two sons, Dana and Jeff. Starkell says at the beginning of this book \\"If I'd known we were going to make it, the challenge would not have been the same.\\" We, as the readers, of course know that he does complete his voyage - but it is by no means either straight forward or easy and in fact it contains many twists of fate along the way. I was quite surprised at just how good this book is - not just the story of the trip, but the writing. It is quite matter of fact and Don spares few punches about either his own behaviour or that of his sons. It is told mostly through what seem to be edited diary entries, there are good number of maps - each chapter has its own small map which makes following their physical progress much simpler. A very worthwhile and adventuresome read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone with interest in adventure","review":"This is an amazing account of courage and commitment to a long term goal. What I find remarkable about Starkell's style of writing is that he is very forthright about stating any errors of judgement he made during this expedition (as he also was in 'Paddle to the Arctic'). The man is obviously able to laugh at himself. Another interesting aspect of this book is how the father and son relationship is affected during the journey. My only complaints are related to the graphics, the text itself warrants 5 stars. These concerns are; a) there should be more photographs, b) there should be only 1 photograph to a page (especially with a paperback), c) the maps should be much more detailed. Any books by Starkell have alot of practical value to people who do backcountry travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for canoeing enthusiasts.","review":"Hard to imagine taking an adventure like this.

OH, and they weren't even the AIMCO brand that I received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panic Free is excellent.","review":"I highly recommend \\"Panic Free\\" for anyone with anxiety. Dr. Freeman presents a unique perspective. This expert is different from other writers of books on panic and anxiety in that she has suffered from panic attacks herself. This provides \\"Panic Free\\" an insight into how to recover which is the best I have read. She is also very savvy about medications, and helps to clarify how to work with your doctor or psychiatrist, or how to work without one. The book is very informative, and gives clear steps to help get over the feeling of being trapped. Try this one, it actually works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Perspective","review":"So far, I've read the book three times, gleaning more from it each time.Panic Free is an easy read. It addresses a very complex subject simply, yet comprehensively, and I'm happy to report that Dr. Freeman isn't \\"selling\\" any particular treatment or \\"easy fix\\".The author's unique perspective as both a clinician AND a patient provides remarkable, yet practical, insights into dealing with panic/anxiety attacks, regardless of source.Since I'm reluctant to lend my copy of the book to others for fear it might disappear, I plan to purchase several more copies to give to select friends. This is a very valuable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Found this one in the dollar vinyl bin at Amoeba. Got lucky. Great band. Previous reviewer summed it up nicely.

Cecil McBee, Stanley Clarke, Billy Hart, and Norman Connors along with what sounds like an army of African percussionists lay down an amazing groove while while the horns take it in turns to go wild. There are some hornless sections that focus on the Balophone as sort of African marimba. The first time I heard Black Unity, I played it over and over again for three days straight. With the exception of what sounds like some sort of electronic keyboard fading in and out with a droning chord, it's all acoustic. Sanders is amazing. He's doing with his sax, imagination, and circular breathing what Hendrix did with an electric guitar with a battery of electronic gadgets.If you are a fan of the Impulse label, especially the late 60's and early 70's then Black Unity is essential. The energy is incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gnawing at my nerves","review":"There are so many terrible horror films being put on the shelves each day - this is one of the ilk. A complete worthless film, that lacks entertainment value - well I was going to list what it lacks, but it lacks everything, so I will save you the time. Bad actors, a weak and recycled to hell plot, weak effects... in fact there is nothing worth mentioning - Simply put - don't waste you time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another too stupid to live slasher flick.","review":"My title says it all. I did not care for any of the characters in this movie (the over-sexed couple, the cheating boyfriend with the side girlfriend pregnant, the too stupid to know girlfriend, and the nice guy). The gory parts were over done. You could see the killers from miles away (the old woman with the bad teeth and the killer who looked like any hillbilly, who was probably the only likable person). You get to know what was the main ingredient in the food the old woman made. There was nothing humorous in this film. This film was just so unbelievable.There wasn't much of a story line and really after the first 1/2 hour you don't care. It's a shame because horror movies coming out of the UK were starting to get good. This one sets British films back."},{"rating":"2","title":"great new movie","review":"I have no idea why some people didn't like this movie. I thought it was very good.

Eaglen has a lovely instrument that is, at least as I hear it, devoid of any emotion whatsoever. She sings all the notes correctly, takes all the crescendos and diminuendos, etc., but I still don't hear any passion. I felt the same way when she sang Isolde in Chicago this past year. I sometime think she's only putting in her time, picking up her pay check, and then going home. I won't go out of my way to hear her again, either live or via recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Jane Eaglen's voice lacks the kind of sensuous quality and bloom required in this repertoire. Her singing is dry and square, and is without much charm. The accompaniment is of mediocre quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unidiomatic singing","review":"This album is disappointing, for Jane Eaglen's doesn't have the style, and in certain cases the voice, for these songs.

A local Tempe, AZ artist formerly of the band One. In Sleepwalker, Jamal & Co. present of a host of haunting and melancholy tunes, backed up by an incredible bass line. Jamal's signature reverb / pedal guitar compliments his sad and dreamy vocals in songs like \\"Pretty Soon Ill be getting Out of Here\\" and \\"Hey Jill\\". before Sleepwalker, Jamal was in a band called One with his sister Shamsi. It's too bad mercury records screwed this band up. Jamal if your out there, Id like to get my hands on any recored One tracks.

But this one has to be the most cheaply constructed mower ever made. Talk about flimsy... We took it out of the box yesterday and we were sorely disappointed with the quality. I don't even thnk it would take my toddlers weight leaning against it. It looks and feels like it would be the one needing the support, not my son. It is made from 1 piece of pressed plastic and is hollow underneath - really thin. We boxed it up and it goes back tomorrow. Don't buy this one - get a more durable one than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't a mower mow grass?","review":"My son has had this mower for 2 years.

Please consider this when looking to purchase this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junkiest toy of all times","review":"This toy arrived broken. Unfortunately I did not examine it carefully, so that was my own fault, but when I did and my ability to return it was 2 days beyond the limit, I realized that this is a toy that could never hold up to any sort of toddler use. It is made of the flimsiest plastic on earth! The handle has a little mechanism that is supposed to snap it in place during operation. On mine it was ruined just from being folded (as it's supposed to) during shipping, making the toy impossible to use. Even if it had not been broken, I would have been ashamed to give such utter junk to my child! It's dime-store value. Really, it's rare that I come across something this shabbily made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap construction","review":"I purchased this for my soon-to-be 4 year old and my 2 year old.

He achieves a nice balance b/w cynical observation of the aristocrat & melodramatic, even maudlin, sympathy. Lead actor Biswas' 1st name is pronounced \\"chubby\\", & indeed here he looks & acts like an overfed baby. Crisp, elegant cinematography, w/ lovely tracking shots, of the desolate palace w/ furniture all sold @ auction. The symbolism is rilly heavy-handed, but it's shot so well that one doesn't mind. Then there's the music: the zamindar blows the last of his fortune hiring the very best musicians, so we're treated to *3* scenes of complete songs by India's best musicians & dancers. Biswas IRL was basically tone-deaf w/ zero ear for music, so his convincing appreciation of it is a testament to his acting & Ray's direction. 8/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"A TIMELESS CLASSIC .","review":"This is one of Ray's best films.

I replaced those with the L-CUSH pads that are actually intended for the SR80 and they fit the SR60 just fine.

However as a novel, historical romance, I found it extremely lacking on character depth. Our southern belle spends the entire book trying to not-too-subtly get the overseer's son to bed her and wed her. I found her bold and brassy in her efforts. The love interest, bowie beckett, spends the book avoiding her obvious attempts to seduce him because he's \\"not good enough for her\\". A real creative story line. It was also short of realism.

Now there is maybe one or two pages in the entire book that will explain how to deal with clients. The rest of the book is just interviews of clients, but there is no real content on how to deal with situations like what to do if a client doesn't pay, or if a client asks for something different every time. These are real problems and a book that says \\"how to...\\" should actually provide information on ...well...\\"how to...\\". In a way it's inspirational, but once again, the companies as clients mentioned in the book are BIG NAMES...and 99.9% of us Graphic Designers work with the average Joe as customer. No good advice in the book sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Misleading title","review":"The title suggests that this books provides \\"guidance\\" and advice on client management for graphic designers. It however, is a very long collection of conversation style stories (told via interview questions) with client and designer (all very big names at that). The books does not contain any real collection of practices, principles, and/or tactical steps one can use. There's also no real organization to the book which definitely makes it \\"not a guide\\". It really feels as if the author is just showing off that she knows these big designers/clients well enough to chat and have coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"the same old thing","review":"I was disappointed in the book. The first part of the book was good. Being new to the business end of graphic design, I was looking for was information on how to deal with clients and start building a client base.

I want info on the how to build a relationship with clients, not how the big got bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"More mystery than fantasy","review":"Carroll is one of my favorite authors and he doesn't dissapoint with \\"Kissing The Beehive.\\" However, this novel is much more a straight mystery story than Carroll's other efforts that always seem to have several fantastical elements to them. I gave the book only four stars because it was missing that bizarre twist that seems to surface halfway through other Carroll novels (e.g., the dog talking in Land of Laughs). Regardless, I do recommend this book. As with all of Carroll's work, it keeps you totally engrossed in the story till the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Good Writing, But Preposterous Plot","review":"Kissing the Beehive starts well, but the storytelling deteriorates pretty quickly. It's a great premise for a book: a blocked writer goes home and finds the story of his career--a thirty-year-old murder mystery. But Carroll isn't able to sustain a credible storyline. Clues start arriving out of nowhere. His hero hooks up with an unstable woman (named Veronica Lake, if you can believe it) who seems to be an authorly creation rather than anything human or real. The denouement is clever, but it ultimately diminishes the book, since it's a little too neat. All in all, a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"2/3 of cLOUDDEAD produce an album that is just that... 2/3.","review":"I loved this album, I still do love it. Nothing has come along like the early Anticon label sounds since they hit. This album is great, it moves from many soundscapes, merging genres and taking the listener on a journey. The only problem is that, to continue this analogy, there are too many roads and not enough stop offs. What I mean by that is that the album is a little too broken up and doesn't sit with some of the really nice sounds long enough. But I guess that's the nature of experimental music - it sometimes only lasts an instant before your inspiration takes you somewhere else. In conclusion, fantastic album, just not quite as good as cLOUDDEAD (self titled and peel sessions, Ten not so good.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Goddess Longline Soft Touch Bra","review":"I did not like to product.

The first one is due to the author's constant reference to Judaism and Christianity. I would have preferred more information on Egyptian religion than Judaism or Christianity. The second reason why I did not like this book, is constant display of Greek and Hebrew? phrases.

There are only a handful of sections where the mystery figures heavily into the plot, and the story is mired down with many boring exchanges and side plots (not to mention several pointless characters).

Instead, the main character is an uninteresting young woman.About a quarter of the way into the book (I was reading it on Kindle), there is a long and confusing digression which just slows down the action. The denouement comes not in action but in other lengthy speeches.His previous works counted as literary \\"thrillers\\", but there are no thrills here.

From a prophetic view point (I read \\"Late Great\\" circa 1975) both of these books are also interesting because of his unpretentious writing style. While he cleary has firm religious beliefs (which I respect but do not always agree with) he does not write with an \\"I know it all\\" style, which is what turns me off with so many other authors who write prophetic books.

Not a volcano can explode, not a sun can be eclipsed without some Chicken Littles running around and squawking doom.

But what hurts me and hurts every Jew that I speak to, it the fact that Xians speak of all these pogroms and murders as if they were looking from the outside. If they only looked down at their hands they would see the blood of my people staining their finger nails. The fact that they so easily cast it off and give no second thought to their barbacity, and the murder and hatred of their ancestor is insulting. A fell good book for murderers and oppressor as so how all this was ment to be and the world is good.

The multicultural representation of twins as well as the inclusion of which twin is older by how many minutes makes these full-page black and white photos exceptional works of art and study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difference and Sameness","review":"Twins is as compelling to me as almost any book of photographic portraits I have seen .. Nagel, Sander, Arbus .. and is a perfect example of the ability of the camera, in the right hands, to go beyond representation. You can usefully pour over these images of apparently identical human twins for hours, to explore the layers of difference, emotion, experience, all the traces that life leaves as evidence of living.It brings to mind Jean Cocteau's statement that after the age of 30 a person is responsible for their own face. On these 20x24 Polaroids every nuance of that responsibility is made clear.If you have any love of"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing How-to Treatise on Living a Self-Absorbed Life","review":"Though drawn to Lambert's book as an amateur sculler, I saw any value of his informative dribbles on rowing repeatedly negated by his arrogance in offering Lessons on (Leading a Self-Absorbed) Life. A disappointing sinker, unlike the comparably intended work of Richard Bode."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a competitive rower, don't waste you time.","review":"Over the top and over writen!

I had trouble laying it down. The suspense in the race which Lambert outlines so beautifully held me spellbound. The lessons in life which were outlined were beautifully phrased. I really think this book could be a best seller if it is promoted properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind over water Lessons on life from the art of rowing","review":"Craig Lambert's Book 'Mind over water: Lessons on life from the art of rowing' attempts to explain how rowing can be a metaphor for life. 'attempts' being the key word there. Being a rower myself, I found that his ideas were so far fetched and in some cases I had no idea how they related to both life and the sport of rowing that we both share. I had to skip over many of the parts that were wordy, and it seems many of the paragraphs could be re-written to be half the length. I am not an english Major, but I did notice that he Author has not organized his thoughts very well. I found that one idea many times did not follow the next. Lambert included some unecessary bits of information such as where he played as a child, and much about his career as an adult. As much as I disliked Craig Lambert's book, he did at least use the correct rowing terminology. But all in all I would not reccomend ambert's book to my fellow crewmates."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Beginners Only","review":"Lambert's account of rowing, though seemingly poetic to the uninitiated, will dissappoint any avid rower for its sheer lack of \\"having been there\\" sentiment. The book is Lambert's chance to spout off about the magic that he sees in rowing and how lessons learned in the sport can be applied universally to any challenge in life. If you can look past his arrogance, without hesitation I recommend the book to non-rowers or novices who will see Lambert's lessons for what they are worth. But I strongly warn off any experienced or competitive rowers because you will be disgusted by Lambert's butchery of the sport. Try The Amatures instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for athlete","review":"This will be a short review. To use an example visit the sample extract that is offered on this web site. The author mentions a double head. He builds it up as something mythic and impossible. This is a joke. Six miles is nothing. Just nothing. Its a warm up for some. Sports writing is not easy but effort should be made to represent the true hardships of a sport, because if you fake it you also fake the joy that can be derived from the sport. Rowing is tough and you learn a lot about yourself from it but limiting it to oh its really cold in the morning and the hagiographies of US olympians is boring and misguided. I suggest Lambert visit a few more boat clubs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcore Fans Only!","review":"One thing you need to know before buying any interview CD is how much you like the artist you're paying to hear talk.

The music ranges from selections by John Dowland to American spirituals, Bach/Gounod, Villa-Lobos, Granados and some Spanish folk songs.

It's a Bonnie & Clyde movie with an appearance by Dracula. If you're looking for a vampire movie (as I was), get over it.

The author's focus, however, is on the physical discomforts at Wat Pah Nanachat in Thailand and the all-too-human faults that commonly arise in groups of people gathered for whatever reason, even a 'higher purpose'. Kind of interesting for readers that may not expect such goings on in ashram life.

When I first installed it, it dribbled water between the housing and the top. I then try tightening it more. It slowed a bit, but stilled leaked. I decided not to worry about a small leak. Seeing that the filter was dirty, I went to change the element. In doing so, it was on so tight that the entire pvc pipe snapped in two.

Purchased it locally (not on sale) for $23 and change. No the filter itself does not leak. The leak came from where the copper pipe fittings screw into the plastic housing. I had the same problem with the Omni 15 years ago. You tighten them just so far in fear on cracking the plastic if you go to far. You get it installed then turn on the water only to find a very slow leak coming out between the pipe fitting and filter housing. So you drain the whole house again tighten them a little more, refill the pipes and it still leaks. I finally gave up and let it leak just a little. The same thing I did with the Omni where it eventually sealed itself probably with tiny little minerals from the water. I'm sure the filter will work fine for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"Works great! I was really surprised to find out just how much crud was in our water!

We had no water softener or filter system. I first installed a water softener in hopes that would take care of most of the hard water issues.

After installing this product it has eliminated all signs of rust and other contaminants in our water. My water now feels and tasted great, all off a $40 filter system. Cant go wrong with that. My only tip would be to go out and buy some plumbers pipe compound to use to seal the connections rather than the plumbers tape provided. Had a issue with a small drip from the end of the filter that the water exits from at first. just removed the connection and added pipe compounded and fixed the problem All in all a fantastic product"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all relative","review":"Currently have one installed (on outlet from water heater, to trap scale -- !) by plumber. Always a pain to change filter: cannot unscrew canister w/o threatening to break pipes, so have to remove the whole unit and get it down on the floor and use two arms and a leg to remove the canister. Developed a slow leak around the canister threads (6-7 years old?) and now a fast leak from the top valve, so I guess I'll replace with the same model -- cause you should read the reviews on the Whirlpool equivalent. At least the canister hasn't exploded on this one yet.

The old one started leaking around the pipe fittings (after five years without a problem). I could not get the old one to stop leaking so I got this Culligan unit, which is very similar, to replace it. Well, this one leaked from where the clear housing screws into the main housing, where the gasket is.

He's certainly knowledgeable, but a woman's perspective might seem more valuable. More importantly, though, the reason a woman's self-confidence is affected every time she looks in the mirror (as the book's description claims is the case) is becuase our society mandates a ridiculously strict and unrealistic standard of beauty. How about a fitness book that emphasizes the fact that people come in all shapes and sizes and that a woman doesn't have to resemble a model to be beautiful--clothed or naked. That would be truly positive and beneficial for women to realize.

I've used this book to find amazing places (like Apremont-la-foret and the Butte de Vaquois just to name two) and put a name to places I've visited but didn't, at the time, know what they were. If you're a Great War buff, or even just interested, this book is essential. You'll get more detail in the Holt's guides, Middlebrook's stunningly clear guide to the Somme, or the terrific Leo Cooper Battleground Europe series.

Mine came in the mail and I was so disappointed I went back and looked to see if I had made a mistake, but I hadn't. The cover of the item is the ONLY place one would see that this is a supplement. Quite misleading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken the day after Christmas","review":"I bought the happy co electric head tripper for my husband for Christmas. He has wanted ones that we've seen in the mall, so this seem to be a good one. Well, the plastic pieces that fit into the slot were very flemsy. We had to be careful not to snap it trying to get it in. Once we got it in, the head tripper felt great. It really did send goosebumps down my spine. THe only problem is the purple plastic piece broke off, litterally the next day after giving it to him. It first was bent and then finally broke all the way off. I do not recommend this product. I was thinking of getting the ting ting motorized head massager to replace them. You can still use the happy head tripper it is just one tong short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels great but...","review":"This product feels amazing.

The plastic seems very sturdy, other reviews said the plastic broke but I am sure they must've been using it wrong because I they fit right in and pull out with a little tug.Overall, I'm happy with this product because it feels really nice, but my family has nicknamed it the \\"dildo head massager\\" because the vibrating part looks like a sex toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good for people with small heads","review":"might have been nice, but just went over my cheeks.

The \\"prongs\\" are made of some sort of cheap plastic that enables the product to be packaged using less space because the prongs come disassembled.

I would not recommend buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"It should be noted in the description of this item that this product also doubles as a vibrator!

Just be forewarned, customers, this item is not for the easily offended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful.","review":"This is a good account of traveling through Russia in recent times. For a similar travel narrative try Tent Life in Siberia: An Incredible Account of Siberian Adventure, Travel, and Survival - minus 120 years and a vehicle, but with the engaging addition of battling against the brutality of the Siberian climate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Among the long-winded","review":"I should preface my review by making it clear that I am not generally a fan of hyper-descriptive, verbose writers in the vein of Hemingway. That said/understood, I found Among the Russians to be so long-winded and detail oriented (in terms of describing places, buildings, forests, etc) that it was difficult to get a sense of the people. He interjects tales of his human interactions sparingly and a bit chaotically, so it isn't the type of book that I enjoy. A balance of description, history, and on-the-ground human interaction is key in making a book like this readable and entertaining. His style misses this by quite a bit. That said, it is an interesting account of 1980's Soviet Russia. It is what it is, but it's definitely not my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"courtneys review on tracy beaker age 10","review":"tracy beaker is my fantasy book of my whole childhood starting from 5 years old,im 10 now and just cant stop reading it.Im going to give it five stars because it has loads of exiting words and the text is smashing.i cant seem too work out though why the author sometimes puts in words and they says the oppisitething for example she writes tracy beaker likes dogs and then she dont.I admire jaqueline willsons books especially tracy beaker.I bet im a number 1 fan and the reason why is all i ever do is either sit down and read tracy beaker or sit on my inflatable sofa and look on the internet and read other peoples reviews on tracy beaker.by courtneyphoenix classyr6"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant !","review":"This is another excellent book by Jacqueline Wilson it's funny and humourous and children and adults alike will thoroughly enjoy it.

The story of a girl who falls from the embraces of sanity into the bell jar where life takes on a completely different view. This book should come handy with a pack of razor blades. I never read a book that has shaped my life as much as this one. Towards the end I stopped feeling symapathy for the character as I felt like I was having a pity party. Plath's writing style reminds me of Salinger possessed by the spirit of Poe. A great book to read just don't stay in house alone after reading it"},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised...","review":"Very Happy. The prices was great. The item came quicker than predicted and was in excellent condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big let down!","review":"I had high expectations of this book because Sylvia Plath came highly recommended by a reliable source, but I was counting the pages until I was done, painfully waiting for the book to get interesting and it never happened. It is easily in the top 3 worse books I've ever read category."},{"rating":"2","title":"look into the mirror","review":"I was slightly disappointed with this book. I enjoyed it thoroughly, but I've always been told how incredible it is and how true it is. As someone who suffers from depression, I was kind of bothered by it. I realize it is a different time and and completely different world for women, but I didn't find it to be quite as accurate as it has been portrayed. I lovely read, yes. Beautifully written, yes. Accurate portrayal of depression, eh, yeah ... weak yes. Dark and moving, yes.I guess it just lost points because everyone has always talked it up ... and I had such high standards for it ... standards it failed to meet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true character study that leaves you stunned","review":"What a wonderful insight into the mind of someone who is tortured by depression. Plath does a good job of helping you to empathize with the main character so much that it makes you wonder if you could end up in the same state, which emphasizes the insidiousness of mental illness. This book made me almost cry just because of the beautiful way she describes her pain and feelings of isolation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tight grasp on reality","review":"Sylvia Plath , is the most realistic writer I've ever read.

Normally I have a list of books waiting to be read, but for some reason I bypassed them and read this book.Wow! An incredible read! It was so well written, so real. I kept saying, \\"but she is so sane!\\" and then everything turned, like the weather sometimes does... I recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read if you're already down, but great insight.","review":"Sylvia really writes from a \\"someone who gets it\\" perspective.

I found myself relating to her immediately as she drew my mind further and further onto the pages of this novel.***Caution: Unfortunately, I was already at a low point in my emotional cycles (BPD and BD), so when she was contemplating suicide, so was I. By continuing reading I pushed myself all the way over the edge and woke up alive the next day in the ICU at a hospital.

It is a novel that I plan to keep on my bookshelf indefinitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept my interest","review":"At first, the main character's psyhcosis seemed almost logical. Then, slowly Ester Greenwood lost touch. Plath did a great job of leading the reader along with Ester as she experienced it. I found myself really pulling for her and hoping that she would get better. It is a stomach turning coincidence that Ester feared the Bell Jar would return because it certainly did for the author. It was a very interesting read and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the bell jar","review":"Even if you do not know anything about the author, Sylvia Plath, and her troubled life, it is still very easy to get into the book, The Bell Jar. The reason is, we have all at one time in our life felt like we were trapped, and plath's sutle genius shines through this book. It has an almost naive quality about it. The main character of Esther is like the voice inside all of our heads. i doubt very much that books such as Prozac Nation would have ever been printed if Plath hadn't done it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved The Bell Jar","review":"I read this book over the summer for school and I really loved it.

A must read for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the classics in modern literature","review":"I first read this book way back when, when I was a teenager. I absolutely loved it then, and it really holds up as a classic. Yes, it's a feminist novel, and yes, it's angsty, but it's also well-written, moving, and realistic. Plath was one of a kind, and the world is just a little colder without her in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Story","review":"This is an interesting story about a talented woman. It is not a feel good book. It is well written and a sad but true story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling, uncanny and sadly realistic tale","review":"Thrilling because extreme and powerful; uncanny because real and unreal, still and restless at the same time, and sadly realistic because we enter a state of mind which rings a bell in each of us: it rings onto our own \\"bell Jar\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was An Ok Psychological Thriller","review":"Full, non-spoiler review courtesy at ~ Book & Movie Dimension a Blog ~The Bell Jar written by Sylvia Plath is a book that I'm very glad toward mt current Literature teacher for pushing me to read. It examines how too much pressure from society can a young woman. She spirals through a long journey through which realizes she has never done what she has wanted in life but what others wanted. This pushes her to descend into a dark abyss of painful despair. It is a sort of psychological classic type book. Sylvia Plath is remarked to have this book as her crowning achievement. She wrote some other books as welland tons of poetry. I'd say it is an ok book for those into this genre. I liked it but it isn't one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad!","review":"Too bad, I was excited to read this book after reading a biography of her by Alexander_______. However, the book left me dissappointed. I could not understand anything; while reading, my mind kept wandering. That is a clear sign to me that the book could not grab my attention and it would be a waste of time to try to read the whole book. I just could not follow the writing at all. There was no plot, no flow that lead me from one event to the other.I read some of the other reviews from readers who also did not like the book. Some people felt that the book was too depressing and too self indulgent. That is the whole point of depression. Depression leads the mind inside oneself and finds fault with the world around it or finds fault about him or herself. It makes sense that her book shows the main character as someone who was self-absorbed. That's part of what depression is."},{"rating":"1","title":"the bell jar","review":"Although this book had some clever imagery and imaginative descriptions, the plot was almost non-existent. There is not one actual event throughout the novel. I could not empathise with the main character, but it did give me some insight into the minds of depressed people, because her life seemed to be one long, torturous toil, even though she really seemed to have no obvious reason for complaint. Even though the focus of the novel never strays from the main character, by the end of the novel, I barely felt I knew her at all; her depression seemed to consume any other personal qualities she may originally have had. As a fanatical reader, I felt I had to read it because it is a classic, but after doing so, I think it would have been best avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Dull, boring, & overrated. Why are so many reviewers in love with this book? Is it because the author killed herself in real life? It certainly can't be the quality of the writing or story. Imagine if you wrote a book about your day to day life, getting up in the morning, including your thoughts on breakfast, your discussions with neighbors, ... etc. Boring right? To me this book was just that, a mundane description of a mundane life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I expected","review":"I purchased two copies, one for my daughter and one as a Gift for her Literature teacher. We are very happy with the books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good untill page 128...","review":"Ya know how an artist's work isn't worth much until he/she dies? Well this is what happened here. Now I see why it wasn't going to be published when she was alive. Because it is BORING!(The book was published 6 weeks after Sylvia Plath committed suicide. Things always sell better after they are dead.) The entire first half of the book is so monotoned I found myself putting the book down quite often. I kept thinking \\"when will she go insane and be interesting?\\" I have to say that her description of things was intelligently written it was just so BORING!Let me sum the book up for you and save you the money....girl gets job in NY, girl meets boy, girl dumps boy, girl goes slightly insane, girl goes into a rehab/asylum, girl is up for getting out of the asylum, book ends......just like that! The worst ending ever!I really am torn by giving authors a poor rating because I know how hard they work on their writing but this book was just arrrgghhh boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of expectations of \\"brilliance\\"","review":"I am almost sorry to say that my reading of Sylvia Plath's novel \\"The Bell Jar\\" was not nearly as moving or thought-provoking as it seems to be for so many. In my opinion, \\"The Bell Jar\\"'s Esther Greenwood is entirely unsympathetic, to the detriment of the novel. While I recognize the necessity of emphasizing her deterioration, I found her to be overly melodramatic and weak (while still recognizing her \\"condition\\"), and I loathed her from the start. While I will allow that Plath's prose is more eloquent than her poetry I failed to find evidence of the brilliance so often extolled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Moving","review":"I read The Bell Jar for a research paper on Sylvia Plath. As I researched info on her life, I was amazed at the events that happened to her that ended up in the novel. The first part of the novel is very funny. The humor slows down at the climax, and stays there for a bit during the conclusion. However, by the end of the book, I felt that I had read everything that was happening before. It was a lot like Girl, Interrupted's hospital, and I realize that this book was the forerunner for these psychological memoirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"poetic language and character make this novel a classic","review":"this is a wonderful novel. the language is beautiful and poetic which is one of the ways that it is a different story than catcher in the rye. esther greenwood typifies a lot of 19-20 year olds in the fact that at times we all feel alone and trapped in a world that we look at through a \\"bell jar\\". even if this wasn't based on plath's life, it is not a far fetched story and the descriptive and poetic elements really bring this novel to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking Through Sylvia Plath's Shoes...","review":"This is an incredible book which I read during the summer, the book is about Esther, although much of it was based on the author's life. The book is set in the 1950's, when Esther was nineteen. During that time she had a metal breakdown and ended up in a mental institution. Don't let that scare you, the book is very deep and will make you feel like you're actually living everything that is going on. Sylvia Plath was a very good author, she had the gift of only writing a few words that could tell an entire story, I was able to finish it in two nights. The only ironic thing about the book was that six months after it was published, Sylvia was \\"sucked back into the Bell Jar\\" and commited suicide. This is a book like no other that will leave you thinking for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a moving experience","review":"Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar is one of the most moving and enlightening novels I have ever had the pleasure to read. Her honesty and patience in relating such personal (and obviousely autobiograohical) events is startling and hugely admirable.The compassion it evokes in the reader is deeply powerful but the relationship it establishes with the reader is even more powerful and it will sit on your bookshelf for decades to come like an old, reassuring friend. I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"belljar1","review":"Read a library copy of Bell Jar and had to have it. It felt like I was side by side with her, all the way down. It seemed so clear what she was saying, it was spooky. Now I can re-read the book and notate on every page. Books I REALLY like I must write in. Feels like I know her. I always want to understand, or try to, the mental and emotional trials of struggling, highly intelligent individuals. Bell Jar is on the list, and not overwhelming. On the way to Infinite Jest."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bell Jar","review":"An amazing book, which opens your eyes to how mental illness creeps up and affects everyone. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly wonderful!","review":"This book was really astounding. It had sort of a simple story going to it, but there were so many deeper meanings thrown into the novel. This book was so amazingly deep, but so easy to read. I finished reading it in two days. I would definately recommend this book to everyone. I personally didn't care for Plath's poetry when we studied it in class, but I really enjoyed her book. So, whether you like Plath's poetry or not if you like a book that is deep, yet a fast read, I would definately read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle, rational, insane.","review":"Plath's story may leave you with the sense that a sane and healthy mind is much more of a fragile thing than you expected. By turns entertaining, funny, dark, and poetic; Plath's writing infuses her character with genuine humanity. She allows us a unique insight into an unwell mind. Strangely enough, I often found myself cracking a slow smile as I read the thoughts of a completely rational character whose descent into insanity seemed so natural and reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Book","review":"\\"The Bell Jar\\" by Silvia Plath, is a book about a girl named Esther Greenwood. She begins to go crazy after she returns home to Boston, from her summer job in New York. She finds that unreality is taking over her life. She makes several suicide attempts and is taken to a mental hospital to be treated.I would highly reccommend \\"The Bell Jar\\". The author writes in an excellent style that makes Esther Greenwood's insanity seem so real. This is a tragic but wonderful and interesting book of how Esther lives her life with her insanity. She undergoes shock treatments at a mental hospital, but along the way, she meets new people and recalls back on some past experiences. I can guarantee that anyone who reads this book will love it just as I did, and will not be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madness and Brilliance","review":"The Bell Jar is a stark narrative about depression, and the power it has to completely immobilize protagonist Esther Greenwood and throw her into insanity. The Bell Jar's prose is easy to read, and yet Sylvia Plath's writing style is highly sophisticated and exact, which is startling considering the nearness of her own suicide. Esther Greenwood begins an ambitious and talented young writer, working for a beauty magazine in New York, and attending college on a full scholarship. Her sorrow and madness begin to surface, and she soon finds herself trapped in a revolving door of mental asylums. The interesting thing here is way the story is told; unflinchingly and without remorse. I could hear Plath's cold, spare, incisive voice behind that of Miss Greenwood - hurting and ready to die. The Bell Jar can be read as a fierce indictment on depression. It is a brilliant, haunting, frightening work, and it held my interest intensely the whole way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic Catcher","review":"The story can be compared to Catcher In The Rye in that the main characters of both stories are similarly out of place in society. They feel as though there is something in life that is missing, but continue living not knowing what it is until they eventually have a mental breakdown. Sylvia Plath, however, writes in a much more poetic language than Salinger. Her words could be violently beautiful, or peacefully bloody, but what can one expect from a novel by a poet."},{"rating":"2","title":"love Sylvia Plath's work","review":"I love Sylvia Plath's work.

It has stayed with me through the years and now a 30 something wife and mother I understand it even more. Now as then when I read this book I \\"feel\\" the bell jar surround me. For a writer to get inside ones head that way I think is the sign of a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An account of one girl's experiences with severe depression.","review":"The Bell Jar is even more powerful because it is an autobiographical piece. I would recommend it to anyone who has doubted the humanity of mental illness, to anyone who needs to open their eyes to the terrifying, ever-present pain of depression. The Bell Jar is not only a well written novel, but extremely good therapy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slowest book ever","review":"Plath gets you in tune with only one character throughout this book. She overly describes everything and slows down the whole story. After reading this book, I will never buy another Sylvia Plath story, but I do want her collected poems. Her description of places and events throughout the story were fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in the Bell Jar","review":"While many people rave about this story I fail to see where it's brilliance is. I read it upon recommendation by a friend. And while I did enjoy the style in which it was written, overall this book left me feeling empty. I felt I had wasted my time. Mostly because I could not at all sympathize with the main character except in the most extreme of cicumstances, such as the shock therapy. Other than those few moments, I did not feel like she was subject to any unusually cruel acts or treatment. The majority of my disappointment came in the end. I felt there wasn't any kind of payoff, no real conclusion.Maybe I was distracted by all the little notes my friend had written in the book. Maybe it's simply because I'm a guy (which I sincerely doubt.) Personally, I would much rather read Ms. Plath's poetry than trudge this this little volume again.I give it two stars, for while I didn't necessarily enjoy the plot, the prose were downright hilarious at times!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I don't get it.","review":"The other night A&E Classroom ran an excellent biography of Sylvia Plath. I was very moved by the story of this brilliant woman who died so young and so tragically. I knew of her name from long ago having grown up just down the road from Smith; however, I never read any of her work. I just read The Bell Jar. While I will never forget the tormented story of Esther Greenwood, I would not rate this as a masterpiece of fiction. Perhaps the real talent is in her poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Bridget","review":"Before Bridget Jones, before Girls Guide, there was The Bell Jar. The ultimate lost-girl in the big city novel. Love, career, and complete mental collapse keep you turning with manic speed. This vivid story is as modern and cool today as it was then.

Also recommended for teenage readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"If you like great writing, you'll like this book. It is honest and direct and evocative and powerful. Utterly unpretentious.This is in no way a book about suicide, the way some people who haven't read it seem to think, though it does chronicle an episode of what must have been the same vulnerability that later resulted in her untimely death.If you like powerful poetry, get Ariel, which contains the poems Plath was writing when she died. I can only read one or two a day, then I have to stop and think about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"I am 42 years old and have just read The Bell Jar for the first time. This is the story of a young woman in the 50's who did not fit the mold of what society at that time dictated that a woman should be. She could not accept this, and in the beginning, it was hard to feel sorry for her because it seemed she gave up too easily. She wanted to be a writer, she didn't get into the writing class, and instead of taking some other course and trying the writing course again later, she gave up and slipped into depression. Esther's character was starkly contrasted by the other successful women characters. There were women doctors, women psychiatrists, women editors. Surely these characters also had gone up against the same pressures and societal dictate that Esther experienced. Yet they overcame their obstacles whereas Esther succumbed to defeat. The book was fascinating and every well written. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bell Jar","review":"The Bell Jar was a very serious book about a young woman deciding to die with herself as the killer. I must admit I usually don't read such heavy books... the storyline was a bit depressing and twisted but the book was written amazingly-- only Plath could turn a serious and depressing storyline into a wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":":)","review":"I liked this novel. Not necessarily entirely credible from the psychological point of view, because the transition from ambitious college girl to depressed, blase poet isn't written all too well. What was done very, *very* well, though, was the language. The descriptions, analogies, and metaphors used were very beautiful and poetic. Very real in that sense..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfull story","review":"I totally enjoyed the Bell Jar, it's a wonderfull book and the way the writer describes things is so realistic. My native language isn't english, but I didn't have any problems with the book. It's easy to read. It's so strange when you realise that the writer, Sylvia Plath, commited suicide after writing the book. The ideas described in the book are really hers. That makes it a biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be overlooked","review":"Remembering whether I read this before or not was difficult so I purchased it for my Kindle & loved every page of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart renching novel that is very realistic","review":"Sylvia Plath did such a wonderful job writing this novel about the psycic breakdown of a woman. Unfortunately Plath's life would slightly mimick the character in the book. But, though its horrible to say this, Plath's own mental breakdown made this book so good and realistic. As thoughts poor threw Esther's mind, it's so vivid and realistic it's almost scarry. Esther had a horrible life being thrown from one mental intistuition to the next and this novel makes certain that the reader feels the majority of the emotions Esther feel herself. Fear, anticipation, sadness, confusion, all poor through your mind through reading this book just as they do for Esther. This is a sad novel that will make you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need to recommend this to Everyone!","review":"This was beautifully written. The way Plath flexes the words to describe the smallest emotional experience is so right on the money, it felt like Ester's experiences were mine own. I just finished The Graduate, and found the depression and weakness of the main character disgusting and pathetic. After reading/listening to Maggie Gyllenhaal bring this book to life, the disgusting depression that The Graduate presented was clearly a failed attempt to make the transition from college to real life and the depression that can come with it tangible for the reader. I wish Sylvia Plath had written more. I love her style, the elegant transitions, and the honey she offers to pull you in. OH and Gyllenhaal's performance is A+ work. Her voice was very easy to follow, her cadence was perfect and the way she took on the character made me feel like I was living the whole thing. LOVED IT it is like a great movie...only longer! Maybe I'll listen again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absoluty Amazing...","review":"This is an amazing book. Your heart really goes out to Plath for having the strength of describing what she's been through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I read this book in highschool and it nearly ruined modern fiction for me. I'm older now, have a masters degree in English, and I still find this book a boring, uninteresting, waste of time. To me Plath tries too hard to come across broken and tragic in her writing. Why do so many people think that a character's descent into madness makes for good reading? Wally Lamb's She's Come Undone is equally a waste of time in this regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"The Bell Jar is a story of a teenage girl, Ester Greenwood, who dives deeper and deeper into depression, rejection & suicidal thoughts. The novel starts out with Ester's internship in NYC for a magazine, all seems normal. However, when Ester returns home she is on a downward spiral, eventually going through with her suicide thoughts and ending up in an instutition.Not having suffered from depression and self-esteem issues, it was hard for me to relate to Ester and her troubles.The Bell Jar is a a very sad tale of depression, thoughts of suicide, belonging and self-worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"For girls","review":"The same way that \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is centered around a boy. \\"The Bell Jar\\" is centered around a girl in the 1960s.From a guys point of view this book is boring.It's about these lame dinners and the girl getting sick, and her pre-occupied thoughts about some dude.This book is outdated and just plain boring. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was This Really Meant to Be Published?","review":"Sylvia Plath was a mentally sick person who was encouraged by one of her psychiatrists to write. I have seen photographs of her and Ted Hughes, and Sylvia is in an appaling state. I can't even relate what Sylvia is doing in one of the photographs. It's sad. I hope that she found some comfort in writing, but honestly, was this meant to be published?It's not a surprise that many readers find this repulsive. English teachers/professors should not require students to read this; it goes against every basic human tendency to be happy and not to be anti-life. I don't know how else to put this but the best writers aren't suicides. Don't read them. Their opus is one long goodbye note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canceled order","review":"Waited too long for Amazon to send this book so I canceled the order. I'll purchase somewhere close to home without a month wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read The Bell Jar","review":"The Bell Jar is an exceptional book. From the moment I began reading it, I fould it hard to put it down. The book gives a poignant recount of a girl's battle with depression. I thought it was a very moving, touching, and sometimes even humorous story. It was at no time dull or boring. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"I read this because it is on a list of the 150 most influential books of this century. It is a book that should be read, tho its subject matter does not fail to disturb. It is flawlessly written, and very smooth reading. You will not regret having used the small amount of time necessary to read this classic work on the descent into madness."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was more than I expected","review":"I loved this book. The writing is unique and every chapter flows right in the next. I did not want to put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truimph !!!!","review":"Sylvia Plath's novel is her only one and after reading it one can understand why. Bell Jar explores the human mind through Esther Greenwood (who is Plath herself, indeed) and the society around her. Bordering on a delicate balance between sanity and insanity, Bell Jar is probing, questioning, dark and at times scary. But so very real at all times. Plath pours out a lifetime through Esther in Bell Jar. It's a pity there aren't too many novels like Bell Jar, but then it's a greater pity there was only one Sylvia Plath."},{"rating":"2","title":"A confused journey","review":"This book really takes you along with this tortured soul's journey into madness. I was amazed at how my own mind fell into the same confused patterns of the main character. A testement to the outstanding writing skill of the author. I think the experience is enhanced by researching and understanding a little about Plath before reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Chapter's are all out of order, pages missing! Do not buy!","review":"I ordered this book for my english 101 class in college, we just started getting into the later chapters of The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. I ordered the book because it would be cheaper then buying it at the local book store. Well, once you hit chapter 7 the book skips back to chapter 5? then keeps going to 6 and skips back to page 112. I'm missing a good 3 chapters of the book! I'm very unhappy as I expected to have the full, undamaged version of the book. Since it's closer to the end its been 30 days and they wont let me return it. I suggest not ordering from this company, as they do no check out the condition that the merchandise is in. Good Luck to finding a good copy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is There a Point Here?","review":"People who claim this is one of the best books they've ever read clearly have not read many books.Plath's description of her main character's descent into crippling depression is unremarkable and hardly credible, made even more so by the fact that Esther's life is so dull to begin with. When did she undergo the electroshock therapy--on page 1 or page 101? We can't tell because Esther's a bore right from the start and there's no difference in her character between \\"before\\" and \\"after.\\" Plath does an unenviable job of turning her tumultuous life into a tedious collection of journal entries of a lifeless, forgettable character. The ambiguous ending only serves to punctuate the lack of anything creditable about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type of read","review":"This was not my type of book. After reading \\"An Unquiet Mind\\" and \\"Girl Interrupted\\" , I should have realized this is not a book that was going to keep my interest. The writing is very choppy. The time and place changes through out the book and it is difficult to follow at times. I do think the story of Sylvia Plath is very interesting. And sad. I would probably be more interested in reading a book about her written by someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the fuss about?","review":"For most of my adult life (I am 49) people who get to know me tell me that I would absolutely love this book. I finally got round to reading it recently. What a disappointment. What is it all about? She repeats herself several times and I don't understand what it means at all. Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sylvia Plath Passes the Buck","review":"Considering its publication date, The Bell Jar's autobiographical tale of Sylvia Plath's descent into depression and insanity is an important book. However, the insinuations contained in it are disturbing. The Bell Jar seems to villify men in general for their lack of understanding. Rather than acknowledge that some people in general are distant, Plath turns men into whipping posts. It should be obvious to the unbiased reader, however, that Plath was just plain old insane. This reviewer feels bad for Ted Hughes, Plath's husband who has been blamed by two generations of literary feminists for Plath's suicide. Reading The Bell Jar should exonerate Hughes-- his wife was, unfortunately, mentally ill independent of his actions. Sylvia Plath should have taken responsibility for her own actions and her own condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not readable for a 60+ year old.","review":"I could not relate to this book at all, and it was recommended by a good, albeit much younger, friend. So I wanted to enjoy it. Luckily I \\"left\\" it to read \\"Wading Home.\\" See my review. Perhaps it w//h/been like Wally Lamb's book about the compulsive overeater, which really \\"got there\\" at the end, but I haven't the patience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Salinger clone.","review":"Robert Taubman of the New Statesman mistakenly said \\"The Bell Jar\\" was \\"the first feminine novel in a Salinger mood\\". On reading the books first third you'll find yourself agreeing. Plath takes us down a path, seeming to say, \\"Look ahead. This will lead us to the end.\\" Then we're repeatedly taken off of that path, down apparent detours without meaning or relevance. This is a deception.By the time you reach the halfway point you'll see that what seems to be important is only a grounding place for what surrounds it. What seems to be rambling is actually what is important. Eventually we abandon the original path completely, and find that all of those supposed meaningless detours were the true path all along, that the story's real importance lies within them."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"I hate reading, and usually have to be forced to read for school, but when I sat down with the Bell Jar, I read the first 150 pages in three days! The way that the author presents her stories and situations, not only do you get a detailed understanding of what she is going through, but you start to wonder what is ACTUALLY wrong with her. You come to a point when you don't consider her crazy, but you look at her as misunderstood! I love this book, and I wish that it had never ended! I know that everyone will love it, boys, girls, young, and old! This book should be read by all, although not through school, at some time or another! WOW!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting novel","review":"The Bell Jar was a novel of which was unusual than anything that I have ever read. It was easy reading, but it has so many different aspects to it. Esther's life takes a very drastic turn- she goes from living a lavish life in New York City, and then in a instant she has this mental illness which takes over her life. I just thought this novel was well-written, very emotional, and it's an interesting topic to write about. Not many people are comfortable with discussing mental illness. I truly recommend this novel as it will provide with a new meaning towards life and how one lives with a mental illness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring To All Fellow High School Students","review":"In a simple phrase, this book was awe inspiring. After I read the last page, I broke down in tears it was so incredible. I dont think I've ever read another book with such realism and emotion. Silvia Plath truly outdid herself when she wrote The Bell Jar. I laughed, I cried, I felt her pain as if it were my own. Truly miraculous for anyone who lays eyes on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure, raw emotion","review":"This is the most amazing book and I usually don't even enjoy fiction. Sylvia Plath speaks straight from her heart through the main character 'Ester.' Plath's writing style is incredible and she communicates feelings, passion, dispair, etc... better than anyone. As you read, you're like, man I feel exactly that way or I have at some point in my life. The analogy about the fig tree in the book relating to the future of her life is breathtaking. I stayed up and read this all in one night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"A portrait of madness written with a light touch. Breathtaking, sad and timeless. A must read for lovers of personal literature of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sad but Wonderful Book","review":"This book is a wonderful book about understanding the way people really feel. It is very realistic and makes you open your eyes to the idea that in the past, people were mistreated in the psychological institutions and were thought of as being insane, instead of people who could be helped with proper treatment. It is very sad, but worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, Dark, Dreamy and Dandy","review":"I loved this book! It's not a very long book, only about 200 pages or so, but man oh man it's an intense read. In my case it took me a year to read this book, so I felt like I was right with Ester Greenwood. I'm the biggest Sylvia Plath fan that I know and I was turned on to her by reading \\"Daddy\\" in an english class I had. And I just have about everything that she has done. Her way with words is sexy and at the same time dark, it seems very unusally for a woman in the 1950's and 1960's to have written like that, but I think it's great she broke the gender role! It's truly a shame that she never wrote another novel like this one, even though there are rumors that there's half of an unfinshed book of hers out there. Man we better call Mulder and Scully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please reprint this book!","review":"I just want to add my love of this book.

I wanted to hear what was it that made this gig really famous. I couldn't really hear anything at all, as it turns out. Seriously, I've heard 4th generation bootlegs that sound better than this, and I can't help asking myself \\"Why did they bother?\\". Not to rip on Wire or the individual members, mind you, as they are, quite simply, one the best bands that ever existed. This particular album, however, is for completists and/or masochists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"An electric soup of mangled memories and submerged vision.","review":"This curiosity, the only live entry in the Wire canon, is the antipathy of the stadium live opus despised by these art school graduates on a punk rock mission. Sounding almost wholly improvised, this smorgasbord of decaying power pop and art gallery installations is at best chaotic, at worst narcissistic in its own sense of post punk artrock indulgence. Impossible to single out songs, but titles include: \\"Eels Sang Lino\\", a Burroughsesque barrel roll and \\"Piano Tuner (Keep Strumming Those Guitars)\\", a bedlamatic strip of shouty pop. These two disparate items are indicative of the album's psychotic appeal. An overview would recommend this strongly to existing Wire fans but the unconverted should begin with \\"154\\" or \\"Chairs Missing\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommendable","review":"Though I appreciate all of Wire's studio-albums from the late 70's to the early 90's, I never liked their live-performances. This is because they often turned their great pop-songs into a dissonant, chaotic goulash of sound. This CD-compilation, recorded at three various locations, Notre Dome Hall, Montreux and Electric Ballroom, is completely unlistenable for \\"normal\\" people. If any unknown band had served this, nobody would have noticed, but here the critics said:\\"Oh Wire, this is fabulous art-school-punk!\\" You may call the performances on this album \\"experimental\\", but I really don't know why this gig made such waves. I only give two points, because there are two good studio-recordings thrown in at the end, they're called \\"Our swimmer\\" and \\"Midnight Bahnhof Cafe\\". But they're not worth buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie of All Time","review":"This is the worst movie of all time. It's not campy.

Smart, sexy and filled with twists and dark humor. If you liked Pritzi's Honor, you'll love this one. One of the first feature films w/Terri Hatcher and Brian Brown is wonderful as a lawyer who tries to commit the \\"perfect crime.\\" The crime isn't, but the movie is. It makes me laugh every time I see it and I can't recall how many times I have. An excellent murder mystery, too -- you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Juicy neo-noir","review":"This was actually made for cable TV back in 1991, but is well enough directed by Bill Condon to make it feel like a feature release. Based on a 50's hard-boiled pulp novel by the great Harry Whittington, Web of Murder, the movie stars Bryan Brown as hot shot attorney Charlie Deegan who's married to a rich wife played by Anne DiSalvo and who has a sexy secretary Laura (Teri Hatcher).So there's the standard noir plot elements--lust and greed and murder. Yep. But the way they're put together here is sharp and nifty, with lots of juicy dark humor along the way, so this is a really fun movie.Nice score--dig Satchmo's singing in the opening credits--and the acting, especially by major fly-in-the-ointment Veronica Cartwright (who puts a serious damper on Charlie's plans) is very strong.A really good addition to your neo-noir collection, Dead in the Water is a great way to spend an hour and a half soaking up them noir vibes.

I would only say that this book is good if you are a novice when it comes to horses. Anyone with experience would find this repetetive and boring. The book only covers very basic points about horses. The book also does not give details about anything- it's more of an outline. I would close by saying that this book is probably one to steer away from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Basic - maybe helpful to a novice","review":"I agree with the other reviewer here. This book barely scratches the surface on horse behavior. To me it raised more questions than it answered. Very brief and superficial discussion. I have been involved with horses for thirty years and just recently discovered the usefulness of understanding a horse's perspective in day-to-day handling and training.

I would have expected a novice lay person to come up with depriving the horse of food and water in an effort to make them \\"dependant\\" upon you for thier very life (and therefore grateful to be caught and fed), however finding it in a book obviously marketed to beginners and novice horsepersons felt this was largely irresponsible. The book is also filled with biases and general assumptions about the expected behavior of horse genders and breeds. There is also a comment that Thoroughbreds are Warmbloods... ?

There are plenty of good references out there on horses. This is *not* one of them.I agree with the previous reviewer who pointed out the author's recommendation to withhold food to get the horse to start coming to you. This is simply cruel and wrong.

Also, the playing on these discs is wonderful. So why do I give it only two stars? The SOUND! The selections from the Town Hall recital are all from deteriorated acetate discs, and the sound quality ranges from bad to gawdawful, which means all of one disc and part of another. The record company is kind enough to warn you about this on the cover, but I figure that Amazon customers need a similar warning. So I don't recommend this unless you absolutely have to have everything ever recorded by Novaes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for Melancholy Moods","review":"I bought this album in 1984 when it first came out and listened to it while laying down on my bed. It made me feel sad, bringing me closer to my true emotional self. It made me pay more attention to the fine details. I listened intensely and felt overwhelmed. I fell asleep. This album is intense in how it will affect you, even though the music is sparse and minimalistic. If you think walking alone in San Francisco when the fog is rolling in is a good time, then this album is for you. It will surround you as you begin to notice fine details, to hear the wind in the trees and the sound of the rain just beginning to fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Background music, not for listening to.","review":"I was playing my favorite Mike Oldfield album for my brother, and he said it sounded like Brian Eno, and I said I've never heard anything by him. So I read most of the reviews here about how excellent this album is and decided to make this my first Brian Eno purchase.Boy was I disappointed. Admittedly I've only heard the album through once (I forced myself), but I found it totally lacking in musical ideas. It is background mood music when you don't really want to listen to the music but just have its ambience felt. There is no rhythm -- just sound.If you want good alternative music to listen to, get ANY Mike Oldfield album. I suggest \\"Music of the Spheres\\", \\"Tubular Bells 2\\", or \\"Amarok\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great telling of the story behind a household name","review":"I love books that tell the story behind a well-known phrase with a little-known background, so Ponzi's Scheme was a natural selection for me. Turns out it was a great choice. The story of Charles Ponzi, an Italian immigrant to America, is a fast-moving rollercoaster of a tale told with skill by Zuckoff.The result is a very readable book with a combination of good lessons for its reader about too-good-to-be-true propositions, great characters, good history, financial lessons, and a tradgedy of Shakesperean proportions.Highly recommended for history buffs, fans of character-driven stories, people in financial markets, and anyone who's curious to know the story behind the phrase \\"Ponzi Scheme.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"My review of Ponzi's Scheme","review":"This book is about the man whose con-game in the summer/fall of 1920 eventually entered into the English language. The book is basicaly a biography of Ponzi, with the majority of it focused on Ponzi's racketand eventual exposure.But there is much that this book does not even bother to look at.For example Ponzi is exposed as a con man in the fall of 1920, yetthere is no attempt on the part of the author to place the Boston Post's concerns about Ponzi in the context of the prevailing social darwinism of the time.Namely a belief that immigrants such as Ponzi could only succeed if they were crooks.The book does not explore what caused Barron to come out against Ponzi after having defended him.Nor is there any attempt to explore Ponzi' s political views, if any as Ponzi did have a patronage position in Mussolini's regime.What saves this book from being a 1 star book, in my view is that it is such an enteraining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts Without Color","review":"Our desire to get ahead financially is insatiable, especially in this capitalist society. A 50% return on my investment in 45 days? Where do I sign up? Too good to be true? Well, you know what they say... We think we are smarter, more sophisticated people today. Maybe so, but if we are, it's because we know about things like Ponzi schemes, or think we do.Mitchell Zuckoff provides the best detail yet, of the life and times of the man who gave his name to an illegal financial scheme, Charles Ponzi. The narrative is straightforward and factual. It's interesting, but a little dull. Charles Ponzi was a very charismatic man, very shrewd; think Donald Trump. This book provides many facts, but little in the way of emotional motivation.I recommend this book to everyone interested in human gullibility and the financial world. You won't learn a lot about either, but you'll have many facts about Charles Ponzi."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's hilarious...","review":"I am currently laughing hard enough to soil myself.

You can't put a cat or dog into a pet carrier, give them some food every once in a while, and expect them to be happy or live long.You know those cups that stores sell the betas in? this \`tank' is about the same size. It's true that bettas can survive in a small puddle of water in the wild but that's only during the dry season. They actualy thrive in larger tanks.

Many Bettas don't survive these rough conditions that nature provides in their home territory. If you buy small cups and throw a fish in them- you are just condemning them to solitary confinement in a prison cell. My Betta is in a 10 gallon tank and you wouldn't believe the fun he has exercising and playing in all that space. If you care- you would never subject this beautiful creature to cups of water if you saw them in gallons of HEATED (they are tropical fish) water!!!!!!

Despite common misconceptions, bettas do NOT like to be kept in tiny containers. They do NOT live in small puddles their entire lives. They live in rice paddies that are flooded in the rainy season and slowly dry up. Bettas have adapted to survive in shallow water, but will not thrive in a cup.Ammonia will build up quickly in a container like this. Also, the temperature will fluctuate. Bettas need clean fresh water and a stable tropical temperature. Failing to meet these needs will result in illness and eventually death.If you want to keep a betta, there are many wonderful online resources. Do some research before you buy one of these amazing creatures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You MUST be joking","review":"Okay, you saw the picture. This poor betta has no space what-so-ever to swim. I keep my betta is a heated, underground filtrated 8 gallon hex. I think this tank is ridiculous. Bettas are tropical fish, and need a heated tank. You couldn't fit a heater in this 'tank' if you tried, and let alone fit a betta in here. Also, in a small tank bacteria will build up quickly and its excrements will dissolve and break down into nitrogen, and in this small tank, it will add up quickly, and soon your betta will be belly-up. I cannot emphasize enough about what a rip off this tank is. Trust me, use you 5 dollars wisely, and save them for a better tank.

The extended fugue on Jack Lord and \\"Hawaii Five-O\\" in the last story (\\"Westward...\\") could've been lifted directly from \\"Vineland\\".

Christopher Parkening is by far the most overated guitarist of the century. The only people who like him don't have any clue of what real classical guitar playing is really like and they just like him because Segovia was his teacher. Segovia's time has passed now and technique and repetiore has changed drastically but Parkening still records the same peices Segovia did and still uses the same out dated technique. He also puts no expression into the music. To him it is just dots on a page. To me music is the composer letting out their inner feelings and speaking a language, a language that we guitarists need to interpret. Parkening does not do so. If you want to hear a real guitarist play listen to Richard Savino.

I have nothing against electronic pop, but the songs are just not really interesting, and the overall feel is pretty silly. I disagree with the reviewer who suggested this compares favorably to New Order. Through the album Technique, New Order had much better, and much more emotionally evocative songs. Arguably, Manscape at times sounds a bit like New Order from the album Republic on, which is not a compliment.

It's not just a noise competition; it's really 2 or 3 superb musicians trying to match their skills to this new enviroment: Hill Country & Irish-based folk works. Doesn't work. Result is harsh, grating, abrasive lines and step-ins variously mixed or matched, but in no way folk... or, even harmonic.

What it is though, is a modern guy with the same name and one other person I was unfamiliar with and they discuss Galatians and issues in the book. Their discussions were very good, and I actually did use this for one of my talks as seeds for studying.Just be aware that this dvd has nothing at all to do with The Jonathan Edwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again?","review":"I am disappointed in the albums nowadays that only have one or two cuts on them that are good and the rest are garbage. So when I heard that GUY was getting back together to do another album I was like hell yeah! But low and behold another disappointment. I just refused to believe that Teddy is losing his touch, but after listening to this and the last Blackstreet album it makes me wonder. I hate to second guess my boy Teddy, but I know this album could have, and should have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guy can do better than this!","review":"If I had to limit my review to one word, it would be disappointment. But since I can elaborate, I will. I waited 10 years for these guys to create magic again, and they didn't deliver. In my opinion, the best track on the whole CD is Dancin' -- and it's marginal at best. The rest of CD sounds like Blackstreet struggling to put out another attempt at success. The ballads don't even come close to being as good as Piece of My Love, Let's Chill, Goodbye Love or even some of the Blackstreet's ballads. Overall, I'm glad they got back together, but in the future I hope they can recapture the inspiration and magic they put into their first two albums -- when they were hungry for success."},{"rating":"2","title":"No stopping The Nasty Man, Teddy 'Jam' riley & Crazy Legs","review":"As you can see there is a lot of mixed opinion about this CD. I feel that you can't go back to the old sound of NewJackSwing - No matter how much we want to. Guy III has followed the same format of the other Guy albumns but has different Flavas. This CD has tight production all over it - Teddy has tried not to take any risks with the albumn and so there will be hits coming, with different sounds. The CD has Guy written all over it and no other producer, and voices could match any of the three albumns. Advise: Don't compare it to the other Guy albums. Track four; Aaron is deadly. Await the 8min remixes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"no title","review":"I think this was one of the most underated albums in history. I cannot see why this album got bad reviews.

Listen, \\"Guy#1\\" with the introduction to New Jack Swing was groundbreaking. \\"The Future\\" marked independence from ownership and writing battles and was really, really great...the three Blackstreet albums were great, but this misses the mark a little bit...maybe we're \\"new jack saturated\\" or were expecting something a little more radical from ya...I dunno. That Roger/Zapp rip on \\"Teddy's Jam III\\" was bearing a little on the distasteful side to me....maybe you coulda waited longer to put this one out...it will probably go gold or platinum, but I, a long time fan, feel let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"These \\"Guys\\" must be imposters!","review":"I had high expectations for this reunion and I must say that I haven't been this disappointed over a CD since Prince's \\" Emancipation\\"!

Aaron Hall and Teddy Riley were great with their solo projects after the group sadly broke up, but they got back together to make this drivel? I remember back in the day when my girls and I would go crazy whenever we heard \\" Let's Chill\\"(a stone cold classic!), \\" Teddy's Jam\\", and \\"Groove Me\\".

Plus,....why aren't there any slow songs like before or that has Aaron the crooner producing? Isn't he the master of that genre and at least we could expect 1 cool slow groove from them. Buy it for nostalgia sake,...not for the tunes. I was really disappointed. If I had to stretch I would say that you could listen to the gospel inspired \\"Someday\\" until heaven exists on earth.

The CD was a massive flop but it still featured some quality material. The first single Dancin was a mid-tempo number that showed of Aaron's vocals and Teddy's production skills while Teddy's Jam III was a instrumental jam easily on par with the first two parts. Of course my man Aaron Hall kils the slow jams in particular Rescue Me, Love On-Line, and Why U Wanna Keep Me From My Baby.Guy was always more than just an above-average soul group and with the right promotion, production and ego's being set aside I could eaisly see the group making a come back."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, No","review":"I was completely disappointed with this release from Guy. After the trend they set with their first two albums, this doesn't even sound like something Teddy Riley would put together. Teddy was completely off the mark when he aimed for this one. I wouldn't recommend this release to today's R&B fan. If you buy this, it will only be one of those discs in your collection that take up space. The only song i really liked on here was Dancin'. Sorry, Teddy..........wrong formula!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD COME BACK","review":"This guy album was very very good. I am a big GUY fan and could not wait for them to release this album. It's good to know that they are still together.

The alarm set buttons on the side are quite small & hard to use. The one feature I liked is the radio on/off button, but that alone was not enough for me to keep this radio. A big disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Unreliable","review":"I do agree that this alarm clock has many features, like an AM/FM tuner, a double alarm, and a bright display.But it is very unreliable with its alarms. It did work fine in the 9 months I owned it; then things started to happen.Five months - The radio quality seem to drop A LOT! Many stations refused to come in, and it made it almost unusable.Six months - The bright display was much darker when I first bought it. I had a hard time reading the time due to this.Nine months (THE FINAL STRAW) - The alarm would not go off at some times. In a month, six alarms did not go off, and I was way behind my day. And to make matters worse, the alarm would go off at random times; in one time it went off at 1:00 AM, and that was awful.It has a few nice features, but it's not durable.

Chamoiseau beautifully portrays the conflict between the ancient oral tradition of story-telling and the modern scientific and linguistic reality.On one level, the book is a gruesome and bloody burlesque on police methods of investigating a murder. On another deeper level, it is a lament for a disappearing culture of stories, magic, demons and superstition in favour of logic and the written word. It is also a tale of colonial stupidity and inevitability.Chamoiseau's prose is lyrical and evocative. It is more of an oral history than a verbal study - an attempt to revive the oral history of his culture.He includes himself as one of the characters, contrasting his status as a mere story-teller with the central character, Solibo, the embodiment of a dying culture.Martina Nicolls, Author of \\"The Sudan Curse\\" and \\"Kashmir on a Knife-Edge\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly lesser than \\"She,\\" but still a mighty fun read!","review":"\\"The Return of She,\\" although not as exciting or groundbreaking as the classic \\"She,\\" is nevertheless a worthy sequel, and one that all admirers of Haggard's original story should enjoy reading. It is a direct continuation of the earlier book, and as such may be called required reading for all fans of Ayesha, Leo Vincey and Ludwig Holly. The novel contains many exciting scenes, including a great avalanche, the pursuit of the death hounds, Ayesha's reincarnation, and the climactic battle with Kalloon. The Dover edition comes with beautiful illustrations from the original 1905 edition that greatly enhance the text. In light of the fact that the overwhelming preponderance of Haggard's books are sadly out of print, this book becomes even more worthy an addition to any fan's library.

The radical beauty of this book is not merely that it is a \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" sequel of She, but that it is the work of an open-minded writer. The plot is full of super natural and pre \\"new age\\" exoticism as well that 19th century romanticism adventures. Its naiveté and simplicity make this book a very enjoyable one. The best moment of the book is a incredible obscure scene in which Ayesha has a meeting with her \\"servants\\", shadows and ghosts from beyond and the past.

Unfortunately, the sequel to SHE is sub-par. Having read only 4 books by Haggard, I could hardly consider myself an expert on his writing, but the one aspect of his writing which I found so intriguing and entertaining was his descriptions of Africa and of the racist imperialist views of the Europeans in Africa. However, in AYESHA, the story takes place somewhere near China or Thibet or Russia (the exact location is never given, but only alluded to). Haggard has stepped out of an area in which he was comfortable, knowledgable, and successful. Unfortunately, by stepping out of the area in which he found the most success, he has fallen down and offered up only a meager tale which has to fight to hold the reader's interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"KENSHIN IS THE B-E-S-T!!!!!!!!","review":"Okay, I saw the ad for the anime on tv, and then and there I decided to watch the show...and it was amzazing.

This record is a coincidence of two genuises: Bach and Parkening. Being a guitar player, I am somewhat biased; but I think these are some of the finest renditions of Bach ever recorded.Parkening's playing is so perfectly suited to these pieces. He makes devilishly difficult pieces sound effortless and sublime. His control and artistry are supreme. Sometimes Parkening's playing, on a few tracks on OTHER recordings, seems a little over-the-top. Not here. He seems to be restrained by the spirit of JSB and plays these pieces so sensatively without getting too loose. Wonderful stuff.Like Mr. Anger says: a desert island CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precise, Pastoral and Pure","review":"I bought this album in the late 80's and practically wore it out. Parkenings technique and tone for the time were remarkable. Certainly on a par with Breem and Williams. His Jesu, I think might be the best ever recorded. A reviewer mentions his spirituality and reverance for both the guitar and God. In Parkening's case it's obvious the two go hand in hand. Clearly time has marched on and there are many newcomers who are marking their territory with different and dynamic approaches to the classics. But at the time this album was made, no one on the planet was in the same building as Parkening."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Go Wrong On This One","review":"The fluidity and tonal control Mr. Parkening displays in these pieces is ASTOUNDING and an absolute joy to listen to.

True the foam earpiece fell off immediately, but even without it, I found it comfortable. I only wish the darn thing would work for more than a few days. I have since given up replacing them and I wish they would improve the design because they are very convenient. One last thing, because it is so small people who are not familiar with headsets are going to look at you like you've gone nuts...talking to yourself when actually the phone is being used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with Nokia 6100","review":"This handsfree set is not compatible with my NOkia 6100 phone.

And be sure to cut away extra plastic that will lay over your gums. This does take some finesse and time, but definitely worth it. These trays are somewhat bulky, but tolerable.

And absolutely NOTHING in terms if 5.1 mixing, just plain old stereo makes these DVDs worthless and a waste of money unless you dont have the VHS set already.

No DTS, No 5.1.As for the extras, OK, you can display the lyrics on your TV screen.

It looks like a cheap video you'd see on MTV. Add to it the director can't let go of the joy stick constantly flashing to different scenes never seeing much of anything.You never feel like you are at the show....you feel removed. That is not the case with the 1989 show. That was infinitely better. It is unfortunate that you don't see the band play. Just as Kirk is about to solo, the shot goes to Lars. Can't understand that.

Others complain that the pacing is slow and it doesn't go anywhere. They have a point. But, then, the same point can be made about \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" unquestionably a great movie in any genre. It too is slow-paced with little action but the tension builds throughout, right up to the weird psychedelic ending. Light sabers and mindless action aren't required. \\"The Objective\\" isn't on a par with \\"2001,\\" not by a long shot, but it is a good, thought-provoking science fiction flick. It's slow-paced and the tension builds gradually until it explodes in truly mind-blowing weirdness at the end. I like it. I like the scenes in the desolate mountains of Afghanistan (actually Morocco), and it had the feel of a real mission by special forces in that war-torn country.

Once real-world issues such as dehydration set in and the group is minimized from 8 to three people, the CIA agent finally details the most of the story you'll get from this movie - unknown hostile energy in the desert that will vaporize you. He sees a mirage, flashing lights, ends up in a hospital bed/weird coma. Perhaps it was all in his mind?! Oh wait, he's clutching a coin.The end.That pretty much sums up the entire 1hr 30min movie.

Seeing hardened military guys in the dessert getting totally pwn3d by out of this world entity (entities?) really gets your heart pumping.Scariest movie I ever saw, ever, and I saw it years ago.

What I will say though is that I was left with the impression that the writers simply didn't know how to end it, so they came up with some totally whacked, nonsensical ending that did not wrap the movie together.

Like most stories of the unknown, the viewer/reader is left to form their own opinions on what happens afterwards. It reminds me of the tv show In Search Of..., but in story form. Bermuda Triangle stories end the same way. X-Files had stories end this way. Some sequences reminded me of Carlos Castaneda's works, too. Our imaginations should be spurred into action by this, but instead I see reviews of people who's imaginations are dead, or non existent. This story ends just as it should, and it was presented appropriately. In life, not everything gets explained, and we certainly don't have all the answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a train wreck you can't stop staring at...","review":"Did they REALLY expect us not to notice that they used a Vietnam era UH-1 helicopter in the desert of Afghanistan post 9-11?

Their so-called special forces unit bears no resemblance to an actual military unit with squad members asking, \\"You sure that's a good idea Chief,\\" almost every time they're given an order. And special forces do NOT shoot randomly into the air at an enemy that nobody can see...I hope. The \\"special effects\\" could have been done on my laptop from 20 years ago and likely were. There was no real explanation of who or what they were encountering in the desert and they showed zero survival instinct after getting lost without provisions.

There are plenty of other low-budget films out there with at least minimal entertainment value. This movie is not one of them.

Maybe there'll be a sequel that will clarify a thing or two.(I came across one online review outside Amazon that talks about the clever ending, at which point I thought oh good, now it'll get explained, but whoever wrote that article seems to have missed one point that doesn't match his explanation either.

But, I thought the Objective was a great movie. Sure there's many unanswered questions--many times that's what makes for a good story. Not all of us want all the answers spoon-fed to us.

They make it out like it's a real story but it's pure speculation if that is true, the video would have never been let out from the CIA if it was true.We have heard many things rumors about stuff that is alien related in that part of the country with the sumerians etc... but this movie is not going to blow anyones skirt up.

The ending didn't explain anything for me. Maybe if you know a little about the \\"myths\\" they talk about in the movie you may find some entertainment in that, but even then the movie doesn't delve deep enough into the characters or plot for anyone to really care. Not to mention there was no action at all. The movie does move at a pace that kept me interested in seeing and learning more, but it was like they ran out of ideas... and money... and ended it abruptly.

The ending explained nothing and left me with the feeling I had just wasted about an hour and a half without any answers as to what the ending meant.

Otherwise, it took a dive over the cliff with Abdul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me interested and wondering..","review":"I liked this movie. It had the right mix of mystery and suspense, and very much avoided the boring, predictable, canned type of plot line that so often has me abandoning a flick to search for something more creative. It's true.. as I've read in some of the other (negative) reviews: This isn't a movie where some cool, ripped special forces dudes roll into a bad guy's fortress with half-a-billion's worth of gear to rescue their captured buddy. Thank God. I'd suggest that it's more about a group of people who have a ton of training and experience, but who head straight into a situation in which their knowledge, training, and former experience have basically no application (except for the leader, who shares little of his limited information before-the-fact.. probably because he knows they wouldn't believe a truthful briefing).

The team of soldiers sent to the desert are there to figure that out, too. As I watched, I expected that there would be some kind of answer to those questions, but the movie provides very little answers and the ending is pointless.The special effects were pretty good for an indy film, and the acting was also good.

A comedy about a guy who travels the world and has two beautiful wmen after him. There is not way that it could possibly be boring,right? Except it is. It's slow and pointless. Everyone, including the dog, is clinically depressed and is in desperate need of therapy with the possible exception of Geena's character who is very unbalanced and stalks the male lead like Pepe la Pew throughout the entire movie. I suppose that she was supposed to be the breath of fresh air, but I found her delusions terrifying. The ending was unsatisfying, there was a strong clue that he was ready to change his mind again within minutes. I did get one really good belly laugh from this DVD when I went to the deleted scenes and saw that there were three screens of them. I'd been betting that they hadn't cut a frame.

Every actor is superb and plays their role to the hilt. To see Macon interact with Muriel's little boy is worth it all.

The plot is definitely confusing. Large sections are left out, understandable to a certain degree as there are limits to movie making, but, not only are certain subplots left out, important sections of the main plot are deleted as well. The result is a choppy, confusing, unpleasant film. The only slightly redeeming quality this film possesses is the fine acting of William Hurt, Gena Davis, and Kathleen Turner who struggle with a terrible script; however, I still don't recommend viewing this film.The novel is such an amazing piece of writing; please read it instead, or, at least, check out my review of the novel.

Thank God for all you firefighters out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic and Boring","review":"I rather like the studio efforts that SCI has put out, however this record just bores me. The songwriting is very simplistic and I find it very hard to listen to the album all the way through. There are a couple of times that the songs seem to be about to go somewhere, but they just end. I'm not talking about ten minute jams, but just some sort of memorable hook or melody.This album will turn a number of songs into live anthems, maybe, but then again, most Cheese songs translate live much better than on record. I gave this two stars for a Cheese record, though nothing on here is actually bad, just unassuming. If you are new to SCI, you should probably start somewhere else. If you are an old fan, then save your money for a concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"New and but not much Improved Cheese","review":"I was fortunate enough to recieve a copy of this album a few weeks before it hit stores. My initial impression was that One Step Closer was a very cool, new, SCI album that was very chill. But the longer I listened to the album, I noticed that the usual energy and creative technique SCI puts in most of their songs was missing. I do like Swampy Waters and Drive, but many of the songs sound semi-mainstream pop and not the rock spiced with bluegrass I was expecting from SCI. Overall, the album itself is a good, chill CD, just nothing too exciting or new."},{"rating":"2","title":"different but awesome","review":"better studio but there jams are just as good if better dont be scared there that theyre changing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Dissapointing","review":"Although a good easy listening chill album, I don't think this album captures the true instrumental talent of the String Cheese Incident. I don't think there is one of these songs that I will actually look forward to seeing live. The only reason I give this album two stars is because I respect String Cheese and the music they make. They claim that this is supposed to be a more lyric driven album, but lets face it, string cheese is not known for their lyrics and these lyrics sound forced and cliche. Is this the String Cheese Incident or the Malcolm Burn Incident????"},{"rating":"1","title":"You could call it a concept album....","review":"the concept being a band working as a democracy - which appears to be true - everybody gets their songs on this album and they're all given proper respect and placement. But what the album seems to lack is collective harmony - or a momentum that keeps your attention from song to song. Some of songs that were meant to be simplified by minimalist arrangements are left too bare to hide the weak vocal performances. And some of the lyrics.. (there are some that WILL make you cringe).. leave you wondering if democracy for the String Cheese Incident means saying \\"good enough.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess one would call this Soft Cheese.","review":"With the exception of a few of their more recent live albums, I have just about everything SCI has put out. I became a fan only relatively recently, but once I got one (starting with their collaboration with Kellar Williams), I got hooked and can't stop. But this album left me disappointed. It was slow and stripped down. As several have said before me, none of the jams, none of the joy, none of the humor, nor the can't-stop-moving musicality of basically every other release by these guys, whether live or in the studio. Everything else - ANYthing else- they've done is just better. Buy if you want to have a complete collection of their work, but if you're a first-time buyer, don't go here, because it's not representative of just how fantastic they are. Had this been the first album I got from them, I would not have bought more and would've missed the unbelievable experience I have every time I listen to virtually everything else they've done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strengths and Weaknesses","review":"A lot of bands are turning this type of sutff out. There is some good writing on this album, but it certainly does not showcase the unmatched musicianship and energy that SCI is about. Why do something that everbody else is doing, when you can do something extremely more moving that no one else can even come close to?

I purchased the Merrick Turducken as Merrick used to be a great company that made wonderful dog food that looked like human food. Not in this case! It looks, smells, and has the same appetizing effect on my dogs as if I'd thrown up in the bowl. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! Neither of my dogs likes it and I'm stuck with an expensive case of food. My dogs both sniffed their bowls, then walked away. I'm feeding it to them as its bought and paid for, but I feel cruel doing so. They usually won't jump right into eating it, no matter how hungry they are. They do eat a little, but usually leave at least half in their bowl and that's so unlike them! Horrible dog food.

It fills me with a longing and desire to \\"go back\\" to this place I never was; to \\"go forward\\" to somewhere... I don't know what to call it except \\"Heaven.\\" It is a mysterious longing for something, and yet the longing is almost like an end in itself -- in a way.

The historical background given by Boone in the opening scenes is brief and to the point so that you can be taken to the scene of the action quickly and efficiently.This series is a fine snapshot of medical practices of the 1950s which might seem outmoded now. Electro-convolsive therapy has been abandoned by practioners but it was an accepted practice in the '50s and is clearly shown. The effects of a nuclear bomb explosion are graphic and chilling to watch and listen to. The open heart valve replacement is quite intriguing even in black and white. Overall this is a series that while it might seem to be somewhat dated is good for historical background and comparison with the way medicine is practiced now.Growing up in the 1950s this was the state of medicine as I knew it and it seemed pretty impressive.

Mind you, I didn't treat it very well and even after stepping on the ear piece twice (and keeping it held together with a rubber band) the thing was still working! It was only after repeated abuse that it finally fell apart. I figure that with two I'll cut down on having to transport it to and fro, as much. This is my first time ordering from Amazon and I'm hoping I won't be disappointed. Oh, and in response to the review dated 2-27-03 (cell phones and brain cancer in mice), the two studies mentioned have not been corroborated by any future studies conducted on the matter. See the FDA's reports (www.fda.gov/cellphones) and extensive international research compiled in a report by the Medical College of Wisconsin (www.mcw.edu)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing wrong here","review":"This is the perfect earpiece for the 8260, 3360, and 8265. It sounds fine, the mic works well, and it has the answer/hangup button inline with the cord. A little expensive yes, but it's great for driving and the earbud isn't too big, unlike some other Nokia models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earbud overall","review":"I really like the convenience (very light and folds up easily) and quality of this earbud. The only drawback is that it sometimes makes an annoying buzzing sound. This can be mitigated by twisting the plug around (go figure) or moving the phone around -- kind of like trying to pick up a radio station. It's not as inconvenient as it sounds, but it's something to be aware of. The volume and quality of sound (when there's no buzzing) is really impressive, and the microphone picks up my voice very well even when I'm driving and twisting my head around to keep an eye on traffic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earbud","review":"This is a very useful product. The earpiece sound is clear and the earpiece stays snugg in the ear. For safety while driving I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best on market, but not that good","review":"I would agree with most other reviewers in saying that this is probably the best hands-free set for this phone on the market. I'm buying my third one. That said, I'm buying my third one in less than three years-- yes, this is not a durable headset. Because cell phones were recently shown to cause brain cell death in rats after only two hours of (GSM) use (Leif Salford, Lund University Hospital, Sweden as published in Environmental Health Perspectives), I use my headset all the time. I am very careful with the headset and its cord, but even if you're careful you should expect a high burn rate with frequent usage.The microphone is sensitive to wind and to mid- and high-pitched noises, more than a cell phone without the attachment. So beware if you're planning on using it outside.With all of its drawbacks, it still seems to be the best product on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money's Worth","review":"My wife and I recently upgraded phones to the Nokia 6555. As usual the headsets from the old Nokia's wouldn't operate in the new ones. After researching prices for the exact (supposedly) Nokia earbub headsets, we settled on two of these sets. Shipment was FAST, however neither worked in either of the phones. I think we paid $2.95 each, with shipping it was around $ 17.00. I did'nt even bother to return them ( I should have), but I just figured that we nearly got our money's worth. Next time I will go for the higher priced set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally found ear piece for Nokia","review":"I finally found an ear piece for my 2 year old Nokia phone. However, the ear insertion doesn't stay in my ear and constantly falls out. So, I'm using my hand to keep the ear piece in my ear. Also, hearing volume is not effective. Annoying, but can't do anything about it.However, I've discovered you can find stuff on Amazon and that's a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty nice, and better than the others....","review":"I bought this earbud as an upgrade to the earbud which came with my AT&T,Nokia 8260. I also bought the Jabra earbud - to compare both. This earbud works quite well. Compared to the Jabra the sound quality going into as well as coming out of this earbud is a little less clear. However, the major advantage of this earbud is that it doesn't pick up as much annoying wind noise or any of that rustling clothes noise. This earbud is sensitive enough but, not to sensitive to be obnoxious. I kept this earbud - It works well enough and is comfortable enough. The other though it comes with an assortment of ear \\"gels\\",is just to complicated and surprisingly uncomfortable for it own good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset","review":"This headset works great with my Nokia 2610.

However, even nearly fifty years later, we still hear about these signs. If you watch classic movies or television, there is a big chance you have heard of the Burma-Shave signs.This book is a quick, light read and very interesting. One can get a glimpse of America from the early days of the automobile up to the sixties by taking time to sit back and read this book.Author Frank Rowsome Jr. gives us a listing of all, or almost all, of the series of signs used and chronicles them by year.

His older brother struggled to hold it right; who would have thought watching a video would have helped? My second son also breezed through phonics after watching these videos for about three months (one video per day). My 3rd son is three and watches one a day now and I am so happy with all he is retaining. The arithmetic one gives a great head start for math.

THEN DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO! Much to our surprise and disappointment, \\"Rev-Up for Arithmetic\\" turns out to be an evangelical Christian video! It is full of references to Jesus, to God giving his only son to us, and so son, and is rife with Christian symbols. The Amazon description of this video gives absolutely no indication of its religious orientation (or perhaps \\"disorientation\\" would be more appropriate). It is truly pathetic that the producers of this technically flawed and otherwise boring video have to resort to subterfuge to get their religious message out. It is an insult to Amazon and to its customers. They owe us an apology. I don't blame Amazon for this, since only by watching this video would one know about its true intentions.

Unfortunately the later editions have been edited to not reflect the Mormon churches view of white racial superiority. Earlier editions of this book as well as the Book of Mormon and Pearl of Great Price and Journal of Discourses speak of whites as being the \\"chosen seed\\" and the blacks as being the \\"seed of cain.\\" The Book of Mormon also speaks of dark skin as a curse(see 2 Nephi 5:21-23) that was pronounced upon the American Indians to make them loathsome to the mormon god's \\"white and delightsome people.\\" The reader of this book would do good to look for a copy of an earlier edition as well to compare and see the way the Mormon church tries to hide some of its less favorable teachings from potential converts. All in all, the book is worth the money for a good general reference on the subject of \\"Mormon Doctrine\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Usefull","review":"This book is well organized and provides a helpful overview for someone trying to filter through Mormon terminology. I would recomend it as a usefull, though not official, reference sorce.I would like to remind readers to keep the time of the origional publication in mind when considering various terminology.

Petersen, found 1,067 doctrinal errors in the first edition of this offensive book should give you a heads up on what one should do with this book: file it on the Mormon fiction shelf. This man was not a prophet and yet his ambition to aspire to the honors of men was probably behind his sickening version of the Gospel found in this book. There is a reason this book is not being reprinted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, But Good","review":"This is a fabulous read (if you are Mormon of course).

It's one thing to write a book of opinion on religion but this so badly misrepresents the doctrines of the faith, I wouldn't represent it to anyone, whether they are Mormon or not. If you are Mormon, you will be riduculed if you quote it and if you are not Mormon, you will not get an accurate portrayal of official doctriine.

His style is to set the record straight on everything he can think of.

It will be of no help to investigators or the just plain curious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive guide to Latter-day thought and beliefs.","review":"Altought Bruce R. McConkie's work is not an official LDS Church Publication, it is a clear and consise presentation of what mormons believe. I found the \\"encyclopedic\\" style quite useful, and it has plenty of cross-references that come in handy when looking for unfamiliar names. One of the most stressed matters within the work is the identity of Christ, from His premortal commission, His earthly ministry, the things He is bringing to pass in the latter days, and His glorious second coming. Worthy of mention here is that the work includes the most complete summary of what the scriptures say are the signs of the second coming of Jesus Christ. McConkie is one of the most versed latter-day saints regarding the messiah, and in this work, it shows. Definitely, a good study tool, but not for entry-level study of mormonism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting thoughts, but not exactly church doctrine","review":"Though this book has a lot of interesting thoughts and insights it is not the approved doctrine of the church. Most of it is just the author's humble opinion and speculation on certain subjects.In my opinion this is not a completely accurate view of what the Mormons believe because most of it was Elder McConkie's express opinion. Most of the things discussed in that book are very trivial and if you asked an average \\"church-going Mormon\\" they would tell you that they don't know and it isn't taught but there opinion is such and such.

It is a bounch of events glued together. At times I felt lost because she jumps from one topic to another and makes the reader confused when she throws a few strange sounding names without explaining who they were. As for the research of the subject I can't comment on the french part, however, on the polish side, the author didn't do a whole lot research because she couldn't even spell the name of an ex-King of Poland correctly! It's Stanisaw Leszczyñski, not Stanislas Leczinski!!! She also undermines the linguistic abilities of the readers, thinking maybe that no-one but the French can really figure out the french language. I would not recommend this book if you really want to learn something about Voltaire and his love life, because there was no love life in that book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that inspired \\"A Visit From Voltaire\\"","review":"The hilarious modern comedy featuring the Ghost of Voltaire returning to the 21st century, \\"A Visit From Voltaire\\"Visit from Voltaire, Acites this book as one of the main sources for the period spanning the love affair of Madame de Chatelet and the King of the Englightenment, Voltaire. Another book that updates this information is Passionate Minds by David Boganis,Passionate Minds: The Great Love Affair of the Enlightenment, Featuring the Scientist Emilie du Chatelet, the Poet Voltaire, Sword Fights, Book Burnings, Assorted Kings,but this is the book that hooked me first. And it remains one of the best books to date, despite a few little hitches in her facts, for readability, entertainment and capturing the spirit of Voltaire's middle years.

She certainly wasn't a rock singer, had a supperclub style and Contiental mentality, was too dramatic and glamorous for the teen crowd, too sophisticated for adult buyers. The ultimate solution were these albums of covers, in turns ridiculous in choice, amusing in execution and delightful in experience. They proved Morgan could sing Anything with a capital A and make it her own. Both albums sold big, to Epic's surprise and delight, and Morgan is the reason why. She was never above doing a song, but when she did a song she did it her way. These albums still are great listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake for Jane","review":"These 2 albums were a mistake for Jane. Her majestic voice should have been doing Arlen, Kern or Rodgers. Too bad she didn't have Norman Granz guiding her caerer like Ella's. The 1st album is a bit better because it's closer to the kind of songs that suit her very talented voice. Ms. Morgan was very popular on the Kapp label by doing \\"artistic\\" albums & not top 10 hits which are what most of these songs are. I keep hoping those lps will be converted to domestic cds SOON! Then, I can write ***** reviews which is what she deserves. But, here, Jane & the band appear to be fighting each other. Instead, they should have been harmonious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel Album to a Great Album is always a danger!","review":"Music industry seems to like to bet on 'the formula of success' and even artists seem to follow this dangerous track.Lalo Schifrin was the creative arranger and composer of one the classic albums in the 60s which combined Jazz with Baroque and Renaissance Music. A quite inspired combination with the best musicians in the place in an album which is still available here @Amazon ('The Dissection and Reconstruction of Music ... as a tribute to Marquis de Sade' on Verve Records, produced by Creed Taylor).Now this sequel album has not achieved the same degree of inspiration though Schifrin could count on great musicians like Ray Brown and Grady Tate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oliver Jones is nothing short of brilliant","review":"Wow! Oliver Jones is fabulous. Why he is not more well known, I do not know. He is a jazz piano master, like fellow Montrealler Oscar Peterson. This double album was recorded live at Toronto's famed Montreal Bistro in 1997 and features Dave Young on bass and Norman Marshall Villeneuve on drums. Most of the songs here are standards, and all played with technical brilliance. Unfortunately he has now retired from performing, but at least we have this and other albums to enjoy. And this album is full of many brilliant suprises. Just listen to his rendition of \\"Waltzin' Matilda\\". I have never heard it played in a jazz way before, and it is amazing. And Oliver's own composition \\"Something for Chuck\\" should become a standard. It's as good as any that I have heard. If you are a jazz fan, and enjoy Oscar Peterson, you will for sure love Oliver Jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"The final copy","review":"Lamott's Bird by Bird has ben criticized, even by those of us who loved it, for not saying more about revisions. And an earlier customer review lamented reading much of what is now Traveling Mercies on-line (salonmagazine.com). But what we have now in Traveling Mercies is some pretty astonishing revision of wonderful material. Look at what happens to her piece from 12/18/97 in Salon, for instance. You see Lamott at work in TM; it will take your breath away to see how the earlier pieces get their final shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks to God for Anne Lamott's ability to reach us!","review":"I usually wait for a friend to recommend a book to me but this time I can't wait to tell all my friends about Anne Lamott's newest.

THANK YOU, ANNE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a lift!","review":"Oh, my gosh, I love this book beyond description! I read through it once (often crying and laughing at the same time) and am now halfway through my second reading. There are nuggets of wisdon sprinkled throughout, as well as sentences that say exactly what I'd like to think I would say - about faith, life, and children - if I were half as clever as Ms. Lamott. It's SUCH an uplifting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read!","review":"Anne Lamott is so inspirational in here stories in this book. I love her humor and perspective of things.

She has a unique, yet relatable, take on God and faith that I could appreciate. I will definately buy her newest book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traveling Mercies","review":"My sister told me about Anne Lamott's books and I have now read three of them. I love the way she writes and expresses herself and her beliefs. She explains how she got from where she was in her practices of faith and where she is today. Anne doesn't preach, just talks to you as the reader and tells you her life stories. I laugh, I cry, I ponder. Loved this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting twists","review":"I found this book to have interesting twists to the usual faith message. It helped me look at my faith in a new and fresh way. I wasn't thrilled that the author kept referring to God as both he/she. However, she was respectful of God as she knew God to be for her. There were many times I wanted to be able to respond to the author because I felt that she tends to judge others in the Christian faith for their beliefs, but as I kept reading - she shared her struggles regarding judgment of herself and others. I share that judging issue myself so felt welcomed to struggle with her on our own journeys."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in a long time!","review":"This book is real, refreshing, funny, but deeply thought-provoking. The way that Anne shares her life experiences and then ties them in with religious truths helps them to come alive. I feel like I know Anne and would sure like to meet her. She is a great writer! I only hope she writes many more books! I was so sorry when it ended that I went on line and immediately ordered another one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right book, right time","review":"Ann doesn't bash you over the head with the Bible. She is not out to convert you. Her writing is not judgemental. It is honest, emotional, and strong.I connected with this book in a big, big way. While going through the MOST trying time of my life, Traveling Mercies fell into my lap. And although I had a hard time feeling sorry for the self abusive and self destructive author in the first few chapters, I grew to understand her faith and the strength she draws from it as the book progressed.This book gave me strength to face each day. I would reread chapters and repeat lines from the book to myself because I found power in them.God works in mysterious ways. That is why this book found me. If you need a spiritual boost, read it. And read it again. If you are looking for just another recovering-alcoholic-author-bio.....it is good for that too. But the faith stuff is where the book's power lies."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring book.","review":"I picked this book up in an airport as a present for an Episcopal friend, expecting not to be interested myself---and promptly read the whole book before the plane had landed. I've been familiar with Anne Lamott from fiction, other books of essays, and local radio programs for a while now, but only with this book did I realize that she has a strong religious identity. To be honest, I expected that to put me off---like so many, I feel plenty \\"spiritual\\" but get a little antsy when anyone else talks about their specific belief set, especially one so dogmatic as Christianity. This book, however, is more about the spiritual questions that consume us all (yes, even us non-Christians) and the joy and pain of our attempts to answer them. Anne is completely readable, funny, and (unlike many writers who tackle the topic of spirituality), NOT HOKEY. Well worth reading, and, for me, re-reading in sections pretty often."},{"rating":"2","title":"honest and real","review":"I am a Christian, the homeschooling Republican variety ;)[edit: Not a Republican anymore], and I find Lamott to be wonderfully honest and real. Those who are offended by her introspection shouldn't have bought a memoir, for starters, and realize that all writers rely heavilly on the self. Lamott is just too honest to pretend that she isn't almost always writing about herself.Furthermore, those who think she isn't spiritual enough to be writing a book on faith miss the whole point. SHE ISN'T SPIRITUAL ENOUGH! That's the point. None of us are. Faith is believing IN SPITE of our frailty and inability to understand.If you want to pretend that only perfect people understand faith, don't read Lamott. If you want to have a little fun while being encouraged to consult God a little more and treat others with compassion, this is a great little read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"This is the sort of book that one nibbles at, instead of devouring in great gulps, because there is so much on every page - indeed, in every paragraph. I'm on my second go-round and have moved from yellow hilighter to red pen to mark favorite passages. This will be a colorful read if I can part with it to pass it on to someone else. These \\"essays\\" are little glimpses into a very human life and one comes away with - among other mantras - \\"Thank you, thank you, thank you\\" for the gift of life and faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book captures and reveals the inner landscape of faith.","review":"Traveling Mercies is a revelation that strikes a deep chord in the heart. Anne Lamott has put her finger on our struggles to find meaning and to believe God has something to do with it. Her situations (like bad hair or the \\"aunties\\") are the same ones we deal with every day. How wonderful to confirm that this is where we find God--in our everyday acts. No pious platitudes or preaching here. What a joy! It is one of the realest books I have ever read, while at the same time laugh-out-loud funny and sometimes touching to the point of tears. Because it is so real, it is deeply believable. Thank you, Anne, for living it and writing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read For All But The Far Right","review":"What a refreshing way of approaching religion in general, and Christianity in particular: through the eyes and experience of an ordinary person. As a minister I get so weary of all of the top-down preaching. This is a wonderful person-to-person sharing of faith. I'm glad I found Lamott and have already begun reading another of her offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conflicted","review":"This book has some amazingly well written passages, especially the one that describes her father's condition at the end of his life. I am a writer and a follower of Christ, so this book left me conflicted as to what to think of it because of how flippant she is with the name of Jesus. At one point she talks about wondering if Jesus would want to drink a bottle of gin, and although there are probably a lot of you reading this who think \\"So what?\\", it really angered me that she claimed to be a follower of Christ but then threw his name around in disregard. She also says that she supports abortion theoretically and politically, and again if she is a true follower of Christ she would know how much he loves children and would never want to harm them, no matter how young they may be. There were several passages in this book that really inspired me to write, but all in all in this book she really is centered on herself to a fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"You already know Anne Lamott...","review":"She's that girl you knew back in high school who walked around constantly saying, \\"I'm so fat,\\" despite being skinnier than nine-tenths of the female population and loudly worrying that she was going to get a B on that French test we took yesterday when everyone knew she was going to get an A. This sort of behavior is nauseating enough in teenagers; in a middle-aged woman, it makes for bad memoirs.Her treatment of Christianity is so superficial in these pages as to be insulting to those of us who believe that God is something other than a Santa Claus who dispenses wishes. This book has little to do with faith; it's mostly a compilation of how the world has somehow wronged Anne Lamott. Perhaps some people find her privileged whine amusing, and I might have looked more kindly on the book if it didn't purport to be about \\"faith.\\" But there are better memoirs by bulimics out there, and Anne Lamott's sophomoric \\"humor\\" gets on my nerves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting....","review":"I am almost done with this book....but reading it has not been the experience I had thought it would be. I realize that this book is about her travels towards faith and that is a uniquely individual thing, but I am really struck by how self-involved the author is...her brand of Christianity seems solely to be how can God enhance her life and the life of those she loves. It all revolves around how finding God has improved her life...with nothing about what God requires of her. I don't consider myself Christian in the born again sense but I was certainly raised in a Christian manner...by parents who volunteered in a million different ways in order to serve God and those less fortunate. Why doesn't Anne Lamott put down the pen and go work in a soup kitchen? She definitely writes well and I enjoy her style, but she needs to get outside her head!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me A Break!","review":"What's next Lamott? Have you finally exhausted all of the minutia in your life that means absolutely nothing?

Hang it up, woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found Lamott to be selfish and reckless, beyond the blame of her upbringing and surroundings. I did not find this book to be entertaining, rather a waste of time and a frustrating experience reading about a self-serving and self destructive individual."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good book","review":"I read this for book club and it was an okay read.

It's time to wake up and call ego-centric, self-indulgent writing exactly what it is. Save your money!

I've read almost everything she has written, and while her fiction seems somewhat dull and bland, her nonfiction is supreme, full of passion and love and humility--it's hard not to think of her as having an expansive, generous soul. I belong to a church I rarely visit, a church full of stiff ceremony, dusty old prayer books, and stale bread--they should all have to read this book, I think, the members of my church, so some feeling can flow back into their cold blue veins, and they can remember that humanity, love, compassion, and forgiveness are at the heart of true religion. I love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read for Anyone","review":"Anne Lamott has a gift for telling stories that few authors have. I was a bit apprehensive about reading a book on faith and religion, but Lamott's ability to relate her religious experience into everyday language made this book a joy to read. I would recommend it for anyone, religious or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"congrats to Annie for all the blessings she's had!!!","review":"Traveling Mercies is one of the best books of 1999-funny, wise, gentle-she can make you laugh and cry within one paragraph and that's no small feat. not only is Traveling Mercies is spending its fifteenth week on the bestseller list-Bird By Bird With Annie a documentary about Ms. Lamott has opened to rave reviews, and her other book Operating Instructions has been selected as one of the best non fiction books of the 20th century. And to those of you who think she's self absorbed or whatever-let me quote Rita Mae Brown:\\"If you don't like my books, find books you do like.\\" Or as AL would say-life is too short. Meanwhile for the people who love Anne Lamott like I do-let us congraduate AL on her great success and commend ourselves on our good taste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Makes You Sit Back and Think","review":"I've read several Anne Lamott books and this is a really great one. It's give you some great background on the author, who had a pretty interesting life, and on her spiritual experiences. The cool thing is that this book is religious but not conservative, shove-it-down-your-throat religious. It helped me gain perspective on things that were happening in my own life at the time. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST BOOK EVER","review":"You definitely have to be a baby boomer to appreciate the colloquialisms used throughout the book. A generation x'er just won't get half the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Anne Lamot's self-effacing humor just doesn't work here. Readers are supposed to believe that she can teach them something about spirituality simply because her book was published. Her self-congratulatory stories about her various addictions, how \\"fat\\" she thinks she is (even though anyone who has seen a photo of her knows she's thin) and episodes of neglecting her son do nothing to inspire me or move me spiritually. Lamot thinks God exists to dole out rewards for self-indulgent behavior and make her feel good about herself. If this is the God you believe in, then by all means, enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traveling Mercies","review":"I read this book for a bookclub I belong to. It was highly recommended. In my humble opinion Anne Lamott is very whiny and lacks purpose with this book. I was not looking for an inspirational read or a comedy I just wanted a book I could enjoy and this was not it. I found myself wondering what is so special or uniquely terrible about her life and my answer is; nothing. I felt I wasted my time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please forgive me for not liking this book.","review":"I feel badly that I didn't enjoy this book. I suppose my expectations were too high. Anne Lamott is not the author who can capture my spiritual imagination. There is no blame -- just a sadness that I had hoped for something more daring."},{"rating":"1","title":"More from Lamott on \\"The Wonder of Me\\"","review":"God save us from sanctimonious and self-absorbed people like Anne Lamott. Me, me, me, me, and more about me...and what do you think about me. That's the collected works of Lamott. I wish she'd shut up for a while and and ponder pride as one of the seven deadly sins."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwhile read","review":"Traveling Mercies is the second book I've read by Anne Lamott. She is as mesmerizing a writer in this as she was in Operating Instructions.I was amazed at her ability to find God in situations where, through our busy-ness, we might overlook Him. She writes in a way that puts you right in the middle of what is happening and what she is feeling. I highly recommend Traveling Mercies for its humor, insight and wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Your Living Room with Ann Lamott","review":"If you have read anything by Lammott, you feel like you are reading many different essays on the same subject. Even her fiction reads like each chapter is a different episode of a television series. Traveling Mercies stands in this same line. After reading this book, all her wittiness, honesty and storytelling mesh together. When I think about this book a few days after having read it, I see themes appear over and over, attitudes surface here and there, and inside jokes pop up again and again. If you have read Bird by Bird or any of her fiction you will recognize Lamott's conversational style in Traveling Mercies. After reading this book, you feel like you know her, like you just had a long conversation with her in your living room."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of my summer reads!","review":"This book is about nothing at all -- but everything that is important. Lamott has special eyes to see the exquisiteness of grace in our everyday lives. And when I finished the book, her special eyes had rubbed off on me. Life seems freer, fresher... Ann reminds me that God is, indeed, at work in our lives. Her ability to capture the special in the mundane is a rare gift, and I just couldn't get enough of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the kind of theology Jesus would write","review":"I was taking a break last Saturday from my own work as a writer about the Bible, and found this book on the shelf. Once in my hand, my work was done for the day and evening until the last page was turned. Anne Lamont accomplishes that most rarely done task: helping people to find God amidst the most ordinary struggles of daily life. In other words, she's the kind of \\"theologian\\" Jesus was. Each story is a parable in which the reader cannot help but ask, \\"was God present here? If so, what does this say about my own ways of seeking or finding the divine in daily life?\\"And one of the best things about the book is that she shows that you can be a \\"born again Christian\\" and actually live a Christian life, opposed to war, injustice, poverty and oppression; and in solidarity with the outcasts, the sick and the dying. Three alleluias for Anne Lamott and this glorious testimony of faith!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"It's been a little while since I've read a book that I could''t put down. And I love to read. Anne Lamott describes things in such a way that you feel like your part of the scene. I can't wait to read the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautifully Written Autobiography of the Soul","review":"Anne Lamott has written a tender and sometimes brutally honest book about her own walk of faith. Her journey is one of fits and starts, looking for faith in the wrong places and finding it where and when you least expect it. Reading this book made me feel like I was panning for gold. You sift through some seemingly ordinary silt till you find a precious nugget that makes all the mud seem beautiful. The book start out rather slow but the latter chapters are true gems. Lamott's style of writing may weary some readers but for those willing to follow her, she reveals some amazing insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be in every hotel room drawer","review":"Many's the time when I was on the road for my job -- depressed, exhausted, eating Kettle Crisps from the minibar because I didn't know how else to fill the time/emptiness/boredom. I for one wish there were a copy of TRAVELING MERCIES in each hotel room, right next to the Gideon Bible. Except people would steal them...perhaps there should be a chain attached, like on phone books.TM is warm, hilarious, self deprecating and life affirming...it reminds us with finely crafted prose why we are here in the global asylum. There are one or two \\"reviewers\\" who have been lobbing vicious hand grenades at Ms. Lamott's sites -- Pay no attention -- this book is clearly a winner - just wonderful. Another bestseller from one of America's most cherished authors. Lammot ROCKS, and so does Travelling Mercies -- which I have given as a gift to everyone I know with a heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrereverant and Self-Absorbed","review":"I bought this book hoping to be inspired and moved. At times I was. Mostly, however, I was disappointed in the liberal agenda Anne Lamott seems to have. Anyone who disagrees with her is 'homophobic' or a 'Right-Winger'. Is she any better by labeling people this way? No. I don't think so. Her introspection is limited, or maybe it is too intense. She has a very shallow view of the world. Loving only those who love in return, hating anything Republican, avoiding Fundamentalist Christians as though they are all rabid vermin. I was disappointed with her limited vision and her quasi-intellectualizing of the Christian faith. I'm sure she is a beautiful person and I feel sorry for her. I believe her intentions were truly good in writing this book. I wish she had been less vague and 'transcendental' in her approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable","review":"I found this book to be as much about a single mom with a young son as about faith. Certainly the author didn't pull any punches with her own life prior to this time but it was all done with humor and affection. Very readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, touching writing. Gave me cause for reflection.","review":"I rarely openly emote when reading but I was, both, laughing out loud and shedding tears at times when reading this wonderful book. I was constantly reflecting on my own experience with faith, alcoholism, and parenthood. Anne Lamott is the rarest of persons: A liberal Christian who is open about your own failings and self-discovery while maintaining a sense of humor. BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifelong learning and lessons to remember.","review":"I found this book to be most inspiring. As a Christian, I realized I am not the only one out here trying to hang on to my faith. One of my favorite passages from the book was \\"courage is fear that has said it's prayers.\\" Through all of her trials and tribulations the reader finds her to be a living, breathing, mistake making mother, friend, daughter,and lover. But, always a child of God. I have my own \\"God box\\" now and it is filling up quickly. Loved her humor and straight, although sometimes rough, language. This is by far, one of the best books I have read this year. Do something nice for yourself. Buy it. Read it. Higlight it. Keep it as a reminder of God's amazing grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not for me","review":"I found this book to be lacking the insights I was seeking. Anne Lamott's life is simply not that inspiring. True, she is a recovering addict who is also a single mom. True, she is a writer. But I didn't find any insights into the nature of God or faith in this book that I felt would qualify Lamott to teach me anything about God I couldn't learn from my own life or my own prayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great memoir writer","review":"All of Anne Lamott's memoirs make me laugh and warm my heart. This one is no exception. I read it two years ago and plan to revisit it soon. This book is full of humor and wonder about life and spirituality as Lamott takes us through her tragedies, better days and everydays. For her, every moment is worth writing about and she always has a way of keeping you interested with her observations of the cotidian."},{"rating":"2","title":"traveling mercies grabbed and didn't let go","review":"I'm always looking for authors who can write so well that you can almost most taste the words. In this book I can taste the pain, and nuances in every passage. It is uplifting and courageous. Many of the lines sink deep in your soul and give you thought, about christianity and the spiritual journey you may be on.

She speaks honestly about her journey with God, no holds barred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written","review":"I was wary of this book when I saw the title, but found that it was not an in your face account of spirituality in which religion is shoved down the reader's throat, but instead an honest look at one woman's struggles to find God. I found the book inspiring. I also found LaMott's prose to be some of the best I have ever read. I read each sentence slowly and carefully, not wanting to miss a single word. I also disagree with the reviewer who said gen-xers would not enjoy this book. I am 28 and think it is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very human spiritual journey.","review":"The journey, with all of its failures and wrong-turns, becomes a beautiful thing to see. She does not end up where I would have ended up, but her experiences ring true."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Mercies","review":"Read this book!I first saw Anne Lamott on the Rosie O'Donnell show, with her dread locks and warm personality, I put this book on that mile long list in my head of books to get. It was quite some time after, I was getting books to take with me on a trip that Traveling Mercies became the perfectly timed book for me to read.Anne Lamott writes like she's talking to you as a friend. I would recommend this book to anyone, even if they are not a religious person. For me, it spanned beyond religion, and became a book about life. It came into my life at a time when my mother was having cancer surgery, so perfectly timed.This is a story about Anne's journey while finding her faith, becoming a mother, dealing with very large problems and passing her quirky wisdom onto us, the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"aching.","review":"I honestly had to push myself to read this whole book. Yes Ms. Lamott is very good at writing interesting and descriptive fun things. She is a great writer. My problem is that despite the wonderful work that the Lord has obviously done on her life, she did not mention that anything she had done or that those around her were into was sin. . it just seemed like she was condoning too much in order to draw people in. She can definitely be used to inspire those who are looking for faith, yes, but at the same time I had a hard time reading things due to my personal knowledge of the Bible and scriptures. I can certainly see that the Lord is still working hard on her, and that she has a relationship with God, and so that made me happy. It just wasn't the right book for me to read. I am too into apologetic and theological studies (and using one's experience to even talk about those things)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish Fulfillment","review":"This book is about the need to believe. If you want something badly enough you can convince yourself of almost anything. For example her experience after getting an abortion was an example. She had to find some kind of meaning to it so out of a deep wish, she convinced herself she was feeling the presence of Christ. I was in the hospital myself faced with death. Jesus wasn't there for me. I prayed and all I felt was coldness. For every Anne Lamott out there, there is a person like myself, and if that is true; is it that Jesus is only interested in half the people that need him? I don't think so I think it's nothing but fantasy. In other words it is a bunch of head tripping nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"The naysayers were right!","review":"I couldn't believe an author could sell so many books, and offer so little. I had to find out for myself. Well, it cost me a few bucks but I've learned a lesson. The naysayers were right: There's nothing here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Women Focused","review":"There's no question that this is a well written book about one WOMANS spiritual journey. Heavy emphasis on woman. As a man,I had a hard time relating to many of Lamotts essays. Specifically the ones about fat thighs, not being pretty, bad hair days, not looking good in a bathing suit, eating disorders, boyfriend problems, etc. I just couldn't relate.The book gets kudos from me, however, for showing that it's possible to be a liberal and a Christian. I also liked the overture section that detailed her path to Jesus. Women will love this book (as the review show), men might have a hard time relating to Lamotts life story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Under Par","review":"I was told by a classmate that this book was inspirational, funny, and a great read. Also, former raving reviews caused me to buy it. However, I was very disappointed and did not even finish the whole text because I couldn't stand one more cheesy metaphor about her haphazardous life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A One-Word Book: Me","review":"This book has as much to do with Faith as Bird By Bird has with writing. Lamott sees, and writes, nothing beyond her own self-centered view of life. She has a vocabulary of one: \\"me''. Well, this reader, and plenty of others, are tired of listening. Save it for your shrink, Lamott."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Indulgent","review":"This book was a bookclub book for me and I had no preconceived notion or really any idea of what it was about. From the start, I found the writing style frenetic and almost stream of consciouness-like and very hard to follow. When I adjusted to the writing style enough to focus on the content I was more disappointed as I found it to be a self-absorbed account of someone's individuals journey with very little in the form of a messesge or inspiration. Very rarely do I read a book that has little or no value or impact for me, I would rate this one at a negative impact. perhaps I just speak another language and others will find it helpful or interesting, hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I miss?","review":"Or, more specifically, what has Anne Lamott missed? This book is not about faith, but about a confused and lonely person who seems to regard religion as a sort of personal improvement program, like AA or therapy. I fully agree with the reviewer who said that Anne Lamott needs to contemplate pride as one of the seven deadly sins.Since the book isn't about faith, what is it about? Well, one woman's feelings of inadequacy resulting from a rather difficult life. In the hands of good authors this can be interesting, even deeply moving, but Lamott never moves beyond the whining peevishness of a high-school girl. I had felt the same way about her \\"Bird By Bird\\" but thought I would give a book on faith another chance. But all one hears from Anne Lamott is \\"me, me, me.\\" Hard to find God, or even Christian fellowship, in all this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacred & Profane - both sides of the coin","review":"Another gr8 book from Ann Lamott. She demonstrates a delightfully earthy approach to spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kleenex Required","review":"I loved this book. It is touching in a quiet, profound way. Almost all of the essays made me cry (I'm a complete softie of the TV-ads-make-me-cry variety.) The stories in this book are straight forward, remarkably honest and often hilarious - I'd love to meet the author. I will definitely be reading some of her other books - what better recommendation can I give?! (This book was recommended to me by sewgeeky.com, another hero of mine!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written and moving","review":"I guess everybody falls into pain and crises during their life, and it seems to be my turn right now. As Anne said, to quote preacher Veronica, \\". . . the world sometimes feels like the waiting room of the emergency ward and that we who are more or less OK for now need to take the tenderest possible care of the more wounded people in the waiting room, until the healer comes. You sit with the people, she said, you bring them juice and graham crackers.\\"Traveling Mercies has brought me juice and graham crackers. I am most appreciative."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop sharing this book with others!","review":"I am not a writer but I recognize genius when I read it. It's amazing to read prose like writing about the very things that I've had in my head for so long. As I journey on my own spiritual path I will refer to this book and be grateful Thank you Thank you Thank you to Ms. Lamott for her willingness to share her insights and life experience via this medium of writing. What a talent. I will be looking for the other books. This is my first by Annie Lamott and I'll be reading others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another One to Re-read Periodically","review":"I bought this book after reading Bird by Bird and absolutely loving it. I have to say the Bird by Bird is still my favorite, but Traveling Mercies is also a great book. Anne is so likeable to me, I feel like I would love to just hang out drinking coffee with her and discussing our paranoias. I also agree with another reviewer that you don't have to be religious to like this book, though if you are profoundly un-religious you may be turned off. This is a great book to keep around and just pick up and flip through every now and then. At a time when I have been questioning my own faith, Traveling Mercies provides a wonderful reminder of the power of faith when you are consistently faithful. If only I could find a Saint Andrews where I live!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Traveling Mercies doesn't cover any new ground.","review":"The ironic thing about the title of Anne Lamott's new book Traveling Mercies is that it really doesn't cover any new ground and basically covers many of the same experiences as her previous books. She doesn't stray much from events relating directly to her, nor does she write about how they may be affecting other people around her. Even Christianity seems to be just another excuse for Anne to talk about Anne. For a book on faith it doesn't seem to deal with the Gospel or Jesus in particular detail or depth. It is as if the challenges or conflicts of being Christian aren't worth being mentioned. Towards the end of the book, you can't help but feel annoyed at an author that seems so arrogantly self absorbed. There is a thin line between autobiographical and being narcissistic and Traveling Mercies crosses it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith - A Thing of Beauty, Often Unrecognized","review":"Anne Lamotte has given us a book about faith that is greater than any I've ever read. She shows us how her faith grew through the drawing into a community of an alcoholic and drug addicted young lady with dreadlocks. She shows us that people of faith are humans with all the flaws of humans, and that there is not \\"miraculous event\\" that occurs to \\"cure\\" all out ills or our sinful nature and actions.As a person suffering from depression and alcohol addiction recovery, and struggling with my faith and my relation to God and his or her relation to me, I find myself seeing visions though the words of this wonderful woman that I've never seen before. Those visions are helping me to find my way back to a path of emotional and faithful contentment.Thank you Anne Lamotte for your ragged and blatent honesty! If more people would be so honest, the world and the church would be a better place."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this.","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I had heard good things about it and read lots of reviews of people liking it. To me though - it seemed like it was just a look of reflections on the author's life without much direction. There seemed to be very little about her faith and how that had helped.I apparently just missed the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best spiritual memoirs I've ever read","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I felt that Anne Lamott had invited me into her home for a cup of tea and while she wrapped me around a quilt that she had knit herself, shared her thoughts and stories on spirituality, life, her son, and herself. It's a warm account of her life, her faith, her friends and everything that matters to her. She did a brilliant job capturing the magic that makes her spiritual and how it is infused in her everyday life. The writing is superb, top-notch, and her book is elegantly structured with essays beautifully tied together like the quilt I had mentioned before. Once in a while, one gets quite saddened that a book is about to end, that a voice is about to close, and that is how I felt when I read the last page. I've been reading many spiritual memoirs lately, and this is one of the best thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book on Faith and Self-Awareness","review":"I love this book. It is a classic. Her self-awareness and self-honesty are refreshing and caused me to examine myself in different ways. Although it's written as a memoir, her discussion of her journey of faith deepened my spiritual experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith even an atheist can love.","review":"Anne Lamott's writings on faith are so gentle and simple, even old cynics and non-believers -- like myself -- are charmed and enlightened. If you're an atheists and think you may find yourself in a foxhole, take this book with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly honest","review":"I read this book over the course of a vacation and found it intriguing. Intriguing in the sense that I have never read a book about the quest for spirituality written from her viewpoint. Her thoughts are at once bawdy and poignant, helping us to realize that we too have a place in the quest for God. Too many books of the spiritual genre reflect on the bad times in ones life as past - as a struggle that is over having achieved nirvana. Anne Lamott's writing underscores the fact that the journey towards spirituality is an ungoing process, and a process that is worthy of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sham","review":"The only thing this author knows, or writes, about faith is her lack of it.

The examples of self-indulgence are too many to repeat; the non-existence story line that leads no-where. Her first \\"I'm a reformed druggy, drunk..\\" may have struck a chord with readers the first time round, but c'mon now, how many times can this poor, sad-sack woman milk this line. Get her to rehab--fast. The proverbial wool has been pulled too many times over the sensibilities of supposedly intelligent readers to dicipher when they're being taken. Congrats to Anne! She has a cadre of fools--continue on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got a story?","review":"The first half of the book was somewhat interesting, and then it went downhill. I found nothing moving about the events upon the author. Needed to see some growth or something different by the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explains a lot.","review":"This book confirmed what I always suspected: That the underlying causes of spirituality are mainly self-centeredness, instability, incompetence, and overwhelming bad luck. As I've said before with regard to Ms. Lamott's work, she knows how to write, but she sure as Hell (pardon the metaphor) doesn't know how to live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Navel Lint","review":"Lamott describes discovering navel lint with a friend from high school in one of her tedious essays.

She is my hero and I really want to meet her some day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I guess it should give all aspiring memoir writers hope that something this shallow managed to get published.

She should have billed this as a memoir, not a \\"book on faith.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I was engrossed with the facts and thrilled by the many directions of the witty style of Anne Matthews and found \\"Wild Nights\\" thoroughly entertaining and very informative. And, having lived in \\"Gotham\\", I can attest to the accuracy of much of the content. It's thought provoking how much is missed when we don't remember to reflect on the sequence of events. Anne Matthews has captured a linear progression of history, natural and other, and displayed it interestingly. One star omitted due to the last chapter's jaunt to Armageddon."},{"rating":"1","title":"New York Nature Deja Vu","review":"As an avid reader of books focusing on the political, cultural and environmental life of New York City, I was excited at the prospect of purchasing \\"Wild Nights.\\"However, upon taking a brief read of the book, I got the distinct impression that I'd read it before! And as a matter of fact, I had four years ago: \\"Wild New York\\" by Margaret Mittlebach and Michael Crewdson.And just judging by a cursory reading of Ms. Matthew's book, I would imagine she's read it as well. Now, to be sure, I am not accusing her of plagarism. However, I do feel that her book is a rather artless, plodding retread of ground covered in Ms. Mittlebach's and Mr. Crewdson's lively and engaging exploration of the city's geographic history.Not to say that Ms. Matthew's book isn't comprehensive, it just isn't necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retread of Previous Books","review":"Wild Night is a retread of previous work about nature in the metropolitan area, including The Meadowlands (Robert Sullivan) and Wild New York (Margaret Mittlebach and Michael Crewdson). Why have a section on Sullivan's discovery of the remnants of Penn Station in the swamps of New Jersey, when this was the sole focus of his book? And she doesn't even credit Sullivan in the acknowledgements. She also never mentions Wild New York, which she obviously used as a source. What's surprising here is that Matthews teaches journalism to students at NYC (a fact she mentions in the book). What kind of lesson is she teaching her students? Pillage the work of others without giving credit?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Are the Attributions","review":"I would like to echo other readers' sense that they've read it before, and from sources not given credit by Ms. Matthews. And as an activist in New York City intimately involved in the issues that Matthews explores, I question the soundness of her facts. For instance, her account of the cricket action at a NYC land auction was really off. Sort of fun, but I think there are other more useful and trustworthy sources for the same ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in the Bronx","review":"There is a major problem with Wild Nights.

Did editors snip out all mentions of the bronx in a chapter titled \\"deep time in the bronx\\"? Or did the editors of this book fail to notice that the bronx wasn't mentioned in a chapter titled \\"deep time in the bronx\\"?I would like to know how this occurred, because I really wanted to learn about the bronx's geology, which I assume what the author meant by \\"deep time in the bronx\\".Please explain to me what happened to the discussion of the bronx in a chapter titled \\"deep time in the bronx.\\"I really want to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, concise, to the point infosec title","review":"It is ironic that the advent of the computer promised to dramatically reduce paper usage; today's 1,000-page-plus computer-security tomes have probably single-handedly deforested whole regions of the earth. A happy exception to this trend of titanic texts is Enterprise Security: The Manager's Defense Guide; which is relatively concise yet highly informative.It provides a good overview of core information security issues and concepts. It takes a big-picture approach to information systems security, not bogging down the reader in arcane minutiae.Overall, it has a more management- and process-oriented look at security and it a valuable title for anyone needing to know about information systems security without sacrificing a forest in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is NOT for children","review":"As an adult and child of immigrants, I can appreciate this movie in many ways. The movie features beautiful scenery and superb acting. I chose to rate this movie the way I did, however, because of a truly GRAPHIC and totally unnecessary scene depicting the slaughter and bleeding out of goats. This scene lends nothing to the film whatsoever and has the actors actively engaged in the slaughter of animals. This movie is without a doubt worth watching and owning but children should not be allowed to view the pointless violence directed at animals in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really Enjoyed It","review":"I have to say that for the few weeks it took me to read the book (on and off) it really did help to pull me away from the day to day grind of life.

Most of the detractors points have low merit (and I would think these same reveiwers have spent little time trying to forage for food in the wilderness considering one persons point that \\"ideas\\" have more meaning).

Let me save you a few days of your life by summing up the book: The reason why white, western / European societies flourished and the rest of the of the non-white, non-western world did not was because the European climate and terrain favored domestication of plants and animals while the rest of the world's terrain and climate did not. Therefore, western man had more free time on his hands to invent stuff and put a man on the moon, while the rest of the world, to this day, is still screwed up. Wow.

Diamond bathes in anything that can support his ridiculous hypotheses, ignoring the overwhelming evidence that does not. For instance, he expects his ignorant readers to assume that sub-Saharan Africa had no domesticatable animals and plants, something that almost made me fall out of my chair with laughter. Sub-Saharan Africans live in richest area of the planet, from minerals to fauna! The entire region is teaming with multitudes of plants and animals that would be easily domesticated: sorghum, millet, yams, and rice; guinea fowl, elephants, buffalo, giraffes, zebras, and wildebeests.On the plus side, though, I must admit the book makes a great coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Mein Kampf\\" of the PC movement","review":"I made myself read the book because I paid for it.

The author cites other instances, for instance, the Maori of Polynesia simply wiped out or enslaved another tribe, the Moriori, who must have been the \\"give-peace-a-chance\\" hippies of the 1830s.

This book ultimately takes fundamental ideas which are simple to understand and by the time you are finished you are overwhelmed by the simplicity of both the arguments and the arguer.My issue is not with the text but with the delivery. One of the most difficult tasks is to try to make statistics, facts, and concepts such as discussed in this text interesting.This book neither compels the reader to continue to research this subject, nor come up with their own ideas. It is what it is, a text which provides facts but little by the way of enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-argued and accessible, but not Pulitzer material","review":"Jared Diamond is no genius, but his argument is coherent, convincing, and timely. He brings scientific expertise and outside perspectives from the realms of botany, zoology, geography, and anthropology to the field of history. The theory of environmental determinism which he generally supports is nothing new, and many have elaborated on it before, but his global scope and willingness to reach back into prehistory for evidence is commendable. A very readable and important book, but with a mediocre writing style and a somewhat sloppy and unfocused structure, I don't believe it deserved the Pulitzer prize. Read it anyway if you have little background in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing political propaganda","review":"I sensed from the begining that there was something wrong with this book. The author was making his objective quite clear and it was not to search for the truth. It was to fight racism, which is certainly a worthy goal. Unfortunately, his weapon in this fight is to present some fascinating facts and then in a most unscientific manner reach a conclusion that is merely a possiblity but that is not proven. The key technique of argument is repetition and the demonization of Eurepeans. In a most bigoted way the author lumps all Europeans as one group. No attempt is made to explain why there are significant differences between various European groups. Why Norway is so different than Albania despite the fact that both had domesticated animals and practiced farming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring...","review":"I was very excited to read this book and then very disappointed.

I suppose the civilization-altering ideas of these men are not the products of genius, but, rather, the inevitable product of the earth. As if springing up from a volacano, the ideas that transformed the world (observation and reality over fantasy, capitalism, etc.) and gave some cultures clear and indisputable superiority over other cultures had little to do with the people, but only in their placement on the earth.

This blatant omission forces him to only talk about facts that support his thesis. Of course, geography, resources, and population density are going to play a role in how successful a people are. But so does how they are governed, what role religion and science play in their civilization, are they accepting of foreign technology, in other words their culture.This book is very politically correct. The fact is that some cultures/civilizations are superior to others. Some of that advantage comes from luck in the beginning, but a large part comes from the choices a civilization makes as it develops."},{"rating":"1","title":"god-awful writing","review":"Aside from all the logical, scientific and historical convolutions, which have been exhaustively noted by other reviewers, little is said about Diamond's writing style. He has a terrible command of the English language; he is repetitive and academically dishonest and inauthentic. I cannot really determine the reason this book made all the fuss that it did. What's worse is that this book gives people a sense that they learned something or that Diamond proved something when all he has done is poorly synthesized others' works without citing them, or made things up in a heap of dreadful language.

Too many sweeping generalizations and too many factual errors in the text. For example, when talking about bananas he writes about early man selecting for smaller and smaller seeds until there weren't any more. Modern seedless bananas are that way because they are triploid and sterile. This is something that has happened fairly recently, probably within the last couple of hundred years. Sloppy terminology, factual errors and the sweeping generalizations ruined this book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scientific history","review":"One of the most important book I ever read.

While there are those who would readily question the author's reliance on geographical factors as the sole influence on the development of human societies, I personally find the theory quite applaudable and impressive.This timely work should play a great part in putting to rest the racist views long held by many who speculated on the factors influencing the development of human societies.Very, very well done.

It tackles a lot of controversial topics. The main focus of this book is to answer the question, \\"What made Europeans technologically superior to Africans?\\" What the book discusses is very interesting but sometimes a little disorganized.

But the explanation as to the slow acceptance of farming and civilization are still attributed to a flaw, or problem within the people themselves.

To hear him tell it -- endlessly, I might add -- Western Civilization owes it ascent and dominance purely through nature's circumstance. He discounts religion and culture as drivers in the development of nations. A ridiculous notion, indeed!For example, the Black Plague nearly wiped out Western Europe, but the Europeans rose from this period to begin the Renaissance era: a period of unequalled creativity and increased liberties for the average citizen, leading to the end of serfdom.

Therefore, those members of the tribe who did not possess the intelligence and foresight to prepare for a period of no food---died. China, Japan, Korea, America, and Europe get cold.

I have also read \\"The Third Chimpanzee,\\" and overall I found that to be a better read. Having read \\"Guns\\" before, though, I was able to follow the arguments in \\"Chimpanzee\\" a bit more easily, since he made references to people and places there that he did not elaborate on.

The author is a physiology professor at a medical school--essentially an amateur popular science writer.

Diamond says early on that he intends to creat a non-racist explanation for European dominance, constructs a series of variables (see above reviews) required for success, isolates three or four places in the world where these variablies intersect, and then proceeds to find reasons why only the Europeans could have succeeded. My favorite naked cop-out: China could not develop an advance society because its coastline is smooth, see, and so dissenters had no place to hide from a centralized government that suppressed innovation.(Um, why?) Europe's coastline, by contrast, is crinkly.

I was turned off however by Diamond's relentless attack on the notion that one race may be intellectually superior to another. Sure enough, to my knowledge, there has never been any serious research that has conclusively come down on one side or the other. But because of that, I believe we are entitled to opinions on the subject, but Diamond would want only one opinion, and that is: all the races are equal in their intellect.

I really missed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 100-word book review","review":"In this thought-provoking and ambitious book, Diamond sets out to explain, in broad terms, how the current human economic, political and social world came to be the way it is. He refutes racist notions of inherent genetic superiority, pointing instead to geographical features, such as oceans, mountain ranges and the positioning of continents. The global distribution of useful plant and animal species is also crucial. This book is wonderfully entertaining, providing many a nugget of fascinating information for the curious. However, Diamond's conclusions are humbling, when one considers the way vast impersonal forces have worked together to shape human history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and thin on ideas","review":"If you are interested in this book, I would strongly urge you to buy his previous book _The Third Chimpanzee_ instead. _Guns, Germs, and Steel_ is merely a book length explication of the ideas contained in one 30 page chapter of that book. Unfortunately, padding them out to 350 pages didn't add much in the way of depth or interest to the ideas. Instead, Diamond goes through and repeats the same basic points 6 or 7 times over the course of this longer work. His writing quickly grew tedious as no new ideas emerged after page 40 or so--merely more repetitive hammering home of the basic points.Not that the core idea--that local biological factors had a decisive influence on the rise of early civiliations--isn't compelling. It is a fascinating perspective. But it's ultimately not enough to carry the entire book, and Diamond really has little else to offer. With _The Third Chimpanzee_ you get the same ideas plus about 15 other ideas almost equally interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"guns,germs and steel","review":"great perspective other than what we in western cultures traditionally have in in our relations with 3rd world countries"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the interested layman to enjoy","review":"I do not have a degree in history but have always been interested in discovering the past. Many \\"scholarly\\" books speak at a level that makes reading them more a chore than pleasure. Guns, Germs, and Steel sets a standard for intelligent, well composed historical prose that hits all the high points. I never felt left behind by the author and was intrigued by the expanding case for environment as the driving cause of conquest and the make up of our modern world.A joy to read, it is enlightening and well laid out. The only caveat would be Diamond's tendency to restate his case and prove already acceptable theories. The entire work is logical and I can't find an argument to dispute his conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulitzer?","review":"Fertile Land=Agriculture and Domesticated Animals=Stored Food=Craftsmen and Politicians=Weapons and Technology=Exploration and Conquest. How profound! Wasn't that part of Anthropology 101 when I took it 30 years ago? I should have known better than to slog thorough this tome once the author (scientist?) speculated that the people of New Guinea were more intelligent than Eurasians because they were naturally selected for intelligence while Eurasians were only naturally selected for immunity to disease. That was right after he ridiculed and condemned as a racist anyone who suggests there might be intellectual differences between racial groups. Incredible. Poorly written, repetitive and unoriginal. The Pulitzer committee (and Bill Gates) should be embarrassed. It's the last time a Pulitzer will influence my selection of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polymathic Tour de Force","review":"A dazzling display of erudition, insight and synthesis that seeks to explore the factors that have enabled some societies to be more successful than others. Many of the ideas in this book can be found elsewhere but I have not found any other single work that manages to combine history, biology, linguistics, geology, paleontology and anthropology into a unified argument that provides such a useful paradigm for studying the unequal outcomes of world history. Whatever your own beliefs and opinions and however much you might disagree with Diamond's particular arguments, you can't help but learn from this book (ever heard of glottochronology?). All in all, an impressive and thought-provoking work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"Seems to be a book everyone one should read, though I just love history.

The most interesting thing for me is that it contains a great summary of the human world to the 1500's. If you want to know about anything from the development of metallurgy, to language, to domestication of plants and animals, this book talks about it.One con of this book is that it sometimes can feel repetitive. There were many times that I thought \\"Oh, great, thanks for telling me again that 'guns, germs, and steel' are the end results of such and such.\\" I would have much preferred that the title be something like \\"The Fates of Human Societies\\" and slowly work up to \\"Germs\\" in the first third, then \\"Steel\\" in the 2nd third, then \\"Guns\\" in the 3rd third."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"I needed this book for my Anthropology class.

However, his book is Euro-centric, patronizing and bound by European concepts of time and space. He fails to consider native perspectives on Europeans, does not explore Native empires to an adequate degree, and entirely dismisses the importance of religion to both European and Native societies. The author does not discuss the role of human agency in determining the fate of society. Diamond also fails to explore the China questions: having had the same or more advanced resources and technology as the Europeans, why didn't China take over the world? He discusses germs in depth, but spends little or no time on guns and steel.Having read this book side by side with Mann's 1491, I definitely recommend the latter"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most truely interesting books I've read in years!","review":"For students of the social sciences and teachers alike, it is rare to find a book so wide in breadth and so monumentally couragous in unearthing why our social world is how it is. With a mear few hundred pages, Diamond paints a complex picture of the past 15,000 years in a qualitative manner which draws strongly from holistic vantage point that ushers the reader into a new and exiting paradigm. Diamond is careful not to make sweeping, unqualified assumptions, while at the same time he is successful in bringing together a wide aray of information to prove his point. Both the general interest reader and the experts will enjoy this important book. In an age when the nature nurture debate continues to rage, this author has the ability to move beyond the quibbling to a new understanding of the human animal, and the world we inhabit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book just long","review":"The book makes some great associations and explains things in fairly simple terms. The discovery of countries and their timing with the evolution of the peoples discovered coincides nicely with the theories of why roles aren't reversed.

He read smoothly and I actually enjoyed hearing the pages turn in the background.I'd still recommend this book to interested parties whom I know are avid readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"The book was chosen by my book club and the subject sounded interesting.

It was interesting, but it so very barely skimmed the surface of the topic that it easily could have been condensed into a ten page essay. The ideas are obvious, the treatment of the subject is shallow, and his writing is addressed to a second-grade level of world understanding.

Mr. Diamond tips his hand fairly early in the book by taking pains to explain that there is no scientific evidence of genetic variations in intelligence and that this idea came about through Eurocentrism. He then states that his aboriginal friends of New Guinea are obviously more intelligent than white Europeans and wonders how the two cultures developed so differently. This contradiction and Mr. Diamond's pretty obvious biases made it very difficult for me to take his answers to this very interesting question seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeping Pills In Print","review":"I feel the book is accurate.

Diamond starts by stating that he has developed a new theory that is different from the geographic theory and then basically re-states the geographic theory. Nothing new in this book. Also, Diamond goes out of its way never to mention Hebrews or Israel as a part of the fertile crescent. For example, on page 135, he depicts such artificial countries as Jordan, Syria & Iraq but does not depict Israel/Judea - the heart of the Fertile Crescent.Also, this book is about 300 pages too long, repetitive & poorly written.A Global Brain or a Lucipher Principle are much more interesting and better theories written by Howard Bloom"},{"rating":"2","title":"Auido Book Review.","review":"May be it's just mine, but the last tape's second half didn't play at all.

If he is appealing over the heads of his peers to the public at large, he should be excommunicated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel is a political treatise, not science.","review":"Jared Diamond's book, Guns, Germs, and Steel, is based on a premise which is undoubtedly correct, that geography has affected history. Unfortunately for readers who expected a sholarly treatment of the subject, the book only serves to detail the author's prejudices. Perhaps the book was written with college freshmen in mind as the audience; it is doubtful anyone else would be impressed with the author's very selective use of facts, his unproven assertions, or his hysterical invective against Europeans, however politically correct that literary style is at present. The author cannot even mention European explorers without placing quotation marks around the word \\"explorers\\".

First, the author sees himself as a scientist and writes like he is providing an article to Vanity Fair. Ignoring science, disregarding significant works and stating opinion as fact he proceeds to batter us with trivia while ignoring facts. I have no argument with the inability of IQ tests to accurately define human intelligence as it relates to practical capability. That doesn't mean, as one of the other reviewers mentioned, that the Bell Curve is not a significant book. Argue the rationale not simply state an opinion and walk away. This book is so plagued with bad science and silly extrapolations from 11,000 years ago that it ignores many of the realities of history. I'll stop now but I could go on for paragraphs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biased?","review":"The presentation, although Historically correct, has in its slant a definite liberal bias.

This is a new and interesting premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nature vs. Nurture: I though we settled this.","review":"Diamond presents interesting hypotheses and evidence for the influence of geography and culture in shaping human societies, but states they are the ONLY causes of societal development. Never forget that societies are made of people. People mediate the effects geography etc. have on society. To say that people (i.e., intelligence) have nothing to do with society is tantamount to saying that nature (heredity) plays to role--that nurture (environment) is the only cause.

Jared Diamond wrote his book in a unique way: he asked the questions, and then went on the explain them. This made his point clear and understandable. Although Mr. Diamond covered numerous questions in each chapter, he thoroughly explained his answers and did not rush one to understand his logic.

Being a voracious reader, but little more than a high school education, it was a pleasure to read a scientific book that I could understand. Archeology and paleontology has always fascinated me but most books on these subjects leave a lot of unanswered questions. \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" has answered some of them. I have underlined sentances, written in the margins, made lists of more questions. The origin of cultures, yes, even races, languages and technology are all addressed in this book.

His reasoning that you take an average American and drop him into their hunter-gatherer society and he'd never survive. Though the exact same thing would happen if you took a NG highlander and dropped him in a Wal-Mart. His disregard for major western military victories are glossed over if mentioned at all.

Read Carnage & Culture instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading logic - don't be fooled!","review":"Jared Diamond writes in a flowery, redundant style that makes the book about three times as long as it should be. Besides that, and more importantly so, Diamond glosses over major holes in his theory that require an astute eye to catch. Though Diamond's presentation of geographic determinism contains interesting information, it ultimately caves under itself as Diamond consistently brushes away the idea that culture had anything to do with regional success, choosing instead to embrace the notion of continental diffusion axes, and at a point, the shape of coastlines (the latter of which indicates some of the outrageous claims in this book). \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" sounds reasonable at times but as a whole is remarkably far-fetched.

Seeking a non-racist explanation, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" author Jared Diamond wrote this book.He looks at when different continents were populated. (For example, there were humans in Africa and Europe long before there were humans in Australia.) He looks at the kinds of flora and fauna native to each continent; some spots, he found, had far fewer domesticable plants and animals. He looks at how geographical barriers kept some inventions and ideas from spreading to other areas.There are many charts, graphs and maps that helpfully illustrate his concepts. I would have preferred more photos, as I like to see the people and places I'm reading about.Diamond's writing is generally quite lively and engrossing. There are, however, a few dry spots. Overall, history and sociology buffs will enjoy this book immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Progress of Civilization","review":"The problem with attributing human social development to externalities is that it glosses over the essential differences between all societies- that is how labor is socially organized and who decides how to allocate and use the social surplus. While geography tempers social development, it is the method of social production that is the overwhelming determinant of social success. Slave societies out produce hunter-gatherers. Feudal out-produces slave, and wage labor out produces slavery and feudal systems.What is more more instructive is how current social relations restrict and hamper social development by wasting social production on useless activities like military ventures and individualized social decision-making. e.g. Individuals riding in cars instead of individuals sharing mass transportation, a more socially efficient transportation system."},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle edition is a ripoff","review":"Like the book but the kindle edition has no illustrations, maps and very crudely formatted tables.

Diamond's thesis is that modern-day civilization was solely determined by geography. In my favorite sections he gives examples how geography affected plant and animal domestication, and he illustrates how the east-west orientation of Eurasia led to their rapid propogation.The problem with this book, however, is not what it contains, but rather what information it is missing. Diamond never wavers from his thesis even when it has many apparent flaws. He discards the notion of biological/cultural differences affecting the progress of civilizations as \\"racist\\" and goes no further. Well, unfortunately the unpleasantness of a theory has nothing to do with whether or not it is true.

It seams the author has a view then went out to write a book that proves this view. Interesting ideas but there is not one chapter that would prove his theory wrong. I find that odd that everything points to him being right."},{"rating":"2","title":"GG&S is a great book but the Kindle version has problems","review":"Jared Diamond is a masterful author. His book, Guns, Germs and Steel, is an awesome discussion and exploration of the rise of human technology, political organizations, writing, and languages in the different continents and areas of the world. Diamond's command of the issues and supporting facts and numerous insightful examples is stunning and presented in very understandable ways.The only criticism I have has to do with the Kindle version of the book. The figures that are referred to in the text are missing in this version. Maybe Kindle can't handle these figures. This is too bad because the figures sounded very interesting. Also, the formats of the tables in the book are hard to read on the Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM 1226","review":"I read this book shortly after it was first published and was fascinated, absorbed and grateful. I have continuously recommended this book ever since. Now I see there are 1225 reviews. I have never seen so many reviews of one book. I am amazed to see 111 one-star reviews; what can they be thinking? Being #1226 means my review is superfluous and redundant, so I will say only this: when I rule the world (I have a sure-fire plan) I will have everyone read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No original contributions, poorly written","review":"Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" correctly suggests that environment is a major factor in the development of human societies. But his dismissal of all other factors involved and his inconsistent use of examples to suggest his arguements without any balanced discussion trouble this reader. The most valuable part of the book is \\"further readings.\\" He cites the excellent work by the Cavalli-Sforzas on paleobotany and a number of works on the effects of disease on human society. Read the references; ignore this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pre-text for history","review":"I can't add much here that reviewers before me haven't touched upon. Truely unique interwoven account of history and science. I'm not really a \\"science guy\\" but more of a history buff and I found this to be a great pre-text for history. If you like American or European history, this book is a great way to fill in some of the mystery between the start of civilization and the modern establishment of nation states. Some people have found fault with pedantic aspects of the book but I found these easy to brush aside. It drags a bit toward the end but it's a surprisingly quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting ideas, but not worth 400+ pages","review":"The author presents a simple and credible set of ideas. Unfortunately, far too much text is devoted to countless long-winded examples that don't add much insight or credibility to those ideas. Instead of reinforcing the author's arguments, this serves to obscure them in the endless verbiage, and bores the reader into a coma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Western propaganda","review":"The book is a violent attack on Western civilization. Diamond tries to compile all possible negative elements. It is far from obvious to me that his ideas are reliable. Even worse, in his rage against the West he forgets the great benefits of the West. Deep in himself he may not stick to his ideas, because I wonder why he does not move to a third World country? Is he realist and ready to live according to his convictions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, Kindle edition is mising important content","review":"Diamond's work should be, but this edition is not acceptable as, a contentious college textbook. There is no excuse for an e-book version lacking printed version content. None. If the e-book version cannot secure the illustration rights, then clearly say so, and drop the price. Otherwise, do not publish. Clearly, anyone can scan the missing content, and make the pirate version worth more then the official.This e-book version lacks pages, illustrations, and an index. The cover is skewed. There is no notice of the missing content or the flaws, before you buy. DON'T BUY this version. GET A DRM-FREE VERSION, AND STIFF THE PUBLISHER. Buy the author a lunch, via pay-pal or a charity of his choosing.DO NOT BUY THIS E-BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few interesting anecdotes, but the rest is tedious.","review":"I believed the cover blurb about this book, and was sorely disappointed. The only time this book came alive for me was when the author related personal anecdotes from his research and travels. The rest was rather tedious and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple yet profound thesis on how we got here","review":"There are hundreds of reviews on here of this monumental book covering the general thesis and finer details. Suffice to say that the book is extremely powerful and thought provoking. Whether or not one agrees with Diamond's conclusions, they are well-established and inspire critical thought. He has presented some of the simplest answers to questions of monumental historical significance, and the scientific presumption should always be that the simplest answer is most likely correct. While some reviewers slam Diamond as psuedo-Marxist and completely unbalanced, no competing theories of human development are as compelling as his nor as scientifically substantiated to this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important but sluggish","review":"This is an excellent book in the sense that it impartsimportant information about why western culture dominates theworld. Much of it is just the luck of geography not any kindof inherent superiority. Now half way through the book I feellike it needs to just end. I get the point. Why another 300pages? In feel the book reads very sluggishly like a history text. The first part was interesting but the middle reallydrags with unintersting information.The book is chock full of facts and details. For an almostopposite tone (little details and mostly well supported generalizations but great reading) I suggest Robert Wright'sNonzero. This books feels like the reference section for Wright'sthough the are really books with different theses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reductionism","review":"Very astute and interesting But : 1 All the mystery of the origin of civilization is reduced to down-to-earth factors such as the possibility to raise cattle in favoured areas 2 Mr Diamond has been very impressed because he has met an intelligent Papuan - That seems to be the key of his vision of History"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly smart and original","review":"General statements about the decisive weight of \\"birth\\" factors in the trayectory of living systems has been probably presented before, but never with such scope and with so a detailed examination of the precise chain of causation as Mr Diamond has done in this work. Mr Diamond takes nothing less than the entire human history and for his understanding he use for good an absolutely original approach that, supported in the findings of several sciences, put the root of all in a distant past of which seldom an historian had given too much attention before. And if that was not enough, he does so with cristal-clear prose that makes you read it with the same rush from beginning to end as if you were reading a top best seller writter, at his best. An incredible work. Surely Mr Diamond has all the trademarks of genius: powerful and simple, unified explanation of many things, at the same time compelling and thrilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reading for Everyone","review":"I loved this book! It starts at the beginning presenting a history of human evolution that rings true for me. The book is divided into different subject areas all designed to support the theory that the Eur-Asian continent provided white men with significant advantages over folks on continents that are taller than they are wide. The book includes the progression of man from hunter-gatherers to farming, the qualities that make a good domestic animal (cow), the origins of the written word, etc. He supports his theories with an abundance of research which at times caused me to think \\"I'm sold. Let's move on.\\" Overall it was an easy read and the information was valuable on so many levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guns, germs and steel","review":"Everyone should read this book, it is so interesting! It arrived on time and in excellent conditions. I am very pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling and inspiring","review":"An interesting travel through time to explain why the world of today is the way we are used to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel","review":"A mind-expanding book for me. On a subject which I didn't know much about when the book first came out. And while I no longer agree with everything Diamond says, his ideas are wonderfully stimulating. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the time to read","review":"Overall a fine book; well worth reading. I learned more about the history of man from 500,000BC to 4000 BC in this book than in the rest of my life put together. The overwhelming global perspective this book makes it even more valuable. Truly a fine description of many of the core formative elements of society.The books bends over backward to avoid any taint of racism. However, Mr. Diamond oversteps his bounds when he claims that he has resolved all issues that deal with how racism arises. I wish that these issues were as easily resolved. The older deeper issues that arise before the foundation of human society still exist. And Mr. Diamond's smug self importance taints an otherwise fine book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frustratiom at errors","review":"Paul Ehrlich in his review wrote that the reader wouldn't be able to put the book down after two pages. Well I put it down after three. Why can't publishers give respect to writers? Three errors in three pages, two of which should be picked up by the most rudimentary spell check. Page 10, second page of preface has \\"liguistic\\" for \\"linguistic\\". Next page has \\"of\\" for \\"or\\" in line 5 and \\"diverese\\" for \\"diverse\\" further down the page. Is this to continue? This from a respectable publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Present","review":"Bought it for a Christmas present for my father, he seemed to enjoy it but said the content and pace was a little dry. Overall, he was pretty happy with it, so I'll give it a 4/5 for decent gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you slap your forehead and wonder why you'd never thought of this","review":"Eg. a crop moving quickly along the same latitude, but taking a long time to traverse north/south because it would be crossing such radically different climates; or how impoverished a people can be if they are in an area with no beasts of burden to domesticate.I appreciate Diamond's expression of his opinions, neither too lengthy, nor too brief. Pat his editor on the back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author admits bias, but good perspective on how societies start","review":"Just finished this book today... Of course this book is biased, he admits this in the \\"Afterword\\" section, in the first few paragraphs. Of course he has a few opinions about different groups of people being \\"smarter\\" than others (Eurasians) but he admits that it is his opinion. It's a great persective and I think it supplements nicely with other history books, filling up a few \\"holes\\" in history....which is riddled with biased holes like swiss cheese! It's interesting and I won't take his extensive work for granted. Also, his afterword gives a lot of insight of how free trade, free economies and de-centralized governments provide a better standard of living for everyone. Examples include the differences between South/North Korea, former East/West Germany, the D. Republic and Haiti...etc. Great points!If anything, Diamond is biased in multiple accounts but the book is nothing short of amazing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"I have heard enough about Diamond's theories throughout this book that I decided to break down and read it. I have to admit that I am very happy I did. Diamond did an excellent job in summarizing (in just over 400 pages) the path of civilization leading up to life as we know it today. His arguments are not only interesting but also concrete. Although I would have liked to have more of the book focused on the future outcomes of the world, I do believe that this book accomplished what Diamond had wanted it to achieve. It's a great read, which I look forward to passing along to family members and friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid writing, solid logic.","review":"This is a great read, so long as you don't get bored by detail (I don't!). The author is very capable of taking a seemingly boring topic, and creating an entire book around it.To any person who thinks human variables trump geography and other environmental variables, it important to remember that without the geography to creates the environment that people operate in. I know it sounds stupidly simple, but think about it. One person could not dominate Europe for a great period of time, because of Europe's geography. One person could, however, control all of China, because of China's geography. Thus, without the geography to create the environment, there is no way for any one person to affect the future of the continent."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did we get where we are?","review":"Why are some societies dominant, others seem to never have gotten started? Thoughtful reading, that takes in facts, not societal propaganda, and will give you somthing to think about long after the book is closed. Should be on every thinking persons bookshelf"},{"rating":"2","title":"Converted Lover of History","review":"I'm reading this book and while its not a \\"can't put down and go to sleep,\\" it is one of the most informative and interesting books I've read. Diamond explores every aspect of human development. He very clearly and patiently explains how we got to be \\"the first world\\" and others didn't and throws in a lot interesting facts and snippets of history. How was the Cyrillic language created? Where did SARS (others preceding it) come from? Why does Europe eat so much bread and South America eat so much rice?Definitely a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Let me start by saying I have studied anthropology, forensics, anatomy and entomology. When I picked this book off the shelf I said \\"Now, this is the book for me!\\" From the first page, I found it to be the most boring, repetivive and predictable read I have ever experienced. I had more fun reading undergrad papers about moth pheromones. As some other reviewers mentioned, the author seems to put \\"stone-age\\" cultures on a pedestal as he tries to make Westerners feel bad for existing. Not really what I was hoping to get from this read. I actually fell asleep numerous times, trying to trudge through this. Hey, if you want bo believe the 5 start reviews, knock yourself out. I would sell the book, used but it's currently acting as a kickstand pad for my motorcycle..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Problem solver","review":"My daughter needed this book for her Critical Thinking college course.

The author backs up his claims with strong arguments which are well researched. He lays out the content of the book in a logical form starting with the clash of two civilizations: The Inca Empire and The Spanish conquistadores in Cajamarca, Peru. This historical episode, though placed at the beginning of the book, is shown to be the logical culmination of 11,000 years of evolution of human societies. The different rates of societal evolution form the basis of this work and are examined to reveal a few causal relationships which the author proposes account for the inevitable outcome symbolized by the massacre in Cajamarca. Suffice it to say that I found this book so interesting that I've gone on to another work by the same author: 'Collapse'."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"It is difficult to believe that the Pulitzer committee would give its prize to such an haphazard collection of wild speculations and outlandish conclusions. Diamond's own political agenda is his business. But passing this book off as some sort of 'scientific' support of those misguided ideals goes beyond the pale. I only hope that anyone else reading this tripe will see through it as easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage of the worst kind!","review":"...The author claims that the savages of New Guinea are mentally superior to those of Western Europe.Need I say more about this book for absolute sheer nonsense.

Every other student I've talked to agrees with my opinion, but hey, you might enjoy it if you like learning about the fates of human societies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Revisionist Lunacy","review":"This book is an entertaining read: buy it for laughs. If you want a realistic treatment of the subject however, buy Victor Davis Hanson's _Carnage and Culture_.Quoth Jared Diamond:\\"That is, in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westeners...\\" Really??? And this book won the Pulitzer Prize???Quoth Jared Diamond:\\"In fact, as I shall explain in a moment, modern Stone Age peoples are on the average probably more intelligent, not less intelligent, than industrialized peoples.\\" Perhaps this statement can qualify him for the Oprah Winfrey Book Club?So, the reason why Africa is such a hopeless morass, and why the Aborigines are still in the Stone Age, and why Arab countries are all suicide-bomb-promoting dictatorships, is because they are much more intelligent than Westerners? Didn't I tell you this book was entertaining?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically correct fabrications","review":"This book makes the point that geography is important, and that also living in large communities and cities is also important. This is true.What Jared has missed is natural selection... that 5,000 years of living in a more complex social environment has meant that the Europeans advanced genetically as their environment advanced. The europeans who survived, were the more intelligent, the more social, more politically machaivellian and the more immune ones.It is a chicken-and-egg situation. Jared refuse to aknowledge that other racial groups (such as africans) stopped evolving because their culture and environment stayed the same and didn't drive change.Or, to put it another way, Africans today are just as stupid as europeans were 5,000 years ago. But European society kept changing and this has forced people to advance too.This book is politically correct half-truths and polemic that is tedious to read and fails to follow through to its logical conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconclusive","review":"While this is an interesting book - it has no end. It is as though the writer was afraid to offend anyone and, while interesting points are made about civilizations and accessibility, it failed to state with any opinion how this reflects on modern society(ies). As race and cultural clashes our a part of everyday life, it would have been far more interesting to bring this research forward to a useful conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"good book, wrong format","review":"I loved listening to this book on tape. It was like attending an Anthro.101 class taught by a brilliant instructor. Unfortunately, the vendor from whom I ordered this book as a gift for friend who spends much time in the car, sent a print version instead of the audio version he listed. In print, the book is more difficult - I never made it past the third chapter. I highly recommend the audio book, just beware of getting the wrong format."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only everyone read this book!","review":"This book was actually the text book for a world history paper i took at university. I enjoyed the book (and the course) immensely. I've seen that Jared Diamonds arguments have not found favour with all the reviewers and perhaps I'll have to give the book a second look. My first impression was that Diamond adequately explains differences between the wealth of peoples across the world, applying research from many academic disciplines to reinforce his theories. I felt that Diamond produced a theory that successfully dismisses racist ideas on the differences between people. An accessible and enjoyable read, with conclusions i believe should not be dismissed easily. Perhaps critics of his work have ideological as opposed to scientific disagreements with his work. If this book were more widely read, I think it could do the world a great deal of good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Review of 10,000 Years of Human Development","review":"One of the best book I've read, in that it helped me better understand many of my own observations about human \\"civilization.\\" Well worth reading by anybody interested in the broad issues confronting the world today, even if one doesn't agree with every word.

Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thesis and synthesis","review":"In the first half of the book Diamond presents his thesis why certain continents are richer than other continents. This is fascinating reading as long as Diamond describes pre-historic times. His arguments are the strongest I have seen so far. Diamond is much less convincing when he moves to historic times and tries to explain differential performance within a given continent. The second half of the book describe individual continents and is quite tedious, but there is no need to read this section unless you have special interests in a particular region.The first half or the book is so interesting and thoughtful so it is a must read.Btw, do not buy the DVD with Diamond, it is quite dull. The book is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for everyone","review":"Diamond's book is a gem (no pun intended). It's clear, well-written and geared to the general reader.

It should be REQUIRED reading for every high school student and for all teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing historical analysis that leaves you rethinking.","review":"Good analysis gets beyond proximate causes and into the actual causes for general technological development. It's presentation is balanced and reasonable not fanatical or political. Centered on the attempt to answer the question about the conquest of the New World by the Old, as opposed to the other way around. Primarily focussed on the presense of raw animal and plant materials for the development of domestication. But overall provides a fairly lucid presentation of human history before writing, which is typically inadequately dealt with in history books. For me, the only thing I didn't like was the title. The best pre-historical history book I have read. One apparent lacunae to me was neglecting the effect of the Mediterranean on the development of Southern Europe and North Africa. The Third Chimpanzee is also as good, but focusses instead on human development. Both are enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Release","review":"I would've given this book a 5 star rating had the author not drug the ending out. Poor Alec!

The current version of SS use zoo zoo zoo Esquivel type singing which is OK for Esquivel fans but has no place in the Swingle Singers sound.

However, the sound alone is amazingly clean and fresh on the Ten recordings. I can't wait until Ten is released as a 'Deluxe Edition' or released cleaned up and remixed. The effects are cleaned off of Once, Alive, Even Flow, and Black and allows you to hear them for what they were suppose to sound like.

This album is for anyone who enjoys Pearl Jams music or anyone who wants a little of this and a little of that.

I see many reviews complaining that PJ have always tried to defy the mainstream, and this is exactly the opposite. Well, the most successful songs would be mainstream, therefore rightly earning their place on this cd.If this was a Best Of cd I would expect to see PJ release many songs that casual fans wouldn't know, going against the mainstream, and probably dissapointing more than this cd. Even though the 4.5 star average shows that dissapoitment is in the minority.Simply this album contains PJ's most popular songs, mostly from their earlier hits such as Ten and Vs. To complain that PJ should have released an album with different unreleased songs is absurd, this is The Greatest Hits, not The Anti-Mainstream Hits that obviously many wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filling the void in the desert of talentless bands","review":"If there was a really good band from 1991 to 2003 it was probably a rock band left over from the 80's or a band that was influenced by Pearl Jam. In the Oasis (pardon the pun) of crap that is out there today it is so very refreshing that this Greatest Hits CD comes out. My suggestion to record companies who are wondering why CD sales are pitiful, and are looking to sue the next grandma or student, is to try to find a band with the talent of Pearl Jam and people will want to buy the CD. This CD is the best way to heal the Aiken or get out of the Real World and listen to something good.

Stone Temple Pilots and Alice in Chains are only slightly better. It's the last three bands - Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Tool, that make grunge a legitimate form of music, and not a fad.

I began having it in the mornings at work, and found it gave me the energy that I rely on coffee for, without feeling wired or sped up. I can see why coca is so sacred to the Peruvians; there is a definite medicinal quality to it. Not in flavor, just in how it effects the body.

That's why it's so bad.In her own words:\\"This album was made without my creative input. It consists largely of unfinished material and songs that didn't make other albums.

This album is badly thrown and slapped together. There are some good numbers here like I Need You and Can't Fight the Moonlight and her Elton John duet, but the listening of it is a bland feeling. The Diane Warren songs borderline on sap and the other songs don't fit with her voice. I suggest that you listen to this CD one time, then throw it out the window. Just because she did some songs for soundtrack albums doesn't mean that you have to throw an album together for the public. People see through that stuff and stay away from it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love LeAnn","review":"This is a good CD, Love LeAnn Rimes, BUT I have to Disagree with the person that said \\"I Need You\\" Was her best song on this or any other CD.

Stevie Wonder is really amazing throughout that live performance. The atmosphere is really palpable, and the interaction between Stevie and his fans is unbelievable. The CD is presented in a nice sleeve which is identical to the original vinyl album. The icing on the cake is that this version is a super high quality CD made in Japan using SHMCD technology; as a result, the sound quality is really good! Fingertips has never sounded so good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate To Sound Insensitive","review":"If it weren't that he was blind this wouldn't have been successful. I heard Fingertips Part 1&2, and it's just stupid. I feel that the public just overlook the fact that there's nothing to this except for alot of shouting, a few words repeated over and over again, and then harmonica thrown in to spoil the orchestra. I heard this for the first time Saturday Jan. 23rd, 1988, and it's stuck to me like a cancer. It's time for the chemotherapy, and removal of this before it becomes malignant. I'm not prejudiced, or insensitive to people with handicaps. I would've ripped this to shreads if it were a white person, and no handicaps. This is just raw sewage that needs to be rid of."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing","review":"From the reveiws I expected it to be very sexy & arousing. It wasn't much of either. It was very boring. It got a two because of the ample nudity. Nothing else of note to say about this movie other than to say when they do an english version of an italian movie it should should not be cut. I think brass thinks americans would not like the full italian version so he does a toned down english version which takes away from the movies. Do not buy english versions of italian movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in English","review":"This clearly did not say at the time it was not in English. Overall movie was pretty bad.

Want something short and sweet to kill a few hours on an airplane? Then this book is for you! Don't be put off by the original publish date - it could have been written this year. A simple tale, simply told, of a delightful few characters and a rolling bookstore on wheels, Parnassus on Wheels is just a fun and uplifting little book to read. No complex sub-plots, no surprise endings, just a simple story that is well told. I enjoyed this book a lot, right down to the predictable happy ending.

The Snowman is the tale of a little boy who builds a snowman and the snowman comes to life! The boy brings the snowman in the house and they have fun in the kitchen and bedroom, and then they fly to the North Pole to see Santa Claus. It's all done without dialog and the soundtrack of \\"We're walking in the air...\\" is so wistful and bittersweet, you'll just love it. The drawings have a soft, childlike quality that goes well with the sense of wonder and innocence. The whole story is sentimental, funny, and first-rate. You and your family will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I remember this movie from my childhood","review":"The Snowman is such a touching and wonderful tale your children will remember it. I certainly have. I have been in love with this movie since I first saw it as a young girl, I sat entranced watching this silent beautifully created masterwork of animation. I have been dying to see it for years! The song \\"Walking in the Air\\" is really catchy and I find myself still singing it to this day. Buy this video for yourself and your kids! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing animation and forgotten legend.","review":"I was born in 1982, and this movie is still in my memory. It's a good movie for the kids I totally recommend it. Also there's one song on the soundtrack called \\"Walking In The Air\\" it is probably the most beautiful track you'll ever hear. George Winston did a good version on his \\"Forest\\" CD, which I would also recommend to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HAPPY!!!","review":"I ordered the version that this company \\"advertises\\" which has David Bowie doing an opening narrative. What I received does not have the David Bowie narrative as I ordered and paid for. I know that there are two versions of this same story - one with David Bowie and one without. I know what I ordered and what I received is not what I ordered. I just read prior comments in which fellow purchasers experienced the same issue.I am not very happy and not going through the headache of trying to return the item and start all over again somewhere else. Just know that if you do buy this, you are purchasing the standard version, NOT the version that is advertised with David Bowie. Other than this, the story is beautiful, one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Classic","review":"This movie has become a family Christmas classic, starting with my children and now my grandchildren.

No complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Snowman by Raymond Briggs","review":"Children of all ages still enjoy this timeless classic.

After our VHS machine became useable we sought the movie on DVD. The color quality of this item is very poor compared to the original versions I have seen on TV and the old VHS copy we had.

The music enhances the outstanding animation, and is deeply moving. What a brilliant video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed.","review":"I was dissappointed that this dvd was not narrated by David Bowie. He did a introduction in the beginning of this movie but a different voice narrated the movie. The original vhs movie was narrated by him throughout the whole movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Christmas films ever!","review":"Charlie Brown's Christmas tale and \\"The Snowman\\" are the two best animated holiday films I can think of - both so full of nostalgia and pathos and indelibly memorable music. But \\"The Snowman's\\" particular wonder lies in its marvelously inventive visual perspectives - so many nifty angles and soaring scenes. Without words, this little film delivers fine perspectives on emotion and imagination as well. Amongst all the pricey things you could buy as gifts (or for youself) this is a little bit of money well spent. I'd buy at least a couple of extras to give as gifts. Share it with everyone you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Snowman has been beautifully rendered in animation.","review":"I am a great fan of Raymond Briggs. The animated version of the Snowman was just as magical as the book. I gave it as a gift to a little girl of 2 1/2 years old and she watches it over and over. On Christmas when she went to bed, \\"the adults\\" watched it for a second and third time with smiles on their faces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spell binding for my 4 year old class","review":"I show this movie every year to my 4 year old class.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"My family has enjoyed this movie for years on tv, but they have all but stopped showing it.

The musical score \\"composed by Howard Blake\\" captures a dream like feeling that is like no other. It's been over twenty years since I first saw this animation and was moved by the artwork and music.

I do not show movies in my classroom. Except \\"The Snowman.\\" It is truly an amazing movie. This film mesmerizes the children in my class. There are no words, only the most lovely music and pictures. I wanted my little friend to see the movie, so I brought it home. My husband sat down with him and fell in love with the movie. I am buying the movie for my husband and my grandchild to be for Christmas this year.

He doesn't.I've bought the one with the dark blue cover, the one with Father Christmas, and the one with the Nuttiest Nutcracker.No Bowie.It looks like the only ones with David Bowie are the VHS and possibly the Region 2. Bummer.I hate that Amazon lists these reviews and special features on all versions! So unhelpful when looking for specifics.Like David Bowie.*sigh"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Snowman","review":"The first time I was able to view this film was with my son's preschool group. The class was silent and all the children sat in awe of the magnificent journey of James and the Snowman. Once the film was finished, they begged the teacher to play it again. I have 7 children ranging in age 14 months to 13 years, and they all love it as well. The touching music and beautiful animation make you feel like you are right there with them on their journey. It brought tears to my eyes when he wakes in the morning to find his snowman gone, but the gift from his trip to visit Santa is still in his pocket, giving him the sense that it wasn't a dream after all.This film has something for everyone.Brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter Enchantment","review":"I have seen this film dozens of times, and every time it has the same effect on me. As if by magic, I am transported just like the little boy when his beloved snowman takes his hand and they fly to a frozen land of enchantment. The flying sequence, along with the beautiful music, is just breathtaking. And the innocence of story, even Raymond Briggs short introduction, is absolutely charming. I recommend this for \\"children\\" of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising by amazon","review":"What a delightful tale this is, too bad it is missing the warm and wonderful intro by David Bowie THAT IT CLAIMS TO HAVE ON IT BUT DOES NOT!!!! The David Bowie bit was the main reason I bought this, I already have it on tape. He should not be listed in the credits in the description nor on the DVD itself, false advertising, shame on Amazon.

Each answer may give some similar answers, but each student may see something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful little story","review":"We received this tape in '89 when we still lived in Holland, our oldest son seven, his little redhead brother four. They played it so often, it's a miracle that it still has not worn out. Now, in the year that both graduated from college, we think it's nice to give both the DVD of this timeless little story.As parents we liked that it was such a 'fresh' story, not one of the traditional, somewhat worn-out, central-European or American fairytales. Actually we would have not minded if Santa had not been the center of the snowmen get-together. We definitely enjoyed the absence of tradional Christian themes or figures.The character development is great. In 23 minutes getting a friend, share things out of one another's lifes, then having to live on after hardly a goodby.Finally, it'll prove to be an historic piece, when the next generation children will ask their parents: \\"was there, back in those days, really that much ice and snow on the North Pole?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's David Bowie?","review":"This DVD of The Snowman was advertised as David Bowie, narrator. He does not appear on this DVD. I was very disappointed! This is an example of false advertising.

I was enthralled with both the story and the music,but wondered if my very active grandchildren would be just as impressed. I sent them a copy and their mom reported that the whole group sat quietly and watched the whole video. There is no better praise from that group!!! I would add that one of the three year olds was upset when the snowman disappeared at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching.","review":"Though I was a young girl when I first saw this film, I have always remembered it. It touched me in a way no film did at such an early age and every Christmas I wait in anticipation for it to come on television so that I can experience the magic of The Snowman all over again. This film is not only wonderful for children but for adults who believe in the magic of The Snowman and Christmas. I can't wait until I have children of my very own so that I may show them this wonderful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Award winner and it shows! Buy it the kids will love...","review":"This movie has amazing artistry and beautiful music. It is obvious why this won numerous awards for the art and animation.

Adults will love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Snowman - a magical adventure for the whole family","review":"If you want wholesome christmas entertainment that the entire family can enjoy year after year, grab a fuzzy blanket, a hot mug of cocoa, and each other and snuggle up to THE SNOWMAN.The colored drawing effect of the cartoon will delight children of all ages. The peaceful soundtrack will make you forget the lack of dialogue. This film stimulates the imagination of all who watch it! Its simplicity is just pure magic.Fortunately, I own this film on DVD (which is actually a double feature with another holiday classic: Father Christmas- check it out if you have a DVD player), so I no longer have to worry about our copy breaking from over-use.I highly recommend making The Snowman the next addition to your holiday collection. It's sure to become a favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...land of lost content\\"","review":"I recently bought this movie for a friend of mine's three-year-old daughter not only because it is a beautiful story, it is also a nostalgic (but not saccharine) tale of a boy's innocence and imagination. Moreso, it reminds me very much of the Wintertide's of my childhood in rural Warwickshire in England. At the sign of the first heavy snow we would rush out and beginning rolling the snowball that would form our snowman's body. It truly was a care-free time; a time without adult worries; a time devoid of adult cynicism. In the words of Housman \\"That is the land of lost content, I see it shining plain. The happy highways where I went, but cannot come again.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical, enchanting images and music","review":"This movie succeeds on several levels simultaneously: Musically, artistically, and expositionally. The only drawback is the physical product itself: My VHS is wearing poorly and almost from the start has had tracking problems. Others who have this movie have noted similar problems, so the videotape seems to be of poor quality.That said, the movie itself is wonderful. Taken from the book of the same name, there is no talking in the movie. Colored pencil images are the source of the animation. They are understated, but beautiful.The music is excellent and the entire score is noteworthy and enchanting.Lastly the story is timeless and Christmas oriented.Overall, highly recommended for children from 1 to 99. If you're looking for violent action or insipid humor, this is not the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I remember watching this as a child and wanted to buy it. My 2yo neice happened to watch it and is obsessed with it now. She absolutely loves it also and it definitely is a timeless piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see movie","review":"Hollywood never makes movies like this. It has almost no dialogue but children are inthralled by it. It is the perfect lenght for young children and leaves you feeling that you might want to see what happens the next time he builts a snowman. The journey that the director takes you is wonderful. It is a must see story filled with wonder and the magic of childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful - no more to be said","review":"'The Snowman' has been required viewing in my house every Christmas since it was first broadcast in 1982. I wanted to introduce my American family to this quintessentially English story with its special magic. There is now a lovely photo of my 40+ nephew and his 18 month old daughter both equally entranced as they watched the DVD. Hopefully, a new Christmas tradition has been born.For those who don't know it, it's a magical tale of a young boy and the night when his snowman came to life. The film is virtually silent. There are a few introductory words from the author and Aled Jones singing 'Walking In the Air'. As my elder niece said ' Oh, that's where that's from.'One of the joys of the film is that it is drawn in the same style as the book.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought 8!","review":"Please keep carrying this amazing holiday gift disc! adults and children alike have loved this over my years of giving it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Going away gift","review":"I bought this for my Indian therapist's daughter because at that time it was her first experience with snow and she loved it.

I don't know if I got a lemon or what, but I'm very disappointed with it.First, the radio reception has a problem. One station is clearly audible over others regardless of the frequency setting. It's not a problem with any other radio in the house, even in the same spot.Second, it doesn't remember the volume setting when you turn it off. Turn it down quiet, then turn it off and on, and the volume is back up to blaring again. I have to adjust it every time. Very annoying.The iPod integration is ok, and the price is decent, but I really wish the radio worked properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"dead","review":"I bought this unit a little over a year ago.

This not only tastes great, his clean bowl shows me how he feels about it, but I feel good about the ingredients. My pup loves people food and this seems like it's a super chunky stew (especially when you add a little water and heat it up). My dog isn't a \\"working dog\\" per se, but he does go into work with me and he loves this food. It's a safe go-to that I know he'll be happy to have for dinner.

The storyline is set around the kids (and a few adults) who want to keep summer vacation.

Disney needs to stop making bad sequels to their feature animation and focus on original material like this.

James Woods, Diedrich Bader, Dan Castellaneta, and many, many more...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another cartoon gone to the dumps!","review":"I'm a fan of the Saterday morning cartoon, and reading the first few reviews I thought the movie would be great!

It's summer vacation and the whole gang has gone away to different summer camps, except T.J. When he finds out that a mad scientist is out to rid the world of summertime, he has to gather his friends and and do whatever it takes to keep summer. Even team up with... his principal!

It portrays Mrs. Washington in a very bad light, selfish, and greedy. While this may be true, I don't feel it is appropriate for this age level. Children this age should be taught to respect adults. If what Jean Fritz wrote about Mrs. Washington is true then I don't mind my children learning about it...when they are a bit older. Although this book was a disappointment, I do recommend other Fritz books such as George Wahington's Breakfast, and Shh! We're writing the Constitution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate book for children","review":"Not only is this book's central theme the negativity of Mary Washington, but it includes a graphic illustration of George Washington being hanged, which is over the top for a children's book (a daydream from Mary, who is constantly worried about George being hurt on the battlefield or by the British). Toward the end of the book you get the impression that Mary Washington was mentally unstable. The book had zero value and, as other reviewers have mentioned, has some grammatical problems to boot. This is a terrible book. It's inappropriate for children and has no value at any age level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a teacher, I was very disappointed that a noted author would have such poor writing skills. There are so many sentence fragments in this story, I lost count. I do not know how many times I have to tell students to not start sentences with the word \\"and\\". This story has sentences that start with the word \\"and\\", and sentences that are just prepositional phrases. It is hard to teach students to write, when authors write poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just excellent","review":"David Sanborn in one of his finest moments.

He can't resist the temptation to show off on every tune. You won't hear it on the samples but you will when you get the full versions.\\"Chicago Song\\" is a fairly boring tune which goes on way too long, so long that they hacked two minutes off it when it went on \\"The Best Of David Sanborn\\".There is no doubt he's a top class player and composer, just listen to \\"Carly's Song\\" from \\"Hideaway\\".

I am so sick and tired of reading books written by prisoners who do nothing but complain about how they're being mistreated and how they're really innocent, and the guards are mean, and the warden has it out for them.One main point in the first couple chapters of this book (that was as far as I could get before I got too frustrated) is that the two guys, who were police officers, were convicted of committing a crime in noe state when they were really committing the same crime in another state at the same time.If I wanted to listen to complaining, I'd hang out with teenaged girls. I wouldn't waste my money on this book by \\"Jimmie\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"Provocative and disturbing, it was difficult to put this novel down once I began reading.

Ties together both action and provocative thought in a cracking good tale of justice, vigilantism, familial ties, revenge and morality. Well researched with outstanding character development, this novel delves into the penal Zeitgeist currently existing in post 9-11 US culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This book is not much about the psychology of the market. In fact most of the text is changes in corporate finance over the years, boom/bust periods as in \\"madness of crowds\\". Lots of market history. There is no investing method per se, as stated in one review. It can be summed up as: trade with the trend, cut you losses, don't bet too much on one stock, and money goes where it is treated best. The market psychology is the same thing in other books.Because of the high praise this book recieved I was expecting some new insights or a different perspective on market psychology. Here it failed miserably. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Performance","review":"Beecham gives a very solid performance of Scheherazade, and I have no complaints.

The Jersey Devil had some interesting reading, but the Mothman section was nothing but rehash from books that preceded this one, such as The Mothman Prophecies by John Keel and MOTHMAN: The Facts Behind The Legend by Donnie Sergent Jr and Jeff Wamsley. I found several mistakes in the factual information concerning the Mothman research. Please do not buy this book with the expectations of getting the facts. It is a decent read for pure entertainment, but the factual mistakes are inexcusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing new to see here","review":"Well this CD rocks, and well it rocked the first time it came out too.

If you want the full track list go to the one that was released earlier. However this CD was said to have a bonus track of some sort, but I couldn't find what the bonus track was called. Well when the CD got deleivered to me, I was sorta mad, the bonus track was Ghost of Tom Joad. On the CD it says that track was previously unreleased, but I know the track was on renagades.

Perhaps I'll try it again one day, since I absolutely loved The Mists of Avalon, The Firebrand, and the Darkover novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...disappointed to say the least","review":"The idea was interesting, but I've seen it before. This is probably the worst fantasy book I've ever read.

I thought the plot was weak and uninspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but it grows on you...","review":"Not as good as some of her later books, but compelling none the less. This is actually a reprint of her earlier works, _Web of Darkness_ and _Web of Light_, published in the early 1980s, and when viewed in that context, the book's flaws are more forgiveable. It is a stepping stone on the way to more mature works like Mists of Avalon or Firebrand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! I loved it.","review":"The story flowed well.The characters where dynamic and likeable. The storyline was interesting and well thought out. It might not have the flare of some of her other books, but it is a nice bridge to The Forest House."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very good . . .","review":"After reading several of her books, this was a major flop. At no time was I swept away with the story as in \\"The Firebrand.\\" At no time did I think \\"now this could happen\\" as in \\"Mists of Avalon.\\" Nor would I ever want to return to its people or places as in \\"Forest House.\\" This was not up to expectations. Certainly not up to the standards I have come to accept as Bradley's. I could not, would not, will not recommend this book to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment...","review":"I was so disapointed about this one... I want you to know, though, that I've read all the MZB books, I love her style and my favourite book ever is \\"Mysts of Avalon\\", and \\"FireBrand\\" also. As the rest I find them not so good... but this... it simply isn't worth to read. As far as my opinion goes I believe that there's so much to write about Atlantis... It doesnt even appear to be written by MZB"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"I love this book. The Fall of Atlantis is one of MZB's earlier works. The story is not as well-plotted as her later works and there are even some minor mistakes in the book (about who is related and where they come from, etc.) but the heart-breaking character of Deoris brings the book to life. It's worth a read just for her story. The thing I like about MZB's writing is that you get to know her characters' thoughts and self-doubts. You can always relate to them on a real level even though they are set in a fantasy world. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a romantic heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about Atlantis","review":"I read about half of this book. I didn't hate it; it just wasn't that interesting. I loved The Mists of Avalon and was intrigued by the Atlantis references in that book. I thought it would be fun to find out what really happened there and who the characters were. Unfortunately, the book doesn't take place in Atlantis - it takes place in Britain, among people who have settled there from Atlantis. That was disappointing. What's more, the characters just aren't that interesting. I expected more from Bradley."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALLEN TOO SOON","review":"After the breathtaking THE FIREBRAND, this was stilted and disappointing. Perhaps it went through too many revisions as the characters speak and act like statues. Might be suitable for a precocious fourteen year old reader who nonetheless could be bored. I as astonished that the story could be so poorly plotted. Cared nothing for anyone. Would like to sell my copy as a matter of fact.

I defeated one and started working on the next and even got my husband in on the action! It is so much fun and additicting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid DS Title You'll Keep Coming Back To","review":"I got this game after I saw hearing how great it was on one of the podcasts I watch. The hosts seemed completely enamored with it, so I had high hopes. Even with high hopes, I really enjoy this game. I can see why it was given so much praise.The game itself is a mix between Bejewled and an RPG, which works much better than it sounds. The story dialogue can be a bit dry and hammy at times, but you always have the option to skip right to the action.Bottom line, this is the perfect game for the DS and it's one that you'll definitely hold onto for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, low replayability in solo-play.","review":"This game is great. It doesn't try to do too much, it's simply a clever treatment of a bejewled-like puzzle game (though PQ involves much more strategy than bejewled thanks to the vs. format). The game is well worth the cost just for the puzzle aspect and multiplayer mode.That said, the quest mode is fun to play through once, though the final boss is underwhelming and the story is extremely simple, linear, and not dependant on character-class. The result is that if you want to build up a 2nd character (different classes offer different abilities in multi-player as well) you have to sit through the same railroad trip all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great game, but slightly repetitive.","review":"The DS has some very interesting, unique, original games being written for it, and Puzzle Quest is definitely one of them. It's part RPG, part puzzler. The story is not really all that interesting, and there's really only one type of puzzle, but there's something very different and fun about defeating monsters by playing them in a puzzle game. I only give it 4 stars because of the bland storyline and repetitive nature..but as you progress, and level up, you do get some interesting powers that make the puzzle playing more interesting. I definitely recommend it. Did I type the word \\"puzzle\\" enough in my review? Sorry about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great twist to standard puzzle games","review":"I really enjoyed the RPG aspect that was incorporated into what could have been a rather typical puzzle game. The battles are interesting and fun, because you aren't just trying to win. You're also trying to collect money and experience based on what you do within the puzzle itself. I will say that the battles can get tedious after you've been playing the game for a while, but that's broken up with the different types of puzzles offered for crafting runes, capturing enemies and researching spells. All in all, a very addictive game that's also great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamond Mine + RPG = Crack","review":"What can I say? PuzzleQuest is very addictive. It hits home nicely for someone like me who has been a long time lover of RPGs and (as I've gotten older) becoming more of a lover of casual gaming. There's definitely hours of entertainment in this one. A few graphical glitches here and there (maybe once every several hours of gameplay you might notice a refresh problem, where some graphics stay on the screen). The only thing that keeps this game becoming a 5 star game is that if you've played enough puzzles you begin to notice they all seem to start with the same configuration - I imagine there's a finite set of starting grids that depend on who you're battling against. It's most noticeable when you're trying to do things like level up your mount and fight the same opponent a couple times in a row."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wierd, but very fun game!","review":"It's also very hard to get a hold of =) This is the kind of game you hope for with the DS - something fun and out of the ordinary. The bejweled aspect can get annoying at times, but it just means you need to pay attention. The good part is that if you need to, you can put this down at any moment and pick up again without \\"dying\\". Oh, and to that effect, losing a battle still gets you something. What a concept!Additionally, there are choices you have to make in the game that affect the ending and playstyle to give you some flavor. It's very addicting, challenging, and worth the bargain basement price.One note, in case Amazon copies this over to the PSP version - there is a bug currently known that you get no credit for your companions. It's only a small help, but still could be a distractor for some. On the company's site they haven't mention if they will have a fix in newer version of the game or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"I love the game- it is amusing and everything I wanted. I wouldn't order it from Amazon though; 3-5 day shipping turned into two weeks of waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not a game to pass up!","review":"I bought this game a month ago thinking it was just a Bedazzled-type of game. As I started to play, it turned out to be a RPG with a Bedazzled-type of battle. I fell in love with it from that moment. And I am still playing it.I would highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. It's worth every penny I bought it for. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Puzzles plus Quests!","review":"I was sort of skeptical about this game. I love a good RPG and I enjoy Bejewelled, but how the heck can you tie them together in a way that makes sense and doesn't get boring? Well, it happened and the result is this game. At first, it seems just like bejewelled but as you progress you realize that your color gems that you match corolate to the manna you need to cast spells, heal, and inflict mad damage upon your opponent. Some battles are harder than others, and you can protect yourself by donning armor and having other items in your inventory to reflect, dissipate, or otherwise shield you. A really unusual game, but it never gets boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless game of Bejeweled","review":"When I bought this game I was under the impression it consisted of a series of DIFFERENT puzzles. My fault for not doing enough researach. This game is a mind numbing endless game of Bejeweled. At least in regular RPGs when you get to a higher level the lower level characters are easy to beat and a fight doesn't last that long. This game however, takes an endless amount of time to complete a fight no matter what your level. I don't understand why there are so many high ratings on this game. If you like the idea of playing bejeweled over and over and over and over then you will like this game. There is no challenge and the story line is non existent."},{"rating":"1","title":"puzzle quest: challenge of the warlords","review":"wasn't what I thought it was going to be. looking for something like 7 wonders of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you want to avoid a role-playing-game, avoid this one","review":"Looking for something for ds like Bejeweled, but this one is not it.

(I tried the Disney Meteos game and didn't like it because it was so incredibly limited, and you couldn't save your place).I cannot put this game down. My family is going to disown me. At first I found the fact that I was playing 2-person Bejeweled annoying (\\"He took the row I wanted!\\") and then realized it really adds a great new dimension to the game.I do find the RPG portion of the game a little tedious, especially now that I'm at level 35 and there are SO many different places I'm supposed to visit.I highly recommend this game, it's totally worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellente!!","review":"This game is so much fun. I bought it for myself and my kids think I'm corny but once they started playing it, they play it more than me!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is boring.","review":"I tried to like this game. I love RPG's, I love puzzle games. I played and played hoping it would get more interesting, but it didn't. It's the same lame puzzle over and over and over, and the RPG-side doesn't make up for it. It wasn't addictive at all, I had to force myself to keep playing. Cool idea for a game, this one's a failure. My guess is the people who rave about this game are more of the checkers type than chess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This game is puzzle meets warrior. It is not what I expected when I purchased a puzzle game. You have to collect points to advance etc. You have to invest a lot more time than I am willing to get very far in the game, not the type you can just pick up occasionally and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be okay for some.","review":"My version is for the Nintendo DS lite. I did not really enjoy this game. Perhaps it is fun for some, but I did not find it to be. It is just a glorified \\"Bejeweled\\" game with a weak story line. Plus,it is somewhat difficult to understand the objective. I suppose you might enjoy it if you are a fan of fantasy games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puzzle Quest Doesn't Disappoint","review":"While Puzzle Quest has some flaws in gameplay -- for one, the story is not as compelling as the creators probably thought it was -- the game is still extremely addictive and fun. The puzzles are really fun and the leveling means that you gain puzzle abilities as you reach higher levels. I really enjoy the game, and I play it a LOT, so I feel that it was also a really good value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Puzzle/RPG hybrid","review":"It's two addictive games in one! Puzzle Quest blends the puzzle gameplay of 'bejeweled' into an RPG setting with quests, an epic story, etc. I find that the use of the puzzle game for combat (or any other task such as crafting, researching or capturing) is very satisfying. There's also a lot you can do. Siege cities to add them to your empire and reap the benefits financially, capture creatures to learn their special abilities, tame mounts and train them to higher levels, buy and even craft your own items, choose from four character classes, befriend companions to help you in battle and train up 7 different skills. There's undoubtedly a lot more I haven't discovered yet. I have also heard the multiplayer is well done, but have not had the opportunity to try it yet. This game is just a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game but lots to remember","review":"I recently purchased this game and find it very entertaining. I am still however trying to remember all of the details necessary in winning the battles. I like the adventure with the \\"Bejeweled battles\\" rather than playing the \\"Bejeweled\\" by itself which to me gets a bit boring.

This doesn't really fit with a beat em up game and makes it less fun as it's hard as hell to actually pull this off. It would be alot more entertaining to beat a boss up and take his key or key card per the rest of the game. The graphics on the box look better than the graphics in the actual game which are quite poor for 2006 or even any time. The original arcade version of final fight that was released nearly 20 years prior actually looks and plays better than this remake/sequel.

It does a good job of keeping line straight. As others have stated you need to stop down (5.6 or higher) to keep sharp focus. That's the case with most very wide angle lenses. It is difficult to focus as others as said. That's just the nature of very wide angle lenses. If you shooting something up close then let the auto-focus do it for you. It you want to make certain it's in focus then measure (the old fashioned way). I've shot numerous projects with this lens and find to be major player in the very wide angle lens field. I've shot home exteriors, home interiors, art gallery interiors and even food with this lens.My only issue with this lens is that it does not handle blowout hot spots well. It tends to shift the color on the fringes of the hot spot to the yellow. You just need to be careful not blowout hot spots which why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Terrific Lens","review":"I own the Sigma 14mm F/2.8 in a Nikon mount, and it is quite fantastic on my D600. I'm surprised that Sigma no longer makes this prime, especially considering how Nikon and Canon are creating lower cost full frame cameras these days. Bokeh isn't something that I would expect from a wide angle lens, but this lens has this magical ability to create smooth and pleasing bokeh when shot wide open. None of my other wide lenses can do this, not my Tokina 16-28 or my Nikon 17-35. And it's crazy sharp when stopped down just a tad. This is definitely a specialty lens that I will pull out when I am feeling inspired. With careful framing, distortion is also very well controlled, though never exempt from any wide angle lens. If you are even considering the Nikon 14-24, I would recommend that you try this lens first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par","review":"OK so i bought this thinking it would get me into the game.

This comes from the same point of view, only less so.The Salon Oriental CDs (at least 1-3) have the accent more on the Asian influence, and less on the dance beats. That's a good thing, unless you like the beats.And by beats, I mean dance beats, not Asian beats. There are plenty of dance beats, but not at the expense of the source material.The Asian influnce comes through much more on this collection than others I've listened to.

It was a great example of what racism was like during the segregation in the US. The main story is about a little boy named Kenny and how he goes to Burmingham with his family. Mainly he learns that life isn't a perfect picture (that you usually here about in fairy tales, with happy endings) with two kids and one car. But instead that life is like a bumpy road full of obstacles. I would recommend this book to kids who like true stories, that are exagerated a little. This book is probably for teenagers and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Racism Tagedy","review":"The Watsons go to Birmingham was an educational book to read in middle school.

Sure MOST of it leads up to the main point of the story, but do you realize this? I sure didn't.The author's style of writing makes this book hard to follow. I can tell that he tried to write from a 10-year-old's point of view, but obviously he tried a lil too hard, because it sounds like from the point of view fom a very immature ten year old.The description of the setting and characters in this book made it very difficult for me to write a book report for; and I just overall didn't like it, although most of the people I know (from my brother to my best friends) were exclaiming, \\"Oh, you're reading that? Isn't it the best?\\"I usually finish a book this length in 1 1/2 to 2 days.

I believe no one should go through the torture of reading it or waste time during their life.This book depicts the journey of an African American family to Birhmingham during the civil rights movement. It creates a less than substantual climax, more resembling a flat plane, to an empty end. It shows the authors weak insight to childrens emotions.I know this is Curtis's first book but I can't help commenting on his lack of elementry stories segments. No problem, except for that of trivial teasing, is seen in this piece, also the \\"rising events\\" are more like a snail climing Mt. Everest. I'm sorry but I fervently wish you won't read this book.

As the title indicates the climax of the book occurs when the Watsons, an African American family living in Michigan, journey to Birmingham, Alabama in 1963 to visit relatives. While in Birmingham they experience first hand the church bombing in which four innocent little girls lose their lives. This book would make a good starting point or enrichment book for a middle school class unit on the struggle for civil rights.

Also, when Byron decides to go out and get a conk without his parents permission and ruining his African American hair. The most important event in this story I think is when the Watsons Go to Birmingham on there vacation. This book is mostly fiction is only has one real event that actually happens in real life.

It was really funny when Byron got his lips frozen to the mirror. Kenny lives in Flint, Michigan and drove all the way to Birmingham, Alabama during the Civil Rights Movement. The reason they go there is because Byron kept getting into trouble and they needed to teach him a lesson. Unfortunately, they have to go back home because the 16th Street Babtist Church was bombed and it was too dangerous to leave Byron with Grandma Sands. I'd give this book an eight and a half out of ten points. It was very good but a little too old for me.

When I read that Joetta was in the building that was was bombed, my heart went out to her because she was so sweet.

However, it seems to be just a collection of stories. The bombing at the end seems sensational and does not tie the rest of the book together. Another problem I had was that the ten year old's personality changed drastically when the got to Alabama. Back in Flint, he was the perfect kid with the delinquent brother. When he gets to Alabama, he becomes disobedient. This was plot maniuplation to set up the Wool Pooh incident. I hope the author comes out with another book soon as he is an excellent writer.

Yes it was a first book by the author but I feel the author failed to get the general picture he was saying in this book out except for one brief moment. Most of the book is a story of the adventures of a normal kid. What little is left a showing of feeling of the whites against the blacks in the the early 1960's.

Little Kenny is a great character. Christopher Paul Curtis did an amazing job here. Ten-year-old Kenny tells the story of his life in 1963, during the Civil Rights Era. They live in Flint, MI and travel to Birmingham, AL for a family trip. Kenny made me laugh (Byron got his lips stuck to the car mirror from kissing his reflection) and cry (children dying in the church). I think this would be a great book to incorporate into any lesson plan while teaching kids about the Civil Rights Movement. It gives great insight into what went on back then and what blacks had to go through. I'm 22 now and I would definitely read it again. I'll give this book to my children to read as well.

When Byron seems out of control, the Watsons pack up their car for a trip down south to their grandmother's house. But they are also on a crash-course with history and the tragic events of the Civil Rights movement. Greater historical themes take a back seat to the personal story of a close family, which is a bit refreshing, especially when the ending hits the readers, shocking them in its impact, just as it did in reality, fifty years ago. Characters are real and fully developed, absolutely loveable and hilarious. Might be a difficult read for younger students due to some of the obscurity/allegorical nature of the writing, as well as dated slang, but definitely a worthwhile and engaging young adult novel. Grade: A-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't see what everyone is talking about","review":"I have had a difficult time finding very many of the episodes funny unless you had grown up in the 1960s. If you were born in the 80s-90s I think most of the humor would be lost, because it needs the cultural/historical background to be understood. I found the book zenophobic (negative remarks about Chinese and people from the south) and it also seemed to glorify bullying. I think there are far better books out there that deal with the issue of racism than ones that include such negative subtexts.I have read a lot of juvenile fiction and this is one of the slowest paced books I have ever read. I think the only things that young readers might be interested in would be the bullying scenes. It takes a long time for the novel to move into the interesting plot line and there are several unexplained gaps in the end that leave the reader confused. I had to read this book as part of my job, but I really wanted it to end. Sorry, just being honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly over-rated","review":"Why this book is a Newberry Honor Book escapes me.

It traveled a different road by really developing the characters of an african-american family with only one racist act in the entire novel. The fact that it was a children's book gave it a great perspective from little Kenny's shoes. Most of the books and movies show how racist it was by presenting every racist thing that happened. But in \\"The Watsons Go to Birmingham\\" it shows a normal african-american family with only one racist act, the church bombing. It showed, more than anything I have ever seen or read, how a racist thing like the bombing can affect a normal family. Reading this book was a wonderful experience and it has given me a very new look on racism and segregation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Watsons go to Birmingham-1963","review":"What I really liked about this book was that the pace of the book was breathtaking. You never knew what would happen next (unless you already read it). A part that really surprised me was the part where there was a bombing in Joetta's church. I really thought that Joetta really had died.The way that it was written really convinced me that it really happened. Especially when Kenny found that shoe.On a scale from one to five I would rate it a five.One reason I would rate it a five is because it was humorous yet some parts were serious. I like a book that is not to serious. I also like an author who has a sense of humor. That is a characteristic that that Christopher Paul Curtis seems to have. I really enjoyed reading this book.I look foward to reading more of his books soon.I plan on reading Bud,not Buddy.

Another reason I love this book is because it reminds me of what my parents had to go through in Birmingham when they were children.I liked the character Kenny because he sort of reminds me of myself. He is very determined to do things, and his brother and him do not get along very often.The very best part of the book was when Kenny's brother, Byron got his tounge stuck to a mirror trying to kiss himself outside in snow.Mainly the story is about Byron, who is not a good child and gets sent to his grandmothers house in Birmingham, Alabamama. Kenny's younger sister, Joetta to church one Sunday. Later on everyone hears a very loud bomb. Kenny runs down to the church and thinks he sees the Wool Pooh, a make believe character his brother made up. Joetta sees Kenny and follows him home.I think this book really is a must read.

I would not use this book in my classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Watsons Go To Birmingham - 1963","review":"Well the very first thing is Byron got into trouble alot.The other thing is that the takes a trip to Birmingham to leave byron because of his behaver.The last thing is that there was a \\"CHURCH BOMBING\\"! and 4 girls young girls died.Well there was two settings one in a snowy ice cold Flint,Michigan.The other thing is a hot sunny place in Birmingham,Alabama.The conflict of the story is that there was a CHURCH BOMBING! in Alabama.So Kenny feels that something is going to happen in Flint.But the resolution of the story is that Byron talks to kenny and tells him that people are just plan evil and don't worry about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wool poo","review":"It was when kenny,biron,andjoey kenny wanted to be bad and go to the other side wear 6 people got killed over a worled pool but biron had made up some kind of lie and said that the worled pool was called the woolpoo he said that the woolpoo was winne the poohs evil twin brother but kenny wasen't scared so he just went his way and joey and biron went there way so kenny had took his soes"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Watsons go to Birmingham","review":"I thought the book was pretty good.

The Watsons are hilarious in what they do, including Byron, the \\"juvennile delinquent\\" that goes with his partner Buphead out to do trouble. After reading many chapters, I recognize that the book turns from a hilarious novel to a saddened tradegy. This book has alot of hilarious events and is considered a great book. Looking at the author, Christopher Paul Curtis, makes a great title that will enlighten the reader from a boring book to a town-cryer screaming \\"READ THIS BOOK, IT IS VERY FANTASTIC!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"The beginning is pretty good and that's why I gave this a two star, but in the end Kenny gets all depressed and it just ruins the bookSambeast 100"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book!","review":"Dear Mr.CurtisI chose 5 stars because The Watsons go to Birmingham is one of my favorite books.

Will the Watsons come back alive?The story, told from Kenny's imaginative point of view, is often filled with exciting, larger-than-life moments.

We are on chapter 7. The students beg me to give them more time to read to find out what's going to happen next. The book lends itself to open discussions about safety with matches, cruelty to animals, and bullying so far. I believe the book will lead us into discussions about what it was like in 1963 for the African American people. My class is majority, african american and need to know more about the history of civil rights. The audio tape is fantastic with Levar Burton reading. He uses Southern accents and jive talking that the kids crack up.The book is hilarious, heartwarming and thought provoking.

The story was about a ten-year-old boy name Kenny. He has one brother who is a juvenile delinquent. The family was very weird to many people.

Kenney Watson, a smart 10-year old with great dialog, is the main character. There's also Momma, Dad, Byron, Grandmaw Sands, and Joetta.

By that I mean predjudice running out of control, KKK, church bombing, and much much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK!!!!!!","review":"This book is a wonderful novel about an African-American family who finds out not everyone likes African-Americans.

In the story the son of the Watson's gets his tongue stuck to the car mirror and that was really funny. The reason his tongue got stuck is because he was kissing the mirror and admiring himself.

I really enjoyed the full rich characters. I felt like I was reading about my own family. The dynamics of the family make this book remarkable. I cherished every moment of the weird Watsons. The account of the church bombing left me with a chill... Kenny's behavior after the family's return was touching. Christopher Paul Curtis did the book justices by having Byron step up and take care of Kenny. I will remember this one for a long time to come. A must read for summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Watson's Go to Birmingham 1963","review":"...I have just finished reading Watsons Go to Birmingham 1963. It was a great book, it was very funny. The funnest part was when Byron, the 13 year got his lips stuck to the car mirrow. The sadest part was when the church was bomb. There was 4 girls who died. Joey to me was the smartest one cause she was always helping and she was always conser, like the time when Byron was playing with fire, and she would blow out the matches when mama was going to burn him.

They are sending Byron to stay with Grandma Sands, in Birmingham, Alabama, because of all of his mischievous adventures from shooting down Natzi parachutists with his flamethrower of death to the time he dyed his hair.When they get to Birmingham they find it surprisingly hot. Byron's whole attitude changes, he saves Kenny from the \\"Wool Pooh\\" and doesn't make fun of him. On Sunday, Joetta has to go to Sunday school and her church blows up, but lucky for her, who she thinks is Kenny, guides her away from danger. Kenny recovers from the bombing in the \\"World Famous Watson Pet Hospital.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"5th","review":"The Watsons go to Birmingham was a great book. I thought that the most interesting part of the book was when the bomb was thrown into the church and they did not knoe what it was. When they found out it was the church they ran all they way down there and were very sad. When they got there they were to scared to go in to try to find Joetta. I thought this was an interesting part, because they were trying to get there as fast as they could to try to find out about Joetta, but when they did not know what to do. I thought this book had good potential and should be taught in a group to classes. If I had a choice I would choose this book because it is on of the most hilarious and entertaining books I have ever read.

I thought that it was a good book because it had some really funny parts in it. I felt bad for Kenny because he had a lazy eye that he got made fun of from. Also, his older brother Byron picks on him a lot. My favorite part of the book was when Byron got his lips stuck to the car mirror when it was really cold out. In the beginning I felt bad for the Watson's because it was very cold out and they didn't have very much heat in their house. I thought it was funny how Byron was making his own little movie in the bathroom. Until his mom caught him and was about to burn him until is sister kept on blowing out the matches. I also thought it was funny when the Watson's went to see their grandma and when Byron walked up to her his grandma gave him a big hug.

She loved the characters and could identify with the love/hate relationship of the siblings--which was a key theme of the book, one that brought the social issue of the 1963 bombing to a personal level. My daughter didn't cry as much as I did during the excruciating emotional recovery of the narrator after the bombing (I could hardly even read), but she did feel the full impact of the admonition in the epilogue: \\"You must remember that these children [the 4 actual girls who died in the bombing] were just as precious to their families as Joetta was to the Watsons or as your brothers and sisters are to you.\\"Note: Indicating that there is a bombing in this book is not a spoiler, just as indicating that the Titanic was going to sink is not. This fictional book is based on an actual historic event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"This is a very warm, youthful portrayal of an African American family and their experiences in Flint, Michiga and Birmingham, Alamaba. The book is jovial and centering on the theme of youthfulness, it also has some corny humor. It indirectly touches on racisim. This may be a good book to introduce young children to some of the social and moral issues pertaining to racism. Getting involved in the story naturally leads one to thoughts on racism, though rather indirectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Weird Watsons and their Amazing Trip","review":"Riding in the car for over 3 days! This is something the Weird Watsons did. The Watsons go to Birmingham-1963 was written by Christopher Paul Curtis. It won several medals. These medals are the Newberry Honor, the ALA Best Book for young adults, the Coretta Scott King Honor, and the ALA Notable Book. The Watsons consist of Byron, Kenny, Joetta, Momma, and Dad. Byron is a school bully who hurts kids who tease Kenny. The book teaches you about a sad moment in Birmingham's History. This book also made me laugh out of my socks. A funny part is when Byron does something with his hair and it gets cut off. This book was also very serious about segregation and African American history. I rated this book four stars because it was very, very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham","review":"I liked the book because it was very interesting and I am very curious about what happened at the church bombing in Birmingham,Alabama.What I liked about the book mostly was when Byron had gotten in trouble about playing with the matches and getting a conk that is what I liked mostly about the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winnie's Evil twin brother,THE WOOL POOH","review":"The book in general was a really great book.

Although it was set in the '60's,the story felt just as real as if it were occuring right now. It was very funny,especially when Byron got in trouble for staging WWII battles in the bathroom and got his lips stuck to the car mirror. When I read the book in reading period,I often began having laugh attacks and had to cover them with fake coughing spells. I understood Kenny's depression after the bombing. However,the Wool Pooh scenes were vague. Who was he really? What about Kenny's vision? Overall,though,this was a wonderful,entertaining book. It conveyed the message of racial tolerance without preachiness and showed how alike we all are inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham 1963","review":"In the Watson family there are five people.Momma,Dad,Byron,Kenny,Joetta.Byron is 13 years old and he gets in a lot of trouble.After a couple months of Byron lighting mathes and throwing them in the toliet.The Watsons go to Birmingham.Momma planned the whole trip.During the trip Byron changed a lot.While they were in Birmingham Kenny thought he was going to die."},{"rating":"2","title":"The watsons go to Birmingham 1963","review":"The Watsons go to Birmingham 1963 was based on a black family which was the Watsons and how they lived back then.

But onceI knew that the figure was death, the story reallytouched me. It was not as funny as some people saidit was, but it was certainly funny. I highlyrecommend that people should read this, but I foundit confusing at the age of 11 ( the age group it issupposed to be aimed at) so I recommend it to people13 or older.- Katharine Manning, American School In Japan, 6th grade"},{"rating":"1","title":"A History Lesson, But Not for the Fainthearted","review":"I have been reading this book aloud to fifth graders in a rural area, and I don't get it! I am very uncomfortable with the enthusiasm with which the book embraces violence as a staple of black family life. There is a chapter about a bully who does a \\"Maytag wash,\\" scrubbing his smaller victims with snow and then flinging them against a chain link fence - apparently meant to be funny, but my audience of ten-year-olds just looked puzzled. In another chapter, the mother approaches naughty brother Byron with matches, Vaseline and bandages, intent upon burning his fingers as punishment. Fortunately, sister Joetta blows out the matches - also meant to be funny, I guess, but it is difficult for me to see the humor in child abuse. I might concede that this book is a valuable illustration of a particular time in history, but the Birmingham experience is overshadowed by the portrayal of African Americans as stupid and scary . . . not the lesson I had hoped for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great audiotapes for a road trip","review":"Reviewing this as a parent, this was a good story. Levar Burton does an excellent job narrating. The story was humorous, and yet, sad in places. There are a lot of morals that come in to play--also, a lot of consequences for choices and actions one makes. There are many situations for the listener to think about and make for family discussions about rights,wrongs and social injustices. The only objection I had to the tapes was the use of profanity by Byron Watson. Even so, I explained to my 12-year old that Byron was, afterall, a \\"juvenille delinquent.\\" One definitely can develop empathy for the characters in this story and relate to some of their situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shelly's Review","review":"The book The Watsons Go to Birmingham -1963 is a great book. I have never read or heard of this book before. It is a true piece of literature. It is about a black family in 1963. It shows the ugly truth about prejudice, and reality. The book tells a real story of a family who moves to the southern states and sees how different their lives change, and the lives of how their family lives in the south. The book is truly a winner. It shows reality in a time period we would like to forget. It shows true life and struggle for a person of a different color. It is to our dismay to see how some people were treated, because of race or color. This book tells a great story of the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Watson's go to Birmingham","review":"I liked The Watsons go to Birmingham because it made you laugh in about every sentence! For example, when the Watson kids called their brown car \\"the turd on wheels.\\" I think the author made the book like it was real. I think the book made you feel like you were in the setting because of all the details. I gave this book four stars because I didn't get the part about the Wool Pooh, Winnie the Pooh's evil twin brother. Besides that, it was great! My favorite character was Byron who thinks he's too cool for anybody. I would recommend this book to you because of all the humorous moments!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scotto is not to be missed","review":"I agree with those who find Manuguerra just a little boring, it's not a bad performance, but pales next to Scotto's magnificent Abigaile.

It looks like it fits the phone like a sock but it doesn't. First of all, the hole for the microphone does not line up. Second, the phone is so bulky until it opens itself with just a slight bump. The phone does not shut itself easily when you close it after talking. Third, the phone does not open fully with the leather case on....it feels weird talking through the case. The material used for the speakers feels really cheap. I don't know what to do with it now....sell it to someone cheap?

The case is somewhat durable, but not real tough. Recently the stitching started to come out and the plastic which covers the keypad of the phone broke at the bottom.

I had it only six weeks before the zipper began to rip. When they cut out the opening for the charger on the bottom, they cut into the fabric of the zipper.

This is a lady I want to meet someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed, I cried","review":"Having worked in the funeral industry, I found Ms. Mosca's book extremely interesting. Many of the insider stories were fascinating and funny at the same time. Ms. Mosca writes with an ease of an established, seasoned author. She makes the reader feel comfortable, much like an old friend. I sometimes laughed so hard at some of her stories, I cried.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would want an insider's view to the funeral industry. Contrary to what one might believe, there are so many bizarre and amusing stories. The interactions, customs and odd requests are amazing. I would encourage anyone to get a copy (or two or three) so that they too might experience Ms. Mosca's journey as a pioneer in the industry. Not only is she a gifted writer and professional career woman, but she is extremely attractive.If you buy the book, you can see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and Informative","review":"This book is a well written, accurate depiction of women in funeral service.

The small works by Liszt, Chopin & Rachmaninov are the icing on this very sweet cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT CLEAN, BUT EXTREMELY PASSIONATE","review":"All I can say is, it's breathtaking to listen to. I haven't come across too many of Richter's performances, so I can't make a lot of comparisons (However, I did see some footage of him on PBS's \\"The Art of The Piano\\"), and to be honest, I just wanted a decent recording of the piano version of \\"Pictures\\", and this seemed to be the top recommendation--Lucky for me it was just released as a single disc. It's also a little weird to hear a few boo-boo's during his performance (Maybe this wasn't a good night for him, but like I said, I haven't heard him much until now), but his pyrotechnical approach to playing makes up for it. Wonderful readings of Liszt, Schubert, Chopin & Rachmaninov as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sviatoslav Richter : the supreme master pianist !","review":"The introspective mood of Richter and his personal convictions about the meaning or the tempos of certain piano pieces has been always subject of unfinnished discusions.In this case Richter temperament worked out to perfection levels.I am a hard fan of Richter pianism (almost sixty five recordings) and I own four different versions of the Pictures . This is one of his best but not the winner .Believe or not , one week later in Bucarest he played the Pictures again with amazing results . Indeed he was a unpredictable pianist. His Chopin is always interesting though it lacked idiomatism . He always was a champion master playing Rachmaninov .As historic reference you must acquire this album .Undoubtly Richter was much better and most interesting artist than Horowitz , he did not only seek the shinning and thundering sound so typical of Horowitz intentions , he seeked the color tonal and the scope beneath every piano piece he played ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sofia Recital is wonderful yet there are problems with the CD","review":"I was introduced to the orchestral presentation (by Reiner and the CSO) of Pictures at an Exhibition while in high school in the late 1960s---one of my favorite compositions---and didn't know that Mussorgsky wrote it for solo piano until much later. Finally having heard of Richter's version, I made the purchase. It, too, is wonderful. The recording does have its issues: background white noise, audience noise, etc.. But those are minor, expected (for the timeframe), annoyances. A major annoyance, however, is the quality of the CD. The first two copies I received from Amazon were unplayable. A third copy was slightly better; I was able, with some difficulty, to transfer its contents to a good, blank, CD using my PC. Try that if you experience the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb playing, poor sound","review":"The playing of Sviatoslav Richter is superb, but the sound is appaling, very dim.

No French style, no enough understanding, no normal French language. Certainly, both of them (Freni and Domingo) are great singers, I like them but they are not up to the mark of this music product at all.

I was not disappointed. I have only had it a month and I have used it many times. The mic pics up well, and the zoom works great (which I use for my kids sports). I have downloaded video to my laptop, and burned DVD's. I took the advice of other customers and bought the longer life battery. The only difficulty I had was in not understanding that formatting meant deleting what you had already recorded on the disc, so I now know. My laptop did not have DVD burning capabilities so I did purchase an external burner and everything works great.

I called the service center and they talked me through a trouble shooting attempt but they couldn't get it working. I had to send it to Texas for a repair. I'll bet it was a used camcorder that I received instead of a new one and that's why it died soooo soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mac Compatible","review":"There has been much talk about whether you can use this camera with a Mac. I have found that you CAN use it!! Get a -RW disc, record your video, then FINALIZE the disc in the camera, connect the USB cable to the camera and computer, turn it on and import the video into iMovie08 very easily. The key here is finalizing the disc and having iMovie08.

He moved to France and lived most of his adult life in Bordeaux, where he had an active musical life, primarily as a theatre conductor. The music on this disc is presented primarily, I imagine, because it represents music by an early African-American composer. It is primarily in the form of quadrilles, galops, waltzes and the like. One can easily imagine some of this music played at house parties or dances. Unfortunately, I can't imagine wanting to hear it more than once. And the performances themselves, although spirited, are pretty clunky.I admire Naxos for recording so much unknown American music, but I think they might have picked something better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, wrong songlist","review":"This is a terrific album full of blues legends bridging Delta and Chicago blues. The songlist given above is wrong and the artist you hear when you sample a song is not the Old Friends. It sounds nothing like them. This album is raw and hard, full-band blues. Just hearing Honeyboy Edwards with a full electric backing band is worth more than the price. I'm just amazed this album is not more popular than it is. It's an outstanding and diverse blues album that brings together five amazing blues musicians that make incredible music together and have a lot of fun doing so. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent soprano!","review":"Kathleen Battle is one in a line of incredibly talented American born sopranos including Anna Moffo, Renee Fleming, Leontyne Price, etc. She has a beautiful voice and perfectly suited to sing Bach, Handel and Mozart. This disc will open your eyes to the beauty of Mozart if you do not already appreciate his work. The standouts here are \\"Vorrei spiegarvi\\" which will send chills up your spine, \\"exsultate jubilate\\", \\"l'amero saro costante\\", \\"un moto di gioia\\", and \\"misera, dove son\\". Andre Previn does an outstanding job at the conductor's helm.I was terribly saddened that this great diva's career was sidetracked by supposed temperament difficulties. I'll not fault her too much because we only know the Met Opera's version. Besides, Battle is forgiven for the sheer gorgeousness of her singing. Mozart himself would be so pleased if he heard this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"mesmerizing","review":"from beginning to end, this album compels one's attention to its subtle, yet striking details. the bare beauty of their compositions is what makes their music amazing. all of their works are equally good, but this album is still my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"good college boy music","review":"If you're a geeky college kid like me, you should have this ep.

Unfortunately, I can't find another brand for this phone. Don't waste your money on this. A scratched phone looks better than one with this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"This album is a culmination of all 5 previous albums, as can be seen in many of their tracks. Their first single, \\"Feels Like It Should\\", is very reminiscent of their Synkronized album. The title track is easily the most addicting song on the album, much in the same fashion that \\"Love Foolosophy\\" was on Funk Odyssey. The track \\"Seven Days In Sunny June\\" represents their earlier days, where synthesizers and digital sounds took a backseat to the natural beats and the piano and guitar rhythms that were abundant in \\"Return of The Space Cowboy\\".The entire ablum has a great flow, the tracks all seem to be where they should be; and blend together well to produce an album that you immediately want to restart and experience again. I got to the end of last track and realized it was over, and I had to go back to track one and listen to it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't stray from the formula","review":"Thumping 70's/80's dance beats that, at times, drown out the vocalist, a lead singer with a distinctive delivery, and enigmatic lyrics make \\"Dynamite\\" another clone of earlier works by Jamiroquai. There is the requisite slow jam (\\"Tallulah\\") that appears midway in the 11-song set, preceded and followed by a plethora of dance tracks, and two semi-rocking tunes thrown in for good measure (\\"Feels Just Like It Should\\" and \\"Hot Tequila Brown\\") that serve to bookend the album.Though not a bad release, it stays too true to form and can be interchangeable to the previous three releases, of which I have them in my collection, also.It's time for the group to take some chances with something NEW, rather than recycled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!!","review":"If you're a Jamiroquai fan, you'll love this one.

Pick this one up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy... but not too innovative","review":"The thing with Jamiroquai's albums is, when you've heard one of them, you've (almost) heard them all. This album, while groovy and contagious, truly doesn't bring along much innovation to the table. Think of the classic 70s and early 80s disco-meets-Motown sound and you will have a perfect idea of how \\"Dynamite\\" sounds. Not bad, not boring: simply more of the same Jamiroquai. This guy, in spite of the \\"trend\\" in pop that has moved ahead to reviving the 80s, has stuck to his sound. I will give it four stars: I like it, but I don't love it to the point of giving it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong.","review":"This is one the strongest efforts by Jamiroquai. He has cretaed his own style which is very recognisable and, of course, he keep persuing it. Jamiroquai is innovative because he is different from others. And, this is true to his every album.\\"Dynamite\\" is diverse in tempo and includes a number of really good songs. Some of them you may enjoy when you are up in the spirit and need some further drive, the others will serve well when you are a bit down in the mood. The album is recorded very well, both highs and lows. Very well defined bass. The voice sounds very natural. The sound engineering is great.You will enjoy both the music and the sound. You will hear the details that add to the overall perception of this highly recommended CD. Take time and it will grow on you even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Debateable","review":"IN comparison to the other Jamiroquai albums, this is the worst. Upon hearing that they were releasing a new album that went back to the good days of Traveling- i was like \\"PIMP!!\\" jamiroquai is my favorite band. i went and got it. listened to all the songs once through, and was satisfied with #2 and #5. the rest are...hmm..they just don't have the jamiroquai spice. looking at the credits, you'll see that there are all new members except Sola and Derrick. i think the real soul in Jamiroquai came from the keyboards and the bass. without that u just got this mish-mash of a cd that shouldn't have been released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds good to me","review":"I just saw Jamiroquai in concert last tuesday and they delivered, ok! I took a little hiatus after \\"Traveling Without Moving,\\" but, I'm back ok! This cd is very good, I heard almost four cuts from the album at the concert and it sounded really good.

A lot of people are saying that it reminds them of Traveling Without Moving which I don't understand because THAT my friends is a GREAT album but not this one. Jamiroquai's first three albums are masterpieces in my opinion. The horn arrangements in Emergency On Planet Earth and Traveling are tight and funky. This album lacks the funk and arrangements that made me such a big Jamiroquai fan.I keep buying his albums hoping that they will get better but they are only getting worse.

A discovery that I can't get enough of. I think it's interesting that the tone can stay relatively the same throughout the album, while exploring a range of emotions and perceptions all at once. They are stories of a man who can go anywhere, experience anything, and not lose himself. They are stories of finding love in the most unexpected places, and still being able to keep life in perspective. The album almost feels like a question... why isn't love happening, when it is all around? Is it worth waiting for sparks to fly, or is it better to move on? The album toys with the possibility that perhaps it is greed and corruption that is making us forget how to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb childen's video","review":"It is good to get a video for children that deals with interesting relationships and where the children portrayed are all different little individuals.

Every time I would slip the horn out of the bag or put it back in, I had to take great care because the zipper could have possibly scratched the finish. I solved the problem by removing the zipper by its stitches and simply tucking the bag underneath the horn.

They are the superb recordings we all heard on the radio and fell in love with over the years. But this lame cd features many inferior, older mono recordings. Shame on Capital Records for getting it wrong, yet again. Add this to the already long list of incomplete Nat packages on the market. Why can't they do their homework and do it right? Nat deserves the loving treatment the label reserves for Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. The first half of this cd is just awful. But at least the second half is so great, you nearly forget how iratating the first has is...Truely one of the greatest male vocalists of all time, regardless of genre. \\"Let's Face The Music And Dance\\" is all the proof you need..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Compilation CD for a great price","review":"This CD had alot of the hits you'd expect from Nat King Cole.Great for a person wanting an intro to his music.

Cool rock from Seattle!","review":"Nevada Bachelors triumph! Another PopLlama gem! I'm telling you buy this record because it will make you happy. The Bachelors sing a string of songs that imbue the listener with an effervescence, an energy, an enthusiasm that's SO refreshing in the depressing world of my-life's-such-a-dreary-pit-of-despair rock and roll mediocrity embodied in the pseudo-sensitivite crying-in-their-beers strung out whiners all too prevalent in the industry today. And the Bachelors accomplish this without rose colored glasses, although I believe I've seen Mike Squires sport a pair in the past, but only literally and never figuratively. Their music is honest and open and testimonial and beyond all that is catchy rock and roll straight from the heart. Shake Yer Mop tells the story of who they are and where they've come from, and the rest of the album is song after song of solid, hook-enriched pop rock to soothe the soul.

Unfortunately (IMO), this CD is over-produced and way too slick. The songs are uneventful, and nothing really stands out. I haven't listened to this CD since the first week I bought it. Sorry, I love Al and I have all of his music, and I hope he keeps recording, but he's capable of SO much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Al. I wish I had borrowed it b4 I bought it...","review":"I am a long time (since the 70s) Al Green devotee. And I'm just very disappointed with this cd. There are a few songs that I enjoy, but very few. I think mostly what is bothering me with this cd is that there seems to be waaaaaay too much caterwauling. Meaning screeching and hollering. Now I can certainly appreciate Al Green's enthusiam and getting into the energy of the song and I don't mind some \\"outbursts\\", but it is excessive on this cd and after I listened to it the first time it really got on my nerves. It isn't that I can't embrace his new recordings like some of my friends who only want to hear the old stuff. I really liked the last cd, \\"I can't stop\\" and I was very excited to hear that this new cd was coming out. Sorry out there to all the Al Green fans, but if you have to choose between this new cd and his last new cd \\"I can't stop\\" I certainly wouldn't pick this newest one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This does not qualify as a sophomore slump","review":"In 2003, The Reverend Al Green dropped religious title and pretense, and got back to his roots with the lovely I Can't Stop, an album that equaled his best years as last generation's top secular soul singer. Everything's OK - number two out of the box for Al since being un-born again - fell far short of I Can't Stop's rough-n-ready soul vibe. If these cheesy lyrics and schlocky production quality are all Mr. Green has to offer, he'd better start shilling for Jesus, again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memphis sound is back!!!","review":"Al Green has always been a favorite of mine.I grew up with soul music as a staple.I slipped this CD in and I thought I was back in the 70'sHis style has not changed at all,I was impressed that he can still(with a little push) hit those same high notes he did when I was a young man.If you want to go back to the better times than this CD is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beat 'em up awesomism","review":"Okay, so it IS flawed. There's no multiplayer (A must for beat 'em ups), and a whole level + character's been taken out, too. But you still gotta play this. Since this game is by Capcom, you're sure to find that this is an awesome Super NES gem.Final Fight is the one that started a whole craze of games that played similarly to it. The button-mashing knuckle-crunching coolness shines throughout the game from start to finish. It's extremely addicting, and in case you think it would get repetitive, chances are you will find an item that can help you beat up all the goons in the level.The graphics are downright amazing. The sprites are all very large-scale, making it easy to appeal to the eye. The music and sound effects are also realistic and catchy, just like how Capcom would always make them.In a nutshell: Go out to a flea market or something, or maybe buy it online here, and you won't be disappointed whatsoever (Although the difficulty can be somewhat tough)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the prisner of Azkaban","review":"I am a real Harry Potter fan, I have read all the books 2x each so when I compare the book with the movie I have to say that at first I thought it was all wrong, but after re reading the book I found that they cut and merged so much of the book to shorten it that it wasn't as true to the books as the other 2 movies.It was very entertaining even with the new Dumbledore who did a fine job but Richard Harrison was most suited for the part and it will take a little time getting used to but I think he will eventually will win the fans over completely.Every body did a wonderful job acting, it was funny and exciting I would however recommend if any are disappointed to re read the book and discover where the merges took place so it makes more sence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I gave it a 5 start rating because I love the movie and liked how it was delivered fast and was in good shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter","review":"The Harry Potter series in movie form all closely follow the books and are for the most part well done.

It looks like they really did a great job with this film. From what I saw in the trailers they pretty much stuck to the book. There were lots of scenes there that I recognized from the book. The movie looks SO EXCITING! I can't wait till June 4th! I'm glad they put in the part when Hermione punches Draco in the face. That was cool! I hope there will be more trailers soon and the poster sure looks exciting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter","review":"I fear that they will ruin the third Harry Potter film for they are going to take away the wizard robes and put them in normal clothes that muggles would wear .

So don't judge it before it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"wasn't a fan until this movie","review":"i personally wasn't looking forward to going to see harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban. im 20 years old and a college student and didnt get the whole harry potter thing. i made a promise to my younger brother for his b-day that i would take him to see it. ive seen the first 2 and thought they were boring. so it was only naturally that when i went into the movie theather i was expecting to be really bored and falling asleep. instead it was actually funny and entertaining so much that ive even borrowed my brother's books and went to see the movie 3 more times. i dont want to say alot about the movie itself except go and see it for yourself but i was say daniel and emma were brillant in it and rupert was extremely funny esp. when he awakes from the nightmare about the spiders it makes me laugh even thinking about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of it's name","review":"I, for one, was extremely disappointed with this film. I think that the third book was my favorite and, personally, this movie seemed to slaughter it.First off, why did the cast the actor who is the definitely of sleasy and villanous as Lupin? I think that was maybe the most horribly cast character in the history of film.Sirius is cast alright, a little fatter than I expected but still better than Lupin.The computer graphics are good, except for that final scene by the lake with sirius, which I won't discuss much further.The scene where Hermoine punches Draco is cool but it kinda came off as a desperate attempt to save a crippled film.Harry feints almost every other scene. I'm not sure where that came from.The were-wolf is a shameful animation, he looks far too gangly and slim to by a horrifying monster.Overall, the plot line is skewered as well and I would never dream of suggesting this movie for harry potter fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creature Fright","review":"All this video is about is how to get over creature fright, like Boggarts. Harry Potter uses Expecto Patronum to challenge the boggart. It doesn't even have any education in this dumb video. I do like it when Malfoy says filthy little mudblood at Hermione, though. That part tears me up! Don't even get this video with violence because this stinken movie has no educational skills...Just kidding! This is the best Harry Potter movie anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Installation To the Saga","review":"I will keep this brief. I tolerate this movie because it is part of the Saga but in my opinion the director fouled up horribly. The movie is relate to the book but it skips and omits in an unbelievable fashion. The entire time thing just does not make sense. The complete overhaul of the castle is horrifying. The alteration of the movie so as to remove Quiditch entirely from the plot line is abhorrent. Please don't get me wrong - I enjoy the movie but as I said - only because its apart of the series. But in my opinion the director did not really care much about the storyline or the book. He had an idea - he had never read the book - he altered, cut, mutilated and destroyed. So. Thats all I have to say. Just dissapointed that this movie could have been so much more... and it wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one was better than the first and second!!","review":"\\"Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban\\" was My favorite Harry Potter movie yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter DVD","review":"I received this item within four days of placing the order.

I suppose I have to write this review.I have seen all the trailers, and they were good. That's why I give this movie 4 stars. Even if I haven't seen it yet, as I mentioned before.Is it true there isn't much of Quidditch? If it is, I'll be disappointed. Quidditch is always been my favourite part in the movies, and in the books too. I know, there isn't Oliver Wood so maybe there's not much Quidditch too(My sister probably doesn't like it, because Oliver Wood is her personal favourite). I hope Daniel Radcliffe is better as Harry, and Rupert Grint is as good as he was in the last movie.

I was so let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wonder What Would Happen If I Watched The Whole Thing...","review":"A few days ago i managed to catch 15 minutes of this movie and it was enough for me! For one thing, the plot has barely anything in common with the book. Isn't Professor Lupin supposed to be shabby and long-haired? Well, actually he looked like a thin Mr. Dursley and he even wore muggle clothes. Malfoy is portrayed as a big sissy, because when Hermione punched him, he started crying. Plus, they totally didn't explain the werewolf situition at all. All-in-all, the people who made this movie should really read the book a few times first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many changes","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the humor in the movie, but it was disappointing to see such obvious changes in the grounds. It just didn't \\"feel\\" right. Although Dumbledore's replacement is an excellent actor, I didn't really warm up to him until his very last lines. He spoke much too fast, not 'wise' at all. The harsh scenes in the movie were great, lots of fast action scary scenes. The ending sucked big time, again, just didn't feel right with that wallpaper that followed. Cuaron gave it the same creepy feeling as a dementor sucking his face again, no good, wrong timing. The one actor who felt perfect for the part was Thewlis, who played Lupin, he was believable. Cuaron failed to make Sirius as sinister as the book portrayed him, and the scene at the Leaky Cauldron was totally wrong! I wish Chris Columbus had done it and the next films as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"heartbroken","review":"I have been a devoted Harry Potter fan for years. This movie almost made me cry!

Why are all the children wearing sweatshirts in class?!!I mean come on, this IS a British boarding school, children DO wear uniforms there!I never loved this book for its realism, I always loved it because it gives me a magical world so different from my own! I miss the clutter of Diagon-alley (why was it turned into a train station?), I miss the luscious green lawns of Hogwarts, but most of all I miss the feeling of intimacy and warmth that was the result of all the close-ups in the first two movies.Please, please bring back Chris Columbus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising of actual product!","review":"I ordered this DVD twice and both times recieved the wrong edition.

That's not what I got. It was supposed to be scary and very creepy. Well, it wasn't. This movie would have been a lot better if it would have been rated PG-13. That would have made a good interpretation of the book. First off, the 3rd book was the best one. It was excellent. But, this movie somehow managed to ruin the whole book and everything for me. This movie is very weird and really dark. I didn't like this peculiar interpretation of the book with lots of strange moments where I was scratching my head, thinking, what the heck?????This movie is weird especially thanks to the wierd bus driver. The movie was also boring to me and after a while, it lost my interest.

I thought maybe our theater's film was messed up since the color and picture quality was so bad, but from what I understand, that was intentional.

Movies are movies. Movies that try to be books are not good movies. You may enjoy seeing every detail from the books in the movies, but an eight-hour movie is not a good movie by any stretch.

It doesn't need Potter nerds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter is a classic","review":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban will be great. Every Harry Potter film is.

I cant imagine what a person who hasnt read the book would think. The movie makes no sense, I dont understand why the screenwriter and director left out so many plot points, but found time to put in pointless sceenes with shrunken heads, harry deep in thought or harry walking through the woods talking to lupin(that especially makes no sense for lupin to spend so much time with harry. I know he did in the book, but I dont recall them having deep heart to heart talks. Most people arent that close with their teachers.)All in all I just dont like this movie, it will go on my list of the worst movies Ive seen. Not because it is that terrible, but the book is so incredibly good, I cant understand how this came from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arsesome","review":"Yeah I said arsesome. I just watched this movie last night and it was the best one so far. The director did a wonderful job bringing Hogwarts to life in a different light from Columbus' vision. It rocks... hard.

Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best \\"Harry Potter\\" yet","review":"A far darker and more mature film, The Prisoner of Azkaban is proof that the Harry Potter franchise is growing up.Based on the book of the same name, this third entry in the Harry Potter epic follows Harry during his third year at Hogwarts. The twist this time around is that there has been an escape at the heavily guarded wizard prison of Azkaban, and the escapee is supposedly after Harry.Far more intense than previous entries, this movie is more appropriate for the preteen and older crowd. \\"Azkaban\\" also showcases one of the growing problems with the franchise - the stories are becoming too long and involved for a 2 hour movie. For those who have read the book, a great deal had to be cut and condensed to accommodate the timeframe. However, none of these issues keep \\"Azkaban\\" from being an excellent film.Recommended for 12-year and older fantasy and Harry Potter fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"Typically, I don't like the movie if I read the book first. This movie, however, can stand on its own.Those viewers looking for the movie to be exactly like the book will be disappointed.

Of course, I would have liked to see more but that is simply not possible.Hungry for more after seeing the movie? Read the book.

He finally made a Harry Potter movie that was worth the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not that good","review":"I think the first two harry potters wre the best because they had a different director.

That said, the movie is quite good. I really liked the portrayal of Professor Lupin. The special effects are wonderful, and the magical world is richly portrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed","review":"This movie was awful! I don't really know how these other people liked it. If I hadn't read the book, I would have had NO idea what was going on with certain scenes in the movie. Other things were added that had no business being in the movie. Maybe it was the director's attempt at humor with some of these things, but failed miserably. Warner Bros. would do well NOT to hire this director for the remainder movies.

But first, for those interested in the movie, it is great - 5 stars.I give the DVD 2 stars because of the Johnny Vaughan. I have rarely ever seen such awful interviews. Just one example: unbelievably, one of the main questions for almost every actor is \\"how many girls\\" (he even uses the offensive term \\"birds\\"...) have you been able to seduce thanks to your fame from the HP films. Even when the boy who plays the Dursley kid states early on that no one recognizes him in the street, Vaughan still asks (maybe even twice if I'm not mistaken) the same stupid, sexist question. (The pathetic attempts at humour using the Shrunken Head are also incredibly annoying.) What a lost opportunity.This is of course no reason not to by the DVD, but Warner Brothers should be embarrassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring Back Chris!","review":"I saw the first two movies and was greatly pleased at how much they were like the books. However, this third movie was not impressive. It lacks spirit and luster. It did not stay true to the book, left out some very important parts, and went as far as changing parts of the story. The cinematoghrapy was dull and the magic of the first two films was non-existent. If you never read the books and saw this movie, you would be lost. I sincerely hope that they bring back the original film crew for the fourth movie or they may lose fans.

The second disk is packed with lots of interesting things such as interviews with all the main actors, games, interactive sets, and explanations of how some of the movie was made, such topics as the animals that appear in the movie, special effects and animatronics. They show how Professor Lupin turns into a werewolf. You also get to see that all of the people involved really enjoyed making the movie.

So much was taken out that should have been left in, stuff that was just a bit important to the plot. And, ok, I realize that Dumbledore had to be changed because of the passing of Richard Harris, but the casting department could have done a little better. I even heard that he acted like a hippie on PURPOSE, acting on instructions from the director. And did Cueron really HAVE to make the ending so stupid?? I had been looking foward to this movie more than the others (it's my favorite book) and was very disappointed. I do, however, give the movie 5 stars for effects (except the werewolf) and for music-that's why it got a star in my rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Disapointed With This One","review":"The third book is my second favorite in the series and I don't think this movie did a very good job of representing it. It seemed to have no plot to it, more like jumping from one thing to another and not explaining anything. Especially when talking about the Marauder's Map and The Grim that Harry sees. I have read the book multiple times and still all I could understand from this movie was that Sirius Black wanted to kill Harry. The ending did not explain the relationship between the makers of the Marauder's Map and Harry, or hardly anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor production !!!!","review":"Compared to the first two Harry Potter films, the third was a very poor comparison to the book. A great many of the important details were left out of the movie, especially at the beginning, that are essential to set the stage for the plot. This movie completely fails to capturing the magical mystical charm of Hogwarts; Dumbledore's demeanor doesn't project the same patriarchal figure as usual, Malfoy's appearance isn't quite as wicked, and the students are often seen out of their regular school uniforms which detracts from the strict boarding school atmosphere that the book portrays. I certainly hope that future Harry Potter movies will reflect the same quality as the books -- otherwise they should stop making the movies.Very disappointing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two-faced","review":"This movie, while I admit the actual theatrical performance was good, did not resemble the book as most people have said. I think that if you make a movie about a book, it should be more like the book. The director for the movie added too many different aspects that did not fit the Harry Potter storyline. I loved the books, but the movie needs some definite help. People have said that the Lord of the Rings movies are too long, but they follow the story which is why they are so loved. This edition of Harry Potter could have been much more loved by the public if it followed the book a bit more closely. The movie was a good movie, but it was not a good Harry Potter movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wheeee","review":"I watched this one yesterday.

With Harry, (Daniel Radcliffe) Hermione, (Emma Watson) and Ron, ( Rupert Grint) hitting their teens, the movie is going to be absolutely, fantastically, positively, GREAT. With notorious murderer Sirius Black on the loose, supposedly going after harry, the movie takes on a differnt visual and tone perception.With darker visuals and edgier tones, the movie is more suspensful.i would just like to say WE LOVE HARRY POTTER, KEEP ON GOING STRONG SON!

The first 2 movies followed the books closely and, no surprise, were too crowded and disorganized. Cuaron edits and streamlines in a way that Rowling seems unable to do: he's a better storyteller. I'm glad he didn't include endless boring quidditch scenes, etc. etc. He did fail to explain a couple of small details, but overall this is an example of superior directing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellect","review":"First of all, the lack of an extended cut takes away any chance of this item being a worthwhile purchase. Now the movie itself also has many flaws. Besides a terrible artistic style, and omitting many important scenes it also suffers from terrible dialogue pacing. Too many conversations happen at a Gilmoresque pace that shouldn't. Harry Potter is not a quick thinking character outside of physical conflict. If he is being told important, complex information he needs to stand there and absorb the information for a moment before responding. This same issue happens on a much lesser scale to most characters in the movie. The only characters who benefit from this pace are the Weasley Twins. The silver tongued quick witted bamboozlers work very well with the pacing of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn Off Your TV and Read","review":"The book is so much more well put together then the movie. The movie is choppy at best. I'm a big fan of the harry potter books but the movies have frankly dispointed me. It leaves out key elements of the story and changes the plot around. It was confusing and harder to follow then the book. I really think people should just stick to the book or the books on tape because they are awesome. If i could give this movie a 0 I would! I wanted to just fall asleep during it. This is a sell out at best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor movie","review":"This movie was too long that left me wanting it to end so I could turn it off. This doesn't have anything of the first 2 movies and that was a huge disappointment. Hogwarts no longer looks like a school but a gothic castle. I lost interest in the mystery and found the characters lacked depth. Maybe the director should read the books and watch the previous films before making this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"They really messed this one up","review":"I loved reading the books, and loved the first two movies. The first movies were visual feasts. This third one is a disaster. It's all dark, there's practically nothing to be seen because it's all gray on black and black on black, faces and scenes flick in and out within these murky images, and the whole thing is as boring as can be.Please bring back Columbus's earlier magic. Please.It's a shame they won't have the budget to re-film this one decently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too intense for children, but older kids and up will like it","review":"Little kids will probably be scared, but other than that the film is highly entertaining. There's enough of a story to engage adults. The action and special effects are also enough to hold the kids attention. Star Wars was the fantasy of choice when I was growing up. Since the recent SW series has been mediocre, the HP series is a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP","review":"This is the third year for Harry Potter at Hogwarts School of Withcraft and Wizardry.

Also, I love how they really got to the emotional parts with Harry, how hard it is to be him and what he's going through.(except when he was crying where did that come from! Sorry im a person who likes every little detail that is in the book to be in the movie) But I absolutely love the way Cuaron made the Ron/Hermione love hate thing I love watching them argue!

I read all the books and seen all the movies. I don't get why people say Prisoner of Azkaban is best one?!! No it is not Chamber of Secrets and both parts of Deathly Hallows are the best ones. This movie does follow parts of the book, but does not follow it really good. Everyone was good in the movie except Ron. It looks like another British Actor who looks like him took his place and acts like if he didn't know who Ron is. Any time I see this movie or hear about it it puts me in a bad mood. The ones who like this movie are either people who haven't read the books or regular people. If you are huge a Harry Potter fan you will be disappointed and just read the book. If you're haven't read the books then you might like the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I think it my duty to add to the single star rating of this NON-ultimate edition. My wife too was thrilled to get the extended versions of the first two Harry Potters. These next two are a complete rip-off of the consumer and ought to warrant refunds for false advertising and promotions. What you expect is the same great continuity WB put into the first two features. Now they want the money without offering anything in return...unless you think a game and a little chit-chat is worth the price of the original movie.Two Thumbs Down for the dispicable way WB is treating the fan base.

That's the job of our government!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best MOVIE yet!","review":"ok: this movie is magical but not without its faults: apparantly the geography of the Hogwarts grounds has changed (for the better, IMO), it strays from the book SLIGHTLY but nothing major. When it does, it makes sense. a great example is Harry's Firebolt. Once you see the film you'll understand why it was a good move. My only complaint is that they didn't dwell on the Prongs, Padfoot, Moody and Wormtail story. Bottom line: best Potter film, however, to get the full expereince read the book AS WELL. Reading the first two books wasn't neccessary to 'get' the movies. I'm anxious for \\"HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE\\" due Nov. 18, 2005.

I mean, come on, where in the HP series does Harry have to go down a long bridge and rocky crags to get to Hagrid's hut? They also could have had more Hagrid and Snape scenes.

This book is the best one in the entire series and I never thought it could be ruined. Before the release of the movie I thought to myself, how can it be bad since the book is so good? Well, the movie positvely butchered the book. The cast was fine, the acting was good, computer animation was great, but c'mon! Was the movie even based on the book because I couldn't tell! The movie was so unlike the book in countless ways! They added a lot of unnecessary things, yet left out some very important information. I don't know how they expect to make more movies because so much was left out of this one. People who only see the movies will be totally confused. So, if you are a big fan of the Harry Potter books, I do not recommend seeing this movie, much less buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch","review":"Warner Bros. has shown us the dark side of the entertainment business by releasing this \\"Ultimate Edition\\" without the extended version. It's unfortunate they will still make money on these flawed editions from people who were pleased with the year one and year two sets(as was I), which included both the theatrical and extended films, who will feel compelled to keep this incomplete set (I will be returning mine). I encourage everyone who feels the same to write about it. Whether it's in these reviews, a blog or emails directly to Warner Bros., letting the powers that be know that their customers are dissatisfied is the only way they'll even consider terminating these shady business practices.

Well dummy me for thinking that way. if you have already purchased these movies on Blu ray don't bother with the same movie again. There is no extended version in these sets. I was hoping that 4 would finally make sense but alas I am left with the travisty that was Mike Newels vision. It is sad that Warner Brothers let us down. They, and Amazon, should do the right thing and send us all the extended editions like we all expected.

I could care less about the crappy trading cards or whatever you call them and most of the extras on the discs aren't in HD anyway so I don't even watch them.

Every new director wants to make a change, but in this case the changes have amounted to stripping the richness from the movie and reducing it to a rather bleak (and simplistic) format. There is almost no Hogwarts background, the acting from the other main characters is trite and sneering, and overall I was left wondering why on earth Warner Brothers chose Alfonso Cuarón to direct the movie. Change for the sake of it is pointless. The new Dumbledore seems to have decided to stress the first four letters of his name, and the stock villain Draco Malfoy has transformed here into a stupid leering simpleton. The result is that there's no dramatic tension of any kind. Although everyone seems to have raved about the results, this reviewer found it flat, badly-paced, lacking in charm and frankly not worth seeing a second time.

Some say the themes was darker, I say all it was was dingy in this movie. The casting of Michael Gambeon was terrible, he reminded me of someones Daft uncle and not the character of Albus Dumbledore. No strength or genuine warmth at all, in fact the most likable character, and the cleanest was, Snape and he's supposed to be the heavy!

Ms. Rowling deserves a cold look of disdain because she signed off on the whole project. I will have to seriously consider whether I want to add this DVD to my collection.

The casting was beautiful, and I cannot wait for the return of Sirius Black. Being a huge potter fan, I did notice that some parts were left out, but some were left out in the other movies too.The scenes in this movie are absolutly spectacular, especially Hogsmede and the big clock thing.

Warner Brothers is pulling down any negative reviews from their site and Amazon seems to be lumping all reviews of Prisoner of A. in to one category instead of by individual versions of the product, so when reading the reviews please make sure you are reading the reviews for the Ultimate Editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"very good movie...different director maybe???","review":"All Harry Potter movies are great, but this one had alot of descrepancies. A couple of them are....When Harry meets the dementors on the train, he says he hears a woman scream. But it's never mentioned again during the film.One more is the fact that they never explain why the dementors are after Harry in the first place. They are supposed to be searching for Sirius Black.However, I've never read the novels, just seen the movies. Maybe in the novel they explain all these things. Even the humor in the movie was dull. Evidently the director was different or he just has made one too many of these to make this latest one good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avid book fan, disappointed movie fan","review":"This movie varied from the book, and, had I not read the book, I would've been completely lost as to what was happening in the end. The actors were good, and as a story, it was good, but the differences in the plot are too much for me bear. The special affects for the werewolf simply made me roll me eyes - it looked like a cross between a rat and a man, not a wolf and a man!It is my opinion that the film makers left out crucial information that will be important to people seeing the next movies. It is a fun watch, but it's way too long (three hours) for not enough explanations."},{"rating":"2","title":"No extended version but the Special Features make up for it!","review":"Our first thought was that WB had done a classic Bait and Switch with these \\"Ultimate Editions\\". Our wonderful friend in Colorado is giving us two HP Ultimate Editions per Christmas and we are currently watching Years 3 and 4.First of all there is NOT an extended version of the movies which we were expecting,Second: the DVD's do not return to the resume mode as do other discs which is a pain to start all over if we are interrupted,Third: the sound quality doesn't seem as good as we have to crank it up during the movie for volume to pick up voicesBUT THAT SAID - the Special Features are EXCELLENT! This makes the Ultimate Edition worth it. Year 3 was Creatures and how they are made for the movie and Year 4 is Sounds and Music - how that makes the whole Harry Potter world come to life and affects our emotions.Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I think many people have talked about this but the whole reason for buying this DVD was to see a new \\"directors\\" cut of the movie. The first two ultimate editions of the Harry Potter movie had a least some added footage but this DVD has nothing. I didn't need another copy of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prisoner of Azkaban streaming video","review":"This review isn't about the film, but rather the streaming service, which is absolutely terrible. If I pause the movie it takes a minute or more to 'seek' the data and restart the film. THEN the volume doesn't work, leaving me no choice but to refresh the whole page or go back a page and start over. Also, the volume is set rather low, such that I have to use headphones, though that may be my computer (MAC)."},{"rating":"1","title":"very different from the first two movies","review":"I have read all the books and have seen the first two movies. This newest movie did not have the same feel as the first two Harry Potter movies. I kept finding myself looking around to see if I was in the right theater. The movie was too dark and confusing. It did not seem to match the book. I was surprised the author had allowed this director to produce the 3rd movie in this way. I wanted to see the whole movie because it was a Harry Potter movie but at the same time the urge to leave the theater early was pretty strong. We were all a bit disappointed by this movie. I am not sure this movie is worth buying maybe you could just reread the 3rd book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item not as described.","review":"The Dvd I bought was described to be in very good condition but it's not even playable."},{"rating":"2","title":"harry potter prisoner of azkaban , good or brilliant.","review":"the new installment of harry potter has finally been released and the film show's great expectation it is absoulutley amazing i think its the best one yet with new people in it starring proffesor lupin, sirius black and not forgetting the other sort of hero buckbeak the hippogriff daniel radcliffe plays an amazing part has harry potter has u watch the film it feels like ur there he makes the character come to life with zest, rupert grint who plays one of harry best friends at hogwarts is character is absoulutley funny there a few funny parts in it and there is always ron that as to say sumthing funny he is an exceptional actor. then theres emma watson who plays hermione granger wat can i say she totally is extrodanary in the film with a few scenes has she smacks draco malfoy she is one of the best actresses of her age i give this film a 5 star rating"},{"rating":"2","title":"The filming is already going well","review":"My wife and I - who are BIG Harry Potter fans - had a preview tour of Warner Studios and it is evident that the filming is already going very well. (We are Oxford graduates - Hogwarts Dining Hall and the the 14th century Duke Humfrey's Library (where my wife and I used to date among the old volumes....:-) are key places in this the third and most exciting of the first three Potter books. If 40 somethings like me and my wife and my god-daughter aged 7 are all convinced that this is going to be a blockbuster, I really don't think that any of us will be disappointed! Christopher Catherwood, Potter fan and author (of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE, Zondervan, 2003)"},{"rating":"1","title":"no magic left","review":"i think that film is just bad. There is no magic left from movie one and two. It is cutted ways too fast, there is no space for any emotions or acting.There are many important things left out from the book, but film-time is wasted with such a stupid scene with making animal noises and steaming out of the ears because of eating candies. And I didn't know that Titanic needs a tribute from Harry Potter!And why were all the sets changed? Is this big clock in the book? And since when is Hogwarts in the mountains?And the end is just terrible!The movie is boring and lets you completely cold.I wished Peter Jackson would take GoF. Perhaps then we could looking forward to a good movie. But else..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not as good as the first two.","review":"This is a great movie, but the first two were better. The special effects were wonderful, alot better than that of the first two. The best scene would have to be the quidditch scene. It's fairly short, but it was really awesome. The movie it self was short, and parts of it, exspecialy the beganning, where rushed. Like I said it was good, but the 1st & 2nd were better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was great!!","review":"I saw the movie in the theaters and fell in love with it. Compared to the other two movies it really sticks out. The use of computer animation is unbelievable. The dementors rock!!It is a must see!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Read the Book Right Before Seeing the Movie!","review":"I loved the movie but I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had not read the book again before going. The director is certainly a more \\"artsy\\" director than the previous director (Chris Columbus) and his liberal thinking is evident in the making of this film. The scenery is beautiful and the art director did a wonderful job of creating the majestic Hogwarts that is described in the books. Because it differs from the other movies, many reviewers seem to forget the Hogwarts from the books. There are many cases of dramatic license in the film but I think it gives more visual interest to the story. PoA is my favorite book and this is my favorite movie so far, but when viewing this movie, treat them as two very different works of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Prisnor of Azkaban","review":"I found this movie to be good but not as good as the others. The characters are growing up and are starting to be out of place."},{"rating":"2","title":"RADCLIFFE IS AWSOME!!!","review":"I felt that all of the Harry Potter movies have partained to the books very well. And you have to admit that some people just like this movie for the amazing actors,special effects, and the witty story plot that keeps viewers pleading for more! I do hope that Warner Bros. continues to make these magnificent movies untill the end of the series!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree with most good reviews","review":"I agree with most reviews but i think Alfonso Cuarón Just went a little to dark, i mean hogswarts was falling apart, come on! I understand darker, a bit older and musty just because it's POA in which the book is but it's like this year clases were in somekind of acient ruin's not a school where magical studies are commited,and the Hogwarts grounds look very chaotic not like the first parts which seem to be a well organized, i think weather and outdoor efect were really good in acordance to the book, the fog, the rain, etc. Well aside from hogwarts looking like a graveyard i think it was well done.Just hope that for GOF we dont get too Bright and Happy (HP 1,2) or the Dark Graveyard (3)... and lupin tranformation sucked big time worst werewolf i've ever since ok i get the werewolves isn't synonymous with fur but that blue-grayish hairless Mexican dog craked me up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Movie","review":"This movie is a little bit darker than the other movies, and Harry seems to start having teenager angst.

I think that it was the dumbest thing that was created in the history of mankind. The books have no depth, or complex ideas. The movie was plain boring. The first few scenes were filled with 'action'(lousy excuses for it), about 'sirius' going to kill harry, but then halfway through the movie, all there was was a day in the life of a scar faced idiot. The actors are highly inprofessional. How could they even earn 3million for doing the movie. This movie stinks. I hate harry potter, and jk rowling for writing such a stupid book"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST!","review":"This was one of the best movies i have ever seen.....i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i own it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great interaction for all Hary potter fans...","review":"I will echo many thorough and positive reviews before me about the movie. Interest is renewed again after doing some of the interactive exercises and previews on Disc 2. Makes you want to go back and watch the movie again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monsieur Harry Potter","review":"I still like the first Harry Potter better than the second and the third. In this 3rd DVD, it's good that the story has some twists and turns. I kept asking myself, \\"How in the world did Hermione appear in the classroom when she wasn't there a second ago?\\" But in the end of the story everything is cleared up (as most of the stories are cleared up). Funny how there's a magical continuity from 1, 2, & 3 when at the end of each story, the mystery/problem is always solved. There's no, \\"That's the end?\\" kind of reaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD missing scenes!!!","review":"I am most distressed to find that the \\"Widescreen Special Edition\\" DVD I purchased is missing numerous small scenes-scenes that are integral to understanding the story!!I have also noticed missing scenes in the Sorceror's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets, which are \\"Special Editions\\" as well.I, for one, will purchase no more Harry Potter DVD's until this practice stops. I am quite disgusted with the Harry Potter marketers and producers--I feel that I have been cheated out of my money.When JK Rowling et al. begin selling unabridged products, I will consider purchasing her movies again.The movies themselves are good; the DVD's are an outright rip-off.BUYER BEWARE!!!Disappointed fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alfonso Cuaron should be locked up in Azkaban","review":"This movie was a huge disappointment. There was far too much cut from the story line (along with stuff inserted that was not in the book). The whole movie seemed choppy and it did not seem like it took place over a whole year. There was also major changes in the scenery - did Hogwarts just all of a sudden decide to renivate? The Great Hall looked half the size that it did in the first movie. The acting, with the exception of one flaw, was the only decent thing about the movie. I am sure the new Dumbledore is probably a great actor - but for crying out loud, he should have noticed from Richard Harris' performances in the first two movies how Dumbledore acts. This movie really was horrible and I am just thankful that Cuaron is not directing Goblet of Fire - although I wish it was Columbus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disenchanted","review":"Yes, I am among all those diehard Harry Potter fans who were very disenchanted by the Prisoner of Azkaban. This director most definately knows nothing about J.K.Rowling's books. It is too bad that Christopher Columbus could not do all of the movies! I know it must be hard to compress the whole book with so much vivid detail into a 2 1/2- 3 hour movie, but there was soo much missing that was important and too much nonsense (chasing his monster book under his bed, eating candy...) and he even changed the landscape of Hogwart's going to Hagrid's cabin. Maybe the suggestion here is to all future directors: READ THE BOOKS, understand the characters, take notes from Christopher Columbus-keep the magic!!Of course, I am still going to buy the DVD, I am curious about the extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Missing","review":"In comparison with the first two Harry Potter movies, this film does not do the books justice. The characters are under-developed, large chunks of the plot are missing or inaccurate, the location of filming was moved - so this is NOT the \\"original\\" Hogwarts, and the feel of the movie is too dark to be appropriate. The acting is a bit better in this film in comparison to the first two, but there are several over-the-top, \\"cheesy\\" moments that ruin the general feel.This movie could have, and perhaps should have, been at least an hour longer than it is to ensure that the audience is not left with a \\"huh?\\" feeling. As a Harry Potter fan I would probably buy this movie just because I want a whole set - but I wouldn't buy it until it's very inexpensive - or until someone else is willing to buy it as a gift.In either case, it will sit on the shelf and definitely won't be watched nearly as often as the first two films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Potter Film Yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is by far the best of the films.It takes the strength of the first two and really improves on them.The special effects were perfect(especially the Quidditch scence and the Dementors)and the acting is extremly good,especially for Gary Oldman(Sirus Black).There are only two things I've got a promblem with:the film doesn't follow the book that well and the atmosphere is very different(which is forgivable,considering this one has a different director than the first two). Anyway,try to look past the flaws and see this film.It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"I really liked this movie. I know a lot of people are complaining that too much of the book was left out; but if every little detail was included in the movie, than it would be 5 hours long. Another point is that if everything from the book is in the movie, than why bother seeing the movie if you've already read the book? Ok, this is just my opinion on the movie. It's a great movie and i urge everyone to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edith...My god, lose the \\"all caps!\\"","review":"When, oh when, will *all* people realize that typing in all caps comes across as screaming? Not because someone decided it was poor manners...but because reading it is truly irritating? Lemmie guess...you prefer a bare, 150 watt lightbulb screwed into a socket in the ceiling rather than a soft, eye-level, shaded lamp, right? That's much like what you are doing, Edith.. Makes me wanna smack someone.Meanwhile....This is, by far, the best of the three. Visually stunning, and for Rickmaniacs, sexy, I am sure. Gorgeous, dark, and satisfying.

Indy awake at 5:30am. j."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prisoner of Beauty","review":"I didn't care much for the HP series at first. While I liked the first two films, they didn't catch my attention. Then came the awesome Prisoner of Azkaban directed by the equally wonderful Alfonso Cuaron. I am a huge fan of this man's style, and he does not disappoint with this movie. Not only does the whole theme of the movie grow darker, but it's visually stunning to look at. Cuaron certainly knows how to bring out the best in young actors as well, giving more depth and emotion to the characters. And as a bonus, the growing on-screen chemistry between the actors really shines. Most especially the sparks between Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson. These two were made to star on-screen together. They light up their scenes.SIMPLY FANTASTIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How Unfortunate","review":"I was very sad to see how much was changed or left out from the book. JK Rowling got it right, so why change it needlessly ... if it isn't broken don't fix it. Now the next directors will have a hard time getting the character developement of many minor and some major characters back where it should be for the next movies. So many great scenes were left out of this movie or altered for no apparent reason. It is still excellent as a stand alone movie, but not as a part of a series. However, it is in no way as good as the book. I also didn't like the new locations as much.On the bright side, the lead child actors have matured and become really wonderful actors. The casting has to be the single best thing about the movie. The performances of all the actors from the leads to the cameos are great !I hope they don't leave as much out of the 4th movie. It would be very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear. It's that time again.","review":"I tried really hard to get into the whole Harry Potter phenomenon. really I did. I read the books and everything (well, looked at the back cover. Whatever.) So, yeah, anyway, I just didn't enjoy any of it. So when I went round to Ryder's the other week, and he was like, 'hey yo', lets watch some Potter and stuff.' And after that, I was like;'NNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!' And, and then, like, I dived forward, and sort of, grabbed a big guitar that was lying around, and just thwacked him in the head with it. I thought he might have been knocked out, or snapped in half. But no, he decided he was going to get up and have a go at me. Well I wasn't having any of that. I grabbed this cat that was on the floor, and snuffed it over his face, and he started choking, and the cat was meowing, and then he just fell over.I'm not entirely sure what happened. He was twitching a little, but it was very cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","review":"This won't be that long of a review because as far as I can see those Harry Potter movies kicked ...

That Daniel Radcliffe must not have any other acting talent whatsoever if these are the only kind of movies he can make.

There are just so many things wrong with it and it's all due to the new director. First of all, Sirius Black, unarguably most people's favorite character, has had his image ruined. He's supposed to be a rather young man, full of vitality... not a 50-year old helpless geezer who looks as if he sits around the back alley feeding on rats and trash! Second, Oliver Wood and Quidditch were removed completely, taking away the Quidditch Cup and a part of that \\"happy memory\\" needed for the Patronus, not to mention a lot of people were fans of Wood, and this is supposed to be his third year. And not to be rude, but Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson seriously CANNOT act; their performance is just so pitifully poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this so expensive?","review":"This is not truly a \\"limited edition\\" and can be found just about anywhere online for less. It would be a good price if it was the limited edition, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute disappointment","review":"Let me start by saying this is a very disappointing piece of garbage and it was doomed to be so from the beginning.Now let me explain why,I seriously doubt the person who wrote the script for this movie even read the books.The book itself was completely ignored in the making of this film,and what wasn't ignored was changed for stupid marketing reasons.Although I did not like the movie too much blame cannot be placed on the movie industry. if they had stayed true to the book the movie would have probably been 16 hours long.if they had to leave out that much of the third book, the fourth movie will be even worse.the proper thing to do is quit making these movies and spend more money promoting the books. These books are truly works of art and to see them mutilated by some big conglomerate movie company is really disheartening for the true fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I am so disappointed to see that this is not an extended version of the movie.

No visits from Voldermort is quite the rarity. However after about 1.5hrs it is painful that the plot then turns into Back to the Future meets Groundhog Day. It's a pretty crucial film in terms of the overall series, and there are some pretty big family tree clues for Harry, that are important to know for later on. The Marauder's Map is great fun and it seems like this film is the last edition that Harry and his mates are allowed to be kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality!","review":"Excellent audio and video quality on this DVD! There is only one thing that I do not like about the DVD itself. It starts out playing The Polar Express with Tom Hanks.

What a disappointment! Were the big wigs at WB thinking that their fans would triple dip editions when they bring out all films in one super ultimate collection? I already owned all of the HP on Blu, but sold them when i started buying the Ultimate editions. I will NOT be purchasing 3 and 4. Very poor on WB's part to say its ultimate, and include 8 hours of bonus materials, but not the few extra scenes that regularly show on TV. Very poor indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? No extended?","review":"What is going on where is the extended? That is what makes it so good! How ultimate is it when you get a pritty box that has the same stuff you already bought? Where is the extended edition? Sure we get a couple pictures, cards and books to add to the collection.

Way to milk the masses of there hard earned paycheck."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Extended Version??----No Sale","review":"The Extras are nice....sure. But the reason I bought the first two Ultimate Editions was primarily to own extended editions of the films. Warner Brothers is stating that they asked the directors if they wanted to make directors cuts and they both said no. I find that just idiotic. With all that extra footage....and I hear there is a lot....forget the directors. Have a disc of the original and then just make and extended edition without the directors' inputs. People love extended editions and would pay to see them on this package. Just look at the negativity surrounding the Lord of the Rings release. Many, many people would not buy it because it was not the extended editions. Same thing will apply here. I guarantee this will not sell nearly as well as the first two editions primarily because of the lack of an extended version. When will these companys learn? NO SALE!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waited for Extended Version for Nothing!!!!","review":"First time I saw the first two movies were the extended ultimate editions. Waited for next 2 and was extremely disappointed that they will not be extended. Well I ordered the other 4 movies on regular blu-ray instead of waiting forever to see if next #5 & 6 will be extended. They screwed up like the evil idiots who won't release Lord of the Rings extended on blu-ray until they rape the consumers with theatrical versions. Movie itself wasn't to bad, but I've never read or have the time or inclination to read the books, so extended is nice for background info."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAR FROM HOGWARTS... NEAR TO HOLLYWOOD..","review":"When I watched the movie I had to turn it off half way because I didn't want to ruin my mental image of the book. Only Harry Potter freaks understand that.

I LOVED the 3rd book & for the first time I can honestly say that the book was better then the movie. I did not like the new Dumbledore & the changes made to Hogwarts. I also did not like that the movie didn't touch on some of the important messages in the book nor did it stick to the sequence of when things happened in the book. I think this movie lost alot of substance. Please go back to the old movie making........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Different","review":"I must admit, I haven't read a single Harry Potter book, but I fell in love with the movies.The latest installment to the Harry Potter series was no disappointment. There were plenty of laughs, excitement, and suspense. True, the new director has revamped the old Chris Columbus look of Hogwart's, but it serves the movie well. As the kids grow older, their experiences and emotions are becoming more intense and mature. The film reflects this.The only problem I had with the film was the opening scene involving Harry and his terrible relatives. This segment was shot with practically no close-ups, which robs the viewer of character reactions. The scene could have been a hilarious one, but fell flat...simply because we weren't able to determine facial expressions."},{"rating":"2","title":"different than the former 2 parts","review":"this Harry Potter movie was darker than the others. also very fun to see how they grew up! Hermione is really a girly girl now and it's nice to see that. the only thing that bothered me in the storyline that it is not very clear how close Sirius, Lupus and Harry's father used to be when they were young. Yes, they tell him they were friends, but in the book it is better described how they were at school. that is my only critic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Harry Potter So Far","review":"This is my favorite Harry Potter movie so far. I have made a point to see each movie that has come out. And I think the Prisoner of Azkaban was better - and more scary - that the first two.I also liked the addition of Gary Oldman and David Thewlis to the cast. And I think Michael Gambon does a wonderful job taking his role over from Richard Harris. The only cast member who bothered me was Emma Thompson - she didn't seem to fit it. The minute her character came on the screen I thought \\"Oh, theres Emma Thompson\\" - I came out of the fantasy and into reality.And I think Director Alfonso Cuarón did a wonderful job with his direction.My favorite special effects were The Dementors, who are pretty frightening just in themselves. They are pretty ugly scary creatures, enough to give small children nightmares.But all in all, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite Harry Potter movie so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy, quirky and utterly gorgeous","review":"Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are back as Harry, Ron and Hermoine, with Hermoine in particular getting to do a lot more. There are less Quidditch matches, and more menace, in keeping with the improved complexity of Rowling's third novel. Hogwarts is not safe, Draco Malfoy is no longer a menace, but just a pain in the ass. And the new CGI-scripted character Buckbeak the Hippogriff (half eagle, half horse) looks fantastic and has personality.The kids are all supposed to be thirteen but look older - hey we'll forgive them. Neville Longbottom has lost so much weight he's almost unrecognisable.All in all, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an good movie, as long as you don't compare it to the book or other HP movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is really bad","review":"This film is such a disappointment. There are scenes in it that have no point and apparently they found those scenes more important than Harry finding out that his father, Black, lupin, and Pettigrew made the marauder's map or that Gryffindor finally won the quidditch cup (first time in at least 7 years). This movie blows."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie rocks!! All you purists need to pipe down!","review":"First off this new director is awesome, the acting is incredible, it was like imagination sprung to life! Sure he cut things out, but books like Harry Potter are cinematically impossible to include every flippin' detail. The point is you get the story and you know what the characters are doing and why. Also this DVD will have deleted scenes and behind the scenes too! AND MOST IMPORTANTLY!!! JK ROWLING HERSELF APPROVES EVERYTHING ON THE FILMS AND LOVES THEM!!! IF THE AUTHOR SAYS THEY ARE GOOD THEN NO ONE ELSE SHOULD EVEN CRITICIZE!!!! I myself have been a fan for ages and this film just rocked! OK just had to make that apparent, watch this movie again or for the first time and watch all the DVD extras with open eyes!! Haryy Potter rocks and so does this movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst harry potter there is....","review":"when this movie came out, i thought it would be the best harry potter move there is because the 3rd harry potter book is my favorite harry potter book. Some parts of the book are left out in the movie such as the winning of the qudditich cup and what are the names meant on the maruader's map. even the landscape has changed in the movie. i also do not like the new albus dumbledore because he doesn't seems like a \\"true\\" dumbledore. i was very disappointed but luckily i rented the movie before buying it. this movie will not enjoy true harry potter fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Atmosphere","review":"I did not enjoy this movie compared to the previous Harry Potters. The only thing I liked about it was that the Chracters are older now and I can relate to them. However, I did not like the fact that they were trying to make the movie humerous. It just gave me a different feeling than the previous Harry Potters. They were trying to hard to make the movie funny. Previous Harry Potters had more action and mystery. I did not enjoy the plot. In Previous Harry Potters, Lord Vauldemont was always the center of the problem. He was mentioned in the movie a couple of times, but I just did not enjoy the movie as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter on the big screen at his best!","review":"Yes, it's not the book...what did you expect?This movie portrays the book better than anything could. It brings major entertainment with it, whether you've read the book or not. PoA is my favorite HP movie yet. I liked the first two, they told the story...the end. The third movie tells the story and you feel emotion! I was so missing emotion in the first two. PoA makes you feel so much for Harry...This movie is really great! The actors have matured so much too! The best yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Perspective","review":"I started out being a little disappointed with the film, but as I sat through it with my daughter (who is 25), who had never read this book in the series, I could tell by her reactions that she was not only enthralled, but well able to keep up with the important points of the story. The dementors actually affected her very appropriately, and we're talking about a serious horror genre junkie, here.I loved the new set, and having lived in England at one time, found the darkness, the heaviness of stone, and the dreary light very suitable and realistic. I also found the landscapes and village scenes wonderful as well.Considering the length and complexity of this book, I thought the director did a good job of pressing in the important highlights while still keeping it under 4 hours. That should be more incentive for the disgruntled to go back and read the book again for sheer enjoyment of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking","review":"After watching this movie I was told that I was a purist. This is because I almost hated this movie. I do grant that the movie had gorgeous cinematography in many scenes but that it lacked in the rest. There are even some plot holes in there. The screenplay and/or director made the movie almost incompatable with the rest of the series if you have not read the books. There were some major scenes and facts needed to push the other stories along that didn't make it into the movie and scenes that did make that weren't nearly as important. Overall, I find that it is my love for the stories that allows me to give such a high rating to this movie because I was gravely dissapointed in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Extended version - NO SALE","review":"Total bummer. As a lot of people have said they won't be buying this and any future Ultimate Editions unless the Extended versions of each film are included and I agree with them. The first two HP films I purchased the Ultimate Editions mainly because the Extended Cuts were included along with the theatrical versions. Adding only a documentary is not reason enough to shell out 40 bucks or more for the same movie I already have on blu-ray.The first two Ultimate Editions are truly beautiful sets. The artwork and all the extras really make these collector's items for any fan of this series and I was looking forward to purchasing all the films (again) on blu-ray. However, as much as I'd love to have these now, without the Extended Cuts, makes all the difference.I hope someone at WB with enough clout sees this thread and hopefully some day soon we will be able to purchase THE truly ULTIMATE EDITIONS of ALL of the Harry Potter films."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP!","review":"\\"Ultimate Editions\\" Year 3 and 4. How disappointing.No extended editions.No magnetic clasp.Low quality boxes- flimsy with bits ripped and stubbed.Clearly made much cheaper than the first two. What crap! The first two ultimate editions were awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.","review":"After reading the 3rd book, I was highly anticipating the release of the movie. I'm sorry to say that I was extremely disappointed. Alot of people I know loved this movie, but none of them had read the book. The book was AMAZING! It made the movie look dim. There were alot of main points that occured in the story that were not brought out in this movie. The fact that authors have no say in the way the movie of the book they wrote turns out, is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I just couldn't get myself to be enthusiastic about this movie.The atmosphere was so much less magical than in the first two films, mainly because the main characters wear the same \\"civilian\\" clothes and look dishevelled most of the time, but also because they had to hire a new actor as Professor Dumbledore. Hogwarts will never be the same without Richard Harris :(It also seems the director took the \\"dark film\\" idea literally: there are too many gloomy sets and cloudy skies in this movie.And the special effects - well, I admit I'm spoiled by LoTR, but the creatures just didn't move right (with the exception of the Dementors).I hope so much they'll hire Chris Columbus again to do the next film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"Let me just say this movie almost made me want to cry it was so bad this movie is definitly different then the other two films the first two i enjoyed because they didnt just focus on the plot the plot in the other two was slowly revealed throughout the year whyll still focusing on other things this film does not do that.I remember back before the first movie came out how many people thought it would be really bad and not follow the story and not be like how they pictured the characters well if number 3 had came out first there wouldnt be anymore everything is different in it hogwarts is in a different location hagrids house is now on top of a hill there is no lake there is no forbidden forest. Anything that has nothing to do with the main plot is not in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"First 2 good, 3 not so good","review":"I liked the first two Harry Potter movies, the first was pretty good, and then the second was turned into more of a little kids movie, if the 3ed follows suit then this one will be a little kids movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish that I could put zero stars.","review":"I hate all these films, besides being utterly inconsistent with the book, I question some of the casting. Of course Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were perfectly cast, being joined by Emma Thomson this time around, but I still find the majority of the actors to be highly lacking.Though some argue that it would be impossible to make the movies perfectly in line with the books, there is a large difference between \\"not keeping exact\\" and cuting out major plot elements all together.I have loved the books and read them hundreds of times. Even dispite my love of the Harry Potter world, these books are far from my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAROLD POTTER MOVIES ARE THE WORST EVER!!!","review":"Please,Please,Please Warner Bros Stop making these ridiculous H. Potter movies.They are really terrible and extremely overrated!!! Thumbs up to anyone who rates all of these H. Potter movies with 1 star or less!!! This goes for that stupid movies' part 4 that is out now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISGRACE to the book!","review":"This reviw is written by a 13 year old female Harry Potter fan.I went to see the movie, and came out extremly dissapionted.Alfonso Curon seriously messed the movie up.I have read Prisoner of Askaban at least 4 times and 75 percent of the book was simply left out completely. There were GIANT plot holes, and I do not understand how someone who had not read the book would understand the plot. The first two movies were the best ever. They were funny,intertaining,and gave good justice to the book.Sadly, this movie did not. I could rant FOREVER about all the things I did not like, but I will not. Do not juge the book buy this movie. Go read the book,and you won't be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but not what I expected.","review":"I'm a big Harry Potter fan and have read all of the books 5+ times. I don't know about you, but I like them to stick to the books. Although Alfonso Cuaron's style brought a new look at Harry and his friends and was interesting I can't help being pissed off because Alfonso left out the Quidditch finals (which is the first time Griffindor wins since Harry started school). I also didn't like the way he chopped it to bits. The last big mistake in my eyes was making it so Harry only got the Firebolt in the end of the movie instead of on Christmas like in the book. It was a great movie, but not perfectly true to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Dumbledore- Good movie","review":"By far the darkest Harry Potter yet, the third installment in the fantastic book series doesn't dissapoint in film form. These movies just make me happy. Granted, the new Dumbledore lacked the grace and dignity and mystique that made the first one so powerful... very dissapointing... but the movie was good. I think it may have been better because I read the book and knew the backstory and all the details left out of the movie...My advice: Read the book, then go have fun at the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I'm perhaps one of the biggest Harry Potter fans ever, but that's not the only reason why i absolutely loved this movie. Along with the incredibly witty plot and humor, the viewer also gets a chance to escape reality, and bury themselves in the world of wizardry and magic in Hogwarts. This movie if full of suspense, it's also geared not only to younger viewers, but for more mature viewers as well. I am 14 years old and am in the 8th grade and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. If your worried about the new Dumbledore, don't be. He is an amazing actor. He is a bit more energetic but still maintains the intellect and encouragement that Richard Harris did in the first 2 movies. I can't say enough good things about this movie and I urge everyone to see it as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Believe it....","review":"I used 2 love the Harry Potter books, they were wonderfully made and the characters had their own personalities. But this movie has bad acting, bad special effects, bad directing, bad cinematography, bad sound, bad music, bad sets, etc etc etc............. why do they keep switching directors???? stick with one!!! Peter Jackson should give Alfonso Cuarón some serious lessons in movie-making. Peter Jackson took a beloved epic series, and turned them into a wonderfully-made epic motion picture trilogy. Alfonso Cuarón took a good book and turned it into a horrible disaster of a movie. Not worth seeing or even renting at the library!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the book, this is where the series begins to slip","review":"Cute but getting played, flat, mediocre plot, wait for cable if possible.

Seeing this movie was an incredible disapointment even compared to the other movies that have come out. It strayed immensly from the book and I don't think that they should even attempt to make Goblet of Fire. To make a movie of a book that is so long and so brilliantly written when a decent one cannot be made of a book that is half it's length will crush any avid Harry Poter fan. The attempts to turn the Harry Poter books into box office hits like the Lord of the Rings is futile and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK......VERY BAD DIRECTOR!!!!!!!","review":"ok.......the director for this one.......STINKS!!!!!!!!! There are many things in this movie that make me say WTF! First off, lupin has no grey hair, dumbledore looks feeble because his costume looks like he is wearing a noghtgown, to many missing sceens, and what was with that pedgleum in the great hall! There was nothing about it in the books why add it. Someone could get hit with that thing. The grounds change.....looks good but why would you do that......the grounds are way to differnt! Alfonso Cuaron should NEVER do another Harry Potter movie. He nearly destroyed the story by remaking it in his own image. I going to buy it only so I have all the movies to date.....but it was a sad attemped at a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Brilliant","review":"I say Alfonso Cuarón did a great job. Since the book was a long one Alfonso Cuarón had to cut some things. The Quidditch Cup(Which I thought was a drag) Also, more info on the Harry's parent's deaths(Secret Keeper) But if you haven't read the book you'll say wow! The music was excelent, the knight bus perfect, and Buckbeak and the dementors were outstanding. It didn't follow the book like the first 2 but still, it was bloody brilliant! Well done Alfonso Cuarón!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love HP Disappointed in THIS movie.","review":"I loved the other 2 movies and all the books. I was left cold by this movie though. I was not the fault of the story or the actors. The direction was fair and whoever edited this movie obviously is not familiar with the books. It felt choppy and bumpy. Several important scenes and relevant information were left out. I can only hope the dvd will be an extended version. If nor, I won't be buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definetly a different potter","review":"I have to admit,when I saw Prisoner of Azkaban i was quite suprised. I was expecting a movie similiar to the other two films. I have to give the new director credit about giving the movie a new twist and sticking to the dark themes. i was disapointed about missing or skiming on some details (i.e. Aunt marge, and the Maudermers map). It was an entertaining film and I hope that the rest of the films, (and Books) keep on the same entertaining path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Review","review":"I enjoyed watching this movie. The plot was easy to follow so you could understand it even if you didn't read the book. The one complaint that I have about the movie is that it was a little fast in the beginning but it was overall good. If you liked reading the book then you will enjoy the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New, standard versions at ultimate price","review":"I purchased Years 1 and 2 and enjoyed the extended versions with the deleted material put back in to the movies. Years 3 and 4 are just the standard versions already released but at a much higher price. The deleted portions are added, just like the standard version on a separate disk but not in context, they should have been assembled into the movie.Save your money and get the standard versions as this is just a WB rip off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I remembered","review":"I haven't read any of the books, and I saw this movie years ago when it came out, but recently watched it again with the family. It was better than I remembered. The story, acting, scenery, special effects, etc. are all quite good, so we all enjoyed the movie. I just don't care for the darker mood of the movie as compared to the brighter original, and there's nothing particularly \\"deep\\" here. There's also a time travel aspect of the story which generates the usual logical contradictions, but it's handled smoothly enough that the contradictions can be ignored. So I'll go with 4 stars rather 5, though I can still recommend it to people interested in a fantasy action movie which has some scary elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR","review":"I thought I was getting an excellent price on this DVD and as soon as me and my daughter finished the book we couldn't wait to watch the movie. When I put the DVD in it did not work. When I took it out and looked at it, it was a blank DVD with nothing on it. Very dissapointing. Amazon refunded my money and then I bought the DVD through Amazon for about $4 more dollars and there wasn't any problem. BEWARE of this!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good edition","review":"I bought this because I know digital is the future and I'm tired of storing DVD's. I'm also tired of people 'borrowing' them and they come back damaged causing me to buy new ones. I don't like the fact that I can't get the last two and keep them on Amazon. Something about them not being available after 12-29-11. The movie studio is creating artificial scarcity which will cause people to stop watching them or pirate them. I stopped consuming anything Disney for this reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the deleted scenes?","review":"I purchased the two-disc Special Edition version of this film. Amazon states on their website that it contains deleted scenes. Am I missing something here? Because I can't find any deleted scenes. Are they on the ultimate editions? If anyone could help me, I would really appreciate it! Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad...","review":"I obviously have a different views than many others that reviewed this DVD. I acknowledge that it did not follow exactly to the plot of the book, but i still found it entertaining. i was not angry that it did not follow the exact plot, because i can still see this as a harry potter movie. however, this did not have a sufficeint(sp?) helping of one of the things i love about the Harry Potter books and movies. It lacked the day to day hogwarts enviroment and flavor that JKR developed so masterfully. that was one of my favorite things about these books and movies. It was still a good movie, and i plan to add it to my collection.P.S.- the reveiwer a few down was correct, Dumbledore's fill in was not as wise looking as the old one. He just didn;t have that \\"wizard\\" feel to him"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What the Book Says!","review":"I didn't like this movie at all, and if I could give it zero stars I would. Here's why:1. Don't buy DvD or Vhs scences will be missing. (lots of them)2. They take out so much stuff from the book. It dosen't even have the same ending. I think they could have made it thrity minutes more with important stuff like ROn getting his owl.3. This guy must not even know who J.K. Rowling is or what Harry Potter is! They don't have any of the stuff the book says would be in the candy shop, but we do get some unneeded things.He has the Actors and Actoresses wear the normal every day stuff.4. They add so many un wanted or needed stuff it's sick.So if you read the book you'll have more info of what should have been in the movie. Saddly all Harry Potter fans will just have to have a movie in their heads and hope for a remake, and if you just want to see a good movie get the first two movies or go see the fourth movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing movie - Great acting by Radcliffe and Rickman.","review":"I am a big Harry Potter fan. I've read all the books and I've seen this and the other two films. I knew what was going to happen of course, but my friends who came along with me did not. I've seen the movie with four different people who hadn't read the books, and none of them understood the movie. I had to explain it twice. Personally, I thought it far better than the first two, but it cut way too much out and did not tell enough backstory. As for acting, I thought Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job. He was dead on - his anger in spots gave me the chills. I also thought Alan Rickman was awesome. His voice, his expressions, he IS Snape. The Shrieking Shack scene just proves it. I was also surprised by David Thewlis as Remus Lupin - He was not how I pictured Lupin at all, but he played the part wonderfully. It is a great movie and I suggest seeing it, especially if you have read the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it was a good movie, but Alfonso left some stuff out","review":"I saw the movie about a week after it came out, and I was somewhat pleased about the movie, but I realized something once it got to the middle of the movie: um, Alfonso you left a LOT out! I mean, you left out Cho Chang, Gryffindor winning the Quidditch Cup, and many other things. I don't think that he should \\"leave some room for creative expression\\". It isn't his movie to do whatever he wants with it, hello!, it's HARRY POTTER! You are supposed to stick with the book! No wonder it didn't break a box office record like the first two! I'm just glad Chris Columbus is directing The Goblet of Fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will wait until WB releases extended versions","review":"After purchasing the ultimate editions for the first two films, I eagerly anticipated a release of a true ultimate edition for the next two films. I am completely disappointed to find that films 3 and 4 are minus the extended versions without which they are not \\"ultimate\\".I will wait for the negative fallout to encourage WB to release ultimate editions with the extended versions of the 3rd and 4th films. I would hope that people who already bought these films will be given vouchers to receive the updated ultimate editions free of charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"No extended scenes make package disappointing.","review":"A very short review. As a loyal fan, I've seen documentaries, read bios, looked at stills, seen the films repeatedly, read the books, read reviews, and so when the Ultimate Editions were announced I thought I would probably get them but what new information could it provide to me? I was plesantly surprised with Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets as they added deleted scenes to the film that allowed for viewing of an extended versions, which in some cases made the film flow better like the book. However, something went amiss in the release of Azkaban as there is no extended version on this Ultimate Edition. Very disappointed. I will still acquire these collections but I will not pay for them. At least I have something for gift lists when I'm asked what I may like to have given to me. Simply, don't waste your own money for stuff you've seen before. The pretty box and booklet are only worth other people wasting their money for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The magic continues!","review":"Harry Potter and friends continue their magical journey at Hogwarts while bedeviled by Harry's old enemy - or is he?

A new teacher in Hogwarts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potter as Excellent as ever!!","review":"In many cases as movies get deeper and deeper into their sequels, they get worse and worse. Not with Harry Potter! This is the best one yet although they all deserve 4 stars. This movie is darker and it is definetly not for children under the age of 10. This is primarily because the plot is darker and more complex. Younger audience members will not understand. The main cast, Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint do an outstanding job. Dan hopefully will receive some kind of academy award nomination for his outstanding work. If you are waiting to see the best picture of 2004, wait no more.

I wasn't a huge fan but made me consider buying the other released movies soon !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, Drab, Disappointing","review":"Alfonso Cuaron has made a drab and disappointing film. Here is a classic example of a director mucking up a perfectly fine story. While of course it isn't possible to put every nuance of these books onscreen, Chris Columbus did a fine job with the first two. In this one, Cuaron reshuffled the Hogwarts grounds layout for no reason, ignored most of the secondary storylines even when they were extremely important to the story as a whole, failed to develop the new characters, and apparently told the actors to walk through their parts. After the first two wonderful Harry Potter movies, this was a big let-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap packaging and no extended cut!","review":"Unlike the Ultimate Editions for the first 2 films, this just contains the exact same version of the film as the other editions of this movie. Sure it has some great extra docs, but after creating ultimate editions that include extended editions of the film with the great docs, this is a total let down and a rip off for the price. You should just be able to buy the extra documentaries for a much lower price since anyone who is buying this already has the film on blu-ray.After this debacle I will not purchasing any more ultimate editions, and these, unlike the first 2 films are not ultimate editions at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO EXTENDED versions!?!","review":"I as well am very disappointed that this and the 4th do not have extended editions of the movie. that is the ONLY reason that I bought the 1st and 2nd ultimate editions.

They don't contain the extended versions of the movie... just a bunch of silly cards and a mildly-amusing booklet with some stills. There's a couple \\"bonus discs\\" of extra content but all of the content could easily have fit on one extra disc... with room to spare.No director's commentary, no real effort was put into this. Even the \\"Marauder's Map\\" screen saver is just a twitty little add-on that your kid could do in about 10 minutes... just advertising for the film and a few stills.I was quite stoked about these editions but now that I have them, I'm wondering why I bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring Back Chris Columbus","review":"What a disapointment. I already read the books and saw the first two movies multiple times. The third was horrific. It did not even closley resemble anything in the first two (colors, buildings, even the fat lady changed. WHY?). Additionally they mixed up the sequence of the book and honestly had you not read the book, you would have been terribly confused because a lot of detail was lost. Now no one can say that there was no time because the scene with Harry on the Hippograph was what...2 minutes...and he didn't even like his ride on it to begin with. The last scene with Harry flying in the air on his broom was out of sequence with the book and really innapropriate for Harry's character. Flying off - showing off in front of anyone when not in a game is just not in his character. They focused too much on fluff and visual effects and not nearly enough on dialogue - please stick to the book in the fourth one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did this guy do?","review":"This movie was dismal. Hogwarts is not magical anymore, its dark and creepy. There is a huge hillside down to Hagrids that i found really annoying. The plot is gone and the busride with the wierd head is stupid. Why on earth did this cuaron take Columbus's wonderful vison of hogwarts found in 1 and 2 and trash it with a clock, bridge and a hillside. I want Columbus back, be true to the books or stay away from these movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I MUST AGREE - BRING BACK CHRIS COLUMBUS!","review":"I am disappointed for all the reasons cited by the reviewers who aren't terribly fond of this version of Book 3; too dark, too short, too little plot elaboration, too little humor.

What I got was a poorly constructed episode of \\"Buffy.\\" Bah humbug!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of fun, spookiness, and Potter quirkiness","review":"This movie captured the many striking elements of the book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. As the book represented a sort of turning point for the Potter series, so does the film. Keep in mind that this vision of the novel--for it's not a rote, verbatim adaptation, and is in line with Rowling's wishes--is Alfonso Cuaron's. He owns this film, and he brings out the tension and excitement from the young stars in a way that makes the characters seem real.It's by turns hilarious, poignant, nerve-wracking (even when I already knew the plot!), frightening, and non-stop. A great flick, fun for any age. Also it has John Williams' best score in many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageous!!","review":"The seven part series of not only the book but the movie is outrageous!!

I did like it for what it was,and that really was'nt very much, too much of the book was left out, but I've read the book and the movie leaves me wanting more. Just not enough time to make the movie half as good as the other 2 movies were.

The story is good, the performances are better, the f/x are great, and overall its a fun movie. They could have used a better quidditch match, and the ending could use a little more adventure, it was too short. Buckbeak and the werewolf are the best. 8 out of a 10.

I guess he has the comedy spark, but the action spark ( retching ). And the dementors are a complete ripoff of Peter Jackson's wonderful Nazgul design. I was excited when Film One came out. What a stinker. I went to see Film Two only because some friends wanted to see it. A little better than Film One, but I think they used the effects for Aragog that Jackson for Shelob. And I almost wrote Aragorn, Aragorn and Aragog sound so much alike. All in all on a scale of one to ten I give this a 0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read all the Harry Potter books and saw the first two movies. I was really looking forward to this movie. The acting was fine (the \\"kids\\" are getting better) and the animation and special effects were great. However, if you hadn't read the book, you'd be totally lost. The plot kept jumping around with no explanation of how they got from one place to another. I got the impression that Cuarón was trying to fit everything in but didn't have enough time so he just jumped from one scene to the next with no tie-in. My husband has not read the books. Although he watched both previous movies and was looking forward to this one, he walked out within the first half hour because he found it so confusing and, thus, unenjoyable. This movie was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"As a huge Harry Potter fan, and having really enjoyed the first two movies, I was very eager to see 'The Prisoner of Azkaban', and now I wish I had rented it and saved my money. There is almost no character development, and Hogwarts now looks as if it is a ruin. But perhaps worst of all it is a poorly constructed movie. My husband, who has not read the books, but thoroughly enjoyed the first two movies, was completely lost in this one. Scenes change quickly, frequently with no explanation, and while this is not a serious problem if you have read the book, for others it makes for a choppy, disjointed mess. Let's hope that if they make the fourth movie, they'll change directors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creativity and Directors","review":"You have to read the book AND see the movie. They are different.

It just happened to coincide with a visit to Chicago.However, there were a lot of things in \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" that didn't make sense to me, that is, until I watched this movie the followed day on cable.I highly recommend watching the movies in order, especially if you haven't read the books, because I had a lot of unanswered questions and didn't understand how things fit together. Also, watching \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" first, ruined some of the suspense and mystery in \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter 3","review":"I went and saw this movie in the theaters and was rather disappointed. I know that the old Albus had died and I couldn't change that, but they could have made the new one look more like the old Albus. I was also disappointed in how they didn't stay with the same castle grounds as in the first and second movies. It's very obvious. I also thought that lupin didn't look like he was suposed to and sirius looked too old. When I started watching the movie more and now I think they did a good job casting, but I still feel strongly about my first two concerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I believe that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a pretty good movie. It's not a great Harry Potter Movie but in General it is a great movie overall.1. The Acting is pretty well done2.It has beautiful camera shots3.It is well directed despite not following the book.4.It is growing up with the generation who first read the book.It is much more dark and I think that that was a good idea on the part of the director because when the series started the kids that were reading were about 8 and on. When the movie came out in 2001 the kids were older. Now at about 16 and up we expect more maturity from the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Made","review":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is one of the worst films made.

In those 24 months, it was a constant struggle, waiting for things to load, for it to \\"Start Up\\" 100 processes, just to say that the Page File was full. Windows ran horribly on it, the DVD/CD combo drive dies without warning, the battery life is short, it had to be run almost constantly on power.From day one, the speakers were extremely tinny, and rattled. The only solution to that was listening with headphones or buying external speakers. So, 26 months after buying a new laptop, I vowed never to purchase a Toshiba computer again (That goes for Toshiba TV's too, they are also horribly made), and I had to dump a load of money into another brand I will not mention for fear of jinxing it.Do not buy any laptop in the Toshiba Satellite line.

If you're looking for a primary textbook, you might be looking for something different, but for a reference to the concepts it's short and sweet: eg. what are canonical transformations, why are they defined the way they are and what is their importance.What's particularly mind-blowing is the 5 page discussion of field momentum. That's the qA term in the hamiltonian for a charge q in a magnetic field (vector potential A). This form of the hamiltonian always puzzled me: Calkin explains the meaning of the qA term beautifully. The book is worth getting for this alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great romance and a fun mystery...","review":"The back of the book says:With a resolve as cold as steel and a thirst for vengeance, U.S. marshal-turned-Confidential-agent Conrad Burke tracked his quarry like a Wild West hero of old.

Marilyn Langworthy, billionaire's daughter- and after one reckless night, mother of Con's unborn child.His quest placed her in jeopardy. But although the mobster he sought took no prisoners, only Marilyn had the key to bring the man down.

I'm passing it on to a family member who liked it.The velcro-secured cover also gets caught in my hair and gets in my way when I am in a hurry. It doesn't prevent me from accidentally pushing buttons on the phone, but that may just be my fault.

It does not dissapoint on any level. You've got some hits, some lesser known tracks and of course, the epics. That sounds like a good Maiden album to me. There are some lesser moments, but nothing that really drags this one down. For me, the finest moments are the opening and closing tracks. Rime of the Ancient Mariner is the kind of long song that really does not feel like its draging on, while Aces High is a moderatly quick burst of awesome metal. You may want to check it out, for it it not a perfect record, but it is easy to get into. Powerslave is really a fantastic record. Check it out for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerslave, lives up to its name!","review":"Powerslave was another massive hit after Iron Maiden's 1983 album \\"Piece of mind\\", but i liked Piece of mind better than powerslave.

If you are starting out with maiden this is definitely your best bet.The guitar solo in two minutes to midnight is probably one of my favourite maiden solos for the simple reason that it doesn't have too many trills.Every song on this album is amazing. It doesn't have a single filler. My personal favourites are \\"aces high\\",\\"two minutes to midnight\\",\\"rime of the ancient marine\\"r and \\"back in the village\\".Dickinson's \\"air raid siren\\" vocals are at a all time high on \\"aces high\\".If you wanna know why Iron Maiden is still one of the greatest bands ever in the history of heavy metal, Powerslave is one of the reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Maiden's Best","review":"It is no wonder that Powerslave is considered by many to be Maiden's greatest album as it contains 4 of Maiden's classics and overall is worthy of being called a masterpiece.Aces High - 10/102 Minutes to Midnight - 9/10Lobsfer Words (Big 'Orra) - 8.5/10Flash of the Blade - 8.5/10The Duelists - 7/10Back in the Village - 8/10Powerslave - 9/10Rime of the Ancient Mariner - 10/10I highly recommend buying this album.

Then one day when I was browsing the music titles at my local Wal-Mart, something strange came over me. I picked up the Iron Maiden CD \\"Powerslave\\" and decided to give it a try. After listening to it in its entirety on my car stereo, I was shocked. The music was unsurprisingly wild, but the lyrics were intelligent, the lead guitar solos intricate, and the bass playing galloped strongly and steadily. The downside to \\"Powerslave\\" is most of the songs are similar in style. But songs like \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\\" \\"Minutes to Midnight,\\" and \\"Losfer Words\\" make \\"Powerslave\\" a worthy buy and Iron Maiden and I an odd couple."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Glory of 84'!!!!!","review":"In my opinion the defining moment of metal in the 80s.Yes there certainly are a number of great bands from that era of metal but I believe Maiden not only peaked as a band on this effort but topped the genre.This is an immaculate product for that time,way ahead of its time and still to this day as good,if not better than anything that has followed by any hard rock or metal band.Musically precise and artistically genius.Need I mention Dickinson's vocal performance on this effort.A flawless 5 Star across the board.Call me nostalgic but when this was first released in 84'I purchased it on audio cassette and knew at that time that history was made...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album!","review":"One of my top 10 favorite rock albums.

THE DUELLIST & BACK IN THE VILLAGE , great cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Maiden Album","review":"Another Maiden album that is part of a whole line of albums that most consider \\"classics.\\" Relentless touring for this album made Iron Maiden much bigger than they were before, especially in America. \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\" is arguably Maiden's best known song. \\"Aces High\\" is one of my favorite of Maiden's shorter songs, with great vocals and guitar solo. The title track is one of the greatest mini-epics that Iron Maiden has written (along with \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\"). I wish Maiden had done more songs with an actual riff; the Egyptian themed riff is awesome, and the guitar solo section in the middle is one of their better interludes. \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" is based on the epic poem of the same name, except, unlike the poem, this song is actually interesting. This is probably one of Iron Maiden's more accessible albums, making this a great album to get into their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"PUT YOUR BALLS TO THE WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Seems like short reviews on this one. Amazon doesn't even list the tracks... doesn't matter. By far the heaviest MAIDEN around, F'in ROCKS!!!!!! Don't F around... do yourself a favor and purchase this mother F'er, or go take a piss sittin' down!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best In my opinion,but very good!","review":"Most people consider this to be maidens best.It is very good if you can ignore back in the village and the duelist.I dont care for either of those tracks.The rest of the album is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd!!!","review":"I love iron maiden and no one's collection will be complete if you don't own this. It's a great cd and I have no intention in ever throwing it out. There is not one bad song on it, so that means this album is one of my favorites. I really would have givin this ten stars if I could. I recomend this to anyone who is an iron maiden fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALBATR0SS!!!","review":"The fact that Bruce says ''Albatross'' a couple of times during ''...Ancient Mariner'' is worth the price and the reason this album is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maiden's finest!","review":"it's open for debate, but it seems like a common opinion among fans that Powerslave stands as Iron Maiden's best album; and i'd have to agree. the band sounds tighter, the songs punchier, and Bruce's vocal performance is nothing short of flawless. every song is a classic and the Egyptian Pharoah Eddie is the best variation of the grisly mascot yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully fun operetta with fabulous music and singing","review":"This is a true gem. The strong cast brings Strauss' comic operetta to life. Especially noteworthy are Lucia Popp as a savvy yet vulnerable Rosalinde and Eva Lind as the ambitious Adele. Placido Domingo does double duty by directing the orchestra as well as playing the role of Alfred, the lovelorn singer out to win Roselinda's heart. And Anges Balsta does a convincing job as the bored Prince Orlofsky.The music flows beautifully in this recording and the singing is wonderful. Particularly touching is track three on disk two, where Peter Seiffert and Lucia Popp step out of character and perform a love duet from \\"Der Zigeunerbaron\\" (Wer uns getraut, ei sprich...). This number in and of itself is worth buying this CD. Also lovely is the finale to Act I and the long, yet totally entertaining dialog piece at the beginning of Act II. The drunk jail keeper is a scream!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Own CD","review":"This CD is one of the best ones i know from the operetta die fledermaus because Placido Domingo and Lucia Popp sing in this operetta by strauss jr. I really love this CD and recomend it to anyone who loves the operetta die fledermaus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of the Aloha Spirit! Good viewing for the young and young-at-heart","review":"I've recently stated taking Hawaiian hula lessons and just love it, so I went on the lookout for any information I could find on this awesome dance and found this video. It's a lot of fun to watch and dance with. While it is no way replaces actual live in person classes, it is a good start. I highly recommend the extra features. Very informative and entertaining. So if you want to get a start with hula, I'd say get this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is amazing","review":"Ok, so it's a little more mellow than your Highway to Hell or your Powerage, but this album just rocks. There are only two songs I don't like and they both come close to the end. Safe in New York City is their best song since Thunderstruck. Stiff Upper Lip improves on Ballbreaker. It has a similar sound. AC/DC sounds a bit different now, but I love it just as much as their old stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, Okay!","review":"Two stars 'cos it's an Ac/Dc album. If any other band had recorded Stiff Upper Lip, i would've given it the full five stars! I've been tryin' to discover what makes this album worse than the others, i still son't know. It's just that there's no variation in the songs, no energy. Somethin's missin'. But anyway, you can't stop 'em!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ac/dc-stiff upper lip","review":"This record is same old, same old. The need a drummer that can play a second beat. Time to retire boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same sh** ...different day!","review":"Haven't these guys heard the phrase,\\"quit while you're ahead! \\" Boring, boring, boring. They obviously ran out of lyrics after the first verse in the first song! I play there music with my band every weekend, but none of these tunes will find there way into our set list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring rock","review":"This is by far the worst cd from anti christ-devil\`s child.To say that this cd blows is a gross understatement.I cannot believe all the clone reviews out there.5 stars,are you out of your(mind),i use the term mind losely."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Hurts Me To Say This But...","review":"This album sucks bad. I love AC/DC but this is lame. The songs are dull, uninspired and VERY forgettable. Satellite Blues and Safe In NYC are ok, but the rest of them are just plain bad. I think the biggest problem is more than likely that Brian Johnson doesn't take any part in the songwriting and it shows. Angus and Malcom are good songwriters, but the best post-Bon Scott era AC/DC songs have always been written by Angus, Malcom AND Brian."},{"rating":"2","title":"AC/DC is the best rock and roll band!!","review":"I have read some of the other reviews on Amazon for Stiff Upper Lip, and the ones that complain that Brian Johnson's voice isn't as pumped anymore are absolutely nuts. Brian's voice just gets better and better. If you want a smooth, pop voice listen to the Back Street Boys. A true rock fan can appreciate Brian's sound. I was fortunate enough to catch AC/DC's show in Memphis, Tennessee and they rocked the Pyramid! Stiff Upper Lip is an awesome mix of rock and blues. AC/DC's sound is repetitive, but isn't this what we LOVE about them? When you do something right, don't change it! And I hope that these guys don't stop making their hard-driving, heart-pounding style of rock and roll for a long, long, long, time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best","review":"Overall, a great CD, although two songs...\\"Safe in NYC\\" and \\"House of Jazz\\" are not that great. Back in Black and Highway are their top 2, this one is definitely #3. A good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No surprises...unfortunately","review":"Like many people I can practically trace my identity to AC/DC. I came of age in the late 70s and early 80s buying up every album I could lay my hands on. In my opinion, there has never been a better front man in the history of rock and roll than Bon Scott. But the boys really came back strong with Back In Black, and followed it well with For Those About To Rock. In the 19 years since the latter album, they have recorded about three songs that are worth a damn, and it kills me to say that this new effort doesn't improve upon that track record at all. I will be first in line to see them live, but I hope they stick to the great old stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was doubtful...and then it happened","review":"This is the best AC/DC album since Back in Black. Listen to the layers of guitars. Listen to the band working as one. This is the best rock album front to back that has come out since ??.Crank it. I gurantee it will get your rocks off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda dull.","review":"AC/DC is one of the best bands of all times, but there just getting little old. They cant rock like they used too. At least there making money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible album","review":"everysong on this album is brutally bad.agnus young's guitar still sounds great but brian johnson's vocal's on this cd is horrific.is this really the same guy who sang vocals on back in black?the song stiff upper lip is the lamest song i ever heard ac/dc performed.if this is the best material they can produced,then maybe it's time they called it a career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiff Upper Lip","review":"I mainly bought this album because I was going to see them on this tour. In fact the gig I was at was the opening show on the tour. Again, the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again. I find most of this album to be very average. Actually after listening, this album is not very good at all. The majority of the songs are cliché ridden in both music and lyrics. There are a couple of catchy tracks most notably \\"Safe In New York City\\" which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic. Probably one of the bands weakest efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, its getting Hot, Hot!","review":"Since Back in Black and For Those about to Rock came out, I never thought they'd be equalled. Well, this record doesn't get there, but gets damn close! Is there anything like an Angus Young guitar solo? No, not even close! I've only played this one 7 times since Friday....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still The Good Ol' Rock -N- Roll Music","review":"There is no doubt that AC/DC is the greatest Heavy Metal band in the world, and STIFF UPPER LIP sure proves it. The title crack is just awsome. I could listen to the album forever and never get tired of it. It just rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical AC/DC album of recent years...it's that bad.","review":"AC/DC seem to have made a career out of naming their albums after cliches. Razor's Edge, Back In Black, Fly on the Wall. Now we have Stiff Upper Lip and the music is just atrocious. This is an example of a once great band that has outlived their usefullness. Angus Young just doesn't look right in that school boy outfit now that he is in his fourties. As for his riffs on this release, well, nothing you haven't heard on every other AC/DC release. If there next release has the title of a tired cliche lets hope it's called \\"Throw In The Towel\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"ACDC are now completly dead","review":"I don't have a problem with ac/dc, (Except that Brian Johnston can't sing worth a damn), they have a cool sound, but this album is old, They need some new material. They WERE a great band in the Bon Scott days, and even Back in Black was great, but they're getting old, and should give it up pretty soon, or at least experiment a bit. I sure hope they get back to Back in Black fourm."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah blah blah","review":"Feeble attempt to reclaim their 80s notariety. It is obvious that the band has not progressed to meet the changing tastes of modern society. In fact, it seems they have regressed. You can only take so much of the same old stuff. Be sure to have your finger on the skip button before you sit down to listen to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop It Already!","review":"Ac/Dc was popular in the 70's and 80's.When people wore tight pants and listened to two bands with music for the brain dead.The music was rock.The bands?Metallica and AC/DC.The songs are about....what? can somebody answer that?

At least that's what it seems. Everything sounds like we heard it somewhere before. There are some good songs on the album however, but not enough to give it more than 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I disagree with EVERYBODY here!","review":"I've been listening to AC/DC for over 20 years.The songs on this particular album offer none of the uniqueness that makes any song a hit.I agree only with the fact that the sound of this CD is ac/dc, but the songs are way too dry and bland.Their previous CD was only slightly better than this one.If you want a good ac/dc album, try these more distinctive flavors of post Bon Scott ac/dc:Back in BlackThe Razor's Edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Old","review":"I listened to this album for about 2 minutes and couldn't take anymore.All of the members in Ac/Dc is over forty years-old.Back In Black was bettter.All the songs on this album sound the same,start the same,and end the same.AC/DC IZ DEAD.Hell,Even Notorious BIG's Album is better and half the songs aren't completed."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP !","review":"I have had enough of AC/DC.As a matter of fact, I have had enough of all rock music.I had to listen to this CD two times over,so i know what it sounds like.\\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" is a senseless song,as with all AC/DC songs,ever since \\"She Got Balls\\" from the \\"High Voltage\\" Cd.And,all of the songs start out with the same sound,like they are scared to try something different.Brian Johnson can't sing,and the Angus brothers have really bad songwriting abilities.AC/DC NEEDS TO QUIT."},{"rating":"2","title":"AC/DC IS BACK WITH A STIFF UPPER LIP!","review":"THE NEW AC/DC SOUNDS A BIT DIFFERENT THAN THIER OLDER MUSIC BUT IS STILL KEEPIN' IT REAL! ONE OF THEIR BEST CD'S HAS JUST ARRIVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps their worst ever","review":"As an avid AC/DC and owner of every one of their US/domestic albums (except Who Made Who), this is, in my opinion, the weakest and worst album produced. It is extremely slow, lacks energy, and sounda like it was written and recorded during a weekend session. I ask all AC/DC fans: what album is worse than SUL? I give it 2 stars only becuase of the title song, the NY song, and their previous accomplishments."},{"rating":"1","title":"No imagination","review":"AC/DC is no doubt one of the best rock bands of all time, but they are not growing as musicians. Sure, they can rock like they used too, but they seem to be out of ideas. The well is dry. Put out a anthology already!!! At least my favorite band Deep Purple keep coming up with good stuff, and with imagination! The fact that Purple's music continues to fascinate as well as puzzle after all this time is evidence we are dealing with art of the highest caliber.Anyway, better luck next time Angus & Co.Stiff Upper Lip~ AC/DC : 2 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to have em back!","review":"I should start this review by saying that the first rock'n'roll record (yes record, I'm that old) that I ever bought was Back In Black, so that's my point of reference for AC/DC. Ultimately I've been disappointed with every album since then because fair or not, I'm always waiting for Back In Black II. That being said this is a very strong album. \\"Meltdown\\", \\"Hold Me Back\\", \\"Can't Stand Still\\" and \\"Satellite Blues\\" are classic AC/DC. The tempo in some of the songs is rather slow and I wish they would pick it up and rock a little more. The bottom line is that if you are already a fan of the band you should have this album, if you're new to the band, check out all of their material with Bon Scott and Back In Black before moving on to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is another good one","review":"I can describe AC/DC's music with one word -- unpretentious. There's no attempt at a profound statement. No whining. No sappiness. If you're looking for those three, look somewhere else. This is just honest hard-driving blue collar rock. Now add some blues and you get a great blend. Angus Young's sizzling solos once again highlight this album. Malcolm is as solid as ever. Brian Johnson's vocals gritty vocals provide a perfect balance. Phil Rudd returns on drums, and Cliff Williams on bass. No wonder I keep going back to this group. This album needs to be accompanied by a Cooper's Pale and a meat pie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ac/dc 17 albums that all sound the same","review":"I like Ac/Dc as much as the next guy but come on. Everyone of these songs sound similiar. Same bass line, same drum beat played at different tempos, Angus Young playing his \\"look at me solos\\", and above it all,tone deaf Brian Johnson croaking out asinine lyrics and repeating the song titles 20 times.This album sounds like the unused material from Ballbreaker only worse. Ac/Dc used to be fresh and original back in the 70's and early 80's, but now they just need to give it up, or at least put out an all instrumential album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A late 90s flop from AC/DC","review":"I remember this CD coming out around 1999, and at that time I thought it was the worst album AC/DC ever made. Now it is seven years later and I still think the same thing. AC/DC sounds burnt out and over the hill, as if they've ran out of good material, and are now just putting out a bunch of half @ssed filler to keep the royalties coming in. The music is boring, and the lyrics are dumb: \\"I keep a stiff upper lip\\", and then they rhyme that with \\"I shoot from the hip\\". How much thought would it take to come up with a song like that? It sounds like AC/DC just threw this half @ssed garbage together in a couple of days! \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" is a perfect example of an old band that used to be good, but is now past their prime and has lost their edge. It's hard to believe this is the same band that brought us such classics as \\"Highway to Hell\\" and \\"Back in Black\\". They've really gone downhill in the last 10 to 15 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEIR BEST ALBUM SINCE \\"BACK IN BLACK \\" ?? !!!!","review":"Uau, people say this is their best album since \\"BACK IN BLACK\\". Há, Há, Há !! What about \\"FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK\\" ? Even \\"THE RAZORS EDGE \\" ??!! DOn't buy this album based on the good reviews below. I love AC/DC, but it's clear that Malcolm and his pals released this CD only for the paycheck. Johnson can't even scream anymore, Phil Rudd seem to be playing his drums while he's sleeping; Cliff Williams's bass is even more low than other albuns. THis CD is one of the worst AC/DC albuns ever. it's worser than BALLBREAKER."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION:Extreme Low Voltage!","review":"please follow this warning and disconnect this cd immediately! this is the worst album by ac/dc to date.a full refund should be given to anyone ,who was foolish enough to buy it.plus a little something extra for pain and suffering!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"AC/DC will sell this album simply by having the AC/DC logo on it, which is sad. maybe they keep remaking Back in Black every two-eight years becasue no one calls it what it is. AC/DC needs some critisism to make some good music other then another rehash of back in black riffs/sound with different lamer lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT KIND ???","review":"What kind of AC/DC fan can say this album is great?? AC/DC is a legendary band, I love it, one can't rip scorn at their work, never !!! But that doesn't mean you should close your eyes to the truth. This album is crap. It has nothing to do with the \\"BON COTT TIME VERSUS BRIAN JOHNSON TIME\\". No, both have their merits The fact is: the first second Johnson starts to sing, he ruined the whole album. The once great singer from BACK IN BLACK and FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK just can't sing no more (or even scream). His voice is so atrocious nowadays that even die-hard fans like myself can't stand the whole album listening to it. Ohter than this, drummer Phil Rudd is his more lacklustre performance ever, no punch at all. (which was a surprise to me, giving his astonishing live performance in the video \\"NO BULL\\", recorded in the \\"BALLBREAKER\\" tour). The Youngs guitar are still fierce and creating good rock / blues tunes. But Johnson really destroys it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"These old guys still got it.","review":"Well what can I say, it's by far the best album since Flick of the switch. From the loud riffs to the even louder solos, it shows that even though they are getting on a bit they still rock better than all this so called rock today.ROCK ON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good album","review":"This may not be AC/DC's best, but the first half the album is fantastic. The second half not as good, but not bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best album, but still great....","review":"While some may say this a filler album, I disagree. Sure, it isn't as good as Back In Black, Powerage, Highway To Hell, and other older albums, but this is one of the best albums AC/DC has put out in awhile. That being said, this album is VERY different from the last few. The album is a lot more bluesy than past albums. \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\"(one of AC/DC's best songs EVER!), \\"Meltdown\\", \\"Hold Me Back\\", \\"Safe In New York City\\"(the chorus does get a bit annoying), \\"Satellite Blues\\", and \\"Give It Up\\" are all great songs. If your a casual fan, get the 70s and 80s stuff first, but this is a must have for the hardcore AC/DC fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD!","review":"This is a good album from AC/DC, though not one of their best it has some good songs and is worth buying to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"As usual, AC/DC doesn't disapoint with Stiff Upper Lip. Strong, blues driven rock from the opening title track to the final track \\"Give it Up\\". The one thing that I can always enjoy about AC/DC is that when you buy an album from them, you know exactly what you're going to get. No worrying about whether Malcolm or Angus are going through a blue period or whether they're feeling a little EMO this week. No, no, no...once again songs are driven by the indulgences of life (women, drugs, booze, fighting and good ole' Rock and Roll).My personal favorite tracks are \\"House of Jazz\\", \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\", \\"Safe in New York City\\", \\"Can't Stand Still\\" and \\"Meltdown\\". This album doesn't have a feel like any other AC/DC album but it's the standard you would expect from AC/DC lyric and vibe wise.BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT DOESN'T HAVE THE HITS LIKE BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA","review":"WHAT IS EVERYONE SAYING? Just say its good. Of course it doesn't have Shook me all night Long, or TNT, or Highway to HELL. Those are on other albums... If you happen to be looking for those songs, I hear ya, those songs f*ckin ROCK, they can be found on BACK IN BLACK, HIGH VOLTAGE, and HIGHWAY TO HELL, respectively.If you are looking for killer songs like SAFE IN NEW YORK CITY, SATELLITE BLUES, STIFF UPPER LIP, ALL SCREWED and stuff that ROCKS, then get STIFF UPPER LIP.Who cares if they were hits or not, its AC/DC, its always good; and here, its actually REALLY good.BRIAN JOHNSON smoked a pack of smokes before recording every cut, his throat is going through more hell than ever on this one, but it sounds incredible; especially cool on the title track.This is one of those albums that gets me fired up just thinking about it.

YEAH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boys Are Back!","review":"It's great to hear these guys again after 5 long years. Brian and Angus are at it again! Who said these guys are too old?

Would they have a big hit on this album? These are questions that I and a lot of others had before buying this CD, but I forgot them soon after because this CD rules! Johnson's voice is still high and explosive, and AC/DC blended their blues roots with hard rock. Can't Hold Me Back is an underrated hit. The title track is pure AC/DC power. All AC/DC fans must get this CD or they will have an incomplete collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great dose of Rock n Roll","review":"To the last reviewer. You are an idiot.

If any AC/DC album deserves to be called a sequel to 1980's classic Back in Black, this is the one. Much like the Star Trek Motion Picture series, AC/DC's releases seemed to follow a good album, bad album pattern for most releases since Bon Scotts death, with the overall quality slowly spiraling downward. Stiff Upper Lip ends that sequence, putting the boys from down under right back at the top of their game. It used to be I would recommend 3 albums to casual AC/DC fans, Highway,Back in Black, and Powerage. Now Ive got to add a fourth. May be a while before it comes out of the stereo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is anyone surprised?","review":"AC/DC has a secret that they have to selling a shizbot or records: They keep putting the same songs on every album. So good reviewers, are you really that immersed in your AC/DC fandom? And fans who put in bad reviews, why are you surprised? Every album is the same album, people. Trust me, this is the case. Not to mention that Angus is a very overrated guitar player. Anyway, don't be surprised that this album lacks originality, because the only original one was the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better back in the 70s","review":"AC/DC was a very good band in the 70s but when Bon Scott died the legend left many though. Till the 80s when they met Brain Johnson who brought the band back. Back in Black was a very good Album,and not many bands write a song to their old friend who passed away. Back In Black was the song to Bon. Angus Young is known as one of the best guitar players who can only play 3 chords I heard. I respect them for still playing at this age they are at, but the newer alubum isnt so good. I am not saying they went down,I still love them alot.."},{"rating":"1","title":"AC/DC's worst album!","review":"I'm an AC/DC fan,but I must say that \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" ranks among one of the worst albums I have ever heard.Most of the songs have the AC/DC sound,but none of them have anything special that makes them stand out,basically it's all filler,the songs are bland.I think their starting to have the same trouble they had from 81-91 not writing very strong material."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is AC/DC?","review":"I got this CD, and couldn't believe this was AC/DC. True, Angus Young's guitar is still good, and i had high hopes for this album. But as soon as Brian Adams starts singing, it kills the album. His voice, which kicked a$$ back in '86 (Back In Black) now sounds like a cross between an old lady and Yoda. I have listened to this CD three times and tried to make myself like it. I just can't. The only half-way decent song is...well, I can't think of a half-way decent song. If you want AC/DC, pick up Back In Black, For Those About to Rock, or Powerage (the last one being a Bon Scott classic). This album disgrases the title of AC/DC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just alright.","review":"Stiff Upper Lip is nothing quite that special. In its nearly 25 year history, AC/DC has never penned lyrics that are this bad. The repetition on tracks like SUL and House of Jazz reak of the creative flavor of say Back in Black or even Ballbreaker for that matter. AC/DC has slowed in pace and tends to shift more towards a blues flavor now, but for the most part it works well. \\"Satelitte Blues\\" tastes damn fine and probably is better than any track on Ballbreaker or Razors Edge, but the rest of the album is just plain uninspiring. Many fans are just happy to see AC/DC back from a 4-year recording hiatus, and there initial enthusiasm might skew their view on this new recording. Will this disk be in their players say a month from now? Bet on it, but it won't be taking the place of any Bon era CDs anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest AC/DC album yet","review":"I love AC/DC and I was very excited when this album came out mainly because they have not recorded an album with new matierial in 3 or 4 years. I was very disappointed! Brian Johnson's voice is wearing out and it shows on this album especially in the live songs(I bought the Stiff Upper Lip DVD too.) Angus and Malcom's riffs aren't that catchy!Stiff Upper Lip is the best song and after that there aren't anymore songs that will stick in your head or even make you think, hay that was pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"First customer to review this album, huh? I agree with amazon.com's reviewer, AC's last few albums have been inconsistent. A few standout songs, a few good songs, and some filler. This album is different. Each track is a standout, you will have a difficult time picking a favorite. This album is a return to form; less metal and more rock and roll and riffage and rhythm galore. This one ranks as one of Angus and Co.'s very best ever. Come and Get It!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"With the exception of one or two songs, this CD is unbelievable. From the straight-up rocker \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" to the more varied \\"Satellite Blues\\", AC/DC hasn't lost a step since their last recording. Go out and get this CD, it's a great addition to any rock collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN OFFENSE !!","review":"To say that all AC/DC albuns are the same is an offense, even if Angus himself may have said it sometime. It's an offense, because it would mean that mediocre albuns like this STIF, BALLBREAKER, FLY ON THE WALL, etc are in the same league as all Bon Scott's albuns and BACK in BLACK and FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO BAD IT MADE ME SICK...","review":"I'm a huge AC/DC fan. SO, I waited eagerly for the last four years for their new release. Oh, what a disapointment! NOthing saves himself in this lousy album, which seems a mockery to fans. It is clear the band no longe cares in composing great simple rock songs. Instead, they simplified it to the point of sheer mediocrity. Brian Johnson completely lost his vocals. Well, it's the same thing as with other bands like Iron Maiden, Sabbath, etc.. they go on living by their names, while fans keep awaiting for their new \\"masterpieces\\", which never comes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF FLY ON THE WALL...","review":"Don't buy this, trust me. It's is an album of filler. The only worthy BRIAN-ERA records are Back In Black, For Those About To Rock, Razors Edge, and PERHAPS Flick Of The Switch. \\"STIFF UPPER LIP\\" is probably one of Brian's homo fantasys. Buy if you ARE an idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE OF THE SAME","review":"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF AC/DC SINCE 1975 WITH THE BON SCOTT DAYS.THIS CD IS MORE OF THE SAME FROM BALLBREAKER,AN O.K. CD BUT NOTHING TO GET EXCITED ABOUT.HARD CORE FANS LIKE MYSELF SHOULD BUY THIS BUT IF YOU ARE NEW TO AC/DC DON\`T START WITH THIS ONE,TRY LET THERE BE ROCK OR BACK IN BLACK."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Old to Rock?","review":"It appears to me that the die hard fans would have given 5 stars to anything. I have every AC/DC album, and bought this one the day it came out. That first day, I could barely make it through the first listen. I kept waiting for each and every song to kick in, but none did. Very repetitive and very flat. I have tried to listen to it since, but just can't. Definitely a dust collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"It seems a follow-up to BALLBREAKER, but it is worse !","review":"Brian Johnson definitely lost the few ammount of vocals he had. Phil Rudd is playing lousy drums, it sucks. Face the truth: AC/DC is gone since \\"FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK\\", their last great album. You'll be dissapointed listening to this, after 4 years without recording one would think they would come back better, but that's not the case..."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Energy!","review":"Despite to my first opinions of this album, I've really grown to like it. I think this kind of album grows on you. Much better than BallBreaker definitly. The guitir riffs are catchy and Phill and Cliff have a really solid foundation. Brian's voice isn't what it used to be, but its better in my opinion than on BallBreaker. For age, he's doing great. Great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AC/DC still the best","review":"What can I say? AC/DC are the monsters of rock and show it time and again. Stiff Upper Lip is classic AC/DC: in your face, hard, bluesy, pure rock and roll! Brian Johnson sounds as great as ever, as does Angus on lead guitar. Rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Rocking Power","review":"I'm not a big AC/DC fan. After seeing them on Saturday Night Live, they seemed like a very talented rock band. I purchased Stiff Up Lip, and I like it. The title track just blows you away. Angus and the boys take one step further with Hold Me Back. This cd changed my mind about this band. Now I got to get Razor's Edge and Ballbreaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative, but the boys still rock","review":"To quote an old interview, when Angus was questioned about a critic's comment that all of AC/DC's 11 albums sound the same, Angus replied \\"That's a bloody lie! We've made 12 albums!\\" It is indeed more of the same, at least over these past 10 years or so. The title track is kind of fun, and there aren't any bad songs. Good rhythms, good solos, Brian Johnson's trademark growl... the lyrics are very light. The double entendres are not as humorous as I had hoped, and the rock and roll attitude is not as high as these boys are capable of. I suspect when I see them perform, these songs will sound a lot better, but I also hope that they only play one or two cuts from this record and fill the show with their classic stuff. To anyone that hasn't seen AC/DC in concert, GO! They are the funnest, most entertaining rock and roll band in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work of the Heart","review":"It is said that before one can address a problem - or opportunity - one must understand that problem (or opportunity). McNeal certainly has understood the opportunity offered the Christian Church to reach out to a pre-Christian (not post-Christian) North American culture. This work presents a passionate appeal to transition to a missional, externally focused approach to ministry by gaining insight into how God shapes the hearts of spiritual leaders through six distinct shaping dynamics in the Christian life. These spiritually formed leaders will have drawn closer to the heart of God, thus recognizing their call to serve in Jesus' name and in His way. Excellent book. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid for this order and did not recieve it","review":"I have not received the order and have not heard back from the seller nor has anyone given my money back. This has caused me to noe have what I need for class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"I really don't need to say much more that the title for this review. Absolutely awful! The concepts weren't terrible, but the author obviously has no reverence for scripture. It would seem that his approach to the Word of God is assumption. He draws lines that simply do not exist and are not taught in the passages he references. For example: He claims that Moses was a good leader when he realized that he wasn't good and public speech and asked to take his brother Aaron along. Anyone can see by reading the Bible that it just didn't happen that way. God was calling Moses to go free his people from slavery in Egypt, and Moses was using every excuse in the book to get out of it. It was at that point that GOD told Moses that he would give him Aaron to convince Moses to obey. Scriptural inaccuracies abound throughout this book. Do not read it!I feel bad for this author. I would not want to be the one who stands before God and have him ask me why I treated his word with such disrespect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guide to western PA","review":"I first found this book at my library, and was amazed at how many locations it covers! I was born in western PA, and grew up in central PA, but there were some intruiging places in this guide that I'd never heard of before. If you are a history buff and have a nice, lazy weekend to spend following the \\"history trail\\" as laid in this book - do it! What a nice way to fall in love with PA all over again. It'd be twice as nice to do in the fall when the leaves are changing. I logged on to Amazon.com today expressly in the hopes of ordering this book - I can't recommend it enough and am looking forward to taking it with me on regional trips in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is useful only for revenge on a close friend.","review":"This is a pamphlet at best, puffed up to book size by inane, unrelated cartoons and half-pages of print. Its grammar and syntax are deplorable. Most of the means of revenge that it offers require access to the victim's property that would only be afforded to a close friend. It might be useful in destroying a close relationship if one doesn't mind being the only suspect for the vengeful act. Most of the remaining methods are more like puerile dreams of getting even rather than practical courses of action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another piece of crap from Gary Brodsky","review":"Yet again Gary Brodsky shows that he does not care what his name is attached to as long as he can make money. This book, if it can be classified as a book, is an inferior product. The writing is full of typographical and gramatical errors. The subject matter is uninspired and poorly rendered. This book is even worse than Brodsky's other print abomination- Mind Of The Cat. Both books are not worth thinking about much less buying. If your local library has a copy of this book, try to convince them to recycle it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOPHOMORIC TRASH","review":"This was the most mean-spirited book I've ever read. Expecting practical jokes, I found felonious stunts that could easily land you in jail. I wouldn't think of recycling it in any way. Straight to the garbage it goes. Shame on you, Gary Brodsky, as well as the publisher of this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Guys are Good!","review":"About ten years ago I produced my own golf television show. And watching this terrific dvd set reminded me of something I learned back then: If you want to see out-of-this-world golf, watch the touring pros--but if you want to learn how to do it and be taught by pros who can communicate and really help you get from Point A to Point B then it's the Club Pros and Teaching Pros you need to consult. Not that these folks can't play...they can! But they have dedicated their lives to teaching the game and to steal the tour's understated line, \\"These (teaching pros) are good!\\" I read everything I can in the golf magazines, but to have these teaching pros come from my dvd player and into my living room is a real treat. I'll use this as a reference anytime I feel my game in need of a tune-up.

I was disappointed that not all the stories (or even half of the stories) were about her beloved pets. But, nonetheless, I enjoyed reading it (even the non-dog stories) and will read more of her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID at all costs","review":"As a great fan of dog stories, I had enjoyed one of this author's tales excerpted in a dog story anthology, and thought that I might relish more of her work. Was I ever WRONG!!! Half or less of the book was related to canines, and then often remotely. Many of her works (this is a compendium of essays) are spoiled by her frequent use of the most vile, crude, and vulgar expletives, always unnecessary and adding nothing to the story. Although humorous on the rarest of occasions, this tome consists mainly of the mindless babblings of the typically self-loathing liberal. Unfit even as a chew toy for your pup!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This is more a pamphlet than a book, really.

I bought the book solely to read MFK Fisher's translation of it. It also doesn't have page numbers, so it can't be cited; and best of all, it makes my PC Kindle app crash every time I try to use it.

I work as a Hard Rock/Heavy Metal DJ and in my work I come across almost every album in the world within that genre. What Maiden has to offer isn't exactly anything revolutionary when it comes to writing songs. Yet, these guys have managed to capture millions of FAITHFULL listeners. The power in their music is unique. All pieces put togheter creates perfection. YES! It is nothing short of perfect. I know that every time I play a Maiden track the club will go wild and just flourish (cool word!) with joy! Rule Britannia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture Discs? Why?","review":"Why did they have to go with the picture discs? Picture discs sound awful and these are no exception. I still have my old Maiden records from the 80's and these do not compare. They lack the punch and kick that the original vinyl had. I don't get it. Aren't the original album covers cool enough to look at? It's a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Rockin' album from a premier metal band!","review":"\\"Piece of Mind\\" was Iron Maiden's 4th studio album and the first with drummer Nicko McBrain. It was the follow up to their Break through album \\"Number of the Beast,\\" and was their first to reach North America's Billboard charts. \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" is the opening song, and right away the energy of McBrain's pounding drums reaches out, grabs you by the neck, and reels you right in. Steve Harris' trademark bass and Bruce Dickinson's amazing vocal range add to the dynamics of every song. As on all Maiden albums, the dual guitars of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith are awesome and intense. They compliment each other extremely well. Each and every song on this album is incredible. The lyrics are well written and fitting of Maiden's style, and the energy is phenomenal. Though I know some people might disagree, to me, this is their best album by far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best - Ever","review":"Piece of Mind is one of the best metal recordings ever released. Intricate songwriting, superb musicianship, and intelligent lyrics combine to result in a timeless album that I still enjoy listening to twenty years after I first purchased it so long ago on cassette tape.'Revelations' is the best vocal performance of Bruce's career and shows the full range of his abilities in one song.You can practically hear Icarus flying through the air to \\"touch the sun\\" during Dave Murray's guitar solo on the 'Flight of Icarus'.You almost feel as if you are horseback riding into battle with the galloping rhythm of 'The Trooper'.If you lke metal, your collection is not complete without Piece of Mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finest Maiden Album - EVER","review":"This is the greatest, melodious, masterful piece of musical genius that Iron Maiden has produced. I have been listening to this CD for 18 years, and I can honestly tell you that it these songs never get old. If you are just starting to get into Maiden, pick up this album. Everything comes together on it, muscially, lyrically, everything. This is the album that will get you hooked. I first heard it in 1984, and after that I was hooked and first in line when 'Powerslave' hit the shelves, been a Maiden fan ever since."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Band, The Best Album, The Best Songs! EVER!!","review":"I got this cd a few months ago, and since I only new a couple of their songs, I only listened to a few. But then I heard 'Where Eagles Dare' and I loved it.

This is a must-have for any Maiden fan anywhere! Up the Irons! Eddie is forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This is such an awesome albumn! This is metal music in it's purest form; incredible! I love every song here! Don't expect your typical \\"Top 10\\" or the \\"made for radio\\" song you find on almost every cd out there, no way, that's not what Iron Maiden is about. Their songs are too perfect and too complex to be cut up just for air play. One listen and you will see why Maiden was one of the biggest influences on many of the bands today; it's too bad most of them have just become another in a long line of generic bands now. Pick up this cd, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You take my life, well I'll take yours too!\\"","review":"\\"Piece Of Mind\\" is a wonderful Maiden album filled with good music! Such songs as \\"The Trooper\\", \\"Flight Of Icarus\\", and \\"Die With Your Boots On\\" are well-known and classics. But such gems as \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" and \\"Quest For Fire\\" are lesser known yet still as awesome. Bruce Dickinson sounds really great here, especially on \\"Revelations\\" where he just wails. This album was the start of the classic line-up, which would follow for many years. Adrian Smith's solo on \\"Flight Of Icarus\\" is just awesome. The reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it gets a little slow later in the album. This album is very good and is very recommended. It's heavy metal essential and a rock classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAH!","review":"hehehe... eddie in a cell. damn this is a good album, every song on it is good except for sun and steel yet.. even that song is better than most of today's modern music. if you want a hell-raising blast listen to the trooper. revelations... damn that song is unexplanable... just listen to it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"METAL CLASSIC!!","review":"by all means ignore the clown who said \\"Kid Rock, Milli Vanilli, and Madonna have more talent than these losers\\".

Oh yeah, I think she needs one more dancer too!Maiden is one of the all time great metal bands and this CD is a highlight.Music for men...by men!!

First of all, you could take the incredible fast paced guitars, and destructive drums, and put them together to create the powerful force which is Iron Maiden. I first bought this album when I started to discover the better music. The music that counters all the lame crap we see on television. When I bought it, I found myself being hooked. Out went the Disturbed and in came the real metal. All that followed was Tool, Opeth, Emperor, anything you can think of. I'm getting of subject though. Iron Maiden's Piece of Mind is an excellent work of musicianship. The metal on this album is some of the best around. These guys can play! With the raging guitars going a mile a minute, this album certainly is quite a treat. Futures such greats as \\"The Trooper\\". This album will satisfy.

These guys stand in the front of the line when it comes to the hard bangers of their time. My hair might be graying and my gait is getting slower but I can still rock with the best of them when I put these guys on and turn it way up. Awesome!

This observation is further proven on both this cd as well as 'Stage'. The only reason why I did not give this cd 5 stars was I wish there would have been more songs on it...possibly even a double cd set. You figure that a majority of the people that will buy this cd are hardcore fans, so adding some other great favorites such as \\"My World\\", \\"Lady Red Light\\", and \\"Mean Mistreater\\" would have really made this perfect. Not to mention, there are no tunes from 1993's 'Sail Away'. Other then that, the vibe, quality of the recording, and the musicianship are stellar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CLassic little work in the philosophy of science","review":"Whitehead is widely regarded as a humane philosopher in the best sense of that word--a philosopher able to get across very difficult ideas with a wink and a smile. Also, he has always been commended for his prose style in his more intimate writings, at least in his books based on lectures (the best of which are Science in the Modern World and Adventures of Ideas). Process and Reality is difficult but worth the effort; one does need a glossary at times, but this isn't a review of that book.It is hard to imagine a philosophy book written with more clarity than this one. I think that the quotes given by reviewers witness that fact. The only review here, it turns out, which dilikes the book because of its \\"unreadability\\" is the one riddled with spelling and grammatical errors itself. Hard reading, it turns out, is even harder if one cannot spell. With that, I heartily concur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Personal Experience....","review":"It was great to read the honest personal experience of an adoption--both the positive and negative. This book provides a centralized source of helpful information on adoptions and could act as a valuable checklist for those adopting a toddler. I would recommend this book to anyone considering the adoption of a toddler or an international adoption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"International adoption is too expensive to waste your money on a book like this. The author says that she tried to write a book about everything she wished she'd thought of before adopting a toddler - unfortunately, my impression is that she didn't think it through much at all. The book is full of helpful tidbits like if you are adopting a three year old, you might want to consider getting a toddler bed instead of a crib, or if you're feeling frumpy and stressed out with all the waiting, you could go shopping! Or maybe get some Glamor Shots taken! Seriously, most of the things in this book are either common sense (don't leave the kid alone in the bathtub) or just plain goofy (Glamor Shots, getting your hair bleached blond). If I had been able to flip through it at a bookstore, I never would have purchased it.Oooo! I forgot! Bring a cute outfit for the child to wear when you take pictures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was hoping this book would help prepare me as we wait to adopt a 2.5-3 year old child. Unfortunately, the book is really geared towards first time parents and since this will be our 4th child, there was very little in the book that I found at all helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't find this book helpful at all","review":"This book is an easy read but I didn't find the information useful at all. The author describes her journey to adopt a toddler through the eyes of someone who has had no experience with children at all. If you have children already this is not the book for you. Most topics are dealt with superficially and short shrift is given to exploring options other than the ones the author chose. Her child is not in day care, so there isn't much useful information about day care. She chose a particular kind of bed, so the pros and cons of different kinds of beds aren't explored very well. The author also makes it clear that fathers are definitely second best when it comes to child rearing and this book is definitely written with a female audience in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful resource for people adopting a toddler!","review":"This book addressed many of the questions I had about the details of a toddler adoption (packing, nursery, etc.) It is written in a style that makes you feel like you are just talking with a good friend and was a quick read. The author recommends Toddler Adoption, A Weaver's Craft for information about the more complicated issues of attachment and bonding, and I agree. Again, it is an excellent look at the details associated with adopting a toddler and preparing for their arrival."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Like listening to a neighbor spout off her opinions and reactions to her own personal experience. Advice amounted to pointing out the obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common Sense","review":"I thought there was a lot of common sense advice in this book, so if you don't have any, you need it. If you simply want light reading to acknowledge that others have done what you are doing, you may enjoy it. If you are looking for \\"what do I do now\\" there are many other books to reference that will be much more helpful. I found the author to be very impressed with herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and informative...","review":"I am soon to be a first time parent of two international adopted children. I enjoyed this book because I found it to be well written and very informative. I enjoyed not only the stories included, but also the specific details discussed within each category. The author reminds/reinforces to the reader the general factors involved with raising children while also laying out quirky specifics relating to adopted children. I am very appreciative to people such as the author who have written about their process of adopting and raising adopted children. It is fascinating and helpful and makes me even more excited about our adoption process and bringing our precious children home!"},{"rating":"1","title":"roll pins","review":"box came broke and all pis in every part. too many big pins. used the smaller ones but the bigger ones are mostly useless"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"Should have less large pins and more smaller pins.

This carrying case does make the phone easier to carry via its belt clip, but does not protect the phone in any way. The face is open, so dirt or dust can reach the screen & keypad. The case is made of leather so thin that it affords no protection from accidental knocks or drops. A little padding would have gone a long way to make this a better case, & so would a front panel that opens & closes via snap or zip. Also, the case fits way too snugly, & it's a real struggle trying to get the phone into & out of it. I'm now looking for a better made case which offers more protection for my phone.

For the general reader, the writing style may be a bit dry; however, because each chapter has different authors, the writing style, while basically academic and fact driven, varies.Any serious dog breeders, trainers, or owners will find themselves returning to certain chapters over and over again. Breeders and even new puppy owners would benefit from the chapter by Serpell and Jagoe on \\"Early experience and the development of behaviour,\\" which updates the standard beliefs about puppy development resulting from the Bar Harbor experiments of over 50 years ago.Excellent book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting for my purchase","review":"I am still waiting to receive my purchase.

Told in three first-person POVs, it offers a rounded presentation of perspectives on the slow degeneration of the small Southern town. The child narrator, Charles Mallison, is an especial joy. The humor isn't as wild as in The Hamlet, but the subtlety and its organic growth from the characters only strengthens the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must own this CD!!!","review":"Seth Horan and co-producer/engineer Robert Gilmer have created nothing short of a masterpiece!

That said, I can't count the number of times my phone has dropped to the floor because the snap on the antenna strap has come undone. Since the mount for the belt clip is attached below the phone's center of gravity, It constantly rotates upside down which contributes to this problem. Add the fact that it really doesn't protect the phone to start with and you are better off keeping your phone in your pocket with your keys and change.

An emergent property that some call \`the spirit that moves through all things' and some call \`god' and I was hoping that this book would call it Gaia. Bah! The author totally ignores the metaphysical evidence and misrepresents the impact of civilization on the natural world. He also misrepresents the relationship tribal aka primitive cultures had with the natural world. Furthermore, this isn't even good science.

I would have like more research on the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and rhetorical","review":"A very outdated book in light of the recent research showing that women are just as likely as men to initiate a violent confrontation with an intimate partner. The book takes the VAWA approach in condemning men whilst never touching on the accountabilities of women as the culprits of a majority of child abuse.Whilst we continue to target men as evil and women as saints we run the risk of ignoring many victims, which is exactly what VAWA has done. The policy of assuming all men and only men are the culprits will shift much needed funds and attention from other victims who suffer just as much.This book needs to be accompanied with one targeting women and the domestic violence they are accountable for. Perhaps Andrea Yates would not be famous if society took a 'Stop all abuse by everyone' approach.2 stars for the effort, but this is a step in the wrong direction for both equality and helping everyone who suffers from abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knock off?","review":"Didn't smell anything like the original Aqua di Parma I'd had for years.

They have all their songs, including a few acoustic versions of the same song (which I thought was the best version) and a Mandarin version of \\"Pretty Boy\\". I believe that is talent. They learned Mandarin in only one day and they sang it very well, according to my aunt (we're Chinese). They also included two Radio Mixes at the end, and they were great! I advise you to get this. M2M are unique, because they aren't like Christina or Britney or N*Sync. I think they are better because they write their own songs, and they sing it themselves and play their own instruments. The second CD is even better than the first, so look forward to that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"M2M Biggest Fan!","review":"GREAT CD! THE BEST! Every song is the best!

Basicly every song is brilliently written and performed. The girls themselves are extreamly talented, more so than any other of there peers (ie. Britney), as they can actually write and perform there own songs. The album is a mix of many styles, and thus can't really be catogorised. Songs such as \\"Pretty Boy\\" and \\"Dear Diary\\" are slow, but then there are other songs such as \\"Do you know what you want\\" and \\"The Feeling is Gone\\" (Australia Only) which are fast and, funky(is that the write word?). Unfortunatly this CD dose not have the broad apeal of many other teen pop stars, (is this because they have talent?) and so is'nt going to top the charts. Anyway, this is an exelent album, and anyone sick of all the manufactured acts around should buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"This is really some quality music from two girls who have been friends since they were young. Marion and Marit are definatly talented girls who write most of their own songs! They have some very good and uplifting lyrics that will make you want to dance.

Dance. Thank God.Marion and Marit are two girls with ACTUAL talent. No, they aren't another Britney Spears. Their music ranges from finding the boy of their dreams to breaking up and finding new love. From \\"Don't Say You Love Me\\" to \\"Dear Diary\\", this is an album you'll be playing nonstop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a breath of fresh air","review":"If I could put sound into feelings, I would say that M2M is a breath of fresh air in a weighted down, smothered genre of pop. Most singers these days have that nasal, Britney sound to them. They find it necessary to belt out many of the notes; constantly putting their voice as the center of attention. These girls just let it flow. The don't try too hard to sing great. This is good because I can actually hear the music behind them, which they wrote and perform themselves. All of the songs are good, with a good hook to them. Their sound is a lot lighter than most pop groups, so that makes it a lot different. I honestly cannot say that there is something for everyone on this album, though. This album is geared towards kids and teens. All the songs are about things that happen to teenagers. However, I still give it five stars because, hey, I'm a teenager and I really ike the music.

When I first listened to it, I didn't like their voices which ironically sound alot alike. Now, however their voices have grown on me and I actually find myself wanting to hear them (weird, huh?).

This book's title can be used to address the long hatred that the Jews have towards the Gentiles.I am firmly convinced that the separation demanded by Jewish religion is the primary cause of anti-semitism, simply because of the implied insult to the majority culture. If Jews would stop being separate, they would gradually stop being hated, but they would no longer be Jews, either.

The story, by Jane Yolen, takes place in ancient China and tells of a tiny princess, not much thought of by her family, who uses her intellect, creativity, and skill to save her father, the emperor, held hostage by kidnappers. The text of the story is lengthy (many pages have ten or more lines of text) and more explanatory than descriptive. The illustrations, done in multi-colored paper cuts, bring the text to life, depicting the most dramatic moments of the story. The illustrations stretch across both pages and often bleed off the edge. Despite their exquisite detail, the illustrations are flat and float in the white space of the page, without any sense of depth or context."},{"rating":"1","title":"This lens has a lot to offer.","review":"Don't overlook this lens.

Captures the essence of the show, describes its impact on later series, and details the long history of Space:1999, down to criticisms lodged by science fiction fans and reviewers alike.

She loves being able to put her baby to bed and put the mommy in the nursery with the baby! My child is deffidently entertained!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great details","review":"I love this little dollhouse family set. It's sort of old-fashioned in style, which I personally love. It reminds me of such sets from thirty years ago. It's true that they aren't the most bendable ever; they bend with a little effort and don't stay completely in position (I think this is a common problem with any set except perhaps plastic). But I'm willing to sacrifice that for how detailed and beautiful they are, compared to many of the wooden or plastic sets. Great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great dolls","review":"the dolls are great. The only thing that frustrates my daughter is that the do not stand and they are difficult to bend. It's so hard to find a larger sized doll for a doll house so we're glad we at least found some for hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"We bought this to go with a large dollhouse.

This one doesn't even cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price discrepancies based upon race","review":"I was about to purchase the African American set and noticed the difference in price compared to the Caucasian and the Asian dolls and it is the most expensive. I am unsure the reason this seller is selling each doll at different prices when they all have the same functions and features. Race should never be a factor in price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap little dolls","review":"I was really disappointed with these dolls. I ordered them to go with the Kidcraft Savannah Dollhouse. First off, they were smaller than the description. They were so cheap - the material they are made out of reminded me of the Gumby toys, only they're not as easily bendable. It's impossible for my 4 year-old to pose them for her dollhouse. Although she likes them, I wish I had purchased Barbies instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves a lot to be desired","review":"I bought these dolls despite the negative reviews. It is so difficult to find dollhouse dolls (we have the KidKraft Savannah dollhouse). I knew there'd be a good chance I'd be out searching for dolls AGAIN, and I am. One of the earlier reviewers compare the dolls to Pokey & Gumbie. That is a very accurate comparison. That is my biggest complaint -- not very bendable. I also want to warn buyers that these dolls are quite small. If you have a dollhouse that will fit Barbie-sized dolls, you will be disappointed with these.I guess I'll be visiting Mattel's website in an effort to find my daughter a couple Barbies who are conveying a positive message... don't get me started!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To scale and quality","review":"This family is made to scale for most dollhouses.

Their clothes are about 3x bigger than the dolls in real life. Also, they are not like regular doll house dolls.

VERYYYYYYY upset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This!","review":"Very durable dolls. Don't have to worry about finding arms and legs and heads to put back on them all the time.

They are bendable but lack a cuteness and charm that I wanted. I'll continue looking for a sweeter set for her. She's playing with them until then. I just didn't find them appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not high quality...","review":"I generally love Melissa & Doug toys, and this set of little dolls looked so beautiful I just had to splurge for my youngest daughter. They are beautiful, but I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the clothes. The seams are poorly sewn and if you want to take them off and on more than once or twice (with extreme care) they begin to fall apart. The pants don't stay up to begin with, the little jackets don't even have one tiny snap to keep them on, and they have an unfinished appearance in general. It's too bad, because they appear to be so nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Victorian?","review":"This item is not labled correctly. Go by the picture. If you want Victorian clothes, pick something else.The dolls themselves are good. They are bendable. For my purpose, they are fine. I am using the entire family to help with the size and scale of other minitures. Nice for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless as a play toy","review":"These are the worst toy dolls ever! They don't bend at all... they can't sit down, can only stand & lay down. You can't play with their clothes b/c they don't come off. You can't play with their hair either. The bendable set by PlayWonder is a lot of fun & usable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to an audio sample before purchasing","review":"Your average amature rapper....at bestthis is terrible.

That may be an improvement over having them look like a couple of wet noodles! I was looking for true support without under wires, and this does NOT deliver. Not even worth the postage to send it back! Good thing I also ordered a Glamorise Magic Lift, which is AWESOME, I will be ordering more of those and no more of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"So tired of tugging at it","review":"I love the look of this bra when it stays in place, which isn't for long. The front strap around the midsection keeps riding up underneath the girls and then makes them look funny...like they are hanging down. If they had a stiffer material so that you don't have to keep pulling down the front, it would be perfect. The look and feel of the bra is wonderful as long as you keep tugging at the front to pull it back in place :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Received Used Bra","review":"We ordered for 2.

This one looks just like it and says it's \\"satin\\", but it's stiff and scratchy, even after a couple washings. They used to offer a wide, padded strap, but can't find that either. This strap is narrow and cuts in after a short time of having it on. I don't like it and have only worn it once because it's very uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"No real support for big chested girls.Was good for a week and then it was useless.Was much more impressed with a JMS bra that I got later."},{"rating":"2","title":"good support","review":"This is a good no-wire support bra.

And was not cotton where it needed to be for comfort sake [inside under band]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire the torpedoes!","review":"I modeled this bra for my husband and he agreed it gave me a rather pointy silhouette, nothing like what was pictured (though that may have more do with the difference in bust size between myself and the model). The support is adequate and the bra wears comfortably, but I'll feel self-conscious in anything form-fitting. I usually fit a 36D to DD, depending on the brand (in Bali models, typically D), so maybe a bigger cup would help. But, I suspect this problem is inherent in the design of the bra itself. It may also be worth noting, though the bra is listed as \\"wire-free,\\" there is a plastic band running vertically on the lateral edge of each cup. It's flexible and doesn't bother me, but might be a problem for others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointy boobs are NOT IN!","review":"Wow, I'm pretty shocked as to how many positive reviews this bra has. The cup is shaped very weird, When on, it makes my boobs look like torpedoes! And it pushes them wayyy to far apart. They stick out too much on the sides and just makes the shape of my chest look un-natural. No bueno. I see other reviewers have had the same experience as me with this bra. I sent it back immediately!The Bali #3372 is the one that makes my boobs look great and feel great, even though it's itchy sometimes. This one looked almost the same, so I gave it a try. But the way it looks on is very different from the way it looks off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"Not what I was expecting - too uncomfortable.

With all the time you spent sharpening your words to fine points, you could have finished reading another book. Perhaps you should use your talent for destruction in the demolition business because at least you would get paid for it.

I adored all of her books from the time i was 13, and i had hopes this one would be better then it was.The main part of it was boring, and at times, i fought not to just throw it acros the room. It got mildly interesting towards the ending, but not enough to redeem it really. I will not be being this new, that's definite.Thought i would add to my review even if it has been awhile. Who knew that a few bad reviews would throw the author into such a tissy? granted, she wrote it, and i'm sure to her, it was her best ever. But, we, as people, are entitled to our opinions. My opinion of this book has not changed, i still think it's not her best. When held up to her previous novels, it falls short. I think she should have kept the mayfairs role in the last couple books to a minumum."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happen?","review":"Anne Rice you should have done what Michael Jordan should have done, retire as the greatest; instead you have ended the wonderful saga of the Vampire Chronicles in shame and embarrassement.

This was painful as I've been a fan of Anne Rice since I was twelve-I'm twenty-nine now & this is the last Anne Rice book I will buy. Someone here said something about relevancy which I disagree with-as I see it any kid playing VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE could make a better story & probably already has-therefore this book anyway has no relevancy at all. If you are into vampires stay away from this book-its terrible-just go back & reread the first three or find some other dark fiction to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hope This Really Wasn't The End","review":"As a long time fan of The Vampire Chronicles, I can't help but hope this book was not the last about all the characters we have all come to care about. While it was clever to pull the two sagas (the vampires and the Mayfairs) into one story, this book really concluded nothing, and very little actually happened in this novel. The story is rather weak and does not give us a final wrap up on Louis or Armand or Marius or David, not even on Lestat really. The end of the book leaves my hopes up for more to come and maybe a concluding novel that will do the series justice. It's worth reading if only just to visit briefly with the characters and world readers have come to know. Not Anne's best work - but we should all give the lady a break. I think (and hope) there will be more to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"Anne should have taken some time off to grieve, and not to write this book. It is the worst of them all. I skipped entire chapters that were poorly written. My thirteen year old nephew speaks like Lestat. What a disappointment.

DON\\"T BUY THIS BOOK>>>>"},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely a slip","review":"I've been reading Anne Rice's books for well over 10 years now, and I have to say I've never been truly disappointed until Blood Canticle. Blackwood Farm was okay, especially when compared to the earlier Vampire Chronicles and the stories of the Mayfair Witches, but Blood Canticle was a huge let down. The diatribe on \\"getting\\" Memnoch was definitely insulting to long-time fans. Maybe it's time for Rice to leave the vampires and witches behind and start with some new \\"blood\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Anne Rice even write this book?","review":"Seriously, did she write this book or [...] I was just waiting for Lestat to call something \\"da bomb\\" after he used the word \\"cool\\" for the tenth million time. And what happened to Mona? She certainly turned into a whiny cardboard copy teenager. I have been a huge fan of Anne Rice and own everything she ever wrote, including books under her other names. This was just a horrible let down, like she didn't even want to write it. And by page 200, I didn't want to read it. I had to push myself through the pages. Someone needs to tell this woman when the book is this bad. It discredits her name. It discredits the editor. And the only reason it's in print is because it has her name one it.

The story is loose, slow, unfocused. It feels like Rice has tried to tie up loose ends without being able to create a coherent story. At times, she seems to please herself with rantings that give the novel little direction. Read it if you must, but don't expect too much of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"If you love the Vampire Chronicles, please don't read this book. It won't be the smashing hit you want it to be, it won't even come close.If you heard the Vampire Lestat was back and he's starring in Blood Canticle, you were lied to. The Lestat you knew in the first few books of the Chronicles is gone. Blood Canticle stars Saint Lestat, a contrived rip-off of the original.The butcher of Lestat's character aside, how do you remember all the other characters? You Mayfair fans, don't look for your characters here, unless your looking for the fancition-style card board cut-out of them.I'm as big an Anne Rice fan as the next person, believe me. And I wouldn't be saying such harsh things about her work if I didn't believe they were true. It saddens me to say it, but this book was nothing but a disappointment. I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't stand the heat...","review":"This book is really not good work compared to Ms Rice's earliest works, although I still think the Witching Hour is the finest book that she has written. This book has the thinly etched sense that makes me feel as if I have already read it.I don't see any point in being nasty or personal, that's just my take. These are reader opinions, not professional reviewers, but we do buy (and buy and buy) her books. If she can't take the heat she should stay out of the Literary Amazon Kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very,Very disappointed","review":"I read all of the reviews for this book and I thought it can't be that bad. From the 3rd chapter I thought to myself who is this new whinny,weak Lestat? The story line was weak and my goodness Quin is such a wimp! What a useless side kick! Also what was up with Lestat's lingo??? Yo Bro? I have so many more things to add but I'm sure it will just be the same thing has everyone else's. So, I will just say this for shame anne, for shame you could have done a lot better then this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back off","review":"First os all, this book was not a complete flop at all. some readers may very well have expected the exact same stlye and story type, but what no one is paying attention to is the fact that Anne rice stays very true to her perseption of each character. Rowan has become a weak desperate child, mona is still the stubborn brat, just learning to take herself differently. ECT. each character in this book has followed through in the course that they were set upon. stoy lines change, so do characters. stop comaring it to all her other works and take this one for what it is, a new chapater."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY EYES!! THEY BURN!","review":"First off, Lestat wants to be a wholesome saint....that will tell you something about this book. Anne Rice turned Lestat from our loving Brat Prince into....i don't even know what! Not to mention that there is way to much stuff about Taltos and Lasher. The entire book is centered around the now, meek Quinn and the bratty little fledgling Mona. No other characters are even in the book from the Chronicles besides Lestat and Quinn. And for the last of the books, shouldn't they be included. Louis is reffered to once, and not even by Lestat, and Maharet sends Lestat a letter. Come on!! The book is littered with Christian refrences that just ruin it. The book is slow and again, way too much about Taltos and Mona. I WANTED LOUIS, ARMAND, AND MARIUS AT THE LEAST. It was very dissapointing, and the only reason i read the whole thing through was in hopes that another Vampire would be included. Sigh. I could have written a better finale! Sigh. Oh Brat Prince, what a way to go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God the chronicles are no more! Editing, please!","review":"Illiterature at its most defining point.

But not enough: I want more!","review":"This novel was a great reading for me. Don't pay attention to the immature and negative reviews here on Amazon about it; most of those reviews come from narrow-minded people who dislike Anne Rice for various reasons. How ridiculous and judgmental to behave like that.Aside from that, this is a great book. It is certainly not in the same league as The Vampire Lestat, or Memnoch the Devil, but it is a good reading.I especially liked the entire Taltos concept; felt like a novelty since I haven't read much at all about the Mayfair witches, and the rest of Anne's occult world (I've only read TVC and New Tales of the Vampires).The only thing that was sort of a disappointment, was that if you're going to end The Vampire Chronicles, please do it by giving us more: I wanted to read more about Maharet, Mekare, Armand, Louis, Marius and all of the other vampires that I've grown to love throughout the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I like this book!","review":"To say the least, I have read Blood Canticle more than once and I found it not what I expected at first. I am a huge fan of her work and personally, I found nothing negative about this book. The characters were presented in the way I have found comfortable at least to me, I have not been disappointed at all. I would like to clear up one thing that I found discouraging about these people who leave reviews on Amazon, they are just here to complain and that was not what I intend to do.

The writing at times is a bit much, but lets face it......its a book on vampires...not Shakespeare!Lestate, Mona, and Quinn meet again! I won't spoil it for you any more, other to say its a fun filled book.Don't get your hopes up with the thought of her first books, but all in all, if you are a fan of her work, you will like it none the less.I am already looking forward to Anne's next book which is due out in November!Happy Reading!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it...","review":"I actually liked this book, it wasn't even close to her greatest but it was good.

Blood Canticle was the only way in my opinion to end was was in fact, one of the best Chronicles I have EVER read, and if you've been through Lestat's adventures then you would understand why in fact, this was ended in such a manner.Always loved are my books, and always will I keep this one and all of the others in high standards.I would give it 10 stars if I could!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann, stop whining please","review":"Yes, yes.

I think \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is the best book of the series and I waited patiently for the return of the phlegmatic Lestat. And he has returned, only in this book he sounds as if Anne Rice hopes that nobody ever will ask her again to write about Lestat. He sounds like a vampire who does not believe in himself anymore, doesn't take himself very seriously. And therefore the reader is not taken very seriously.I have believed in Lestat, had hope even and the belief that he existed, but now I know that Lestat is dead, just as the writer of the book wanted to achieve. Lestat is dead. I hope she never writes about him again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, make it end!","review":"This series should've stopped several books ago. How many people can Anne make into vampires and then force us to endure listening to their angst as they come to terms with enjoying that ultimate vampire orgasm which is drinking someone's blood? How many more side characters can she stretch out into full stories?My biggest disappointment was the \\"love\\" story between Rowan Mayfair and Lestat. It was unconvincing and contrived. One of the nicest parts of the Witching Hour was the romance between Michael and Rowan, which Anne proceeded to destroy in subsequent Mayfair books.This is a tired, tired series.

But then they started to decline. That is, they started to decline once the witches were introduced.But I'm here to write about Blood Canticle, aren't I?Well, I still want to know what happened. It used to be that Lestat could contemplate for pages on end, but now there is never a page that doesn't have some half-hearted dialoge!

I guess my expectations were so much higher than they should have been. I expected a lot more from one of my favorite authors. This book picks up immediately after Blackwood Farm ends and goes off into a lot of repetition which I assume is for those readers who did not read the The Witching Hour, Lasher, and Taltos. If you're an Anne Rice fan than you more than likely read them all so this one was boring and repetitive...and had me wishing the book would move along to something new and exciting. It never got to that point. It's ending was as disappointing as it's beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello, Anne Rice, Are You There?","review":"Let me start off by saying the story wasn't so bad, it was the execution of the story that was terrible.I was thrilled to see that Lestat played a major role in this story, until the dialog kicked in. He sounds like some metro, gangsta, surfer knock-off. He actually says \\"dude\\" all too frequently. Please.The story actually does a decent job tying the Mayfair Witch/Vampire scene together. It revolves around Quinn Blackwood and how he is struggling to deal with his fresh mortal life and his new vampiric existence. But, again, let me say that for the first time in any Rice book, Lestat killed it. I could not get passed the random, rambling soliloquy that popped up everywhere.Sorry, this one didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill Me Now!","review":"I've read every one of Anne Rice's novels, and have graciously accepted Lestat being \\"reborn,\\" but I can not accept Lestat becoming such a bore.

I miss the great storytelling author who wrote \\"The Witching Hour.\\" What happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have 5 pages left to go...","review":"I loved every book in this series up to Blackwood Farms and this book, both are filled with pedantic drivel. If you like to read 10 pages about a little old lady's shoes, or how wonderful said woman thinks it is that her grandson is bi-sexual, then this is the book for you! I'm sure Rice will just think I don't get it, or understand the complex, artistic nature of her book, and who knows she might be right. Either way, not many people liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh god, ricey, go back to your pulp heaven","review":"Pretentious authors always think it blasphemy to criticize their work--and the greater the hack, the greater the defense of his crap. Thus cometh American Hack Rice, who tries so pathetically to equal herself to Stephen King and, with this worthless defense of her novel, proves herself to be simpy Diane Steel with vampires.No, dear Anne, you are no great writer, and this work is certainly the worst of your Lestat chronicles. I read your works from a library on a beach--when, of course, there are no boy bandson the radio to distract my attention (their intelligence equals yours).So please, take your fictional greatness and go back to your fictional world where you are a wonderful writer.

However, many of you are saying that this is your last of the vampire or witch chronicles and you're more than right about that. In fact, you don't even have a choice. Anne Rice has stated multiple times in her phone messages that this is the last novel she will ever write about vampires or witches. I think it's pretty disappointing for a final bow out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lestat wrote it,....","review":"Many people seem to have issues with this book, however I think it is quite an interesting endeavor. Lestat wrote this book, not Mrs. Rice. Meaning she wrote it as Lestat would have written it and I think she hit the nail on the head.

There is no other way to express how much I vehemently despise \\"Blood Canticle\\". I loved so many things about the \\"Vampire Chronicles, especially \\"Vampire Lestat\\", \\"Queen of the Damned, and yes, even \\"Memnoch The Devil\\". \\"Witching Hour\\" was probably one of the most interesting family sagas I have ever read.And \\"Blood Canticle\\" is what we have been given as a \\"finale\\"? It is beyond a let down. It is insulting. One dimensional flat characters, no plot, no cohesion, \\"Blood Canticle\\" is the very best example of writing a novel for a pay check. It is sloppy and base. Usually, I can find something interesting in even the worst book, but this novel is far beyond even the worst Jackie Collins.I shall adopt the new vernacular of Lestat.Yo, Anne, you're a hack, and any future novels you write should be confined to the very bottom of the barrel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loyal Fan","review":"I am a bit mad at the fact that this is the last chronicle but I really cant believe that, even if she says it is so; she left it all too unfinished.I lived through menoch the devil and I can live through this. . . i hope.

I could sit for hours reading her works as if they were made from fine wine (gee I sound like Lestat now). Since MEMNOCH THE DEVIL the Vampire Chronicles have gone down hill. Except for PANDORA and VICTORRIO, the other installments are the same story over and over again. The Armand and Marius based books are the same minus a handful of chapters and both repeating stories already told in THE VAMPIRE LESTAT. Now with this addition we have to go through BLACKWOOD FARM again. And Why do we have to go through the history of Taltos again? I was very disappointed. I loved the WITCHING HOUR. I is my favorite! But now the characters of Rowan and Michael seem so fake so not what they used to be. Sadly this book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"how disappointing","review":"I am sorry to say that this book realy does not live up to the previous books in this series.

Get an original idea, take a break, take a vacation, take a pill... do anything but write tripe like this.She has destroyed her career and alienated her fans. She has become a parody of herself. And what's even more tragic, she thinks she has relevance. She thinks that what she has to write about is valued and worthy of a reader investing his time and 28.00 bucks. Deluded is best way to describe her. Even better, she has become a legend in her own mind. I suggest we stop buying her \\"work\\".

They continue to rant on and on, for whichever side they're on.The truth of the matter is that this book still has the excellent writing that Anne has always had. It's written wonderfully, and the 'plot', if you'd like to call it, is just as good as any others in the Vampire Chronicles. It's a wonderful book not only for her excellent writing, but because it combines The Mayfair Witches with the Vampire Chronicles, as in Blackwood Farm. Devote fans of Anne should be pleased that the two series have been combined, in a way. Any avid reader of the Vampire Chronicles -should- be pleased with this book, as it finalizes many things that have been in past books.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Witches & Vampires","review":"If you love the witches and love the vampires - this book is for you.

I don't usually buy hardcover, but in my eagerness to read, I even bought the hardcover version, as soon as it's release; However, I must say that I'm really disappointed in the two latest chronicles, Blackwood Farm and Blood Canticle.I am no language professor or writer. I don't read to analyze/dissect the novel or anything like that. I read just for pleasure. I don't care if there's inconsistencies or some other small problems or strangeness in the novel. I only look to be able to share and enjoy the adventures with the heroes; to be drawn into the story. However, I feel alienated from the heroes. They seemed so aloof.

It was an easy read but the meanings of the stories felt to me, that Anne rice didn't want to write this. It felt like she rushed it just to meet her deadline. Let me first start by saying that we never knew at the end of \\"Taltos\\" what happened to Ash and Morrigan. That book ended good and the I did not feel that we had to go through that again and really find out what happened to them. Lestat was marvelous as always but I didn't think that the witches and vampires should have been brought together in such a way. They should have been kept separate. I would tell any Anne Rice fan to read this book but I can only hope that her next will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Lestat!?!?!","review":"I have read almost every one of Anne Rice's novels, and I have to say this is the worst one. Usually the language is poetic, yet forceful, and in this one, I thought Lestat seemed scattered and stupid. Suddenly, everything and everyone was \\"facinating\\". He talks like a 17-year old surfer, not a 200-year old well-read vampire. It almost seems like it was written by a different person. I can blame Anne Rice for some of it (though the story was good) but the editing was terrible (a slow downward trend has been noticeable for some time).

This, however, is such a departure in writing style, story-line and intensity, that I am shocked it was written by the same woman who brought us timeless stories of other vampires. Lestat seems to be written like an 18 year old surfer, using the word \\"dude\\" too many times for me to count. Mona is detached and cold. Quinn is a stumbling fool. This book lacks Lestat's charm, it also lacks Louis, Marius, Armand, Pandora and every other entertaing character she has previously brought to life. I am sad this is her last chronicle.

But \\"Blood Canticle\\" is so bad that it defies even being cataorgized as a miss. Stupid, incoherent, and mind numbingly insipid, this book should be propping up the missing leg on your sofa.Characters are eviscerated.

And for the last of the books, shouldn't they be included. Louis is reffered to once, and not even by Lestat, and Maharet sends Lestat a letter. Come on!! The book is littered with Christian refrences that just ruin it. The book is slow and again, way too much about Taltos and Mona. I WANTED LOUIS, ARMAND, AND MARIUS AT THE LEAST.

Heck, no one talks like the way Lestat talks! Get real! Slang is ok, but carried to extreme as AR does it becomes tiring and just plain irritating. It takes the focus off the story. I had to put it down after 50 pages. What's the matter with you AR? You've written enough books to know that. My guess is you needed the money to pay your bills and you weren't inspired or had any stories left in you. The BC, rather than being a labour of love is more like the results of constipation.

It should have been part of the Mayfair witches series, guest starring 2 vampires! But, I respect her as a writer, and believe that no one knows the characters better than she, so it must be right. I wasn't expecting anything cataclysmic in the end, so I wasn't shocked by the ending...it left an opening for a new book, if she ever wants to pick them up in the future.

Of course there is the part about the Mayfairs and the unnatural offspring, but that part wasn't all that interesting to me. I wish that Anne would write more books about new and different vampires, older vampires from different places and tell their life stories. That is the books I like the best.

This is a must buy and a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remind me its only 368 pages","review":"I'm in 8th grade, and usually enjoy reading Iris Johansen's work, but this was a huge disappointment.First of all, I had trouble getting into the story to begin with, it all happened so fast, without much detail. A few parts of suspense lasted for like a page, is the only thing good about this book. When I hit the 200th page I threw it at the wall and hoped to God it would end soon. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get On With IT!!!","review":"Ok. Can we please, please stop with the cookie-cutter books? I mean it's been girl gets in trouble. Male protects girl. Male has troubles of his own. Male beats up people. Female gets pissed. Female beats up people. Male and female get together when the female \\"gives in\\". Male and female live happily ever after. Until for some odd reason Iris can't think up NEW characters so she recycles her old ones. Bangs head against table repeatedly. The last book of hers I read; I knew the villain when you first meet him. I mean c'mon. This road's been trampled to death. Either think up a new story or stop wasting trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and immature","review":"Johansen books seem to be hit or miss. This book is definitely a miss. The characters reminded me of two teenagers trying to be cool, but just couldn't pull it off. Alex was too confident and pretty much told Morgan how it's going to be. Also, the constant sarcastic remarks between the two were overkill. There was no depth to the characters or plot. I think I will pass on reading anymore of Johansen's book. I'd rather spend my money on a hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why am I not surprised? Clear as mud","review":"Why am I not surprised? Ms.Johansen confirms what I knew, my female collegues don't know how to truly write suspense. The golden retriever Monty is mentioned in connection with the search-and-rescue-team, but the main figure is a two legged friend Alex, the photographerix. She has guts, foul language and braves a lot of adversities coming from the Homeland Security Team, FBI, CIA etc. Why? Good question. They like to blow up dams and mines and the President, and of course Alex is opposed to that and is therefore on the wanted list. Makes sense? The whole story is clear as mud. Best you make a list of all the players at the start, because there are plenty and sometimes you meet them by their first name and sometimes by their last. Who is who? You go back and forth. See for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks to High Heaven","review":"I read about 1/4 of this book and couldn't take it anymore. This is the first time I've read a book from this author and am not familiar with the characters. Ms. Johansen, however, does not give any good character introductions and the transition from event to the next is very sloppy. The book was so pathetic, I literally gave it away to a used bookstore before completion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I have never written a review before but I couldn't let this go. I had heard good things about Iris Johansen's books so I thought I would give it a try. It was such a disappointment. I made myself finish it but actually started another book so that I had something thoughtful to read while working my way through her book. The characters were as cliche as I have ever read. The plot didn't excite me. Unless it was free, I would never read another of Johansen's books. She obviously rides on her past performance as an author and that is unfair to all those that pour their hearts into each book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Aim CD","review":"I am so thankful I checked out this book on CD from the library rather than buying it. The narrator is terrible. She reads in a sort of low monotone voice. It's sad when a good book is narrated by a terrible narrator. I didn't get too far though before I realized this is not a good book anyway, so no big loss. If you want to hear a great narrator, try Sue Grafton's alphabet mysteries read by Judy Kaye. She is the best! I love to read, but I would almost rather hear Judy Kaye read these than read them myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment !","review":"I eagerly awaited this new book as I had read every one of her books before. I can only say that I feel really disappointed that this book is so below her other efforts. I kept having to check the author's name because I felt I was reading an Elizabeth Lowell story! All those phrases in italics is exactly how Elizabeth Lowell writes her stories. Come on Iris you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuhgeddabaudit!!","review":"This was a very disappointing book. So much so, that I will probably never purchase another by this author. The plot drifts - the ending is virtually non-existent. The book conveniently skips over what could have been considered the climax of the plot. Instead, a chapter ends - and the ending begins --- saves so much time in actually developing a plot! Use words like --- Feelings! What am I thinking!? I can't feel that! ---- good grief! thin, thin, thin.....lazy lazy lazy...too bad the author is resting on her laurels - easy money, terrible product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead aim","review":"This was very good book with alt of action. I love Iris Nohansen as a author. I would recommend this this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witness on the run","review":"I am a fan of Iris. This book kept my interest. Plot was good. Constant turn of events. Answers were not answered until the end. The growing relationship between Alex and Morgan could have had a little more attention. As well as the ending turn of events, with a little more discription. Over all a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Like a previous reviewer, I won't read Iris Johansen again. I got sick and tired of Alex's stupid attitude of shunning any protection, fighting Morgan every step of the way, and then found it hard to believe they end up in bed. Even more unbelievable is the part where Alex dictates to the assasin Runne the terms under which she will meet him, arrogantly telling him she will kill him. SNORT! Give me a break! The only reason I finished this silly tall tale of a book is that I wanted to find out what Z3 is. Now, I'm through with this author and her ridiculous heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISSAPOINTING","review":"After reading Ugly Duckling and Reap the Wing, which were both excellent and exciting from beginning to end, this book was hardto get into. I did manage to finish it in one day, but cannot say it is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last Iris Johansen book I will be reading.","review":"Wow... what a crap. I can't believe trees were cut down to print this crap-o-la. Thank goodness I borrowed this book from public library. If I had spent $1 on it, that would have been regretful.Why am I bashing this book? From this book, I found author to be someone who is only interested in sensationalism to sell her books and make $ rather than creating a story together with some intelligence and care to tickle the mind of a reader.This book has as much value as Yellowpages from Afganistan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre and amateurish","review":"This is the first and last Iris Johansen I'll read. I was expecting better. The plot is just silly and the dialogue is amateurish. This book reads as if it were written by an untalented high schooler for English class. Save your money, and read something by Janet Evanovich, Dorothy Gilman, Lee Child, Nelson Demille, or Dick Francis instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!!!","review":"No more blankets, no more towels! Love this product. It has velcro to attach to the pen. I have put mine through the washing machine! A must have to go along with the pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works but...","review":"It doesn't quite fit. It's a little bigger than it should be but, that doesn't hinder what it's used for. It's durable and can withstand minor digging."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for a rabbit","review":"When i assembled the cage and pen...and placed my rabbit in it. within minutes my rabbit started to naw threw the mat. she also started to naw threw the velcrow. It works well as a cover where the rabbit cant reach it..but definitely not a mat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product for your rabbit","review":"I wrote a review on the smaller pen also, but I want to post it here to warn rabbit owners. These pens are very dangerous because they are known to come unlatched. When this happens the curious little rabbits like to see if they can get out, for us and others this resulted in the death of the rabbit. I recommend a pen built for dogs to house your rabbits in. These seemed like a great idea at the time, but if you value your rabbit, do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Playpen for bunnies....","review":"I saw a post on how these could be dangerous for rabbits and wanted to add my 2 cents. I also have one that my 2 rabbits are currently housed in and yes, they get out! They've gotten out about 4 times in about 3 weeks. They also chew the matt/cover. I will be purchasing them something else to live in. Be very careful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leonard Maltin [once again] left clueless","review":"This film is flawless. Don't let the TRULY pretentious Shakespeare snobbery of the reviewers put you off if you're fans of the mob genre or the greatest writer of all time. Done with a more modest indie budget, it compares equally with \\"Goodfellas\\" or any other example you care to name and the Shakespearean quality remains in the timelessness of human lust for power. Maltin's talking about flashlights shows a genuine density of insight, as the character is actually wandering at night in a trance of insanity. Its not about sleeping disorders, Leonard!Turturro by the way gives this film his best performance ever and all the casting is outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dope movie","review":"This movie was one of those movies, that got me interested in the whole list of wise guy movies, like Goodfellas etc. Nice plot...nice movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It's not as if Men of Respect is a poor tranposition of the play Macbeth; it's just a bad mob movie. I was hoping to find a Godfather meets Macbeth, but instead got a Carlito's Way meets Macbeth. There was a reason I had never heard of this movie until recently. I should have known from the lame title."},{"rating":"1","title":"pink doesn't reflect","review":"I had been impressed by the video, but was disapoointed, the pink doesn't really reflect, defeating the entire idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing","review":"Ordered the blue and they don't work as in the video at all, still my son who is 5 think of them as cool but to me it was just a waste of money since they don't serve the purpose I intended when I bought them. It could be that the blue is not the best colour to chose, if you still want to get them, try yellow or white they might work better."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],H={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),b(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,C)):p("",!0)])}const R=d(B,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-4ae15a23"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/45.md","filePath":"drive/45.md"}'),x={name:"drive/45.md"},j=Object.assign(x,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,j as default};
