The train was a great addition to the collection. It's very easy for my 12 month old son to start and toddle after. It's not too noisy, either and compatible with all the other block sets. My 4 year old plays with it too, and it's nice to have something they can share!Definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"still using it a year later....","review":"My son got this toy on his 1st bday and his 2nd just passed and he still loves it. He puts it in other toys and the train pushed them too. The peek a boo blocks are cute at first but now he likes just the train. It is very cute and keeps his busy and trust me he is a very active boy. He thinks of different ways of using the train. Very highly recommended here. I still have not changed the batteries either."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG hit in our House!","review":"Our son has had this toy since he started crawling. He is almost 2 now and still loves this toy. It is easy for him to activate by himself and he enjoys putting the blocks on and watching them move.Most of our house is carpeted, but we have a small section that has foam ABC mats covering the floor. The train doesn't move at all on our carpet, but it has no problems on the mats.Durability- Everything is still fully functional, but two of the blocks that rotate when you put them on the middle car get stuck and won't spin occasionally.Overall-an awesome toy that I would highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice toy","review":"Although we have lost most of the blocks that go with this train, my nephew seem's to love when we press the button.

It's usually the first toy he goes for in the morning. He hits the smoke stack listens to the familiar, \\"Choo Choo\\" and watches the train depart to circus music. He really loves the train and the circus music isn't too annoying. I'd definitely recommend this train to everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful first train...","review":"but I have seen better prices at places like Costco. Other than that it is a very nice gift and we were so happy to receive it for our son. Very eye catching and the blocks are an added bonus.

He is now 10 months old and just loves to push this train up and down the hall. Just a great toy and a great gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real HERO","review":"Nicky Barr's life and the courage he showed, were almost too unblieveable to be true.

All the product left on the sides of the cup never melts. I think that's a waste of money. The other thing is that it works better with small amounts of hair.

I bought it and had it for sometime before trying it as I have had little success with other products. Boy was I amazed when I first tried it as it was easy to use and worked great! I love that it comes with a skin cleaner and oil to use before and after waxing. The only difficulty we (my sister and I) had was we tried using it on our lip and eyebrows while sitting in a chair - it wax had a tendency to drip. The second time we used it we laid down on the sofa and it was much easier to use. This was simple, easy to use, cost effective and worked well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I'm an experienced waxer, but this 'hard' wax was new for me. I didn't like it. I feel that you have to use way too much product to get the consistency correct so that you can then pull it off.I much prefer the 'soft' wax that you have to use cloth strips to remove. For $45 you really don't get a lot of wax. This wax is pretty - shiny blue. That makes it easy to see the tiny spots you may have missed. It heated up exactly like the instructions said it would in my microwave. But, I returned this to Sephora (which has an excellent return policy!!) after my attempt. It's just not for me.Instead, I got the 'Satin Smooth' electric wax heater and I LOVE that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rude Dog is in the house - turn it up!","review":"Put the top down, turn the volume up, and let the rhythm take you.

Scaling new heights of rock, funk, and jazz fusions, the fiery literacy behind Mclaughlin's stunning guitar work, plus Ponty's string-based inclusion make for an invigorating, and diverse set. There are several tremendous occasions throughout; bliss-filled homages to the heavens bubbling with unbelievable progressive synergy- when violently beautiful violin solos begin clashing within profound melodies on \\"Eternity's Breath Part 2\\", it still sounds like a new urgency had been set in fusion (and spiritual) greatness. It's put together a little differently then their other discs, but track for track I do not think you can dispute the depth of quality, though perhaps argue to the contrary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary!!!","review":"This summer, a good friend of mine wanted me to listen to one of their cds, so i did. it happened to be this one, and i must say that i was blown away. i heard elements from so many different styles of music and the fast paced violin riffs and amazing guitar just filled me with emotion. i had to buy it!!! now i own 4 mahavishnu orchestra cds, but this one is my favorite because, although it is experimental, it doesn't stray too far from a line. it holds together better than the other albums. now when someone asks me what my favorite groups are, i say pink floyd, the mahavishnu orchestra, and led zeppelin. no one knows who the mahavishnu orchestra is, and that's what makes it so special. it's like a private discovery! by the way, i would suggest santana, especially the boxed set, if you like the mahavishnu orchestra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic fusion","review":"An excelent album, and it is one of my favorites Mahavishnu's album.....

I bought Birds of Fire and was impressed. Then I purchased this masterpiece. Faith and Eternity's Breath part one and two and standouts not to be ignored. Cobham's insane drumming fits John's guitar like a glove. The violin is a nice surprise to a listener who usually focuses on the rock genre. Overall, just a great album, my favorite Mahavishnu record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mahavishnu I Is Better. So Is Apocalypse","review":"The Mahavishnu Orchestra, ApocalypseThe Mahavishnu Orchestra, Visions of the Emerald BeyondMahavishnu II was nowhere as good as MI, but it had its good points in this inaugural album, most notably the pristine of electric violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. McLaughlin still generates the heat but sounds like he is recycling more forceful work from earlier albums. The drumming, bass and keyboards are unexceptional but not notable. There is a pretty vocal solo by keyboardist Gayle Moran on \\"Smile of the Beyond.\\" All in all, there's too much recycled in this album, the musicians (Ponty and McLaughlin excepted) are mediocre at best, and the Buddhist propagandizing seems egregious. But at least it's better than the next album, Visions of the Emerald Beyond, which has almost nothing to recommend it, except for its moments of ersatz funk (\\"Cosmic Strut,\\" \\"Can't Stand Your Funk\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theres is a trouble with this image, is a body lotion not a perfum, be aware","review":"just be aware that this image is not according to product, this bottle of perfume showing is really a body lotion in other presentation, don't get confuse like happen to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds great","review":"I had never purchased anything online that was used before, but after receiving (it was delivered by regular mail within a week) and listening to this C.D., I was glad I took a chance.

It explains the physics of acceleration and microgravity on the level of an early reader, as well as an explanation of how a rotating space station would provide a simulation of normal gravity.I would recommend this book to anyone who has a child who will be interested in the upcoming Orion Missions to the Moon and beyond, It would be a lot better than 'Goodnight, Moon\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going down memory lane","review":"I grew up with this book when I was a kid and I loved it then so much I read it to my younger brother.

Class members discuss his ideas, and challenge each other and Seth, and Seth answers the questions they ask. If someone is curious about Seth, but has reservations about some of his statements, concepts and precepts regarding life, this is a good book to read, as some of the class members feel the same way and ask Seth the same questions all of us might want to ask.

So your tools stay in place until you are ready for them, no opening the case to find them scattered all over.

After the first 5 to 10 minutes of clips (mostly from \\"I Love Lucy\\"), the program tells little about Lucy, her life or her death. The guests are Sid Ceasar and Jerry Lewis. Neither are very touching. The questions asked by Jeff Greenfield are lame. This is not a tribute to Lucy, it's not even a decent piece of reporting by the ABC News team.

What he fails to acknowledge is that if America were made fully Islamic then what he finds so wonderful about this country would disappear. As I read the book I often wondered whether he realizes that according to his faith he is a hypocrite (a major failing for which he, as a cleric, would be destroyed in truly Islamic countries). All in all, this is a book written to make westerners feel good while the Islamic rope tightens around their throat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dodge every sensitive issue","review":"Well written but dodges every touchy issue.

The tutoring is there on command. . . and will even pull itself up when it detects your child having problems. It is NON-threatening for a new young PC user. Also the program stores your childs progress and stays at his/her level. You can look in the \\"Stats\\" to see there progress.

I expected to hear the well-recorded sounds of indigenous Appalachian birds, wildlife and maybe a trickling brook. Instead all I heard on the ENTIRE CD is just some clod endlessly plodding through dry leaves - crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch ... Once about every five minutes he stops for a few seconds where we eventually may or may not hear one feeble, poorly recorded chirp from a bird. Then he goes stomping along again.

Being a fan of his from the beginning I really didn't see any point to buying this album until I heard the new track \\"How Long.\\" This song has a totally different feel than any of his other songs and definitely shows some of his growth as an artist. It's also nice to have all of his other hit singles conveniently packaged on one cd.

How is it possible that a person dedicated to the parish would twist his way into commentary of such low quality. My question would be, what unresolved childhood issues reside within this mind?

Good book with thorough explanations (but may be considered by some too long winded). Very wordy in style, but OTOH has many examples (very important!) The style is for practioners - it's not a math or algorithms book.The bad side: no solutions on the back of the book, and no solutions manual to buy. Only instructors have access to the solutions manual.

I frequently found myself crossing out an entire paragraph and a writing summary sentence in the margin. I do not think it will make a good reference because it is very easy to get lost in its verbosity.

I haven't watched disc 2 yet, but because of the lack of quality on half of the two I have seen, I am already disappointed. Bronson movies rock, but they deserve a decent transfer to DVD.

I wish I'd had this book years ago when I was transitioning from social work to business education; and yet, I find it extremely helpful as I move now, twenty years later, from an academic environment into homebased business ownership. Dorothy Perrin Moore has interviewed hundreds of women and discovered the multitudinous ways women build careers and move through the various stages of their work lives. Excellent and encouraging examples! If you're not sure what you want to do in your work life, there are a gazillion ideas in this book! Well written and researched, Moore validates the opportunities women have today to create careers without boundaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Buy for All Interested in Women's Careers!","review":"Not since the publication of breaking the Glass Ceiling ( Addison-Wesley, 1987) has there been a book that adequately sings praise for the new career paths of women. Dot Moore's Careerpreneurs shows that there is a new brand of women - educated, savvy, and smart - who are taking control of their careers and blazing their own pathways to success. Dot Moore's Careerpreneurs is thought provoking, interesting, and provocative. The stories told by the entrepreneurial women, and their challenges in leading others, negotiating contracts, and transitioning towards success are quite memorable. A \\"Must-read\\" for anyone interested in the career literature, the entrepreneurship literature, the women and diversity literature, and even the general management literature. And a double \\"must-read\\" for any woman who is thinking about becoming an entrepreneur, or who already is blazing her own path in this day and age of the new millennium."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extremely Helpful Guide for the Female Entrepreneur","review":"I read Dr. Moore's book a year ago as I started my business as a female entrepreneur, and now a year later I re-read it- and find all the lessons even more relevant and helpful.

I have learned quite a bit over the last year, and Dr. Moore's book tremendously helped reduce my learning curve (not that it's been easy).As a self- employed consultant focusing on women's leadership, I have found especially useful the author's pointers on negotiation, how to invest my time, and how to make the most of my networking resources.

Book one alone would have made a good two hour film.Even the best attempts to condense to a single theatrical release stumble. Think of Das Boot. Sadly, Alatriste is comparable to having series like Harry Potter, Star wars or The Jewel In The Crown reduced to one movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent view","review":"I have not read the books - but I really enjoyed this movie, it is classy and very well executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a story","review":"Alatriste has some brilliant scenes. Many such as the theater and the battle scenes, were fascinating viewing. I particularly liked the costumes and setting which are good. It shows that considerable effort has gone into making them authentic for the era.The acting is also good. Some of the characters need more development. It is like their parts have been edited out.The problem is the film is we are following the life of a soldier that has no purpose. The film does not go anywhere. I suspect the story is too large for the movie and too much edited out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and realistic portrayal","review":"I have read all the Captain Alatriste books and I think the reason so much is put into the movie is for others who have not. Rather than base the movie on one or two of the books, which are really a thread of his lifetime anyway, this movie rather contains the highlights of the captain's life and times. I loved the costumes -- they were more than I would have imagined. I was shocked that Viggo spoke all his lines in Spanish and how magically the captain came to life because of it. The blood and guts of the wars; the suffering of the soldiers on both sides; and the low value of life in his times are very much represented. The books put me in mind of the old \\"swashbuckling\\" films of the 50s, but this movie elevated the subject to a much more meaningful level."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a beautiful movie that is perhaps not for everyone.","review":"I can understand why this movie hasn't been marketed in the United States. One needs to understand a bit about European history (The Hapsburgs, the 80 years war, the 30 years war, and the decline of the Spanish Empire) to understand the greater story that is being told. To tell this larger story, there are lots of characters with complex stories that each get much less screen time than would do their stories justice, and the entire arc covers at least 25 years.Ultimately, this is the story of the decline of Spanish supremacy through the eyes of a roguish larger than life swordsman in the Spanish army. It is beautiful and there are many things to love about the movie, as long as you aren't expecting a passive theatrical story-telling experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny and great acting from Anna Faris","review":"This is a great romantic comedy for mature audiences, Lots of fun and great acting performance from Anna Faris.

I purchased this to watch on a flight, expecting a typical mediocre rom-com that would at least entertain me and give me a few chuckle's for its ridiculousness. But really, you should just pass. While I normally love Anna Farris, the acting is terrible and the plot is so beyond transparent it's hard to stay interested. I at least expected a few good laughs but again, you could see the punch lines coming a mile away and the humor bordered on just plain dumb more than funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money!","review":"I had high hopes for this film, but the trailer was better the actual movie.

That's something you do when you're 17 and want to get everything out of the way before your parents come back!\\" What? The whole numbers thing is a very tenuous plot idea too, and the whole film to me was about neurotic and repressed women. Honestly, I didn't even watch the last twenty minutes as the script was just so laughable (not in the good way) that I went and boiled my own head instead.For a decent rom com look up No Strings Attached. Natalie Portman is fantastic in it, and it's far more sexually liberated than this rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dramatization of degeneracy. Vile and disgusting.","review":"The main character of this movie is a filthy whore who plunges the depths of self-degradation in pursuit of some man to love her. Her male romantic interest is a morally corrupt libertine who uses and disposes of an endless series of one-night stands. The script contains some of the most obscene dialogue and situations I've ever heard or seen in a movie. Yet, for modern America, this is a \\"romantic comedy\\", and the movie's target audience of twenty-something, White, urban professionals will identify with the utterly soulless, amoral and promiscuous protagonists. What a sad commentary on our people. What a depressing testimony to the depths to which humans can sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are these movies still even being made?!","review":"I was very disappointed in this movie. I am glad it did as horrible as it did. Is there really a \\"number\\" that women simply can't go over before they are doomed to never having a meaningful relationship? Let's not even go there with how many women men can be with before they are judged worthless. That number doesn't exist.

I was also able to overlook the flimsy door and the fact that it had less power than my previous microwave, I adjusted times accordingly. However I am giving this microwave only 1 star because I have to return it after only having used it for one month due to paint chipping off the interior. I replaced my previous 9 year old microwave because it just started to chip paint and yet this one chips after only a month. Very disappointing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Overnight Transformation from Good to Bad","review":"Everything seemed right about this compact microwave when it first arrived. I have another Sharp model elsewhere that I love and had high expectations for this one. Size was perfect. Price was perfect. My son's girlfriend remarked about how quiet it was compared to her's of another brand. And it was! Then about a month after I started using it it began to make a terrible racket and has stayed that way ever since. It emits a constant sound reminiscent of a street being jackhammered! I still use it but stare at it expecting something to happen. I also noticed that when the room is dark I can see the interior light around the control panel. Makes me wonder further about it's construction. Reviews were a mixed bag and expect I'll be soon shopping for a new microwave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact Microwave","review":"I had a larger more expensive Sharp with more wattage, but for the price, this one is excellent.

I'm not sure.","review":"I purchased this microwave from Amazon early in July and received it within a few days. After hauling it to my apartment, setting it up and plugging it in, I put some popcorn inside and waited for the magic to happen. The microwave shut down and reset itself after 20 seconds. Annoyed, I tried again, but the machine continued to turn itself off for no reason. (The popcorn was ruined.)The Amazon return policy is nice. You press a few buttons online, print out a return receipt, put the microwave back in its box, drive it to the nearest UPS, and you're done. They sent the new microwave quickly, as well. But the new reviews people have been posting for the Sharp 230K worry me. The replacement microwave works well so far (I've heated one cup of water), so I'm crossing my fingers and hoping this one lasts.In conclusion, get a microwave from Amazon, but not necessarily this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, great service","review":"After I received my first microwave, I noticed that it had a dent on the side and the metal puckered in the back a bit. I wasn't sure whether or not to return it, but finally decided to do so. Amazon was FANTASTIC about the return. The microwave they sent to replace it was double-boxed which was, frankly, very considerate! I received it in good condition and I love the microwave. The size is just right and it functions well. I'm going to take the advice that a previous reviewer gave and keep the door open for a short while after using to let it cool off and personally, I appreciate that the clock isn't bright. The microwave is roomy inside but created more counter space in my tiny kitchen. I'm very satisfied with the product and would definitely recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"peice a crap","review":"I was so dissapointed with this microwave, looks nice, works like junk. The keypad is very dark at night, so you have to turn all the kitchen lights on to see it,, the turntable makes a scratching sound now, I've only had it a month.

Unlike the image portrayed in the photos of this microwave, it is cheaply constructed. The over-excited door shoots open, so keep breakables out of the way and maybe put a bumper on the wall.

Bought it in July 2009, it's early March 2010, and it shuts itself off every five seconds. Unfortunately, I didn't fill out their warranty card and can't find my receipt (that's totally my fault, I know!)- so it looks like I'll be out the money.

I assumed that maybe it was an older model they were reviewing, or a fluke with a isolated batch of product. I got my package yesterday, set up the microwave, and upon using it for the first time I was disappointed to discover that the one I ordered was no exception. Brand new, out of the box, with a very loud, tinny rattling sound coming from somewhere in the motor. Very frustrating to have to repackage this, schedule a UPS pick-up, and send it back to Amazon for a refund. HUGE waste of time!!! I previously owned a similar Sharp model that was reliable for 10+ years, but this model is definitely a dud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke down after 6 months","review":"I'm interested to see the other comments about how this microwave died after a year because that's been my experience too.

We choose this for its compact size. We have had good luck with sharp procucts. We use multible micro waves in the kitchen of our country store. This is in constant use all day 7 days a week.

Is it one of those prominent blue buttons near the bottom? Wrong! Those aren't even buttons, they're informational labels. Is it one of the light blue buttons at the top? Wrong! That's the \\"defrost\\" function button. Where is the Start button? It's somewhere among 8 similarly labeled areas below the numeric pad, and above the blue information labels. It's not even a \\"button\\". It's a touch-sensitive label. Every time you use this product, you have to carefully read the labels, to see which one says \\"Start\\".

I needed a small microwave for the second home and looked at every 0.8 cu ft one I could find in the stores. This Sharp was the best made, making it the clear winner in its size class. In use, it has the fairly intuitive Sharp interface, heats decently at 800 watts and has performed well for for reheating, defrosting, warming plates, and other simple tasks. The only negative is that due to the light weight of the smaller size, the rotating tray comes off the track if I slide things in or out. Comparing this microwave to my GE over the stove microwave is like comparing a KIA to a BMW. The 0.8 cu ft Sharp does the job, but I don't expect it to be as well made or as much a pleasure to use as the one I paid 8X as much for."},{"rating":"1","title":"it technically works...","review":"Expect it to take twice as long as you think. i had a 1,000 watt that i replaced with this, and it's a BIG difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp Microwave","review":"Good product for the for the money.

Poor in my opinion. I can't believe that I will probably put up with this for years as I use my microwave several times a day. My husband just complained that the start button is hidden on the user display among the other buttons. Seems like there should some sort of user standards for display input. Like Power buttons in the upper left corner. Most-used buttons should be large. maybe in a special color. I like the web 2.0 look that is developing on user interfaces. No user interface should make the user feel stupid is my thought. I asked my husband what was the brand name and he said \\"Sharp\\" so even if cheap I think Sharp ought to protect the brand image.

We have limited counter space, so the size is perfect. We don't often use the preset times for defrosting/reheating, as they don't seem to work for the amount of food we put in (thus the reduction in stars). For the most part, we manually set the times and things heat/defrost great. The one preset we still want to try is the popcorn setting. Our old microwave consistently burnt our popcorn, so we're looking hoping this one works better!

We purchased this one and paid more for this Sharp brand than other lesser known brands. We've had it for 5 months, and the membranes covering the buttons are about to wear through. You can barely read the buttons now, and I fear once the membrane is stripped that the buttons will be inoperable. For a simple product from a premium Japanese brand this is simply unacceptable. Try your luck elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"Purchased this microwave in May and five weeks later it stopped working. It would get extremely hot to the touch and then fail to heat food. I am told it needs a magnetron, a major part in a microwave.

I would not recommend this machine at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shuts off after a few seconds","review":"This microwave stopped working after 6 weeks.

I have had great luck with VCR's, CD players, TV's etc. They have worked great, lasted a long time and not cost too much. When I needed a new microwave I looked on Amazon for Sharp and this one popped right up. Given my faith in Sharp I bought it.It turns out to be the noisiest microwave I ever heard. The whole kitchen rumbles from it. I even made rubber pads for under the feet but it did not help. It is also rather short on features and even at max heat setting heats stuff very slowly. I used it for a while, a little too long to return it I thought, then simply couldn't stand it any more. I went to my local \\"shopping club\\" and got a GE that is waaayyy quieter, heats stuff almost twice as fast, has much handier controls, is much more solidly built, and cost $10 less than the Sharp.

Note that the internal volume is 11 by 11 by 7 inches, so you cannot put a dish larger than 11 inches diameter inside this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very small and noisy","review":"Very small working area - you can heat only a small plate of food for one person.Device is really noisy when working.And forget about cooking in this microwave. Power is low and this device heats your food from one side only. If something will stack inside and won't rotate (what happens very often because of small working area size), then your food will be burned from one side, and remains icy from another.The worth microwave I ever had :(."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Diappointed","review":"This item was described on Amazon website as new, but had a dent on the top part when it arrived. This microwave is too small and very difficult to open the lid without holding the microwave. There is no light on the clock area and is therefore dark to see the time when the kitchen light is switched off. I owned a bigger Sharp R-23 wat microwave, but was disappointed with this one. I am thinking about buying a new microvawe."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good at this price","review":"as a compact microwave, it works just what it has to do, price is reasonable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works and looks great","review":"This is actually a great microwave - the only bummer is the clock doesn't lite up like most, so it's hard to see - also, it's a very loud microwave. However, it works great! The size is perfect too - very convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!!! Buttons will stop working.","review":"It did the job til it became defective. After a year of light use (avg 3 times a week), three of the most important buttons stopped working: the start button, power level button and minute plus button. Now the only way we can get it to heat anything is to use the popcorn button."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE - Worked for 11 months then quit","review":"I bought this microwave in Jan 2009. It worked fine for 11 months then quit. It gave no notice of any issues, just suddenly developed a sharp buzzing rattle in the engine and stopped heating the food. From the other reviews, this is an issue with this model, so I would not suggest buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of JUNK. Broke after 4 months barely using it 3 minutes a day to warm up milk","review":"This microwave stopped working yesterday, after just 4 months since purchase. I used it very little, just to warm up milk, 3 minutes in the morning. I suppose it is the front panel that seems not to be fully attached to the body of the microwave so it is probably a matter of electrical contacts in the front panel. I contacted Sharp, well of course there is no way whatsoever to talk to a human. You get the closest locations (which for me are all over 100 miles distance) and I guess if you want to ship it, then ship at your own expenses (that would cost at least 25 $ because on the website they also say you must insure the shipping).Total WASTE of 70$. Very disappointed. I will NOT buy any more Sharp microwaves ever again"},{"rating":"1","title":"It keeps dying","review":"I've bought this microwave twice (shame on me for doing it the 2nd time). The buttons on the control panel die one at a time inside a year. I now can't hit 'start' so it's dead. After two in a row, I've learned my lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3months","review":"I bought this for my sister's new place as a housewarming gift. Sadly it broke.Would I buy another one? Yes, but not this one or from this brand -- ever again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves its purpose but a little small inside","review":"I think it is a pretty good microwave but my only complaint is that even the little models keep getting bigger on the outside but not proportionately larger on the inside. Since we used ours mostly for defrosting, and heating up, all we need is something dependable. We read in consumer reports that the knobs and switches were just average so that wasnt a show stopper for us. That's because it works well and doesn't break down for a long time. In 6 years, we've owned two small Sharp \\"carousel\\" microwaves, each of which lasted for three years with no problems. Compared to our other home appliances, this is pretty impressive. Granted, their are few working parts and all microwaves are more reliable then things like toasters and blenders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Number buttons no longer work after less than 2 years","review":"Used to have a Sharp micorwave which lasted for years before the rotating table stopped turning. Bought this version which was more tedious to program: to get a 10% setting you need to press the power level 10 times. Now, after less than 2 years the number buttons are, one by one, no longer responding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Small Kitchens","review":"I have a walk through kitchen, so space is already a bit limited.This compact and looks attractive enough. Its a bit smaller than my previous microwave, but that has not stopped me from warming up the same kind of meals that I did before.Most people complain about front panel display hard to read... well, I'm short so I'm OK with it. Otherwise, it may be more of an annoyance.If you can deal with the display, this is a great microwave for tight places."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good.","review":"The first microwave I was shipped was damaged. The second was fine and is still working after one month. I like the size. Its smaller than our last one and with little counter space I think it fits nicely. A regular size dinner plate fits with spare room. We mostly use it to heat cold coffee and the leftovers we have for dinner. I would recommend it. D"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHARP 0.8 MICROWAVE","review":"Our old Sharp .7 cubic foot microwave failed, and we wanted a replacement. We liked the original, so an exact replacement would do, but was not available. The orignal was not too big, but had a square interior so we could put in larger bowls. Many of the microwaves out there do not have square interiors, so you are limited to the bowl size. Why the interior would not be square is beyond me, perhaps just to up the cubic feet. Anyway, after much serching we found this one and it is just about as large as our previous .7 cubic feet unit (we can put in the same size bowls-almost). I liked the controls on our old unit better, but perhaps only because I was used to them. In conclusion, I like this unit because the inside is square - that maximizes the size of the bowl that you can put in. No problems with the operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap appliances waste money.","review":"I owned this microwave for about 2 years before the buttons began to fail. First it was the +1 min. button. No problem, I thought, I'll just start using the number buttons. Then the 2 button wouldn't press, so i would work around this by entering times like 1:59. But how can I work around a microwave with no start button?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Microwave","review":"I purchased my Sharp R-230 800-watt microwave in June 2003, and it's still working great!! Red, black, and stainless steel are nice, but white is timeless so it's a good choice.I primarily use this for heating things up and defrosting. Once I tried to replace it with a countertop oven but quickly put it back when I realized how much it was needed. It's quality built, just the right size, and has a control panel that's dependable and nicely laid out. All told, I feel I got a lot for my money in this little microwave."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice product","review":"Little smaller than I had expected, but performs well, and expected to last a good few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective out of the box","review":"I've never bought an appliance online, sight unseen, and wish I hadn't with this one (Sharp R230KW Microwave). It was double boxed but very little packing and was inserted upside down. Although the inner box looked untouched, I wondered if it wasn't a re-sale/re-packed item. After opening the inner box, I found the glass tray and owner's manual inside the microwave and then I couldn't get the release button to pop open! I immediately packed it up and shipped it back; never again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so great recording","review":"Love the Boswell Sisters, but this wasn't as good a recording as the others. It's still worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak Book","review":"This is a weak Arts & Crafts furniture book. Many of the plans are simple and pseudo \\"Arts & Crafts\\" pieces (a CD holder?). There are a couple of nice plans, but that's it.The drawings look like they are from a budget CAD program, but that aside are quite detailed and informative.I would recommend looking at another book, such as \\"Classic Arts & Crafts Furniture You Can Build\\" by Andy Schultz or \\"The Furniture of Gustav Stickley : History, Techniques, Projects\\". Those are two really nice books, with excellent plans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak plans","review":"I have three Stickley furniture plans books and this is the weakest of them.

Yep, I could've lived without it, I guess, but I'm glad I didn't. Despite the sound quality (which, considering the source, isn't really that bad), this performance has become my favorite one over the '55 and '81 versions. It isn't as showy as the '55, nor is it as eccentric as the '81. Gould's playing is technically brilliant here, but not forced in it's display. He is more relaxed and not trying to impress. One gets the idea that he is playing \\"for himself\\", and I like that. Gouldomaniacs are probably familiar with this 1954 record, and it would be a good record for those who've never heard this Bach masterpiece. Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very fine performance, hideous recording","review":"Nearly unlistenable. Very fine performance, hideous recording; Zero dynamic range, noise from hall, etc. Either was not remastered properly or the original master tapes were bad to begin with. Not kidding here, but It sounds about as good as a cassette tape recorded on a boom box to me. Sad, because Gould did perform very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CHRISTIAN METAL BAND EVER","review":"Having lost good copies of my Bloodgood tapes..(that's right...cassette tapes, you spoiled Mp3 and Ipod users!) It was so refreshing to hear a band that has meant so much to me, especially in my early years as a Christian. Bloodgood is (they are back) the best CHRISTIAN band to combine strong, lyrics (indeed, many chorus parts and lyrics are directly from the Bible) and quality and unique metal WITHOUT COMING OFF CHEEZY!). Les's voice is similar in some respects to Queensryche and Maiden..but has a distinctive quality all its own which makes Bloodgood extremely special. Zippy Zaffiro was and is a great guitarist. I like and enjoy the new members since he left...but something special about the first 2 CD's. Keep ROCKIN! lol!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet","review":"This is a vary good cd.

My husband and I both enjoy playing Senet with the kids. It is really a fun two-player game. You toss the wooden sticks like dice onto the table and the way they land decides how many spaces you can move on the board. You can move your pieces into combinations to be safe together or to blockade other pieces from moving. But you can't stay that way too long because you have to keep moving to get all your pieces off the board and win."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you believe a wading pool?","review":"I have to admit, this is the first one of this series I have been seriously disappointed in. No finesse at all. Sounds like water being slowly sloshed around in a big plastic tub, with some birds thrown in now and then. Sounds like someone made it in their backyard with a childs' wading pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin, and magnets are a mystery","review":"I got it because it was cheap. I got what I paid for. I have no idea what the magnets said to be inside are for and it doesn't bother explaining it in the packaging. It's basically cheap foam on a cardboard backing with a thin cover. It does cushion a little, but it's not something most folks would rave about. Other than covering a hole in a worn out car seat, I'm not sure what the purpose of it is. It does have a pretty good system for strapping it to the seat, with 3 sets of connectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seat cushion","review":"This is a very comfortable seat cushion.

I was on a camping trip in Point Pleasant, PA. I was listening to a rock station in Allentown, and I heard something for the first time that sounded like a country and western song, but then it began thrashing the heebie jeebies out of me, and I ran over to CRANK IT UP!!!!!! I would find out later it was a group named War Babies, and the song was called \\"Sweetwater\\". I'd also go onto find out that they were from Seattle WA. I was mindblown again as the groups coming out of Seattle at the time were Grunge like Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Alice In Chains. War Babies sounded more like a bluesey group, and didn't fit into the picture. I'd be cranking it at high volume in my car at all times. Unfortunately, they only released one single called \\"Hang Her Up\\", and disappeared. \\"Sweetwater\\" wound up going to #2 on my heavy metal/hard rock poll for 1992. \\"Alive\\" from Pearl Jam took the top spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"On the eve of destruction in my hotel room\\"","review":"This album is a little bit country, a smidgen of metal and a whole heck of a lot of rock 'n roll! I bought this CD in 1992 right after I saw the music video for the killer \\"Hang Me Up\\" (a song about televangelists). They were played a lot on MTV's Headbangers ball when this CD came out. War Babies was a straight forward rock 'n roll band with some country rock sound to boot. Seven tracks on here are 5-star material: \\"Hang Me Up,\\" \\"The Wind,\\" the slow rocker \\"Cry Yourself to Sleep,\\" the butt-kickin' \\"Sweetwater,\\" \\"Sea of Madness,\\" \\"Satellite,\\" and \\"Big Big Sun.\\" The rest are good as well. There is a metal influence on this CD but more of the goodtime rock 'n roll type; not the dark, heavy type. I definitely recommend this CD to any fan of crunchy guitar, screaming vocalist, country rock. Shop around though as the extra tracks on this pricey import do not seem like much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too opinionated for it's own good","review":"While the subject matter is excellent, the authours opinion is too prevalent.JD Cardwell considers all sailboats under 22' as \\"not really cruisers\\". There are many on the water that would disagree. While a bigger trailerable may be more comfortable, it's also harder to tow, and more expensive.The authour needlessly runs the risk of pushing the dream beyond the scope of those with limited resources.This book may be considered valuable by those with or considering boats between 22 to 26 feet, but probably not to others.Lastly, the authour obviously places more importance on creature comfort than seaworthiness, O.K. for the marina crowd, but offensive to the true cruising sailor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly shallow","review":"Only the first few pages of this book contain anything of value--a discussion of the virtues of going small vs. large.

If you are looking at small boats and have not purchased yet this book will be very helpful. If you own a small boat this book will suggest many good ideas for upgrading your boat. I like the organization of this book excellent TOC page; good index. Chapters are well organized and clearly written with summaries at the end of each chapter. Length =240 pages. 9 Chapters. Covers used boat buying and trailers as well. If you are looking at the purchase of a trailer sailer this is a good guide.

And it doesn't seem to occur to little kids (just learning to count) that the lady bugs might be getting eaten, but the idea keeps me entertained every time.The book has great colorful artwork and the bugs stick out.

She would put her finger on each one while I counted and now she can do it herself. My one year old now has me put her finger on each ladybug while I count, just to be like her big sister.

It takes it to the next level of Buck Owens influenced sounds with Dwight's own signature melodies and style his longtime fans are well familiar with. Unlike most country artists of today, Yoakam writes and plays what he wants, never to sell out and use poppy \\"hit makers\\" other artists rely on.

I have been a fan of Dwight's since his first album and yes, my expectations are high, but he's surpassed them this time. If you like Dwight, or if you just like good music, then buy this. Listen to only one song: \\"I Was There\\" - it should be enough to convince you. He's a genius both as a writer and as a perfomer. What is wrong with your Country Music Assocation? Why do they keep giving awards to people who are only a tenth as deserving as Dwight? They should be showering awards on this man - he's a national treasure and you are lucky to have him.

Cheap Trick's \\"I Want You To Want Me\\" adapts perfectly to Yoakam's style and is a winner also. Its a great CD but I don't think the title \\"Tommorrows Sounds Today\\" is appropriate. Dwight had a more progressive sound on his \\"This Time\\" album than this one. A more appropriate title might be \\"More of the Same Sound you Already Love\\" BUY IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it!","review":"Some folks say \\"Hillbilly Deluxe\\" or \\"This Time\\" were the finest Dwight albums ever. I strongly disagree. This is the one. If Dwight never released another album or never sang another note, we'd still have \\"Tomorrow's Sounds Today\\". You cannot (and will not) EVER find a country music album so complete. Hey, this album should be required listening for any fan of country music. I can't pick one song that stands out on this whole album; they are all equally good. I dont think I can say enough about the quality of this piece, but it is by far the finest Country Music album of the past 30 years; and you can take that to the bank! A++++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one really grows on you","review":"I'll admit that I had to listen to \\"Tomorrow's Sounds Today\\" more than once to fully appreciate it, but yep, it's a keeper. Never being one to disappoint, Yoakam has managed to give us another wonderful album full of the consistently great tunes and insightful lyrics that fans have come to expect over the years.As someone who prefers Yoakam's rock \`n roll side, I particularly enjoyed \\"Dreams of Clay\\" and \\"Free to Go.\\" I may be alone in this, but I thought I sensed a little Allman Brothers influence in the latter. A pleasant surprise worth noting are the \\"Bonus Bucks,\\" two duets with pal Buck Owens (Owens actually appears on three tracks). This may not be Yoakam's strongest effort to date, but a definite must-have addition to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dwight Delivers","review":"\\"Tomorrow's Sounds Today\\" is Dwight's best CD since \\"This Time.\\" Gary Morse's trebly-twangy-Brumley-Bakersfield steel playing is a definite album highlight. Dwight's singing is heartfelt, the songs are well-crafted, and Pete Anderson's guitar playing and producing continue to amaze. Icing on the cake is hearing Buck Owens and Dwight 'together again.'

As a publication, it leaves a fair amount to be desired, not the least of which would be the quality of editing provided by iUniverse. I couldn't concentrate on the book because I was too busy dealing with the errors all over the place.As a novel, Roman's work is a decent start--unfortunately, having been started out in a serialized form, it doesn't make the transition to a novel very well.

At under 200 pages, a quick read.Wizard is a story that had a great deal of potential had it been developed differently. Sophy's self-depricating manner of handling her issues of not living up to her parents's expectations and rebelling against all things academic grew tiresome very quickly. That Max took advantage of her when she was most vulnerable seemed terribly out-of-character for him, and tarnished his image and his likability in my eyes. The resulting conflict and bickering that ensued between them was so awful it became almost unbearable to read. The same storyline could have been presented so much better, which would have turned this into a very sweet and realistic feel-good romance, rather than something that was an unsatisfying struggle to muddle though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ice Symphonies","review":"I bought this without any expectations.

It's problems are many...1. No variable speed control.2. VERY weak clutch which is not adjustable either.3. Despite being Lithium Ion powered, it has a very low battery life.I was foolish enough to believe that the quality people at Makita would never let a product of this terrible quality go into production.

I actually bought this tool for my wife to use because she wanted a smaller and lighter driver to use in the house.The biggest drawback is that it doesn't have variable speed. So its either full speed or nothing. That can be a pain if you want a little more control in certain situations, like starting a screw in a tight space.

This thing is too much tool for what I had in mind and I am going to return it and replace with something a little smaller. It has no variable speed which makes it kind of overkill for the kind of tool I had in mind. I am afraid I would break more things than I would fix if I tried to use this and I already have 2 or 3 drills in my workshop.

If that's not enough, it also includes the chest measurement, garment length, and sleeve length for each size. As long as you check your gauge, this makes it easy to adjust the pattern for a perfect fit.

A couple of times I thought \\"why couldn't I think of this myself!\\" - well, I don't have to, thanks to Sally's visions.Both of the books are well made for the beginner, you don't have to start with the first one, though I would recommend it.

Is he writing for shock value, or is there a darker agenda hidden here? Questionable statistics, and even more questionable conclusions.

A shameless attack on NFL players that simply promotes prejudice without any enlightening social content in evidence. Pathetic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not a good read","review":"Having read and enjoyed Benedict's earlier effort, \\"Pro's and Cons\\", I was anxiously awaiting this book and was subsequently thoroughly let down.

I've read several World War II related books lately, especially about the Nazis.

I highly recommend this book! It made me cry and it made me hopeful for any victims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life's Value.","review":"Every book that I've read on the holocaust contains descriptions of the horrors that man are capable of exerting on fellow man. Simultaneously, each one also differs in very interesting ways that make it unique. I appreciate Gerda Klein's simple writing, and how well she expresses her feelings and experiences.Books like \\"All But My Life\\" help keep the past (however dark) alive. I think that human beings have a lot to learn from such memoirs - politics, society, and human nature - it's all there. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most amazing story","review":"It is powerful to listen to this book in a voice that could be the author's.

It isn't filled with anything but her actual experience. It's a side of the victim's that needs to be heard and isn't dressed up or invented in any way. It has to be the best and most educating book I have read on the subject. I can not recommend it enough. And it will fill you with all sorts of emotions, while preserving the memory of those lost in that terrible time. It's a story that should have been told over and over again, let us never forget those people."},{"rating":"2","title":"All But My Life","review":"I had already read the book and had been fortunate enough to meet the author.

I am blessed to have read her story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST memoir on the holocaust that I've read","review":"I have read numerous accounts of holocaust survivors; all similar stories, yet each one seems as if I've never read anything so horrific before. All But My life was so very hard to put down. I wanted to spend every waking moment reading. My daughter is now reading it and feels the same as I do.As the daughter of a Hungarian Jewish immigrant, fortunate enough to leave Hungary before the war, I cannot fathom such hatred and disregard for human life. Yet, the anti-semitism still exists today even though we all know the horrors of what happened at the hands of Nazis!This book is a MUST read! I give honor and respect to Gerda Weissmann Klein for the strength to endure what she did, to write about it and to continue to talk to everyone about the holocaust. My only wish would be to meet this very courageous woman - and listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgettable story","review":"I have just finished reading All But My Life. I was deeply moved by Gerda's strength, but I have also come to admire the language she uses in her memoir. It's amazing that Klein has survived so much and can still retell her tale with such vivid detail. One of the things I enjoyed about her writing was the way she told the reader what would happen to a certain character in the future. For example, when her father is leaving , she writes, \\"We watched until the train was out of sight. I never saw my father again\\". Although some readers may be disappointed because they know what will happen, I think that this makes a much stronger impact. The reader knows what Gerda doesn't yet know, and it makes her struggle that much more unforgettable. I would strongly recommend this book to everyone, it's a story that needs to be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"I loved it.

All But My LIfe is one of the best written, most informative, and frankest of them all, a must-read volume for those of us \\"outsiders\\" who would attempt to get as \\"inside\\" as possible. The narrative is seamless, and engaging. Recall is selective, cogent, and yet also revealing. Irony, wit, and judgments add much of value. All in all, this memoir would seem to warrant all the acclaim it has earned to date - and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Just when you think the human spirit can endure no more, this story proves that thinking very wrong.

Writing in the first-person must agree with her. Though there were a few parts of the book that could have been developed more (like the relationship of Ellie and Pete), and a few parts that seemed to be thrown in to make everything fit together, Daddy's Little Girl is one of Clark's best and a must-read for anyone who loves a good mystery. This books leaves the reader wanting more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"im disappointed","review":"As an avid fan of MHC, I have read all her books, but I am quite disappointed with her latest. When I pick up one of her books I am always positive that I will find suspense and surprise with each page I turn, and the end is always a complete surprise. Daddy's Little Girl created no suspense and was completely predictable. I enjoyed reading it simply because she is a fabulous author no matter what, but this is not one of her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Mind of Suspense","review":"Mary Higgins Clark has truely out done herself in this new book \\"Daddy's Little Girl\\". From the moment I picked up this book I could not turn the pages fast enough to find out what was going to happen next. As always she has you changing your mind on who dunn it until the very end. The people who come to her (Ellie's) rescue will surprise you also.I'm sure that there are many people out there that can relate to the title \\"Daddy's Little Girl\\" and how the youngest daughter (Ellie) feels. It may make you think differently about things in your own life.Have fun reading and I can not wait for her next novel to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary Higgins At Her Worst","review":"When I saw this book I was so excited to read it. At first I was really into it but then later on it just turned me off. There was no suspense in this book and you knew who the killer was.DON'T READ AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK YETI knew that Paulie wasn't the killer. He was too stupid and helpless to d something like that. The whole book was pretty obvious. I also missed the usual romance that MHC usually adds to her book. The whole thing b/w Ellie and Pete just wasn't enough. The end of the book with the one year later thing diudn't seem to fit. It just seemed like a hasty ending to a not so good book. I was left feeling deceived after reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"major disappointment","review":"I eagerly await any new Mary Higgins Clark book.

Damsel in distress, with the odds stacked against her, manages to unveil the bad guy and find love in the process. Year after year Clark churns out the same predictable plot, and while it seems monotonus, you have to hand it to her, she's created a successful market. Read this if you don't want to be surprised in the end or if you're loyal to Clark's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real page turner?","review":"I read this book so fast, not that it was good, it was just to get through it.

She grows up and becomes a reporter and investagates her sister's death.I recommend this book to everyone who likes mystery's. It is really good. Your always wondering about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you expect from MHC but left me in tears","review":"This is not a typical MHC book and I agree that it was pretty clear who the murderer was. But,unlike her other books, this one was rich on character description (Ellie) and just the whole concept of her risking her life to find out more about her sister's death and coming to terms with her father and realizing that although it might have seemed that he did not care about her, she was also his little daddy's girl-well this all was so touching and compelling, it made me cry. So, if you are looking for another whodunit story, this probably would seem like a waste of time to you. But,if all other advantages I described above,appeal to you, then by all means-pick up a copy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This is a great book, I couldn't put it down. I love Mary Higgins Clark and this book is now one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum........","review":"I kept waiting for a story to grab me like many of Mary Higgins Clark's earlier fare, but this one didn't do it, sad to say. Rather plodding and lackluster. I wonder at the proof-reading skills of the editor because on page 29 it said Ellie was 30 and on page 143 it said at the same time that she was 29 during the same incident . Also it said on page 139 that a cheese, lettuce & tomato sandwich was all that there was to eat (refrigerated items obviously) and on page 144 it said \\"I also did not want to empty the refrigerator\\" What was there to empty? (please note: I quote these pages from the paperback version). I know these are small things, but it shows how poorly the story was for me to even be able to pick up on these errors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"14 year olds review","review":"I think this book was awsome and once i started readin it i couldn't put it down it's awsome and i'm going to buy all her other books. I think it was really sad what happend to Ellie's sister and I though that she should have been close with her father even though what happend becasue some of us don't always have a good father even though if it's just fiction.

The story of Ellie Cavanaugh and her quest to pursue her sister's murderer is quite enticing. While I found the story to be slightly less suspenseful than some of Clark's previous novels, I thought that the character development in this novel was much more cultivated.It's certainly a different Mary Higgins Clark novel, but it's still a great read (as always!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Was Such a Disappointment","review":"I am such a big fan of Mary Higgins Clark that I went to the book store oping to get a copy of Daddy's Little Girl, the day before it was released. No luck, but I did buy the book on the day it was released and decided to spend my lunch hour reading one of my favorite authors' works. What a disappointment! This story is told in a series of endless flashbacks and even the passages that are supposed to take place in the present are a continual rehashing of the the back story.I wanted to return my book but out of respect for Clark, decided to hold to it. I'll be waiting on line for her next book too, but this time I will read several chapters (I enjoyed the first four chapters available on line) before I make the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"From the very beginning, you knew the ending. What puzzles me, though, is that most of the book seems to have been written by a ghost writer. Very few pages were written in her style. [For instance, she usually likes to use verbiage such as, \\"festive\\" or \\"fabulous\\" and also gets into clothing descriptions]. Actually, it was a pleasant reprieve from the usual Danielle Steel style of writing. For that, I give it the two stars. I also found the main character to be a little ditsy. Who in their right mind would stand in front of a large prison, as inmates are being released on parole, holding up a sign with her phone number on it? It wasn't believable.I liked Mary Higgens Clark's first few books the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phoning it in","review":"Although her books are formulaic to say the least, I generally enjoy MHC's books quite a bit. The heroines are fun, the plots are enjoyable, and the villain is not always obvious, making for suspenseful reading. It was disappointing, therefore, to read her latest, as the heroine was deadly dull and the story was predictable and flat (in fact, it appeared to me that MHC must have been having some trouble thinking of an interesting story as, instead of her usual creativity, we are treated to a rip-off of the Martha Moxley murder here; how appropriate that the book was released almost to the day of the Skakel trial's opening). Hope this putrid approximation of a MHC novel isn't a harbinger of books to come...."},{"rating":"1","title":"So where was the big mystery???","review":"I have read all of MHC's books.Her earlier books were so much better.There was a sense of mystery in them.This latest book is entertaining,but I kept waiting for the big suspenseful ending.Unfortunately,there wasn't one.The book wasn't suspenseful at all. It was entertaining,but not worth the money to buy it.Pick it up at your local library instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I usually enjoy MHC's books, but this one is AWFUL! I borrowed it from a cousin, thank the Lord, or I'd be right at the bookstore returning this. This book was not only boring, but predictable too. Not a good combination. And I totally saw the \\"union\\" at the end. Just terrible.the pieces fell together to cleanly.

But, it the middle it got a little slow. It was boring because there was really nothing good happening at this time in the book. But, towards the end it sped up and became more interesting. I think that the author could have put more detail and things going on in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe she did it!","review":"I must confess that I've condemmed Ms. Higgins' latest effort without reading it! I can't get past the fact that she's written in the first person and revealed the culprit early on. I've read every book published by Ms. Higgins and I always look forward each Spring to reading her latest. Unfortunately, I have almost a phobia about reading first person books -- I feel as if I'm missing out on the perspectives of other characters and I can't get past that. Call me shallow; but it's a fact. Coupling that with no culprit revealed at the end of the book makes it impossible for me to even crack the cover. Ironically, I'd just sat down at the computer to order the book from Amazon and now I have to find something else to read. Sorry, Ms. Clark. I've loved your books in the past and I've always bought them in hardcover; I have quite a collection. Maybe next time....... huh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I am a long time fan of Mary Higgins Clark and had waited with great anticipation for this book. The lead character was flat, the plot and who-done-it was known from the beggining. No real suspense. I couldn't even tell that the lead character was involved in a romance until the very end when she married the guy. This was Ms. Clark's first time writing only in the first person, perhaps that affected her. Hope she goes back to her former winning style! Don't buy this in hardback, not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was actually quite disappointed in this novel from Ms. Clark. I am an avid reader of her books and always look forward to the next. However, this one did not in any way live up to her reputation as the queen of Mystery Writers. It was suspensful, but did not end with its(story) in a conclusion other than one in a documentory.Ellie did not encounter as the heroine the many obstacle and hairline mishaps that heroines in other of Ms. Clark's books have had to endure. This was truly an elaboration on a real crime and I can only hope this will not further lead to other stories or a trend by the author. Please go back to your usual style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this novel","review":"This novel was a big disappointment for me. I've read other MHC novels before and enjoyed most of them, but this was just bad. Andrea, a teenager, is murdered and a rich boy is found guilty. Twenty years later, the murderer is going out on parole and he's produced a witness out of thin air that puts the blame on someone else and he's looking for a second trial. Andrea's sister is determined to prove he was the killer without shadow of a doubt and, here's the main problem - she succeeds with almost no effort. Everything works well for her. She discovers leads that all point to him and gets outs of a couple of attempts against her life with just a scratch. Throughout the novel you're led to believe that she is wrong, that someone else was really the killer, but the disappointing truth is she's been always right! This \\"novel\\" is just a short story inflated to occupy several pages.

I had originally chosen \\"Second Chance\\", but realized that this was a sequel.So my book club ended up with this. I was not really thrilled about this book. To me it seemed to drag and the suspense was far and few. Maybe I am just used to Mr. Patterson's writing that keeps me on the edge of my seat.The book stressed the guilt that the character Ellie had been carrying for her life. She felt guilty for her sister's death and that was prominent through the book. It never really had the suspense during her journey to investiagte her sister's death. Just a little bit of a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a wonderful murder story","review":"This book is a wonderful murder story. I rate this book a five because it's uniquely planned and the clues just keep on adding up. It's a detective story with a perfect ending.

There was absolutely on mystery or suspense in this book. I was expecting one hell of a surprise or twist at the end because the books was SO predictable. Character development is pretty much absent, too. I give it two stars instead of one mainly because I actually enjoyed reading the novel. It was just that at the end I felt tricked. As another reviewer put it... \\"That's it?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Did MHC really write this?","review":"I have to admit I listened to this rather than read it, but from the beginning I had a hard time believing that MHC wrote this. It was very amateurish. Not up to par at all. Very repetitious and who writes a mystery where the person suspected at the beginning is the actual culprit. No mystery there. I didn't totally hate it but it was defiantly not close to a favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I'm a long-time fan of Mary Higgins Clark, so was really looking forward to curling up on the sofa with her latest, \\"Daddy's Little Girl\\". What a huge disappointment that it was written in the first person. I didn't make it past the second chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"Readers of MHC will be extrmemly disappointed in her new work. Considering how many best-selling authors don't write their own stuff anymore, you have to wonder if MHc wrote this or a ghost writer. Readers can figure out the entire, predicatable plot within the first 10 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time....","review":"This book doesn't even deserve a star. The story is so boring and I feel this book is an insult to my intelligence. They tell you who the killer is from the beginning and the killer already served his sentence. So what's the point of the book? just to WASTE your time and fool you into thinking there's a twist. I even feel like the heroine is the psycho.Definitely not a suspense! I wish I can refund this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Style, Little Substance","review":"Daddy's Little Girl is a stylish speed-read, but even as a plot-driven thriller it falls short. Violent but engaging in the earlier chapters, the book quickly devolves into a series of convenient close-brush-with-death events culminating in a sleep-inducing ending. People who love pictures of cute little puppy dogs and babies dressed as sunflowers should have no problem with the last two-thirds of this book, which is as patently undisturbing as the first few chapters are needlessly sensational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should I keep going?","review":"This was the first book I've read by her and i was BORED. Some books get you to spend the entire reading guessing how it's going to end (making you feel pretty smart if you guessed something close, or happy the book had such an unpredictable ending if you weren't) but this book needed no guessing. We knew who did it, how he did it, and surprise! he killed another person that we know nothing about and have no attachments to. I hear MHC usually writes a decent book...but this was a bad introduction to her collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Clark I've read","review":"This is the worst, more boring MHC book that I've read. The last one I read, On the Street Where you Live, was bad enough, but this was just plain awful. The heroine was not compelling, the plot was dreary and predictable. I kept expecting a twist, but nothing happened. Also, the proof reading was deplorable. Did MHC actually write this thing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly predictable and simplistic!","review":"I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this book. I have read several of Mary Higgins Clark's novels and have found them quite entertaining...that's why I find it so hard to believe that this is by the same author.There really was no mystery to this book - it is obvious who the criminal is from the very beginning and there are none of the necessary twists in plot that make for an intriguing mystery. It was all just too simplistic and obvious for me....Maybe this is the typical example of a well-known author being able to publish and sell anything simply based on previous accomplishments!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best by Mrs. Clark","review":"I love Mary Higgens Clark and couldn't wait till Daddy's Little Girl was released. I was quite disappointed. First, the killer is revealed very early in the novel and really all you wind up reading about is who is following Ellie around. I'm use to reading a Clark book and guessing who dun it till the last page. Unfortunetly this was not what this book was about. After finishing last night i was very disappointed and felt that most of the chapters had nothing to do with the storyline and were more or less to expand the book. Hopefully, this was just a fluke book by Mrs. Clark and her next will be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"Since so many people enjoy her books I thought I would give her a try. I purchased this and another one of her books since it was on sale. I had never read anything by her before. It was awful. There was very little character development and I didn't care what happened to any of them. After reading this I bought the other back without ever reading it. It reminded me of the one Danielle Steele novel I read years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distraught and Disappointed","review":"This book was a very disappointing read. I found it to be bland and predictable. You know from the first few chapters what was going to happen. There was nothing to pull the reader in and the only reason you would finish it would be because you would feel some type of obligation to yourself to finish what you started. The author leads you on a long and tedious path only to end it where you already knew what happened.The only reason I gave it two stars was because of the emotional and spiritual growing \\"Ellie\\" does."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story told in the first person!","review":"This was a great book, which took me all of two days to read, as I could not put it down. I am a Mary Higgins Clark fan and have read everything by her. This is her first book told from the first person point of view and it really works!Ellie, an investigative reporter and the younger sister of a murdered girl, sets off to prove the murderer's guilt when he is released from prison twenty-two years later. He has almost the whole town believing that he is an innocent man who has served time for someone else's crime. Of course, someone believes that Ellie must be stopped and her life is put in jeopardy.This is a book full of suspense that had me on the edge of my seat. I hope Ms. Clark brings back Ellie in another book (like she did with Alvirah).

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed information","review":"This cookbook is not just a list of recipes but an interesting biographical journey into the interior. Grace Young writes well about her family providing a personal context for the recipes that she provides.I found the information very good indeed. It is rare to find in one location certain details about buying produce and items from an asian grocery store.The section on what the sauces, vegetables and other items that you can find at the grocers is nice indeed. Usually you would have had to buy a book dedicated to this, but Young provides a good section to get you through.This is my favorite Chinese cookbook so far this year. I find material for personal reflection and also, a source for Chinese food information (almond soup being good for the skin).I agree that Young could have been more lavish with technique and photos but she did very well otherwise. Also, the indexing could have been more detailed, but these are small quibles.Good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen: Classic Family Recipes","review":"I am a Chineses food lover.

We found most of them in this book and we had been using it quite often. The instruction is clear and dishes are relatively easy to make. However, I would like to see more pictures (of the final product and the preperation steps) in the next edition. We like the book so much that we purchased multiple copies as gifts to friends.Highly recommended. If there are more pictures, I will give it a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Authentic Chinese","review":"I lived in San Francisco for about 10 years. I was truly thrilled to see my favorite Chinese restaurants and places shown as illustrations in the book. To my surprise, the recipes came out almost exactly like the ones I remember from my favorite restaurants! This cook book delivers the real goods, in a very well produced book. It is a pleasure to use. I tried several of the healing/balance recipes and they worked well for their declared use. That is not to say they were easy to down, I found them very far from pleasant. I guess that is the price one pays for trying traditional Chinese medicine"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource","review":"Although I'm waiting try the new hikes detailed in this book (I'll wait till summer passes, thanks), I have found it to be a great read on its own merits. The physical descriptions of the areas covered are detailed and evocative without being flowery; the driving and trail directions are as exact as they can be given the remoteness of some of these areas. Mr. Zdon knows these places inside and out, and he goes well beyond the obvious choices into some wild and relatively unexplored terrain. This book introduced me to some new places I want to experience, and made me realize I don't know my \\"familiar\\" spots as well as I thought. The volume is also very handsomely illustrated and produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Beginning to Arthurian Legend","review":"I love the entire Pendragon Cycle because of this first book, Taliesin. It's beautiful: The history of Atlantis, the early prophecies, the life of Charis and the baby boy Taliesin wrapped in seal fur. The characters are deep and rich; Lawhead creates the perfect foundation to this legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new legend is born","review":"If you can say that writing a book is quite simple then creating a myth can be a really tough job. It is difficult to know where to use your fantasy and where to use pure historical facts. I guess for Stephen Lawhead, his job would have been extremely difficult since his competitors have been establishing their fantastic view for centuries now and have created the most world famous legends heard and told. Despite the difficultness, Lawhead has done surprisingly well!! He has put history in its right position! A new legend is born,new characters find their positions next to King Arthur and readers'fantasy advances to a higher level. New tragic and heroic tales shall be sang by all the modern bards.I hope that the sequels prove to be as thrilling and legendary as this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on what you're looking for....","review":"The story is well-written and the characters are endearing, but...Taliesin journeys to the Otherworld and finds there... the White God? Seriously?! The most legendary Druid Bard who ever lived (maybe?) turned into the World's First Evangelical Christian was very painful to witness. And the light hand with history was also cringe-worthy. If you have only the most cursory interest in and knowledge about Celtic history, Druids, the Atlantis myth, the Cymry people, Wales, and the Arthurian Legend, you may enjoy this book. But if you are interested in these subjects and know a thing or two about them, this book will probably deeply hurt you.All that said... there are some passages which are beautifully crafted and quote-worthy. Just... not the ones which have anything to do with the spiritual path of the world's most famous Druids (whether myth or real) or history even in the lightest concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me...","review":"or is this book seriously anachronistic? References to: potatoes, Fir trees, war horses. Not very authentic. Sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not based on accurate historical information","review":"This was the first and only book of Stephen Lawhead I've read. It's also my last. As a pantheist and druid, I find Taliesin's conversion to christianity offensive. The early christian church has already stolen and corrupted most of the pagan gods and holidays, now the author is trying to take Taliesin. Read this book only if you want a diffused, rambling story with no hint of real historical facts"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just Bad, but offensive as well.","review":"I was not expecting to be blown away by this book, but I was also not expecting to have my time wasted with Christian Romantasy. Taliesin, one of the most ancient and powerful figures in Celtic and British Myth,a converted Christian?! The idea is patently absurd. I could go on, but this kind of tripe makes my head hurt to even think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Taliesin\\" is simply my favorite book.","review":"\\"Taliesin\\" is my favorite book I've ever read and I am a Literature major at Cambridge. That should tell you somthing. It has strong-points in every field that make a piece of writing a classic: great characters,rich plot that will keep you reading for hours,intense drama,and a tour of a world so beautiful, only an author like Lawhead could create it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest stories I've ever read.","review":"Taliesin is such a great book! Lawhead really builds his characters so well. Charis and Taliesin paint out such a story as to impress even the greatest of the great authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story without a plot","review":"Could be a good story, but the excessive detail drags the whole book down. There is no real central issue which the book revolves around; just following the lives and experiences of various characters. The whole third section of the book seems to be devoted to a Christian agenda. Followers of Calvin converting Merlin to Christianity? Long exposes on the meaning of the 'one true god.' Now Taliesin refers to others as Pagans. Seems to be the central motif of the later part of this book. Many much better fantasy novels revolving around these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A puzzling disappointment","review":"Lawhead is undeniably a good talespinner, but this was too much fantasy and too little Arthurian Britain. The technique of placing Atlantis, said by Plato to have sunk around 9,000 BC, to be contemporary with 5th Century AD Britain, is just too preposterous to stand up. The character of Taliesin is superficial, nowhere near as fleshed out as that of Charis, his wife. It was not quite straightforward fantasy, not quite historical fiction, and the saintly characterizations of the Christians (nothing is said about the darker aspects of exterminating paganism) was too sugary. I expected better from Lawhead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Christian Fantasy","review":"Lawhead incorporates the Arthurian fantasy world with the Ideals of Christendom for an enjoyable scenario. Sometimes it is very slow paced, while others are fascinating and exciting. It was interesting, but i've not read any of the sequels following it in the past few years since reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Fantasy than Historical Fiction","review":"This was a very enjoyable book to read. While realizing that the story of Arthur is mythical, when I purchased the book I was expecting historical fiction. I would have to say however, that this book is more fantasy, given the story of Charis and Atlantis as well as the finding of Taliesin and his trips to the Otherworld. That is not to say that the book is not historically accurate. When the book does discuss Britain, it is for the most part historically accurate. Lawhead does an incredible job of character development, which is increasingly becoming a lost art in this age of \\"action and adventure\\". I plan on reading the Pendragon Cycle, and while I haven't read the other books, I'm not sure that I would recommend this as a stand-alone read. Throughout the book, my sense was that this was an introduction to a much longer story that what was contained solely in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Me","review":"A decent read, one that I was enjoying, until it got REALLY preachy about 2/3 of the way through the book. I picked the book up knowing the the author was a Christian, and it didn't stop me: I'd be a fool and a biggot to choose not to read a book based solely on the author's beliefs...but then he started to cram those beliefs down my throat. And THAT'S when I put the book down, unfinished, never to pick it up again. To quote Homer Simpson:\\"Awwww...this isn't about *Jesus* is it?\\"Sorry Homer, I'm afraid it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silliest Arthurian book ever written","review":"Having read previous reviwes, I noticed that some disapproved of Taliesin (Merlin, Arthur etc.) being made christians because of their own religious belived. I am myself a christian, but I am also a welsh-speaker who finds the celtic history and culture being ridiculed in this book. Lawhead wants us to believe that Atlantis had anything to do with King Arthur and Celtic Britain, a time-gap of almost 5.000 years, he says that Germanic tribes LIBERATED Britain from the Romans! The Romans had left long before these Germanic tribes enslaved Britain. King Arthur and Merlin is Mr. Lawhead's way of making cheap money out of a subject that he is totaly unaware of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor history","review":"Although the story of Charis and Taliesin is an interesting one, and reasonably well written, I could not finish the book. Lawhead places Atlantis at the same time the Romans are occupying Britain. Plato (b. c. 427 b.c.e.) spoke of Atlantis being an ancient city and other authors have placed Atlantis about the same time as the Minoans (c. 1500 b.c.e.). The Roman occupation of Britain started with Julius Caesar (55-54 b.c.e). These two are not contemporaneous. I much prefer my historical fiction to be reasonably historical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever","review":"This was AWFUL. The first two thirds were entertaining. But in the third section, just when Taliesin was starting to get awesome, he becomes a Christian which apparently is equivalent to being boring and one dimensional. I'm a Christian, so when i read this portion of the book it thoroughly disappointed me. Lawhead could have provided an entertaining story but instead he decided that he wanted to provide an uninspired and uninteresting ending to an otherwise good story. What a waste. Don't but this book. If you REALLY want to read it just borrow it from the library or borrow it from a friend who made the mistake of buying it. I got it at a yard sale; i wish i had spent my quarter on just about anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written piece of tripe...","review":"...unless you are a charismatic Christian whocannot open a novel unless it somehow involvesthe greatness and correctness of Christianity.I slogged through page after page of overdescriptiveprose (hint to aspiring writers: writing at lengthabout someone's boredom is boring) only to have itdawn on me that the whole work is just a set up forlots of misguided pagans to discover the True Way.I love and respect the works of CS Lewis. I don'thave a problem with Christian fiction. I haveno problem with writers expressing their world view--that's the whole point of writing. But for God's sake(really), don't be dishonest about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Descriptive, and Enjoyable even for the 5th read!","review":"In preparation for Lawhead's upcoming release of Avalon I am re-reading the Pendragon Cycle beginning with Taliesin. The book is wonderful. Lawhead evokes grand and fantastic images in my head as I read his books and Taliesin is one of the best. I sincerely love the characters; they are very wonderful people. This is one of those rare stories that also lift my heart to live life more fully. Even though I have read this book many times, I still laughed and cried aloud at new and familiar points in the story. I also discovered a key plot point that I had somehow missed in the first 4 reads. What a great book! May Taliesin live forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the effort!","review":"I had some difficulty getting into this book, and struggled for the first third of the book. The chapters alternate between two separate storylines until the last third, and this can be a little disorienting. For me, jumping between storylines made it harder to connect with the characters. For a time I had to turn back a chapter to reacquaint myself with what had happened previously. Normally I would have set aside a book like this, but I kept reading because it came highly recommended. I am glad I did. The character development is in depth, the landscapes are vividly portrayed and the story really comes together in the last third of the book. The range of emotion the main characters travel through had me up late and unable to go to sleep after I finished. I will be reading the rest of this series and other Stephen R. Lawhead books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Taliesin is an amazing book. My dad has a paper back copy that I've read before so decided to by this one when I saw it online.

I really enjoyed learning about Taliesin, and how Lawhead interwove the famous Celtic bard in the Arthurian mythos. Great story telling and the series only gets better after this novel, although it is my favorite. As had been said in other reviews, Lawhead does tend to preach it in these novels, so if that is not your thing and you're likely to get offended, I would stay away.

It has a good beginning and a good ending, but some of the middle couldv'e stood to be left out. It took me awhile to read this book because I lost interest about halfway through, but I hate leaving books unfinished, and I'm glad I didn't because the ending was great. I found that the Merlin book of this cycle was a bit like that too. Just know that when you read it, there's going to be a bit of a flat stretch but it gets better and it is definitely worth reading just to get into the rest of the books if nothing else! I do like the spin of Atlantis though, very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another Arthurian series - this one is BAD, though","review":"I'm not impressed. Not even amused. To make books about Arthur and Merlin seems to be a safe way to print money. Well, this author won't get any more of my money. Trying to make the Merlin a christian, and breaking with historical facts on almost every page (Arthur eating potatoes made me laugh out loud - potatoes came to Englad from America a millennium later than this time frame). It clearly shines through that Lawhead is a christian author who wants to accomplish two things - make money, and jam his beliefs down your throat. Avoid, unless you're just out for a good laugh at the expense of a bad author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Story Ruined","review":"I love Arthurian lore, especially anything having to do with Merlin. In this book you get a look into where Merlin came from. Unfortunately it falls into the trap of so many others. Merlin came from a Pagan background.

It is a mini series regarding Jonathan's kin in 1880's Kansas. It has very little to do with the Supermen legend, and there are hints of the BIG RED S thrown in .John Ostrander has done his research. This western saga is well told. This could be told in a regular novel format, it is better as a graphic novel. Ostrander's storytelling ability is excellent. Even without the Superman family name, this could be the next best western on film, if some studio would take noticeThe art of Timothy Truman is amazing, and I do not use that word lightly. The classic artistic style that Truman has used in previous westerns makes this graphic novel a force to savor and enjoy. His work seems to pop off the pages, like 3-D.

I was fortunate enough in my youth to have a chance to canoe 200 miles of Canada not all that far from Cache Lake country - and can only say that Rowland's account rings true.

He already had his exquisite timing; moreover, his digital dexterity was absolutely miraculous: he played things as he did because HE COULD do it. None of the great pianists really had GG's gift.Now, with Beethoven I've long been exclusively a Kempff fan. Kempff had great control and expression, plus he had a real insight into Beethoven's musical architechtonics. Gould has been damned for his vibrant Mozart and his peculiar Beethoven. But I have to say that I prefer GG's Mozart to anybody else's; plus, now I'm getting the vision of his Beethoven.GG's recordings of Beethoven's late sonatas were done early in his career. Here, the Op. 101 was done in 1952 prior to his great Goldberg's recording of 1955. This is the only performance of GG's B's Op. 101 available. The wonderful Opp. 109-11 were done in 1956.

This board has no more functionality than a normal QWERTY keyboard, and if you know how to type, it actually creates an alien keying experience as you relearn where the keys are in reference to your rested hand position.Don't spend the money here. Buy a decent, mid priced keyboard instead. It will last you years and you won't have to worry about dumping money worthlessly into new keyboards for each game you play.This product is a perfect example of corporate band-wagoning in an attempt to exploit customers for every last cent with irrelevant and useless products.

I wish they had a way to attach a consumable board to the top so that I could cut right across the top, but I think I can figure out some work around for that. They are stable, easily adjustable and easy to fold up. I only rated them 4 out of 5 stars for 2 reasons: No way to attach a board at the top and the shelf in the middle can't handle as much weight as I was hoping (I stood on it and it made a bad noise but still works). - 35 yr old amateur remodeler and father of 5 great kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sawhorses","review":"Great sawhorses.

Every lyric, chord change, album photo and personal reward or tragedy is examined in this 188 page book. Rose explores these albums from a psychological, musical, and sociological viewpoint. Also included, is an undated interview with the author and Roger Waters. While I was disappointed that there was no analysis of Water's solo works, I realized, that is the subject of another study.

That is not true. This thing leaks bubble solution all over the place. I have a six year old and he had bubble solution all over the place. It is really messy and no fun at ALL.

The end of the cord sits nicely inside the brake mechanism and the connections are tight, not loose like an older pair of cross levers I've used. The clamp is solid and the bolt is as well. These are great levers! Even for bars slightly wider than 26mm, the clamp will still perform well even if it's not 100% closed (but in that case I'd recommend putting a strip of rubber or cork, as in bar tape, under the clamp)."},{"rating":"1","title":"refurbish diamond blade","review":"This is not a new blade, refurbisg with uneven teeth!

I was looking for an emergency blanket to keep in my car, and from the description I thought this was plastic/tarp on one side and flocked/fuzzy on the other (the description mentions wool). Instead it's a plastic tarp on one side and reflective/mylar material on the other.I like that it has grommets on the corners, so it can be tied down as a shelter. I like the size of it, which is plenty big enough to keep a couple of people warm and dry. It's also much tougher than a standard space blanket, so it's not just a one-use item. I'm disappointed that it's nothing like a blanket on the back side of it, but the reflective material will work too.I think it's a little overpriced, at $18, but I'm not going to return it.

As another reviewer pointed out the balance between the loons in the foreground and the other bird calls in the background isn't perfect but that's probably nitpicking.

After that it's the bullfrog show (it's either a bullfrog or a cow giving birth to a hippo, I'm not sure) and this bullfrog sounds like it's croaking into a bull horn that's bungeed to your head and cranked up to 11.

Now I know why they are selling this watch at such a discount. This Invicta 9223 Speedway watch is not made with quality components/craftsmanship.

If you need to remove a link no need for a jeweler, look at the inside of the band there are arrows on which way to push pin out.

After I had the watch for about 3 days I noticed that it was losing time. I would reset the time and it would be ok for awhile but on about the 5th day it stopped working all together. I'm assuming that the battery died. You would think that Invicta would check these things before they shipped a watch. Also the case for the watch was pretty dirty so who knows how long this was in the warehouse before they shipped it. I was very dissapointed and I will not be purchasing this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invicta Speedway Collection from Amazon","review":"I generally don't check for the watches in the shop before placing an order over net. This is perhaps the trust i have built over time on WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). but it is different in case of this watch. In yor first glance you can figureout that the design is little different from what you see in the picture; which is disappointing. I would have still given it a 3 rating if this was the only issue.

However, the game doesn't even include a map of the US! The stock market is the same cretin style stock market of the previous game (no matter how much money you have, you can't buy stock from other players). The last and most serious problem is track laying & station placement. There is no un-do.

It was therefore with much anticipation that I purchased version 3 and man was I ever disappointed! Graphically, it's a beautiful game. But it seems to me that gameplay was sacrificed for the sake of lovely pictures. It simply isn't as much fun to play version 3 as it is version 2.To be fair, I haven't played it all that much because I find the interface more difficult to use than RRT2.

It's hefty and sturdy, and is now my main daily wear watch. I would suggest buying it with a band resizing tool to save yourself some money and a trip to a watch store.The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that it came gaining about 20 seconds a day. Did some research, finding the maker of miyota movement inside this watch rates -20 to +40 sec a day within spec.update: January 2011. The watch stopped working. Almost exactly a year after the purchase the winding mechanism no longer works properly, so I would have to hand wind the watch daily. I'm no longer wearing it as it is not cost-effective to repair it. I'm taking the score down from 4 to 2 as a result. I guess spending $70 a year on a watch is not too expensive, but I rather spending $300 on a seiko and have it last 5-10 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA.","review":"This is the second watch of this particular model I bought. The first one has been running great for the last two years and I had no hesitation in buying another one for my dad. Unfortunately, I realized something was wrong with this watch the moment I took it out of the box. All Automatic watches need a couple of turns of the winder to get them started. The winder on this one offered no resistance what so ever. That in itself was a clue to a bigger problem. Once the watch gets an initial wind, it supposed to be able to wind itself as you move around. This watch stopped within 5 minutes. I wore it for two days, trying to give it enough wind to keep it going, but it still stopped 30 minutes after I took it off.Since the first watch was/is running flawlessly, it's safe to assume that this is simply lack of manufacturer's quality control. Therefore, I will be ordering a replacement once my purchase has been refunded."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT GET THIS","review":"THIS product is not the best quality.

If you wind it? Maybe 18 hours. When you unscrew the winding knob to change the time (which you'll be doing alot) it's rare to get that second *click* so you'll have to screw it back in then out again.

After poking 2 holes in my fingers, denting my desk, and more than an hour of frustration, I took my hammer (yes, I had to try it aslo) and smashed the watch to pieces. Some things just can't be done, even if you are very skilled and knowledgable. Chinese-made (i.e. junk), so I don't have a lot of expectations, but it would have been a nice watch.

I showed some coworkers and they couldn't really tell how much it cost, but if you've ever held a nice watch, you can tell it's cheap. Initially, the band felt really cheap and not very smooth when it moved around. The crown actually comes off when you are setting the time.

This may be due to the fact that it is a kinetic watch but that seems to be a short period of time to stop keeping time. I didn't keep the watch long enough to find out because the fact that the bezel didn't work was enough for me to return it. I wanted the watch for diving but the bezel was so stiff that it was impossible to set. I envy the people who bought this watch and have no problems. It's a great looker for a great price.

I also liked the fact that the movement was apparently the Myiota movement I have in several of my Invicta automatics. Excellent durable movement. THIS WATCH IS NOT 43 MIL IT IS 40 (I already own one in 40 mil with a nicer dial) AND IT DOES NOT HAVE A MYIOTA MOVEMENT. Sent it back disappointed.

What's more, I'm a big fan of Tom Waits, on whose albums Mr. Ribot performs ably. The problem with this disc is not that it fails to be conventional, but rather that it resoundingly fails to be interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"avant twaddle","review":"This cd is a dull exercise in lame NY avant guitar twaddle.

It took me back to my third month of practicing and made me relive a memory that I had long since forgotten. This is first time I have heard something that has motivated me to write a review. If I could sue to get me money back I would and I imagine I could get a class action suit going too. This is nothing more than tripe trying to be avant garde. I like all forms of music done well, but trying to breeze this by as music worth burning on a cd is rediculous. I've listened and own music from say John Zorn, etc. so I'm fully aware and prepared for the approach. Please re-think and save your money. This is [not good]. Since there was not a position for placing no stars I was forced to put one star, it really should be taking from the shelves and used for flipping burgers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most admired tenor.","review":"Being well-represented on the CD market, the art of tenor Tito Schipa can readily be appreciated and enjoyed by listeners young and old and also singers young and old. This compilation gives a cross section of his recording output from the 1920s and 1930s. Transfers and reprocessing are as good as any available. Of course, collectors must expect duplicates of items they already own, but there are two tracks here that are new to me. They are the last two tracks - songs sung in English, one of which Schipa wrote himself.Yes, singers of earlier times and today have frequently expressed their admiration for Tito Schipa. The Czech soprano Jarmila Novotna, for one, recounted in a 1988 interview, \\"Later I sang Traviata with Tito Schipa whom I adored. He entranced me so much that once when we had a duet, I looked at him and looked at him, and forgot to sing!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"great vance material, does lack any plot direction","review":"As a big vance fan, I enjoyed this book a lot. It is almost like a scrapbook of various vance-designed worlds and cultures, paraded one after another as the protagonist travels from world to world. The book could be 10000 pages long and I wouldn't get tired of this, but as I said, I am a Vance fan.The big problem some readers might have with this book is the lack of any overall plot or conflict. I wonder how much of this is a function of Vance's desire not to write the first half of a story without any real guarantees he would be able to finish it (he is quite elderly). In the event, he has finished the sequel, Lurulu, which should be printed late 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"drifting, entertaining, but not exciting","review":"Being a vivid fan of the master, I eagerly awaited his latest output.

It's sort of like a long road trip on which you forget where you're going after the first few miles but you keep driving anyway because you're supposed to be going somewhere. Perhaps Vance should have waited to figure out where he wanted to go before writing this. He does well with the main character but the rest seem flimsy. Perhaps with something driving them (like a plot for instance) they would be more fleshed out."},{"rating":"1","title":"overwritten, overrated and not over soon enough","review":"No characters, no plot - a complete waste of time. Avoid"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment...","review":"As any devoted Jack Vance fan knows, Vance's level of focus varies wildly from book to book- from the tightly plotted and well thought out (Lyonesse, The Dying Earth) to gotta-pay-the-bills one-draft hackiness (the Alastor Cluster series).I guess he had to pay some bills with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Vance's best work, but...","review":"Vance does with the book what he does best. He creates vivid imagery, great and quirky characters, charming situations, and new and unusual cultural perspectives. On the negative side, the book lacks a cohesive story and has very little plot. Is is almost just a series of vignettes. It is very likely meant to be the first book in a series as it has no real conclusion.For all of that, a true Jack Vance fan will enjoy it, because it gives healthy dose of the Vance experience. The fragments the story divides itself into are interesting enough and done with sufficient mastery to make the book well worth reading. For those drab souless people with no grandness of vision who do not like Jack Vance, there probably will be little appeal to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"you guys are missing the point!","review":"Jack Vance is one of the premier stylists writing in America today, the best in SciFi. Plot is secondary in his stories, merely a minimum requirement of the novel form. If SciFi were not Vances's chosen form, he would win every writing award worth winning. But I am afraid that he doomed to be read by people who can not understand Vance's approach and never to be read by those who can-because of the genre. Vance is always an entertaining read and a thoughtful one. Sign me-just a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"For an author who wrote such a large amount of splendid books, this is rather poor.

It has its moments, but for the rest it is written without much inspiration. A pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull beyond belief","review":"I am a big fan of jack vance, but I got the impression that he was just trying to sell a book with this one. This is by far the worst book of his I have read-and I have read them all.Instead of creating a vast and descriptive set of societies as he usually does so well, Port of Call spends most of it's time in concersation between characters that goes absolutely no where."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Port in the Storm for Science Fiction readers","review":"Jack Vance has been creating great science fiction for decades, and PORTS OF CALL does not disappoint. The plotline is fairly standard, but it is Vance's tongue in cheek humor and poetic story telling that carry this story through planets of diversity and discovery.

I was let down by it. I feel like it may have been poor directing or even a poor screenplay, but it was all too simple. It wasn't real enough for me. Annabelle kept appearing in every scene and she lacked character depth, as did the teacher. I just feel like there wasn't enough build up of tension and drama, neither character really got to know the other and when it seemed as if they were trying to, everything was cliche and unrealistic.So I'm going to have to say that this could have been an amazing film, but instead it's was only a good idea that was executed poorly.

I realized that I didn't care if the women in the movie lived or died.The young girl in the movie is supposed to be a \\"bad\\" girl (conveyed to us by her smoking and her awful orange highlights). The character of the teacher is hardly developed. And while I'm not shallow, I couldn't concentrate on anything she was saying due to the Grand Canyon-like wrinkle between her eyebrows.It's not sexy.

Lesbians are not unintelligent uninformed weak and spineless individuals who fall for children. They are strong, ethical and kind, and go out of their way to protect children. Did you see the Mother Superior try to hit on Simone? Wow, and a Catholic high school allowed this to be filmed on their campus.

Has our concept of friendship dipped so low that we feel obligated to allow a \\"friend\\" to treat us so abysmally? OK, for purposes of the movie we suspend our everyday notions of ethics and morals so that we can have a comedy. Unfortunately, it is not believable in any respect, even as comedy. It is not funny, and I like funny! Even worse, it is not clever. It wastes Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon's abilities and demands much more than Owen Wlson is able to deliver!

Karl and Molly are newlyweds when Karl's best friend Dupree finds himself on the skids. Karl opens his door to Dupree, 20+ years of friendship is hard to break...or is it? We forgot about Molly. And the Kicker in this all is Molly's dad, Played by Michael Douglas, who incidently is Karls boss. Follow the Triad of Karl, Molly and Dupree, and have some laughs along the way as well.

Obviously, he doesn't get the job. Surprise! Very funny!3) Father-in-law asks Carl to get a vasectomy within the first few weeks of the wedding.

I allready knew that after only after a few minutes of watching.... no action and no comedy and boring scenes that this movie would be a waist of time. I really like Owen Wilson but this is certainly one of his worst films that he has made so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's got its moments","review":"this comedy, like Click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through. the characters in this film can be hated at points, especially Michael Douglas' and Matt Dillon's but there is a lighter side! Owen Wilson is very likeable as Dupree, an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job. the cast is fine and one of the strength's in this film! however, I think it gets too serious at points. this is supposed to be a comedy after all. I wouldn't buy it but it is certainly worth renting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"Stay clear of this one, unless you like sitting through boring, boring, boring movies.

Personally, I liked the acting and Molly; Carl was kind of out there somewhere as was Dupree, but it wasn't a bad movie,nor a good movie, although there were a few crude parts. To be honest; I really can't tell you if I liked it or not. It does have a happy ending, so if that's your piece of cake it's there for the taking.Definitely not recommended for children to view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This movie is horrible, not funny, and very simplistic and stupid plot line, do yourself the biggest favor and do not rent, buy, or other wise waste time on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure rancid s**t!","review":"i didnt laugh at all at this movie, i like that actor that was in 40 year old virgin, the rest of the cast is crap. i laughed harder when i saw a poodle getting splatted by an 18 wheeler. don't rent and definetly don't buy. in the name of hagar the elk god, im out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would recommend.

I can't think of anything positive to say about this movie, other than the Hawaii location in the opening scenes was pretty. The main problem was the story--not a single interesting element. The basic premise could have been made into an enjoyable, clever diversion. But there was nothing funny or original here. Were they aiming for such a low standard of film? I can't think otherwise, since it starts with the script and it was so thin and uninteresting. My overriding thought was that the people and studio involved must have a very low opinion of the movie-going public's discernment, intelligence and taste. I wouldn't even recommend watching it if you were being paid to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as funny as we had hoped","review":"The movie has its moments, but they are not often enough to recommend this movie to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG -- Crap","review":"this is a horriable movie, I actually liked kate and Matt , but I didnt like dupree (owen).

Crude physical humor abounds with lines uttered by \\"zany\\" Owen Wilson that are more stupid than funny. Matt Dillon looks like he wants to be somewhere else constantly, and the overrated Kate Hudson is just there looking like the celebrity royalty heir she bases her career upon.

It was the reason that I bought a PC instead of an expensive console. At the time, you couldn't get a better shooter on the PC. Times change however, and so did Max Payne. By in large, for the better. The graphics are better. Much smoother. The first game had a real comic book feel to it. Max Payne 2, while still having the storyboards, seems to be more like a movie. I thought the gameplay had everything, and more, that the first Max Payne did. More weapons, better graphics, more dark, and a long complicated storyline. The relationship between Mona Sax, and Mr. Payne, ends up distracting from the game unfortunatly. It makes for some cheesy cutscenes. The voice acting, and dialog are painful at times. It's ok for a game like this to have some vulgarities in it, but the half baked voice overs make them hard to listen to. Overall, this game had me booting up many, many times, and I enjoyed it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing as the original except too short.","review":"You really can't find a better game; perfect graphic and sound. Hard to image it's developed by the same company that produced GTA series which I think they are horrible. For an action game, there's nothing more you can ask for. If I really have to come up with something, that'll be too short for the game and a weak story. But who cares that much about story for shooting games?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent game overall","review":"I was wowed. My jaw dropped to the floor and stayed there. The graphics are easily the best I have ever seen in a FPS. The sound is utterly perfect, and the controls are very easy to learn (especially if you are a MP veteran). The battles are difficult, but never too difficult. My only complaint about it was that it was rather short (like the first one), but the Dead Man Walking mode more than made up for that.However, the plot was a different story. I was thoroughly disappointed by it. They should have had many more references to the first Max Payne, and the love story gets old and annoying after while, so much that it can interfere with the main story. One of my favorite characters in MP 1 turns bad, and the whole thing just doesn't captivate me like the first one did.Anyway, except for the story, the game rocked. I have never played a game more exciting, and that's that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"A great game, awesome graphics, great storyline, but too short.

Otherwise I like this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much emphasis on emotions","review":"Unlike the first game where Max Payne had at least a can do fighting attitude, in this sequel, he's always in conceding mode until the end of course and even then it ain't always so. Sure, the bullettime and graphics are souped up a bit but storywise and gameplay-wise, this game lacks much of both. It was annoying enough that in the first game Max had to walk through a couple of dark mazes but what's worse in this sequel is that in at least 3 or 4 levels of this game, Max walks through while talking to himself in a more groaning manner which is even more annoying. Also, too much emphasis is placed on Max's desperate love for Mona. Yes, there is supposed to be love noir crap in this sequel but how much emphasis can you really afford to put on emotions until you make the game all sappy !?!?! Too easy and too boring if you ever want to play it again.

I finished it, and anxiously awaited the sequel. When It cam out, I played it over at a friends house. I still have not bought it. I was just disappointed with how they took the storyline. In the game, there's no mention as your playing, of the first game(unless you play the \\"previously\\" video in the game). Secondly, Max looks NOTHING like he did in the original! I can understand that times change, and I read how super looking max now is, compared to the original, but His looks didn't strike me as great. Medicore, I would say. And last but not least, if you don't have high specs for this game, don't even bother wasting your money, or downloading the demo(especially if your a dial up user). It's just not worth it.

Lot's of story, relatively short game, something just wasn't right about the game. Don't get me wrong, the physics are awe dropping-rag doll hello! But I don't agree that the graphics are much better at all. I can max out both games with full 6xAA and 16xAF and I feel the first looks just as good. Anyway...I FIGURED out what made me feel like MP2 wasn't as fun as Max Payne. For those of you that played MP a lot and got fairly good at, it probably wasn't challenging enough and sorta boring, like going through the motions. This happened to me. The fact that you can only play on detective mode made the initial play of the game a TOTAL LET DOWN."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best cd i have owned besides metalica","review":"ok, if your wondering why these reviews are all from georgia, the band is from georgia if you didn't know that already. ok, i liked them like 5 years ago when they were in bars and stuff. their cd just kicks so much a$$!! it is never out of my cd player because i love every song from hey! album. woohoo! go marvelous 3 - become famous rock stars, but don't sell out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Plot","review":"This book certainly had an interesting plot.

Johnson puts forth in this book are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"A confused look at evolution.","review":"For anyone interested in the creation/evolution debate, this books pretty much sums up the best creationists can do against evolution. While Johnson does not argue FOR creationism, it is pretty clear that he has that (or some form of it) in the back of his mind. Most of the issues he nitpicks are irrelevant, unresolved, or unimportant. His argument is above average for creationists - but goes nowhere in counteracting the arguments for natural selection and evolution"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect a lawyer to intelligently critique a scientific theory","review":"As a Bible-believing Christian, this kind of book makes me sad. Johnson not only botches the topic, he demonstrates a profound ignorance of science and the scientific method in general.I can only wish that authors like Johnson would focus on topics in which they are well-informed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potboiler science","review":"I think there's a lot for us to learn about evolution. That is why I picked up Johnson's book, because it is supposed to be a logically based critique of the current theory of evolution. But Johnson wears his religious heart on his sleeve far too much, and his criticisms lose their validity as he loses his objectivity. It's too bad, because Johnson possesses a remarkable ability for analysis and debate. If he were to use his talents more objectively, I think he could contribute something of value on this topic, even as a critic. As it is, Johnson uses an attorney's strategy by taking a biased and adversarial position against the opposition - in this case, science and scientists. Johnson makes his greatest and most inexcusable error by taking statements made by scientists out of context."},{"rating":"1","title":"book packaging/mailing problem","review":"i never received the book ordered due to (apparently) improper packaging. all i received was notification from the postal service that the product could not be delivered due to failure of the packaging. amazon.com needs to do a better job in packaging items for delivery so they will survive the mailing process."},{"rating":"1","title":"It seems the enlightenment failed!!!","review":"Every time I see people try to discredit science with superstition and religion I cringe. Johnson's diatribe against natural selection is weak at best. At some points his thinly veiled objectivity decends into a maelstrom of blatant opinion, speculation and generally bad science. Johnson clamours for a \\"theistic\\" science that gives notions of god the same sway as hard facts. Lamentably this is analogous to andmitting fallacies into the field of logic. This book is just another bad attempt at science that will be confined to the bargain aisle of \\"psudo science\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies and Deceit","review":"This book is evil. It begins by mixing up the definitions of fact, theory, and hypothesis. Quotes are taken out of context and don't reflect their author's intended meaning. Authors have complained in writing only to see the same mistruths reappear in the 2nd edition. Science and the scientific community are falsely portrayed. Naturalism is substituted for objectivism and Darwinism for evolution. Without knowledge of paleontology or anthropology and how the scientific community really works, this book may sound very convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lawyer Dissects the Evolutionary Dogma","review":"I am amused by those who criticize Johnson, a lawyer, for examining evolutionary theory. While lawyers are not scientists, they often delve into scientific issues even during their legal practice. Moreover, lawyers are explicitly trained to detect and expose fallacious arguments, of which evolutionary theory has quite a few (that's putting it mildly). One does not have to agree with every detail of Johnson's excellent analysis in order to appreciate his deconstruction of evolution. Finally, those who complain that legal standards of evidence should not be applied to ostensibly scientific theories should recognize that they have themselves to blame: Were evolutionary theory not taught as fact to laypersons and unsuspecting students, it would not be also put in a position where it is subject to the highest standards of evidentiary reasoning--and where it fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best way to discredit this entire book.","review":"I need to only say 3 things-1. Examining Johnson's sources and statements reveal an incredible amount of quote mining and misrepresentations.2. The bulk of \\"arguments\\" he's leveled against evolution have been answered extensively by the scientific community.3. Phillip Johnson is not a scientist. He is a law professor, and as such is better suited towards knowing how to lie convincingly rather than express facts accurately and without misrepresentations, as scientists do."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the funniest books I've read in years!!!","review":"This guy would make a good humor writer. I haven't laughed at a book so much in years! Evolution is supported by mountains and mountains of documented, irrefutable evidence from educated, professional, intelligent people who have simply followed the course of where their research took them. It's no longer about one guy who wrote one book in the mid-1800's. Not any more. Inform yourselves, people. I challenge anyone reading this to actually investigate how much supporting research there is out there for evolution in science, in astronomy, biology geology and physics. It's overwhelming. Check out some web sites from some universities and research institutes to get an idea of how research is being done on evolution all over the world. Do you think they're all in a conspiracy, and that they're just making it all up?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"It is obvious by reading many of the negative reviews on this book, those people have not actually read this book. It is amazing how worried Darwinists are becoming as their faith in evolution is being tested by the real lack of evidence of this theory. Most supporters will do anything to discredit any attack on this theory.All I ask is people read this book with an open mind. You may come away still believing evolution is true, and that is fine, just actually read this book before writing your review. However, I think it will at least have you re-evaluating your views on the truth of evolution.

It should be required reading for every college student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before you buy the book, read the one star reviews","review":"While the one-star reviews say little specific about the arguments presented in the book, they say much about the reviewers themselves. Johnson's critics rail, they accuse, they seethe with anger. They claim one needs decades of study to grasp evolutionary theory. They call the book \\"evil.\\" They attack the author for being a Christian, an attorney, a liar. They insult positive reviewers, Christians, those who dare question evolution and, most of all, the author. Are these the responses of scientists dispassionately searching for---and open to discovering---the truth? Or are these the reactions one might expect of religious zealots they disparage? One thing is certain: many are threatened by this book and the arguments therein. Why, I wonder? Having read the book, I know why: because Johnson's arguments are sound, accessible and depend not upon faith, but on reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid piece of convicing evidence argument against Darwin.","review":"Issue by issue the author thoroughly presents the case against Darwinian evolution from a legal standpoint. It is a clear, consise piece that evolutionists will find hard to refute.

However, if you've already been tinkering with UltraDev for a few weeks, and are hoping this book will show you how to do some of the more complex things UltraDev can do, you're our of luck.

But unlike other \\"jam bands\\" (a misnomer in this case, in my opinion), Hipbone is never sloppy, never pretentious, and never, ever plays an unnecessary note. They are talented musicians with an innate feel for improvisation and groove along with a sophisticated sense of melody. If you dig organ- and sax-driven jazz-inflected funk, then you will be a Hipbone addict within the opening four bars of any of their songs.Unfortunately, Hipbone played their final show on December 16, 2000.

The whole book basically is just one big tutorial that is confusing and boring. You actually start modeling on chapter 5 and by the time you get there you are just feeling confused and bored to death.

The basics? Yep - lots of it. The advanced stuff? Nope. Not even close. My advice is only buy this book if you have no idea what you're doing with [any] 3D program. All topics requiring skills from intermediate and upwards are covered very sparsely (if at all - there's no mention of NURBS!#?!). The featured artists in the book also have questionable 3D skills. ... is a lot of money for a book you're only going to need for 2 or 3 weeks.

All those early recordings were released in stereo, so why are these mono?Then I began to see the reason for 'previously unreleased' material being unreleased. The ones on these discs don't do much for me. 'Museum' is a case in point - the released version is better. That's probably why it was released, and I would rather have that version (in stereo).This set looks like a bargain, but I feel like I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folkrock poetry at its best","review":"I enjoyed this collection.

The rest of the songs were musically well executed, but the lyrics and themes were just shy of idiotic. I ordered this set just to get Catch The Wind, so I guess I can't say I'm upset by it, but I guess I'm just thinking that perhaps Donovan may just be a bit overrated as far as this genre is concerned.

The military is manned by clones who, get this, die if someone tells them they are clones!! These clones are all male, in fact everyone is male! The only women in this book are sex objects, and nothing else. The story just goes around and around, with the same situations repeated. The hero is betrayed by officers, sulks, then comes back to fight again. The enemy is always superior in technology but inferior in every other aspect, and our hero defeats them every time.

The author of \\"The Clone Republic\\" tries hard -- varied settings, lots of battles, a complex (if incomprehensible) background political environment -- but there's no life to the story. A romance with no romance. A brief affair with no sex. Battles with strangely invisible enemies and no sense of immediacy. A plot built around clones who seem, oddly, little different from the rest of us (what, no advances in genetics in 500 or so years?) and implausibly unaware of their nature. An 'advanced' clone type (our narrator) with nothing that justifies all the mystery surrounding him. A warfare that is basically World War II (maybe Vietnam if you add in gunships circling over, of all things, a beachhead on an actual beach) with bigger explosions.

Although some of the stellar BB harmonies are there, production is bare bones...this is the antithesis of 'pocket symphony' complexity that came before and after. Brian's keyboard work sounds plodding and basic, and many songs come across as juvenile. Brian's voice is hoarse, husky, tentative, and often un-melodic. 'Good Time' is an exception, and 'Mona' has potential. I am a huge BB fan and defender, but there's a reason why this album fell off the charts after 7 wks and spawned no singles.

I bought this book b/c I read a review in TIme that called it \\"massively researched and ludicrously entertaining,\\" and boy are both true."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah","review":"I borrowed this book from the library but didn't finish it so I thought I would buy it. I am quite satisfied with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real story-not the movie story","review":"I saw the movie before reading the book and though I enjoyed the Johnny Depp film, the book is incredibly detailed and covers not just Dillinger, but all the Depression era criminals-Bonnie and Clyde, Prett Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, Machine Gun Kelly, and the Barker-Karpis gang from 1933-1934. You also learn that the FBI,a young agency in the infancy of crime fighting, was more like Keystone Kops than today's crime fighters. They constantly fumbled and bumbled their way through two years of missed opportunities for capturing and arresting bank robbers and kidnappers. A great historical account that puts you in the center of the action. Well researched with access to previosuly unreleased material it is one of the most fascianting and readable books you can get on a bloody era of American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed with fascinating information","review":"Burrough takes you beyond the comic book version of gangsters and G-men in this detailed look at a unique period of American history. All sorts of interesting tidbits flow out of the pages, all of it based upon solid research. Burrough has said he wanted to avoid any 'speculative' history where the author attempts to interpret events or else posit some theory based upon flimsy evidence. I appreciate that as I've had too many experiences of authors interjecting their theories into history books and rendering the book somewhat ludicrous.That said, in some places the book does get weighted down under an avalanche of information. In those places I had to slow down in order to follow the story line. However, I didn't find that too big of an issue....not even enough to deduct a star off my rating.Overall, an excellent read which will give you a comprehensive understanding of the gangster era."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"THIS BOOK WAS A GREAT READ FROM FIRST PAGE ON.GREAT DETAIL AND INSIGHT TO THE 1930 GANGSTERS LIKE DILLINGER AND BONNIE AND CLYDE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads faster than the bullets spitting from Clyde's Tommy Gun","review":"Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34One blurb says Burrough brings you so close to the times that you can smell the unwashed Bonnie and Clyde. He's right. I dont know if Burrough correctly assesses each and every bandit and G-man, and each of the key sheriff's, molls, witnesses, etc., but the contemporary primary evidence the book is based on appears to back him up. And the author accomplishes the miracle of throwing in the kitchen sink without dragging down the narrative. This has more bullets fired than any action movie, and its a whole lot more engaging. Yeah, wish I had written this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"PE","review":"Great read. Well researched also! I really learned a lot about the FBI and of course all the crime figures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Public Enemies","review":"I very much enjoyed Public Enemies. I took it me while I traveled, and it entertained me during a very long flight. It's length is just right. I am very interested in the beginnings of the FBI and in J. Edgar Hoover. The book jumped around somewhat among the different groups of public enemies and forward and back in time and thus was occasionally a little difficult to keep up with, but it always held my attention. It was extremely interesting. What I found most intriguing was how inept the FBI was at that time and the turf battles between the local police and the FBI. Hoover's egotism is well known, but some of the descriptions of his behavior were surprising. Public Enemies was a page turner for me, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Public Enemies - Great Book!","review":"I'm so glad I bought this book, considering I made the purchase on a whim. Borders was having a \\"Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off\\" sale and I needed a book to pair with 1776.As a kid growing up in the sixties and seventies I went through that phase where I was fascinated by the FBI. I read The FBI Story, saw the movie of the same name, watched the TV series, and read many other books on the bureau. It was interesting to learn how biased some of these sources were.My close proximity to the sites of the FBI's war on crime also factored in my interest. Family friends owned a resort near Little Bohemia in the late 1960's. My father, 23 years old during the great crime wave, witnessed Baby Face Nelson's last gun battle firsthand as Nelson and the FBI raced passed the truck he was driving down Highway 12.Public Enemies brought that era to life with a fact-based, entertaining account of what were some very interesting times in the American Midwest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and a excellent book","review":"Mr. Burrough is a talented writer. Public Enemies is very well written and he has an abundance of information within the pages of his manuscript.

It is a must have for the home collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non stop entertainment","review":"This book is a non stop trill ride.

So when I saw this Disney Sorry! game at the store, I was thrilled! The fact that it was a few dollars more than original Sorry! didn't bother me. I was so disappointed when I brought it home to find that the game pieces that you move around the board are made of cardboard and have to be attached to little plastic pieces to stand up. Boy, for a few bucks more the makers of Sorry! could have made some nice game pieces (similar to Monopoly, maybe) that wouldn't get lost or torn. This was a great idea, done on the cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"I would recommend this game to any one that likes the orignal Sorry game. A few tips though, to make the characters stay on thier stands I would recommend a drop of glue, and play it on a smooth sturdy surfaces as the game pieces can be tippy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"The game pieces are different characters that you put into a place holder and move them around the board. They are to big and tippy so the kids keep knocking them over. The orginal game had smaller more stable pieces. Very frustrating to try and keep track of where the pieces go. I liked that the new rules on the cards made the game different and quicker than the orignal."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first juicer","review":"In attempt to improve my fruit/veggie consumption I was looking for a juicer. The best are really expensive and I'm not sure if it is going to be a routine I will stick with. I decided on this juicer for two reasons: 1- many years ago in my native country Poland I had almost identical looking juicer and it worked great, 2- one MD in article about benefits of juicing recommended this particular juicer. It was a surprise for me that anybody on this side of Atlantic would recommend juicer from Poland.So I use it for approx 2 weeks now. It makes a great juice and dry pulp. I learned that pulp is more dry when you push fruit in slower. Not to loud, easy to clean. Hope it will last me a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"Nothing more I can add to the reviews that have already submitted, other than my personal experiences. The product appeared promising, but problems arose immediately after unpacking the box. The device has multiple plugs adapters for European power sockets, but I was missing the standard US 120V plug. Not a fantastic start.Emailing Joytech yielded no joy. It took them 5 business days to respond to my first email. The response was basically that I was SOL. They had stopped manufacture of the Control Center, thus they could not fix their mistake. I replied asking if they could just send a power adapter of the same voltage from one of the other devices they made, but after waiting another 3 days I was given the same answer. \\"We're sorry, but it is out of our power.\\"I was able to find a universal adapter that worked for some time and the product worked for a time, but after 13 months of use, the power button stopped responding.As was mentioned in another review, you pay for what you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might not work with HD to Analog TV convertor boxes.","review":"I bought this AV adapter just for my analog tv, DVD player, and Insignia HD convertor for analog tv.

This book is ideal for medical students; it allows the rapid assimilation of concepts with the appropriate level of depth.

How long before we get the \\"Ultimate Lennon\\" or \\"Gold Lennon\\" is anybody guess. The only thing I dislike about this is the sequence of the tracks.

Artificial Flavors is a 'dark' album... and a serious effort. Sicboy combines a lot of influences (Korn, Deftones, Tool, & Radiohead) and originality to create a debut album that is uneasy, yet rather comforting at the same time. This band has a lot of potential. Check out songs like Myself, Fever, Hang Up, and Ruth's Song... stand out tracks, and diverse at that.

Also most of the photographs are just of guitars and guitar hardware and don't really help explain anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good overview on guitar set-ups","review":"I highly recommend this book for the essential guitar library. I bought this book several years ago & have bascially dog-earred my copy. Although basic in approach it does contain brief information on topics that are also - unfortunately not covered to any extent in similar theme books.

How well-known can depend on the movie to which the soundtrack applies (though not always). So it's no longer a mystery to me that Wild Cherry's 'Play That Funky Music (White Boy)' and A Taste of Honey's 'Boogie Oogie Oogie' were omitted from the compilation in favor of tracks by artists like Freak Power, Spy, Citizen King and those perpetual soundtrack-surfers, Moloko. Nevertheless, the soundtrack redeems itself with its inclusion of the Trammps, the BEE GEES, and 'Invisible Boy'-Kel Mitchell's catchy foray into rap backed by the M.A.F.T.

The character gets embroiled in an affair with a New Mexico male witch, who exercises a spell on her.The acting is terrible, the dialogues childish, and the whole story a real turkey. How Mrs. Somers accepted to participate in a movie such as this, after her TV successes and popularity, is an enigma.Two things can be rescued from this movie: one is an excellent new-age style soundtrack, and the other is a two-second scene of Mrs. Somers in underwear showing a beautiful mature body. Apart from that, it is a great medicine for insomniacs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic to the end","review":"This is a for-cable produced movie starring beautiful Suzanne Somers. How Mrs. Somers agreed to perform this horrible script is, for me, unexplicable.The story revolves around an Indian witch that exercises a spell on a reporter (Somers), who is a very middle-class, loving, caring, etc. mother/wife. She, of course, did have an affair with the witch and subsequently felt guilty for it.Two things are good in this movie: the soundtrack, which is a kind of excellent new age music and a two-second view of Suzanne in underwear (just a beautiful mature body). I don't think that these warrant spending 90 minutes of anyone's life watching this turkey of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need a good laugh","review":"..............watch this turkey of a movie. Suzanne Somers climbing a mountain (only experienced rock climbers could do this!) in the summer in the New Mexican desert in a long suede fringed coat with mocassin boots is worth the good laugh that this movie will get out of you - she gets to the top of the mountain with maybe a speck of dirt on her face, makeup and clothes perfectly in tact.

That was the first thing I did. Imagine, I went into a record store and asked for an album called \\"eight.\\" They figured it out, though. Played the first CD so much it gave out on me.

Still , after so many year on top Ramazzotti keeps recording diverting yet awfully similar albums which are nice for a ride in the car listening to your radio but poor for soul searching moments or anything remotely close to that .

The graphic novel tale of two kids and their run in with tomb robbers is basic and not especially good. But what really makes this book are the \\"factoids\\" and the wonderfully detailed illustrations that accompany them. Richard Bonson is a gifted illustrator who specializes in detailed cross sectional renderings of buildings. The Italian illustrators from Studio Inklink are an especially capable group of historical illustrators. The illustrations in this book are first rate and a used copy can be purchased at little cost.

I sprayed again and tried again, and then it picked up a few drops of water but nothing close to the 2-3 cups that I estimate had been sprayed into the rug. Maybe this product is not intended for this kind of carpeting, but I can't find that information anywhere. You may have better results with other types of carpet.

The Cleaner Solution tank does not properly \\"lock\\" back in and was always loose causing it to fall out anytime you moved the machine. After noticing this I didn't even bother to use it as I could only imagine the mess I would have had to clean up. Back in the box and back to Amazon..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I purchased this because it was the least expensive and I just couldn't see spending $150 on a Green Machine (or thousands on new carpet...). I have a one year old and a nervous cat and my carpet is a mess. I read tons of reviews and saw people complaining about difficulty getting the tanks off. I had NO problems with this machine and just removed several stains from my light beige carpet including a coffee stain from a week ago, cat hairball stains and random food that my daughter flings around. This is a GREAT deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good for what it does","review":"this little wet vacum does what it says it does.

But it cleans up a mess from my mastiff without needing to be emptied during cleaning - which is nice. Very easy to clean/empty. Very light and compact - and the little bottle of cleaner that it comes with goes a long way:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I don't really see the point of this. I thought it would make clean up after my 8 month old easier but I think it is harder with this thing. All it does it suck up the cleaner. I thought that the brush would spin and therefore assist in cleaning up the spot but it is stationary so you have to rub back and forth. I find it easier just to use a wash cloth and a spot cleaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"One fatal flaw that overrides genius. Would not buy again.","review":"Would not buy again. The problem isn't the cleaner -- it does what it should do, and beautifully. The problem is CLEANING the cleaner itself. It is the Rubik's cube of mini vacuums. Once you put on gloves (pet waste hazard), separate the body from the housing, take it outside to empty and use bleach to prevent mold from growing inside (you can see the mold everywhere if this isn't done pretty soon after you use it), it has to dry out so you can use it again. This takes at least a day...this is a very high maintenance cleaner. I need a nap just explaining this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life Span","review":"These work ok for a year or so but ultimately the battery charge doesn't hold. It lasts shorter and shorter amounts of time and finally not at all. I tried emailing Bissell about this but I was told there was nothing past a year. So as long as you see this as a disposable you are ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't have enough power.","review":"I bought this so I could more easily clean my carpeted stairs. Unfortunately, while it could spray the liquid out, it didn't suck it back up. I was only able to collect about a tablespoon of liquid back into the machine. It seemed to only have about as much power as a dust buster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This item is fairly useless. The spray is inaccurate, the brush is stationary so to get any effect you have to move the entire unwieldy machine back and forth to scrub anything, the suction is poor at best, it's heavy with no hose, and to charge it takes forever just for the privilege of using it for less than 15 minutes!A huge waste of money I'm sad to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice toddler accessory","review":"This little cleaner is easy to use, and so far works very well. I got some old juice stains and a cat barf stain out of the carpet right away. The detergent tank is eay to load and the dirty water tank is easy to empty.I only have one minor gripe- I'm not sure it makes sense for this product to be cordless. I was worried at first that its 15 minute runtime with a 12 hour charge would be annoying. It really isn't, it doesn't take but a minute to remove a spot, and you aren't going to use this to clean a whole carpet. However, the manual recommends running the battery completely down before recharging, which means that either it's going to conk out on you when you're using it or that you have to just leave it on to run down when the battery is low. Not a big deal, but is that really more convenient than just using a cord?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat gadget","review":"This is a pretty neat gadget for the price. I was leery because of the awesome price, but it works fine for the small amount of carpet we have. I've used it on the couch, no problems.

I emptied the tank after every cleaning so I don't think that is the problem. It will not charge anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted a month!","review":"I understand that you get what you pay for (the price was great on this cleaner) but I certainly expected it to hold up for a bit longer than a month! I don't know if it's the motor or battery, but it just doesn't turn on after being charged anymore. Until then it worked fine for short spurts of cleaning time...but like other reviewers are mentioning it's only good for several minutes before dying. Very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy for quick cleanups","review":"This is a must if you have pets or kids. It's easy to use (my kids, ages 9 and 13, use it) and quick.

If you need to clean up more than a spot, this isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good machine","review":"The Bissell Cordless Spot Lifter is a pretty good machine. I use it to clean stains from my cat's fur-balls. It gets out most of the stain...enough that no one else would ever notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ewwwww -- the smell","review":"I guess you get what you pay for with this cheap little piece of junk. I think I paid about $40, so it's no great loss to toss it out. The GOOD: the solution that comes with it does a decent job of removing a spot and the suction gets up the liquid pretty good. The BAD: The solution squirter gets in the way when you are trying to dismantle it for cleaning. Not much battery life. The UGLY: It's very difficult to remove the waste tank for cleaning. And if you let it sit for a few hours, you'll regret it mightily -- depending upon what kind of \\"spot\\" you were cleaning. I can tell you if you are cleaning up after a CAT, get the tank emptied ASAP. That is, if you can get the darn thing off. I finally threw the whole thing in the trash after it sat too long. Not worth dealing with the smell if I was able to get it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Fix","review":"This little spotlifter does a great job. Spilled pop and muddy foot prints can be cleaned up in minutes. I would suggest this product for anyone who has kids or animals.

Considering it operates on batteries it has pretty good sucking power and is easy to clean out the collection trap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for pet clean-ups","review":"I have 2 cats who tend to loose their lunch on my white carpet, so I use this often. I use the recommended Little Green liquid. Soak the spot well, let it sit a minute, rub with the brush on the bottom in various directions, maybe spray again and then vacuum it up slowly. Spots go away, even if they had been made hours before. A must have if you have pets and carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just stopped working","review":"I bought this item in September and before the end of October it had stopped working.

It wouldn't work for a whole room, but for spot cleaning, it is fantastic.

It is a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works for me","review":"I was going to buy a Spotbot, because a friend recommended it, but I didn't want to spend the $80. So I read the reviews of this product and figured that I'd give it a try. I used it to clean up old stains from the first two months of having my little dog, and it worked really well. I use the Bissel Pet Odor and Stain formula, and it's awesome. It works amazingly well on fresh stains.I can get about 4 or 5 stains out on one charge, and I try to make sure the battery runs out before I plug it in overnight. The power spray is excellent, the solution gets really deep in the carpet. The suction is great. I was a little disappointed at first because I meant to get the one with the cord, but after using it, I actually really like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solution Container Does Not Stay Attached","review":"I received the product today and un-boxed it. The container that holds the cleaning solution in the back immediately fell off. It won't stay attached not is there a discernible tab or button the would seem to keep it in place.

It's going back to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Engine That Does!","review":"I was leary of buying anything portable that only ran for a few minutes at a time. I had multiple stains in my auto upholstery and figured I would need to make two jobs over two days to get the seats clean. However the Bissell made short work of the stains! It is very easy to manuever and fill. It lifted and cleaned the stains immediately. The Little Green cleaner solution works very efficiently in the Spotlifter. I wish I had bought one of these years ago. It also cleans up a pet stains very well. The Bissell Pet Stain and Odor Remover is the best solution on the market. I would definitely recommend this machine for small jobs and stains. I totally cleaned 4 car seats in less than 15 minutes. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit sold with a bad battery.","review":"Bought this Bissell Spotlifter Model #1719 back in April 2010. The unit started not holding a charge by July (!!!). By then, I could not return it to Amazon, so I had to call Bissell via the 1-800 number. They diagnosed it as needing a new battery and that it would cost $11.88 including shipping. I was not pleased with Amazon or Bissell that I had bought a spotlifter whose battery was old AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. Adding insult to injury was that I had to pay for the battery after just a few months of ownership. After a year or more, I would understand, but not after 3 months. Sad thing is that I can't afford to buy another spotlifter so I was stuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaker","review":"The basics of the product is good. We had an older model and liked it.

The machince barely soaks up any liquid, and the best part is that the cleaning solution is sprayed on by pushing a button that is located toward the top of the machine, so it is nearly impossible to grasp the handle and press the button with the same hand. If that isn't enough to deter you from purchasing this useless gadget, how about the fact that I purchased it for $39, and it is now being sold (less than 30 days later) for 5 dollars, from the same distributor (Target).

It might be worth an average of 3 stars but no way nearly 5. We bought this b/c it said the brush would \\"agitate\\" the stain. What it didn't say was that the agitation came from your own arm. So what this machine does is spray a stream of liquid that has been mixed with cleaner onto your stain. You then can move the unit over the stain and your own strength with cause the brush on the unit to brush the stain. As you do that it sucks the water back up. So you've spent your money on what you've already been doing-spraying your stains with carpet cleaner and then scrubbing them with a brush and letting it air dry. We bought this because we thought it'd do a better job than what we were already doing. It's actually a worse job and it cost us a lot of money.

The old one mounted on the wall with a simple plastic tab. The clean-water reservoir falls off if you turn the machine 20 degrees from perpendicular.this one is junk.

I used the 8 ounce Bissell cleaning fluid that came with the spot lifter. The spray mechanism worked well and I saturated the dodo spots and scrubbed away with the scrub brush.It worked OK from a cleaning standpoint still leaving a trace of poo but my major problem is the almost complete lack of any suction. I admit I over sprayed and used about 1/3 of the bottle of spray during this small but stinky cleanup. I noticed that maybe an ounce of nasty fluid was sucked back off of my carpet and into the machine. Basically no suction. The rest of the cleaning fluid is still on my new carpet.I'll have to do a bit of manual work here.Avoid this one people."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This does not get up stains as you would expect.

Then it quit running completely. In fact, if you plug in the charger, smoke comes out of the unit and it makes a burning smell. If these are the features you're looking for, then this unit is for you.

I charged the battery per the directions and used it on a stain...it was ok, but I knew I've have to do a 2nd cleaning. Then, all heck broke loose! You have to remove the front collector each time you use the machine, empty and replace it. Easier said than done - and not as easy as the directions imply. I've tried multiple times now (20+ since my purchase yesterday) to replace the front collector - IT IS IMPOSSIBLE! Every time I think I have it \\"snapped into place\\" I turn the machine on and it spurts out cleaning fluid from the side. Needless to say, I have had several \\"little green\\" cleaning fluid showers in the past 24 hours!

Why wouldn't I just get a vacuum cleaner that does a better job of cleaning and get a spray bottle? It would work better and it'd be cheaper.I don't know who wrote all the good reviews for this product, because they seriously confuse me. This thing is just incredibly useless all around. If you want to charge something for 12 hours to have it function for about 10 minutes, go ahead and buy this thing.tl;dr - it's useless and way too expensive for how useless it is. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does just what it claims to","review":"Great for people with pets. Yes, you could do the same thing with a lot of paper towels, carpet spray and a vacuum cleaner but it is a lot more convenient to just do it all with one machine. It's easy to clean and use, and it probably pays for itself with the money you save on paper towels. It will only do a small area since the liquid capacity is quite small, but it never claims to be a substitute for a whole room steam machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE MINE!","review":"I've had none of the problems that other people have commented on. This works great for me! When my new puppy has a slip-up all I have to do is grab the Spotlifter and off I go to clean up the mess. I've had no odor coming from the machine and I've found that cleaning the machine takes only a minute. I've never had a problem with suds coming out of vents or such- maybe too much solution is being used by others, I don't know. I find the the 'fill line' capacity is plenty big for what I use my Spotlifter for. It doesn't fill with suds in 10 seconds as mentioned by others. But then again, I'm using mine for spot removal, not to clean my whole carpet.... The one defect that I find is that removing the front tank which holds the dirty water is difficult to take off because you automatically hit the squirt button under the handle when pulling off the front tank. THAT is something that Bissel needs to redesign! Other than that - I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first. . . Battery gave up","review":"I originally thought this was a great deal! I wanted something small and portable for \\"little\\" messes so I didn't always have to break out the full size steam cleaner.This worked exceedingly well for the first month, but then it wouldn't re-charge anymore. I followed the instructions for the \\"battery charge resistance\\" in the manual repeatedly for a full week (exhausting the battery, then charging it, repeat). Complete waste of time! It still barely charges (to a dull groan that lasts 5 seconds).After waiting over 10 minutes on Bissell's customer service line and still not getting a live person, I gave up. Sad, because if it would just charge, it'd be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more than me with the Bissell cleaning solution and a brush","review":"I thought it would act more like a stanley steemer or something.

I decided to check and see if there are similar products made by other carpet cleaning companies. Bissell is the only company that makes these, which makes me wonder why Eureka, Hoover, and other good companies don't have something even close to offer in the spot cleaning robot machine category. I have to think the technology has not been perfected enough for reputable companies to take a chance on it. I have a Dyson carpet cleaner I love, but was expensive. I wanted something simple to take care of spills.

The charge last for less than 15 minutes and then requires 12 hours to charge it up again.

You can see the water trying to vaccum up, but it never pulls it hard enough to make it to the top and stay in the reserve.

Food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beltronics V940","review":"This is the lower priced Beltronics radar detector so it does not have a lot of bells and whistles. It does however, have the same sensing specs as the higher priced ones. It has better range than my Cobra but I would have hoped for a little better selectivity on KA band false alarms. It is a very good product and I would recommend it. It is one of the better values on the market"},{"rating":"2","title":"OK so far","review":"Working as expected, Suggest buying the accessory visor clip and the power cord to run to the fuse box (if you want to hide the cord). The detector is a bit noisy on start up if left in the normal mode, but can be programmed to operate quieter and in different modes. The two accessory items are advertised being for the Escort detector but they work with the Bel V940. As with any detector, If you are caught by a laser or an instant on radar, your detector may warn you that you just got a ticket, so be vigilent to alerts react quickly and drive responsibly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I love my V940 and the picture is correct. It is what I got and the perfomance is great. I have had mine for a few weeks and it is amazingly accurate. It is also very easy to program in the case that you want to.

I am not a speed demon per se, but like to have the detector as an added safeguard for my road trips within Texas. If anything, during long road trips its a quick snap back to reality to be mindful of limit, especially in the small towns. I've had this for about 6 months or so and it seems to do the job. Gives a pretty fair amount of warning and in some cases while doing city driving, the range is pretty amazing. I think the detector is certainly worth the money. Very loud and there are various settings in terms of brightness. I do have a tiny amount of trouble mounting the detector in certain vehicles (SUVs mainly), but that could just be user error. All in all, I recommend this detector but would also recommended shopping for the best price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Disappointing","review":"On the plus side: you can preset the device to skip the start-up run through all the signals.On the minus side: warning sounds are harsh and raspy, worst I have ever heard.

I had an earlier Bell product and this one is much better made in all respects, from the unit itself to the windshield mount. It also has much less false readings than the earlier one. It has great range too. It picked up a cop under an overpass in the median, which, where he was sitting was like in a hole!! I heard 2 beeps, i slowed and saw the hood of his car sticking up at angle in the median. Then I wondered how his gun was aimed and if he did shoot me, how would he get out to chase me? However my Bell picked him up anyway so i was able to slow in time. Probable the best unit for the money you can buy.

I used on a trip to Colorado. The unit picked up radars a half mile away in some instances, and paid for itself several times over on this single trip. The only flaw I have found with the unit is the windshield attachment. The detector simply slides onto the windshield attachment. Not sure if its the angle of the windshield in my F250, but the thing just slides off the attachment at times. My simple fix was just putting a rubber band around the whole thing to keep it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal, Good Detector","review":"Got this Beltronics to replace an old x-50 that died one me.

The songs are well-put together and this music is all right, but personally it just doesn't do anything for me. The only way I can describe it is that this side of Squarepusher sounds too loaded up with urban pretensions without any higher purpose to balance the effort. Just not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dissappointment","review":"What are you people saying, this album contains neither jazz nor drum n bass. I was excited when i heard of and bought this album, because I know Squarepusher has the potential for genius. he is a musical master.

I dont even see how it can be fun to make? boring and annoying. There are maybe 3 ok songs, and they are average at best. \\"My Sound\\" is the best song and that even gets annoying after, oh, say two listens? This album only proves that techno artists are lazy, and unproductive. Don't mistake noise with music, or talent for that matter. Recording an ant walking on the sand, or a microphone rubbing against carpet may sound like a cool idea, but that doesn't mean you should release it on an album.

Unfortunately, this just seems out of place in his progression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Music Here","review":"Very good music indeed. Tom Jenkinson's homage to the acid jazz of Miles Davis and early funk of Herbie Hancock is very interesting to listen to.

The story line keeps the reader interested and doesn't drag on about one subject. I think that people will find out that the characters displayed in the book are more real than they think. For instance, most sci-fi books have the shoot'em up and get the girl type genre. But this book portrays the life story of Rick Hunter in the Zentraedi conflict. He works to help the citizens of Macross survive in combat and in deep space. Romance and comedy come into play and a whole bunch of other stories surface. The way that Jack McKinney plots the stories will keep you up for hours gripping this book for more.

For Rodney to not only grow up but to grow up to be such a generous person is a wonder! It really inspired me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I disagree with the previous reviews. This book was a quickly written tome of banal anecdotes. Important area's of Rodney's life were only touched upon in an extremely cursory way. For example, his run in with the IRS was touched on, but no details were provided. Ditto- his divorce,his relationship with his children etc.Some of his battles with other comedians were not even mentioned. There was just nothing to sink my teeth into.No angst, no pathos, no emotion- just trivial unimportant stories of only passing interest.Recently on Howard Stern's radio program, Howard asked Rodney why at the age of 80, he decided to write this book. Rodney's answer- \\"a big advance.\\" That says it all.If anyone would like to read a truly great autobiography of a comedian, may I suggest \\"Jackie Oy\\" by Jackie Mason. I truly know the \\"inner Jackie.\\"I still don't know Rodney- too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but light","review":"Rodney wrote his autobiography like he wrote his jokes - short, simple sentences. While this works great for comedy it doesn't work so well for his life story.Don't get me wrong, I love the man, and his story is especially heartbreaking during his early years -- his jokes about not being loved as a child are all too firmly based in reality -- but he omits little details like his marriage to his last wife, only mentioning his married life near the end of the book. It's a good and inspiring story, but in this case Rodney would have been helped by a ghostwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny biography of a great comedian","review":"This book is a mix of biographical information as well as pure comedy. Before I read this book I knew very little about Mr.Dangerfield other than he was a comedian. This covers his entire life starting off when he was a young child; it contains lots of interesting stories, since he lead a very interesting and exciting life. Interspersed between the biographical portions are short jokes written by Rodney Dangerfield, usually accompanying the words \\"I get no respect;\\" his self-deprecating humor is truly one of a kind and will have you laughing out loud many times throughout the book.Great book if you like Rodney or if you just want to read a funny book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible...tons of static","review":"This monitor is the worst on the market.

We know it's not just our house causing it - because friends that have the same monitor complained about the same noise with theirs that they bought around the same time as us. When we use it with battery power alone, the life of the battery wears out in just like 5 nights of using it - and this is just using it when the baby goes to bed until we go to bed. I find it totally unacceptable and will be looking for a different monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH STATIC","review":"This monitor is horrible, I hear the static more than I hear the baby.

We have to turn the volume so far down on this reciever to avoid static that we hear our child first before we hear him on the monitor. Probably a great monitor when you use only one reciever and plan on never switching it from room to room. All in all ---> DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Invest in a better monitor, you'll be glad you did.","review":"This monitor has WAY too much static and makes a ticking noise constantly.

Then, there was so much static I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't hear the baby clearly. I highly recommend the Sony babycall monitor (also carried by Babies R Us, but not online). It has a wonderful voice activated only feature that allows perfect silence from the monitor unless baby is fussing (i.e., you won't hear the vacuum cleaner or the dryer or the neighbor's dog barking, etc. - it only turns on when the baby cries or your spouse talks, etc.) I bought the Sony and retired the Fisher Price and am sleeping better than I have in weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get used to listening to Static!","review":"We also bought this monitor because of the glowing reviews. We have been using it for 7 months and are tolerating it, but definitely would not rate it as a great product. The static is terrible (plus a high-pitched buzz). We are sometimes able to move it to different areas in our room to reduce the static but that never lasts for long. If it's remotely close to any other electronic device there's no chance of it being quiet. Fortunately we've never had trouble hearing our son cry over the static, but it is getting very annoying falling asleep to the sound of static every night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a clear monitor","review":"We received this monitor as a shower gift. When we tested it before our daughter was born it worked fine. Since then, another family in our neighborhood has begun using this monitor.

We are returning this to the store and buying another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"You could hear a pin drop!","review":"This monitor is great. I bought it based on the other reviews. I love it.

Now I use the plug, but there is a slight hum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one","review":"We broke our last monitor, went looking for the least expensive one and ended up with this. The sound quality is awful. The base unit sits over my son's bed, but it still sounds like he's in a tunnel. Second, it does not have rechargeable batteries and eats up 9 volt batteries like nobody's business. This one's cheap (until you add the cost of batteries), and you'll certainly get what you pay for! My advice: Spend a little more and make sure it uses rechargeable batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"This item is great for my family, I can put my son in bed for his nap and go outside and take care of what needs to be done.I can say that it my not be as good for everyone we have four buildings on our property and all of them are made different. I can say that this monitor does not work in anything with powerlines really close or in a tin building.

I really recomend this monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed in Fisher Price","review":"Go ahead and buy a better monior from the start. We recieved this monitor as a shower gift. We have a split floor plan so he slept in our room and we didn't atempt to use monitor till he was 10 weeks old. When we did we could not sleep because of the humming and static. We had keep our son sleeping in our room untill we bought the Sony babycall. Now we can sleep. The Sony has a voice actived feature so at night the monior is quiet untill the baby cries. You can also listen if you want. The sony is quieter with less stactic. Don't waste your money on the Fisher Price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great monitor for the price","review":"Well I purchased this monitor over a year ago when my son was born last November 2002, and I have had no complaints. The monitor does have background noise when you turn it on, and I only use the AC Adaptor, but it works well for my needs. I can hear my son if the volume is down low, and the lights work great. I haven't had a problem with the static, and it's one of the most economical buys out there. So far, Fisher-Price has been a company I have bought many baby items from. So, although others have only had short term luck with their monitor, I highly recommend this product , and I've had it for over a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great monitor","review":"What a bargain...I have had absolutely no problems with this monitor. The lights feature is great if conversation or other noise drowns out the receiver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bang for the Buck","review":"Being that I was having my first baby, I didn't know much about what to get ahead of time. As far as monitors go, I did A LOT of research and read all the reviews. I ended up registering for the Bebe monitor ... . Well, no one bought it for us, and so since we were trying to watch our money, my husband (who also did his own research on baby monitors) ended up coming home with this Fisher Price Sights and Sounds monitor. I was pretty skeptical, but figured it was worth trying. I am SO GLAD that we didn't get that expensive monitor. The Fisher Price monitor works fantastic! No static or buzzing. (Regarding the buzzing, I have heard that if the monitor buzzes, there may be interference from another large appliance close by such as a television, large fish tank, or whatever...)We sleep very sound knowing that we can keep an ear on our precious baby without having to worry if we are missing anything. I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother of 3","review":"I was in need of a third monitor for my home. I have tried many monitors and nothing would work since I already have 2 monitors in use. I was told that I was very lucky to have 2 working, and that I would not be able to have 3 monitors in use at the same time. I decided to try the Sounds N Lights Monitor and so far it's awesome! I have very little static, but it's very minimal compared to the others I have tried. I'm very pleased to have found this monitor because now I can sleep easier being able to hear all 3 of my children, which sleep in different rooms!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very noisy","review":"The only thing I liked about this monitor is that it lit up. It was entirely too noisy. I almost couldn't hear my baby for the noise that the monitor made. Needless to say it only lasted one night in my house. I found the Safety First model to be alot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Junk!!","review":"I just brought this home and as soon as I plugged it in it made a loud buzzing sound. Tons of background static. A complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great, when it works!","review":"After reading the great reviews about this monitor my husband and I desided to get it. After our baby was born we put it to the test. It worked great, I could hear every little sound that our daughter made. About twenty minutes later all you could hear was loud static. We tried everything to fix it. We changed batteries, tried diffrent channels, and even bought a new adapter for it. Nothing worked. We returned it and bought a Graco Clear Range Monitor. It works fantastic. We've never had one single problem with it, and my daugter loves to knock it around a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Monitor!","review":"I researched monitors, and found that this one had pretty good reviews. When we started using it with our newborn, the batteries would only last 4 nights! We switched brands of batteries, but the same thing again. You can count on spending $5-6 a week just on batteries. Now, after using it for 3 weeks with no static, all it does it make static, hum very loudly, or make clicking sounds. You cannot hear the baby when he cries and one can defintely not sleep with all that sound. This monitor is useless and I am very disappointed in the quality. Hopefully Target will take it back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this monitor is junk!","review":"I bought this monitor and it broke within 5 months (only used at night). The reciever will no longer work on batteries and gets static several times a night that is so loud that it wakes me up. It also uses batteries very quickly. I do not recommed this monitor to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than the others","review":"I just bought this monitor after fussing with another brand for a few months. I thought the Fisher-Price brand would offer better quality. When it works, it is very sensitive and I can hear my baby breathing, but it doesn't usually work. When it's plugged in, there is this low buzzing that bothers me while I sleep and I am a heavy sleeper. When it's on battery power, it gets nothing but static if I put it down. I have to hold the antenna to keep the static away. NOT very convenient. I have tried all the recommendations in the directions to no avail. Plus sometimes, the sound just cuts in and out like my baby's on a cell phone and I can't hear him at all for several seconds. So, it looks like another trip to the store to try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static problems","review":"It was a little static-y when we got it, but after a few months of use, it developed a serious problem. At odd intervals, it would make a VERY loud static sound and jolt me out of my sleep! About the time I'd get back to sleep, it would do it again. Adjusting the volume made no difference. It went out with the trash, and I slept in the baby's room till I could get a different one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's cheap for a reason...","review":"This is the WORST monitor we've had so far. The only way to get rid of the static and/or humming noise is to turn the receiver off! We got it yesterday, and it's not getting another chance. I would rather sleep on her hardwood floor in her room than listen to all the noise from this monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the monitor!","review":"We purchased this monitor when we transitioned our 4 month old out of the bassinett in our room, to his crib upstairs. I work nights and was worried that my husband wouldn't hear the baby wake up. We set the monitor on the dresser across the room from the crib and let me tell you it picks up perfectly. It's crystal clear as well. You can hear baby inhale, exhale, grunt, change positions...even little baby toots! :) The range is great as well, we can take it out in the yard and it still works. To wrap it up, this monitor does the job and is not expensive. We're actually going to buy one for grandmas house. Great purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"I enjoyed this monitor for 3 months. I tried using batteries with it at first but there was too much static.

My advise is to buy a different system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy product","review":"This product was horrible. It sucked batteries like they were going out of style.

For the rest of my review please see the comment I added before realising it was a DUTY to let Ellington enthusiasts know this is as good a visual historical record of his 1929-43 period as you are likely to get. There are a few other videos of his later bands contained in the PBS 2-part documentary but to see them means ploughing thru 2 hours of Ducal interviews (which can get rather boring watched over and over)."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been a whole lot better","review":"Credits are important. They help define the creative process and guide the viewer's point of view. We like to know what we are watching, especially nostalgic compilations like this. Other than a few brief liner notes, the DVD does not impart enough information and leaves the viewer disappointed. The Duke is great, this DVD is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its good, but not the best.","review":"Autechre's ideas here are well worth credit. However, I was disappointed that so much of it sounded so similar. This album is called LP5 in Europe and is better presented than white one white, but still Autechre has made a great album.This album is like the thoughts that occur everyday in our heads. It's deep and troubling and can only be good on light listening, heavy listening can get to be too much. Its a combitnation of trance with electronic in an odd setting.While I give it only 4 stars, I think that Autechre has done much more credible work in the past and future of this album. Amber and +++TriRepetae are much better than this, even though this is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precision music artfully decayed","review":"Like Kraftwerk soundfiles buried and exhumed, Autechre's music has the regularity of organic forms decayed. It seems to want to recover its structure as if it were running an endless unsuccessful defrag on itself, and the sadness of this struggle gives the music tremendous weight and melancholy. Going beyond the massive but stuttering creativity of Chiastic Slide, LP5 re-renders techno as a timeless natural form."},{"rating":"2","title":"beyond the digital machine","review":"What a relief to leave all mainstream-techno- grooves behind. The listener is put into a world emerging from subconscioussness, grooves transforming themselves, changing; they live, they're pure emotion from the center of the brain, put into wonderful soundscapes with a slight melancholy. The linearity of trad-techno is broken up, this is not the digital machine, this is music for the human brain, a higher connection. It's just perfect if you're ready to understand and appreciate this album, if you haven't reached it yet, don't start with this to avoid dissapointment and prejudice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The coldest, most organic record of the year","review":"\\"Arch Carrier\\" invoked nightmares of sitting in a maniacal dentist chair, bleeding, waiting to drill. This is horror and beauty without a name or face, but plenty of identity. Each song, meticioulously programmed with the patience of a dark ages monk scribe, forms a sad little dream in itself. Each melody is a cycle of gestation, birth, life, and death. Nothing lies incomplete, except the imagination of the listener after hearing this landmark album. This, along with the stable of artists emerging from the Warp/ Skam Records stables, is the sound not of the future, but of the subconcious present. Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic.","review":"Strangely enough amongst experimental electronics artists, Autechre seem alone in being able to craft ALBUMS as opposed to collections of tracks with perhaps a few good tracks and a lot of irritating rubbish, (see all aphex and squarepusher albums).LP5, (along with chiastic slide and confield) are definitive sonic works, that strangely also work as \\"classic rock albums\\".With decent pacing and mix of tracks, despite not having a single lyric or proper \\"song\\" they can be listened to like a great opera or classic album.Whilst a little too hardcore for some, Ae's later works are masterpieces on the whole, and eventually, like all music, can be appreciated as pure \\"pop\\" once your ears are properly acclimatized.Approach with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rae is worth price of admission by itself.","review":"Okay, I think we've established that Autechre is not for everyone but it is interesting music nonetheless. With this cd, we get to hear a number of dark beats but the one that sticks out the most - and was the reason I bought this to start off - is the song called Rae. It is a very nice beat to say the least.The other songs on this cd are somewhat hard to take at times but tracks 5,6,8, and 10 are all solid. Autechre is a solid cd and of the three Autechre cds I have, this one is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful, on every level. If it could get minus zero, it would deserve it!!","review":"I bought the DVD, understanding it wasnt a documentary, or even a story really related to the actual Lizzie Borden murder mystery, etc. I did expect however, some kind of a decent film, with good acting, a storyline, plot, all those kinds of things that go into a good tale. None of those things will be found in here. The acting is atrocious, the storyline?? ..there isn't one. The special effects are pathetic, and asinine. The whole mess is just a disgrace. I cannot believe I spent money to buy this. Im ashamed. This is one of the worst pieces of drivel, trash I even say, that I have ever been unfortunate enough to watch.

No one did their homework on this piece of junk. Actual documented details of the real case are either left out or contradictory in this 'movie'. At first I was going to just file the DVD away with the annotation that the DVD was a piece of cheesy junk, but then decided it was not even worth including in my Lizzie Borden 'library'- it is even worse than the Elizabeth Montgomery Lizzie Borden movie. People who know the documents facts will cringe at this piece of junk. I ended up throwing the DVD in the trash after painfully watching the first 25 minutes. Besides the stupid premise of the movie (the Lizze had returned) the worst parts were the murder scenes themselves- Andrew and Abby kept screaming hit after hit after hit- you get the point. Don't waste your time. Amazon forces me to give this piece of junk one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lizzie Borden movie","review":"This was not what I expected. I apparently ordered the wrong thing. This movie was a low budget movie. Good thing I didn't spend a lot of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow that sucked","review":"This movie is so awful! It's based on a person who was accused of killing her parents in Fall River Massachusetts.... Not California. How did Lizzie get to the West Coast??? did she take a plane?? The acting is terrible, The lead male was worst of all, I can't even type how terrible he was. I would advise you to see for yourself, but you will need to take a shower after the movie because it makes you feel gross inside. And to top it all off Lizzie gets beat with a punch in the face at the end. A punch in a face, not an explosion or stabbed with her own weapon! A stupid punch in the face. Damn this movie sucks......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great at first, but quality is poor","review":"Purchased 3 for an under counter light in the garage. Worked great for one month.

Time-tested buildings from classical temples to traditional Japanese homes and early modernist masterpieces, are explored in this wide ranging, but focused study. Unwin demonstrates that while architectural styles change over time, the underlying principles that organize quality designs remain remarkably consistent.This book is a must for all architectural students interested in acquiring the visual skills needed to understand a wide variety of design methodologies. My only criticism is that proportion and scale were not given enough attention, but there are many other books that cover this important topic separately.Intelligently considered, and clearly presented, \`Analysing Architecture' is a refreshing counterpoint to the sort of pretentious, self-serving rubbish that Eisenman, Libeskind, Hadid, et al try to pass off as design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful first person book","review":"The Defence of Plevna is a first person story told by a Lieutenant with the Turkish army fighting in the Russo-Turkish war that pretty much ended the Ottoman Empire and established Romania as an independent country. Not unlike a lot of first person war stories, this one reflected the front line despair and want of food/clothes/medical attention.

The problem is that even if you do this, this timer will often get stuck or fail to ring entirely. It looks very nice, but unfortunately it completely fails to do what a timer has to.

Olympics fans will appreciate the tight, informative focus on the Games' schedule and the venues within and without the city. And there are excellent tips on how to survive the outdoor venues (bring food and bring, use sunscreen liberally and take something to sit on).

For Farkle his passion is music and after trying many instruments at the end he finds his \\"fit\\" where he can appreciate all instruments.This might be a bit tedious for adults, but this is a very important lesson for children to learn and to recognize that there are other options out there, just because you start learning music on a piano does not mean you can't try the trombone or if you work in pastels you can't work with watercolors.This is a great read which is funny, fun, and silly, while still maintaining a serious message."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Incredible Farkle McBride","review":"My son loved this book.

Yes, it is formulaic, but that isn't neccessarily a bad thing if done well, as it is in this movie. Now, there is plenty corny parts about it, but there were enough genuine laughs in it to more than balance that out.

I must admit I'd never heard of the guy until my grandmother told me he wanted to send us a gift. I am still reading the book (almost done with it though) and I can't seem to put it down. He is an exceptional writer! I have yelled at the book (Lenny mostly and his obsession with Natalie- give her up man) and even almost cried a few times.

If you've ever known trance, you should know Darren Tate, whether you know it or not. Darren is the man behind such trance behemoths as \\"Jurgen Vries\\", \\"Angelic\\", \\"Orion\\", \\"DT8 Project\\", & \\"Citizen Caned\\". Horizons 01 is destined to go down in trance history with all Darren's other productions. If you like well produced uplifting without the cheese, here you go. Move aside ATB, Darude, Ian Van Dahl, & 4 Strings, the true trance dons are back to reclaim their rightful place on on dance musics throne. Every track on this album is an absolute anthem, it's gonna be hard for a trance album to top this one for a while.

Relying on her own family's years of natural bone health, she gives the reader many facts and field results on the \\"Nutritional Aspect\\" of treating, and improving our bones throughout our lifetime. Her 60+ recipes are original and sometimes very unique, giving a very encourageing start to, hopefully, a new awareness and lifestyle. I have greatly enjoyed reading, learning, and following her many examples and suggestions, and fixing her recipes...I know I feel better already.

Most of the books that I'm asked to review are art instruction books or picture books because I also am a freelance artist. I thought that I should read this book to make sure that I hadn't missed anything. However, the title is misleading. It is not really a book about \\"Evaluating and Reviewing Children's Books\\". A better title would be understanding children's books. Only the last chapter in the book deals with reviewing children's books and that is the shortest chapter. Most of the book is comprised of a comprehensive overview of the different categories of children's books (non-fiction, poetry, picture, easy readers, transitional and fiction). If I had the opportunity to browse through this book in a regular bookstore, it would have stayed on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for teachers!","review":"This book is a required text for a children's litreture course that I am doing.

It changed my outlook dramatically. All I can say is, when someone is totally yielded to God, real life is so much more exciting than fiction.The book starts a little slowly, and sometimes I felt like Olsen was getting bogged down in painstaking theology issues, but I think that reflects the painstaking process the realization of truth was for him. Stick with it, because when the story picks up, you won't be able to put it down. Olsen and his team demonstrate a ministry that is pure gospel rather than cultural imperialism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"The price for any commodity is relative.

All the songs on the CD are very catchy and its like those songs where you listen while bobbing your head but you dont know it. haha maybe i'm the only one that does that. yea yea i know that Dream Street has been gone for a while already but you can still support them and buy their cd.

Their music is fun to listen to and these boys are just all around talented. Now, a note to that mother (no offence of course). Dream Street's lyrics are not sexual in any way! The song \\"Lets Get Funky Tonite\\" is 100% about dancing NOT teens having sex. The song was orginally written for Nsync. You said your kids listened to Nsync too. So if DS wouldn't have sang that song, you would have been throwing Nsync's cd out the window. Nsync's music is way harsher then DS's because the guys are around 20 yrs old singing about strong love while Ds is only 14- 16 singing about young teen crushes. I'm just making my point, so I really think this is a great cd! I myself am only 13 years old but i love these guys' music and talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"cool","review":"I think it was alright,the songs were cool but this could be just another boyband getting success from their looks.personally my favorite song is it happens every time because it gets stuck in your mind.this is just my opinion you don't have to agree but overall it was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Dream Street but keep dreaming","review":"Just be a show to all pre-teen girls, that's all your for.Not to be so crude, but this is awful music.

Some of the songs are OK, but most seem to have lyrics which distinctly and clearly imply encounters of a sexual nature and so are not appropriate for my young children. It's disturbing to listen to a voice which sounds 8 or 10 years old singing these lyrics.

But theyve forgotten to teach them whats most important in the music biz- the music! These 5 boys cannot sing well enough to put out an album that wont be compared to the chipmunks and kiddie sing-alongs. Im not even a huge fan of Nsync or Backstreet, but put them next to Dream Street and you can hands down see whos got the talent, and its not Dream Street!

I bought this CD as a birthday present for my cousin and after 5 minutes of listening to it she asked if I could return it for her. I was appalled that someone actually thinks that these kids have talent. They don't even have a hit. One sign that bands are terrible is when record execs have to advertise them on TV.

I don't care about nstinc. but as u know, bsb is the best of pop! some gurls even say that they'll be the next bsb...pul-leese! tell ur dream street boys to wait another 10 years!then maybe there'll be a little possibility to succeed! dream street r only for gurls under 13. well, I'm 13, and I'm a pop fan, but I hate dreamstreet!please, gurls, do urself a favor, go listen to some better bands such as bsb(my fave ever!),nsync,good charlotte, linkin park, evanescence etc. i'm tellin u, it's not worth it. i'm sure that dream street will be gone b4 u know it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamstreetisnogood","review":"They stink and they are bubble gum pop! None of them have talent! I mean some of there songs. There voices haven't changed. THey sing sooooo high. They make glass crack. If you want a good cd buy Nelly Furtado's Whoa Nelly! So forget about Dreamstreet, you will just be dissapionted."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont like it","review":"Whats with the kid who spikes his hair all the time? Does he think thats hott or something? None of these boys are hott. I saw them on this show called Go For It and they are such posers, they didnt even sing. They just stood up there and lip synced, and yes they were, they didnt even have microphones! The music is more for girls under 13."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Disapointed!!","review":"I was kind of dissapointed with this cd. They sound like little kids, but I can't blame them, because they were my age when they made that cd. The only song I likes was Gotta Get The Girl because Jesse is the only one I like. People respect his vocals. He can get his voice high or low or right in the middle, whenever the song needs it. He did sort of sound like a girl, but he sounds best on the DisneyMania 2 cd. I don't think they should of been Dream Street when they were at that age, they should've at the age of 15 at the most."},{"rating":"1","title":"EW.","review":"What has the world come to? Why are these little kids aloud to make horrible music like this....? Anyway, all this is just a horrible Backstreet Boys clone which is really saying something considering the Backstreet Boys weren't even any good. Not to mention I haven't heard anything from the Backstreet Boys OR Dream Street in quite awhile. Point is stay far FAR away from this and any other music that resembles this. Instead try this cd: Walk Among Us by The Misfits. Might take some getting used to if you're accustomed to this crap, but trust me you'll be glad you made the switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"i luv it!","review":"Dream Street rox this world! i luv their CD! it is off da hook.. i luv it it is soo kewl and learn how to spell pplz...Jesse is soo freakin hot n so is the rest of ds....they have incredibly amazing voices.. very sexy bodz..n everything else..Jesse is such a good actor n singer.The Biggest Fan movie is gonna be awesome.And the Dream Street Live dvd was da bomb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excuse me. . .","review":"I think they're really talented and if you really can't say anything nice about them, and I'll just put this rudely, F**K UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DREAM STREET?Bulls Sh*t!More Lik Seasame Street!","review":"Another Damned Boy Band!Who Sound Like Chix!What Are There Ages?5 Through 7 or Some Sh*t Like That!Why Are 12 Year Olds On The Net They \\"MIGHT\\"\\"ACCEDENTLY\\" click into Some Porn Or Something!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At least someone listens!","review":"Well at least someone has music taste.

These guys have no talent. Aaron Carter's song 'Oh Aaron' deserves a grammy in comparison with 'Feel the Rain'.

Listen to the online samples and judge for yourself.I would have given it 0 stars had it been possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Deserves No Stars","review":"I saw a commercial for this \\"band\\" as I was watching Conan O'Brien, and I thought that it was part of a comedy sketch on the show. Then I came to the realization that this was a real commercial for an actual cd. I'm torn between laughter and anger whenever I see this cd. Seeing this makes the Backstreet Boys look like hard working and talented musicians. It makes me sick to think that the record industry will pay money to support garbage like this, when talented musicians can't even get a record contract."},{"rating":"2","title":"HeY HoTTieZ!","review":"hey every1! ok well...i think that the DS cd is really good if ur a pop lover! when i first saw them i waz like \\"oh gosh the backstreet boyz live\\" and then i heard it and i waz like WOW! these guyz r really hot and really talented so i think u shud try it out and see 4 yo self!k!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talent? keep looking.....","review":"If theres one thing I've learned from Dream Street its that you dont need talent do get somewhere!Well, if you want to hear of this \\"talent\\" thing listen to ACTUAL MUSIC.....Listen, people who love this [music] are slaves!I make a challenge, if you have any guts: buy Aenima by Tool,listen to it, listen to what Maynard james keenan says and if you honestly still love Dream street over Tool you are blind to talent and dont deserve to own a CD player"},{"rating":"1","title":"They'll be good when their voices change!","review":"I listened to some of the songs on this album, and at first I thought I heard girls singing! The vocals were pretty good, but it sounded WAY too much like the girls in the 5th grade chorus way back when!(by the way i'm 13 not 12,... ^_^) Many of the songs are bubblegummy and are only the kind of stuff little teenyboppers would listen to. Yes, I am 13 and I listen to some pop music, but not no-talent kids entertainers who are like, 13 and fourteen! This stuff's so squeaky clean i bet they used clorox on all the cd's! If you like pop or pop rock, listen to someone with talent such as o-town, bsb, michelle branch, etc...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble Gum Anyone?","review":"WOW, I am in a pop R&B group, and were like Nsync. We don't play corny tracks, and corny lyrics like Dreamstreet. This kinda pop is fading out, and Nsync is bringing in the new pop flavor. Our gourp is 15 and 16 yr olds. We don't sing cheesy lyrics, and bad tracks. Try again Dreamstreet on your sophmore album."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's okay","review":"The album is alright, but far from the best. The guys have tallent and maybe in a few years (after their voices break) they'll be worth something. But as for now, I'd personally stick to the older pop groups who are old enough to understand what they're singing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"thiS iS a graet CD!!!","review":"I think this cd is great just like Billy gilman. Feel the Rain is stupendous. Jennifer Goodbye is positively obstinate, while Dream on is a vernacular conclusion to the album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At least they are boys","review":"I got a headache after listening to 5 seconds of their first song. How many more boy bands are their going to be? At least they are boys. But if it's the 15 year old girls that are listening to the 25 year old men of BSB and N'SYNC how old are the girls listening to Dream Street?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD!","review":"Ever since seeing the tv ad on Dreamstreet, I've been nuts about there cd. \\"It happens every time,\\" (my persounal favorite) has a great chorus, and they all have great voices, Jesse especially. I'm an 11 year old boy, and I love there music! It's fun to dance to, or just to turn on when you are board. I'm not big on rap, or that kind of stuff, I'm more of a bsb, Britney Spears, Ateens, pop person. And if you love pop like me, you'll love this cd. I like \\"It happens every time\\" and \\"Sugar Rush\\" the most (Sugar Rush is my favorite song on Ateens Teen Spirit, too). The reason I gave it 4 stars was that I wish it had more songs that I could play over and over and love. Anyway, get the cd, it's awsome. Or if u just like \\"It happens every time\\" get the cd-single. Thats all I have to say, so get the cd, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total trash!","review":"I really hate thi- oh wait, nevermind..

This is just like all the other boy groups out there. THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Unique","review":"I have to admit these guys have talent, but unfortunately it is wasted. I like a couple of the songs, but they've fallen into the same trap as all the other boy groups and young vocalists of today...their songs are virtually interchangable! There is nothing unique in their style to set them apart from N'Sync, Backstreet Boys, Aaron Carter and (God help us) Britney Spears.This style is getting extremely monotonous and with luck I think the public will tire of it very soon. Additionally, virtually every song on this CD is an insipid or sappy love song. But thank heavens there's no rap!So c'mon guys! You've got TALENT, use it to create something new and unique! Forget BSB, N'Sync and especially Britney and do something new. I wish you the best of luck and I mean that sincerely. Just be yourselves! We don't need any more of the same old same old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I SAY YEAH! *****5 star cd","review":"OK to start off they do NOT sound like lill' girls,like you can sing better!Another thing there the best I love the song I SAY YEAH,they also have the freshest dances and cloths.Not only are they talented but very good looking, so if you want the hottest dances and boys you got to get the #1 cd, DREAMSTREEET!And to the others that say there bad,then you don't know music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Street: A New View of Pop","review":"Sure, all of us like the Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and the rest of the old gang. But tired of seeing those flashy, know-it-all past-teens? Well, here's something different. For a change, you could just sit back and relax and not worry about your parent's suspicious glances. Dream Street, unlike recent pop stars, are...all clean. The music has a variety of rhythms to match your moods. This new 5-boy band's music is suprisingly smooth, whether it be \\"Gotta Get the Girl\\", \\"Feel the Rain\\", or \\"I Say Yeah\\". All of them display a diverse set of emotions; wanting, happiness, despair. It's all cuss-free, which let parents take a break from yelling at their kids, making them turn the stereo down. If you ask me, Dream Street is way better than any other CD's I've heard. It's a whole new view of pop music, and I advise all of you buyers to check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A boy band made up of kids........right.","review":"This needs to stop.

Nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS C.D. DESERVES 0 STARS!","review":"When I first saw the commercial for the Dream Street c.d. where they were singing \\"It Happens Everytime\\", I thought that they were the cutest, most talented band that summer. I learned to like them more, and I even got their C.D. for my birthday. But soon I got really sick of listening to these little twerps. Let's face it: They are little kids, they can't sing, they sound like girls (literally!), and they shouldn't be in the music biz. Also, I think they should at least play their own instruments and write their own songs. So, beware of this group- you'll regret ever listening to them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Underaged Singers","review":"These amateurs ...!

And they wear their sun-glasses 24/7! Geesh, you'd think they'd wait til' they actually sounded half-way decent! If you were waiting for something new, you found it! Boys that act like girls!

What gameplay is there consists of the following: walk around, buy equipment, fight repitive tedious menu-based battles that have little to no strategy behind them, and finally watch cut scenes. I suppose you could call it a partially interactive movie but thats about it.Despite the somewhat interesting story and well designed characters I still can't find a reason to play this. But if I want intersting stories and characters sans interactivity I'd much rather watch a movie.Some people enjoy \\"games\\" like Final Fantasy but I certainly don't. If you want a role playing game that actually involves *gasp* role playing and gameplay I highly recommend Fallout 1/2 and Planescape: Torment. Both games allow you to create your own solutions to problems based upon your playing style, possess interesting characters and stories, and have fun challenging strategic combat."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand the hype.","review":"To be fair, this game has amazing graphics. The sound is also superb. However, I have to give it only 1 star because you don't actually get to play the darn game. I spent 2 hours in one sitting \\"playing\\" this game after initially opening it, and I felt like I had just watched a movie with no plot or ending. Bottom line: if you're not an avid role-playing-gamer, this game is probably not for you, especially with its turn based play that leaves you feeling as though there is no real action to be experienced in playing this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, bad game..","review":"I want a game, not a movie. I think I've watched it play with itself more than I've actually played. If you want an interactive movie buy this one, if you want a game try Metal Gear Solid. The graphics are good."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's suppose to be a game not a movie","review":"This game does indeed have some of the best graphics that I have ever seen, but you do more watching than you do playing. To me it seems that with each new release in the series squaresoft concentrates more on the graphics and less on the gameplay. I found this to be the easiest Final Fantasy to beat yet, and the shortest. It is a beatiful game to watch but that's most of what you'll do. I'd recommend renting it first. It is worth at least seeing the graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best RPG game","review":"FFX is the best RPG games i ever played or you can say any FF games are the best except FFVII"},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy Does it again.","review":"What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said. Theres the great graphics, excellent storyline, and suprisingly fun battles and minigames. Who doesn't love playing underwater volleyball with some Hawaiian dude whos team name is the Aurochs?? The only drawbacks to the game are the sometimes cheesy voice acting, mildy overdone cinematics, and the fact that you can't get anywhere if you don't completely understand the sphere system from the beggining(I had to start over because of this). All in all this game is worth at least a rental to average gamers, and definitely a purchase for RPG fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad...","review":"well i have to say that i enjoyed the game. It seemed like this game was rushed while being made. I felt like it overall had a good storyline and the graphics were not too bad. However, the voice overs were horrible. It doesn't even look like they are saying what they are. I felt like this game was a backwards step for squaresoft. It doesn't hold the \\"final fantasy feel\\" to it. I loved FF7 and FF9.

I would recommend renting it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINAL FANTASY X IS THE GREATEST GAME EVER","review":"Final Fantasy X is my favorite game ever. It really goes beyond all gaming experiences.

Also, be sure to buy this when you don't have anything to do in the next few days, because beware: this game is the most addicting game out on the market, i played this for 3 straight days for about 12 hours a day, and i still play it now, 6 months after i bought it, please buy this game if you want to play the very best of ps2 games, this sold way more than GTA3 and MGS2, as hard as it seems it is true, it sold like 2.3 million copies in japan in a span of 4 days! buy this game, any videogame website will rate this at least a 9.3, its that good. do yourself a favor and go get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FFX","review":"I think the is the best Final Fantasy game since FFVII.

That kinda makes it cheap, seeing how you can have a summon Ultra-Powerful. Also, this is also cheap, the multi attaking system. My friends did like 5 hits with one char. every turn. Also, switching chars IN BATTLE! This is so cheap, it is not even funny, just cycle threw all the people once some one dies... But other then that, it is very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One more Final Fantasy Hit!!!","review":"I Love the Final Fantasy series but 10 is by far the best one of them all. It's story line is awsome and graphics amazing! The cut-scenes are unbelivable. The you'll get very attached to the charaters. I've beaten this game and it was very worth my time. I recomend this game to RPG fans and people who like adveture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ya ya! Super Game, Ya!","review":"Okay, first off, I am Japanese, so no jokes, okay? Well this game kicks Sailor Moon behind! I mean this is the KING boys and girls. The graphics are superb, not only in the cutscenes, but also in the normal game playing. The storyline, though confusing at first, is excellent! Ya! Okay to the second point I really really want to tell you that this game has more than 70 hours of gameplay. I played this game for 136 and 25 minutes (sorry, no seconds included!). Being a game reviewer, I am completely for this game! Anyways buy this game Now! It is well worth it!!! Ya ya super game ya!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINAL FANTASY X ROCKS!!!!","review":"Ok, I have played this game for 43 hours thus far according to my save file, and I love this love this game!!!! The FF X virtual world is so addictive! The characters are developed very well, you start to get attached to them as if they were family. LULU is the sexiest FF girl ever!! The storyline is very well thought out, and the graphics blow anything available out of the water!! BUY THIS GAME!, Get a strategy guide for some of the hard puzzles, but play the game through on your own! This game has mad replay value!!!

I own FF7, FF9, and Kingdom Hearts and of course FF10. The graphics was the first thing I noticed about this game. The storyline blew me away. The battle and level system was simple so no hassels. The ending was sad and thats what made it good. I got to know every character since they were described so well. I want to know what happened to Tidus so I'm awaiting for the sequel FF10-2. Anyway If you want to know what I,m talking about buy the game its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Square has done it again!!!","review":"I loved this game. It has an interesting plot and also is a must buy. I bought this game years after its release and it still killed every game ive ever played on the PS2. Let me tell you about it.Graphics: Unreal!! At points it may seem like im lying to ya but it still is magnifceient. The battle system graphics are o.k. but who cares. Your not looking for teriffic stuff when you dont need it. The Summonings are suberb to any ff yet!!!Sound: The word and mouth are slightly off but the charactors voices matches their dicription flawlessly. the musics was remarkable.All in all diffinatly the best rpg out there!!!! BUY IT NOW!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best games ever made","review":"After around 50 hours of gameplay, I have finally beat the game. This was my first RPG and I absolutely loved it. The graphics are amazing, gameplay is awesome, and most of this game has one of the best story lines I have ever seen/heard. This game is truly captivating and will pull you into the Final Fantasy world. You begin to think that Yuna, Tidus, Lulu, Wakka, Rikku, Auron, and Kimhari are your friends; it's a weird feeling after you beat this game because you know you'll never see them again or know what's going on in there lives. This game is a must-have. Put the effort and patience in--it will be all worth it in the end. I promise you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Game !","review":"This is possibly the best Final Fantasy ever. It's got voice acting (which can get hilarious at times), full facial expression (nice), and a new battle system, which makes life a lot easier. You can now switch characters during the battle. Two good things to this is that 1)if a character is low on HP, switch that guy out for someone else, and 2) can raise ALL of the characters' level in one boss fight. Nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"FFX beats all","review":"This games graphics are by far the BEST I have seen on any system. FFX is everything I hoped it'd be and more. This game's rich design and deep plot make it a surefire winner. Tidus is like a cheerfull squall. I loved the characters in this, almost as much as the FFIII characters. This game also had a neat lil side game called BlitzBall. FFX deserves game of the year. I loved every minute of it. Don't rush the game. Play it through slowly and get addapted to the characters and surrondings. The fact that the characters talk is a huge plus! Squaresoft definetly out done themselves this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"FFX...need I say more?","review":"Final Fantasy X is a brilliant game. The graphics are great, especially during the cinematics. In fact, the only complaint I have is that the story is a little more interesting in the begining than near the end, but maybe that's just me."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 STARS","review":"My favorite part of this game is the leveling up system. You get tons of control. If one of your party members starts out as a warrior you can turn him into a mage as you level up.The graphics are awesome the gameplay is kinda the same as most RPG's but that's cool. The story line is good nothing amazing. The voice acting is great except for tidus, but you get used to it.Overall this is a great game but it's not perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottom Line","review":"The bottom line to thhis game isPros:1.

Very cheesy and childish at times"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like, Aaahhh, Totally Awesome","review":"Hail to the person who got rid of that stupid junctioning system in one of the previous Final Fantasy games. The fighting scheme is much simpler. The graphics and story are great. I actually care about what happens to the characters, except Riccu. The FF series is the only role playing games I've ever played and except for the one mentioned in the first sentence above, they have not let me down. Problem is, my wife is mad at me because I played this game before she did. I can only play when she is at work. Thanks a lot Squaresoft!!! You've done it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent(Spoiler)","review":"it is a good game, and it is done very well. The CG scenes are just awesome, and Square's choice of music was equally great. However, it isnt worth playing through. Omega Weapon, which should be nearly unbeatable, i killed in 3 hits. And it is impossible to lose the last fight. It's way too easy. Other than that its a great game, good story line, etc., etc. It just takes away from what FF should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Square outdoes themselves again....","review":"I am about 12 hours into the game and I must say, WOW!!!!! Final Fantasy X kicks major hiney. From the beautiful FMV's to the outstanding, blow you away battles FF X will not disappoint you. And the Summons.... Words can't describe the summons. So far my favorite is Ifrit with his Hellfire attack. I can't wait 'till I get Bahamut. (He's my favorite) This game is the reason I purchased the PSX2, and it was well worth the gobs of money I forked over. The sphere grid system is a little complex, but once I figured it out I like it. You can make your party what you want. From cowardly weaklings to get out of our way we are saving the world heros. Their is only two things I don't like in the game and these are minor nitpicky things:1. The battle system is turn based only.2. They left out the Leviathan, NeoBahamut, and BahamutZero Summons.All in all this game cosmically rules the RPG world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Final Fantasy!","review":"The Final Fantasy saga is the best RPG saga out there. If you think that this game is a \\"movie\\", you [are wrong]. This game has a lot of action, and even though there are a lot of movie clips(just like in every other Final Fantasy game), you get to play and walk around. A lot. This game also features a deep storyline, which needs the movie clips so you could understand it. The video CGI is awesome, especially the Blitzball tournament at the starting. The music is awesome, so are the graphics. If you don't like this game because it ha a lot of movie clips, than you shouldn't consider yourself a Final Fantasy fan. This is the best of it's kind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the pain, the horror","review":"Please don't buy this game, or, even better, buy as many copies of this game as you can and burn them all! Seriously though, the game isn't too terrible, but it doesn't deserve to be apart of the same franchise as other final fantasy games (namely american ffII, III and VII). The change back to a turn based battle system is cool, and so is the concept that you can change characters mid-battle, but the level up system just angers me, the sphere grid is just annoying, especially if you try to max out your characters, because to best do so, you need abilities (i.e triple AP, and Triple overdrive + overdrive-->AP)that are available so late in the game that you have little time to enjoy your uber-characters. The puzzles in the game are annoying and repetitive and the plot, while not too confusing, is non-sensical, contrived, and altogether stupid. Square should have spent more time on making the main quest of the game enjoyable rather than making many long and annoying side-quests"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tis ok...","review":"This game was pretty awesome but I think its a bit cheap that they had 3 graphic styles and it looked like they just threw it all together in some parts. The Plot is awesome but the villain name Sin has been over used many times... they probably could have put a better name... The voice acting was wonderful! Just a couple characters got a bit annoying (aka Tidus, Wakka, Yuna, Rikku) and some of the acting was a bit cheesy but if all that is put aside its a pretty awesome game... I thought the ending was a bit how should I put it... to short :( its kinda sad to... but I won't say anymore... lol I only say it you like really trippy games or are a BIG Final Fantasy fan I say get it cause it really is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy X","review":"I also own this game, and I love it, like all the other Final Fantasy series this one is the best over all, graphics, gameplay, and so forth. However it is the first Final Fantasy game to intigrate Voice over's. The entire game play revolves around a world called Spira. And how the world is under attack buy a large destructive creature named 'Sin' all in all this is a must have in an PS2 Library. However I myself was disappointed when I Finished the game but then again thats just my opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic addition for the FF Series","review":"This game is very unique in the FF series. All of them have their own mini games. FF VIII had the card game which was excellent and this game has Blitz Ball. It's basically like Soccer underwater, it's very cool. But as for the game, it coincides with the FF VIII theme a little I think, and that's why I like it so much. Great graphics, good storyline, all is fantastic. A must have classic for the PS2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy X","review":"The game plays quite well. :) I am very happy with the coddtion the game was in, and I was pleasantly surprised by how fast I recieved the game.

When I got into battle mode, I couldn't believe how [poor] it is. The battle mode is very similar to POKEMON...you press \\"Attack\\" on the screen, and your character automatically runs up to the villian, hits him, and runs back.

It is an animated story that has very mild interaction. For me, it is not a game. If you want to watch a cartoon for most of the time and then play for a couple of minutes and then watch a cartoon for a while and then play for a couple of minutes, etc., etc., then you will love this game, otherwise save your money. If you really are curious, rent it first. This way you don't waste forty+ dollars like I did. The animation is good, but I'm not going to review this for game play, because I do not consider it a game. Some love this game, and some hate it.....This is a rent first, buy later (if you like it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This game is a terrible game! I hated it in every way! The game involved little play, most of it was movies. It was almost like pokemon yellow in the fighting system. The grapics were good but only is some scenes. In the rest, the grapics were grainy. The bosses past the half point of the game were super impossibly hard to beat. Before the half point the bosses were super incedibly easy to beat. The storyline was non progressive.(it stayed the same through the whole game) There was a pokemon style of travel. You walk a bit, fight a bit, and thats about it. The cut scenes were SOOOOOOO LONG, and they wernt always with good grapics. Personally, the only thing that I would recommend this game for is to throw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Glitz No Glamour!","review":"Don't get me wrong I love Final Fantasy but FFX is poo! First you might be expecting a 4 disc set like previous versions but this one is a one disk game. This means less space for a variety of music (The battle song gets real old real fast) and less space for graphics (All the good graphics are the same as they show you on the commercial, nothing new) after you see all the good graphics Square really skimps on the characters details. They turn into 16 bit graphics before your half way through the game. Final Fantasy had a good reputation with previous versions but this one is just riding the comp wave. The next one will have to be better because this one stinks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buen juego, si te gusta juntar un poco de romance con el juego","review":"esta bien el juego, tiene mucha variedad de opciones, el juego en si solo para sacarle el final es corto, pero si quieres saber todo sus trucos y cosas ocultas se tardaran mucho."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy X","review":"This was the Final Fantasy game I have played.

There is nothing in this cheesy after-school-special movie that even resembles a game.Don't get me wrong, the graphics are excellent. However, the graphics get boring after about 5 minutes of \\"gameplay\\" and there is absolutely nothing to support this \\"game\\" after that. I don't understand how you can have two hours of some kid looking startled by every sound and call it a story.I have played this game for about 2 hours and have absolutely no desire to play it any longer.

There is no role playing in this game. You watch about 40 hours of movies and actually control your characters for a couple hours. When you do get to control your characters you can't go anywhere but the few screens that they give you. There is no adventure, no free will, no variation. I've played many RPGs and was really excited to get this game. I could not be more disappointed. If you're looking for an RPG (as opposed to a 40 hour movie) take your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This biggest disappointment since Battle Field Earth","review":"I have been waiting to play this game for over a year. I have read on all the video game sites every week, looking at screen shots, videos etc. To be blunt this is not a video game, it is a 40 hour movie, that lets you push buttons every 5 minutes for about 30 seconds. There is not playing involved, the people who like this game obviously dont like to PLAY video games they would rather watch videos. The graphics look good, but so does Shrek, its the same concept, its not a good looking video game its a good looking movie.

I thought it would be exciting. NOT! You have to sit there and watch these boring scenes and stupid storylines. Then you get a couple seconds of control. Some of the battles are fun, but you have to wait soooo long to get to them, it's not worth it. The worst thing is if you die, you have to sit through all the storyline AGAIN to get back to your battle. No cuts or fast-forwards. I still can't believe that!

I was totaly amazed at all aspects of the game. I was totally shocked to see how advanced it was compared to what I have seen before. Everything was antastic including voiced and facial animation which made the game feel more real than ever (though I wish I knew who did the voices).

Mainly with Seymour the 1st time,Seymour Flux, and the last battle with Yunascela. The videos were excellent, but I thought this mainly went around destroying sin, but got caught in other details. Tidus is pretty weak in the begginning. Auron, Lulu, and Yuna are the best completetion of characters. Still I'm trying to get another secrect aeon (still am confused on that part.) What is up Lulu...though?!? I reccomend buying this game. I am not the true FF fan I have only played 7 and 8 even though FF9 was really child-like still played it. I hope the next one will be even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Some people RPGs. Why do they play them, then? They think that the basic plot of people or making three-pointers is so much better than actual plot. You don't like plot? Don't buy this game.

It's absolutely beautiful, both in the cinema sequences and in game; it's similar enough to other FF titles that the title really belongs yet different enough that they didn't just copy over an old game and stick a new title onto it; and it's an enjoyable game, for the most part. Also, the AP system is a nice break from artificial D&D-style levels and classes. The minigame, Blitzball, is fun (though it could have used a fair amount of tweaking).However, the plot is very, very linear, and mostly predictable. You can't go anywhere except where the plot tells you to until the very end, at a point where (if you actually pay attention to the plot) your character really ought to want to face the final bosses ASAP. Game balance towards the end is poorly done, as enemies are all either far too easy or ridiculously difficult.Overall, enjoyable, but certainly not perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game, bit easy","review":"I really like the final fantasy series.

I spent many a hour playing it. The graphics are SUPERB. Some are the very best i have ever seen on this system. But, alas, it has some faults. The main charecter, Tidus, is a wee bit of a WHINER. He has the voice of a child's and complains (and dresses) like one. His dialouge is kind of spotty too. But the charecters are solid, and you definitely start to love them.

It really is milestone in the Final Fantasy series with the inovation of facial expressions and SPEAKING.

The controls are really simple to learn and the learning curve is adequate for beginners to the series. Now over to the storyline, which nothing new.

In my opinion the story is pretty solid, the fight system is good because you can actually use everyone instead of a focused party, and the sphere system is cool because it allows you to do a ton with each character (except Rikku, she seems terrible no matter what you do). My biggest issue with this game is Tidus. I think it's mostly just his voice but there are times where he just sounds soooo annoying.

I don't understand the buttons. The cut scenes are cool, but the guy does not respond to my controller movements during them. This is unfair because I want to move the player. The character, Tidus, whines too much. She is definitely not a loveable character. But, the ending makes up for everything, when Wakka gets killed by Tidus. Justice is served.

The fighting scenes aren't much better, you get to choose a target and mode of attack, than as usual you get to watch.The graphics are really good, but if I wanted a video/movie or whatever you want to call it than I'd watch a movie, and I would choose one with a better story."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"OK, THIS GAME HAS SOME GOOD THINGS BUT THEY DONT MAKE THIS GAME GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME TO GIVE IT 2 STARS.

The \\"Cloister of Trials\\" puzzles can be a little tough and complicated at times, but you feel a sense of accomplishment after completing them. I started 3 new games already, and I haven't had the game all that long. I just love to see my characters grow stronger, and I also found out that I missed something the first time around (like treasure chests,etc.). That's not to say that I ever finished the first game I started. I am taking my time playing the game, enjoying it as I go. \\"Blitzball\\" is not one of my favorite episodes in the game, because it is kind of complicated, and I just can't seem to get the hang of it. It's just a little extra, that I'm sure other players would enjoy. All in all it is a great game, wich I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of your time and money","review":"This game should get the prize for MOST BORING GAME.

I got about 8 hours into this game and then had to quit. The story was bland and unoriginal. Protect the summoner, kill the monster. The graphics were good, but could have been better (Compared to Metroid Prime, these are just ok). The battle system was ok, but the Sphere Grid was a bit much. The voiceovers, oh God the voiceovers, they hardly matched the moving of the mouths. The voice of Wakka was cheesy. Tidus sounded like he was whining the whole time and the script made him sound like an idiot. Yuna sounds like an airhead. Auron sounds too overly dramatic. Seymour's voice hurt my ears. The high point of the game was blitzball, although the music could have varied from time to time instead of the same technoish song in every single match (it gets annoying).The best in this series are FF 6,7, and 8, although the gameplay in 8 is horrid, the story is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Fantasy X...... please......","review":"this game is dumb and the people who like it just like the same thing over and over again (u just use the same spells and stuff). The only fun thing about is Blitz ball, and that is were the 1 star comes in! so here is a warning to all rpgers out there, stay away from this game cause if u buy it, you just wasted money.

Everything is scripted, and the movie sequences are agonizingly long, although the story is not that bad. BUT, THIS IS NOT A GAME! This is an interactive movie, in which you could close your eyes and just push the \\"x\\" button continuously for 36 hours and have the \\"game\\" be over. Not worth anyone's time- I am deeply dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a movie not a game!!!","review":"I realize that a lot of people love this game but frankly it is just not my cup of tea. Most of the time you do nothing but watch a movie. It has to be the longest movie ever. Even when you do get to play all you do is walk from point A to B. It is just plain boring and really slow. I admit it could get better at the end. I haven't invested the 300 hours that my brother has, but there are a lot better games out there where you get to play right from the beginning instead of a hundred hours into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? I can't pick zero stars?","review":"Not to offend the fanboys of the final fantasy series, but this game is not an RPG in the slightest way. It's pretty to look at, and yes it has a storyline, but you don't really get to play a role. Any real RPG fan out there will hate this game; it has very little in the way of interactivity.

After playing this game you might want to buy the whole series, like me! This game isn't short, but not long either. But when you finish the game, you wish it were longer. This game is so good I beat it twice and am playing it again! The graphics are amazing and so is the environments and movies.This game is a story about a boy called Tidus, that's a star blitzball player, who gets transported 1,000 years into the future and is on a quest to help a summoner called Yuna, to defeat a monster called Sin, with the rest of her guardians.This game is really also a movie, because the story is really good!

I can't wait for FFX-2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Final Fantasy have reached perfection?","review":"This game is what I consider the best game in the series, with more movie like qaulities, some of the best music in any video game I've seen, and a more advanced way of leveling up.

There's really nothing that spectacular about this game. The graphics are great for PS2, the turn based fighting is a nice touch, but everything else about this game is laughable. The story line was sad, the voice acting is terrible, and seriously, the enemy is a dude dressed in drag. Whatever happened to real villains like Sephiroth? I bought this game so cheap, that I'm not even going to force myself to complete it. If you like stories that are exciting, well written, full of twists and turns, and have characters with depth, KEEP LOOKING; I guarantee that this is not that game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy 10","review":"I never realy liked turn based RPG. But when I bought Final fantasy 10 it changed my mind for ever. In the first place I did not enjoy TB(rpg)'s is for the single reason that the gameplay was way to slow and never really kept my intrest. But what makes FF10 an exepction is it's simple but complex battle system almost never ruined the pace. And with the additon of voice acting and a story like no other made it better then the rest. Therefore, FF10 should be your game of choice when it comes to TB(rpg)."},{"rating":"2","title":"have bought this game 4 times","review":"Because of carelessness on my part I have had to purchase this game 4 times!

This is more movie than game, and I'm sad to see that Square decided to bring the series here. I will say that the graphics are stunning, the story is decent, and the sound is good...but the gameplay bites. The major flaw is that you don't feel as if you are in control of anything. The game forces you to go to the next event, witness it, and move to the next. This is how many RPG's start, but this one is entirely like that. Also, the character advancement system is retarded. If you ever want to have a character who is truly great, you will literally have to spend DAYS bringing him around the stupid grid. What was wrong with a level system? And where are the moogles??? A FF title without moogles is just wrong. In short, save your money.

I was really excited to try out this new game that I was positive I would really enjoy. I'm still trying to like it 8 hours into the game! Now, it is obviously good enough to keep my interest for this long, but I'm sure I'd never want to replay it. From what I have gathered, it's like an interactive movie. You go where you are led, you watch a lot of movie clips, you fight monsters and expect a hard battle, but it takes no skill or strategy to defeat.I actually cannot believe so many people think this game is so great. I'm assuming you must be a Final Fantasy fan to truly enjoy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay...","review":"If you want a longterm game that you'll actually want to play over and over again, this game is not for you.As a reporter and forum maintainer at gamespot.com, I've played the Japanese version of this game. Unfortunately, the story is a bit lacking in most parts and after the \\"glare\\" of this game fades away, you'll most likely wish you bought some other game, Be it the classic games like Chrono Trigger, or newer unappreciated games like the Breath of Fire series, Dragon Warrior VII, and Super Smash Bros Mele.My advice is to rent this game first for a week or two. At first I thought this game was going to revolutionize gaming too, but I soon realized that if all games were like this, I'd drop out of the industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"epic fail","review":"this game gets boring as you go, the story is rather bland, and whoever came up with the ending needs to be slapped. it sucked! you'll want to put your PS2 through a wall when this game is over. buy 'Star Ocean: til the end of time' instead. it is waaaaaaaaay better.but if you are still interested...the premise is the same as every other final fantasy game. there is a good guy. a bad guy. a guy that turns out to be the real baddest bad guy and a chick. add in a quest, random battles, optional megaultrasuper bosses, characters that join with bad attitudes and reaaaaaaaaaalllllllllly big weapons. don't get me wrong, square enix pumps out some good RPG's, but this one just sucked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy X is awsome!","review":"Cinema Scenes:Graphics are so good, they look 100% real!Gameplay:The gameplay is good, but the game is half movie and half playing.

The only thing thats wrong with the game is the english dubbing. But you'll get use to it. The game is only one disc. But don't worry, its a DVD ROM. So its about over 40 hours long. DVD ROM is like 4.7 gigabytes of space (which is more than four discs) and the orginal Playstation one disc are like 700 megabytes of space (which makes 2.7 gigabytes with four discs). So it is going to be a long game. I can't wait for this game to come out.

As a longtime Final Fantasy gameplayer, every series has been enhanced in creativety. I've been through the development process, it's not easy. We must support Square for their tedious work in bringing 5 stars RPG into market because I want to play them.

The only thing I don't like about the graphics are that they are too bright, happy and colorful. I haven't played much yet, only about 2 hours or so but I'm pretty sure I'm going to just abandon it until I finish playing Shadow Hearts.

Some plusses are the new level up system (which would seem very confusing if I explained it here, but is actually quite simple. play the game and find out for yourself), the fact that the characters talk, amazing graphics, and an improvement on the GFs from FFVIII called Aeons. Some minuses...there's no world map, so exploring doesn't have the same thrill, some characters have abilities that are completely impractical (such as one character's ability to learn enemy attacks...that do almost no damage) and the lamea$$ minigame...blitzball, which is in essence, turn based football.

Why you ask? it's simple. I hate turn based games. In fact I wonder why there are so many positive reviews for the most boring, time consuming game of all time. final fantasy x is not a game, but a slightly interactive movie. Why watch animated characters talking when real people are much more interesting. For those of you who like this game you know nothing of real entertainment. The point of a videogame is to play not watch. But this really goes to all rpgs what is so fun about taking turns hitting each other. If you want real entertainment stop playing rpgs and start playing real time games. I recommend grand theft auto 3 and/or max payne."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible game","review":"The day of RPG's is over.

The story is long and dull if you liked FF 1-9 AVOID FF 10"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most famous additions to the Square Enix family.","review":"The first Final Fantasy game to hit the PS2, and one of the best to be sure. A deep and fantastic story, 30 plus hours of gameplay, with gorgeous graphics even by todays standards. There is a reason this game made it to greatest hits status."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linear Garbage","review":"These new game consoles just don't get it!!! Rpg's of old were so entertaining and satisfying because you could spend hours exploring and goofing off. The storylines were there but you could take a break from it and do something else.

The storyline is terrific, there's lots of character development, and there are tons of interesting places in Spira for you to visit. In some places it's annoying when you get attacked every ten seconds, but overall, it's a cool game. Plus, the advancement system is fun and original.If you're looking for a good RPG with a good plot, excellent gameplay and pretty good graphics, FFX is the game for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"For a RPG fan, you will find yourself not being able to put this down.

Now don't get me wrong, pokemon was a great game, but on PlayStation2, I expect a little better. So what do you do? Walk around unimaginative maps where you have absolutely no freedom to explore. Then, at any moment, the screen flashes, and a monster appears that you must battle with your own. The battles are fought entirely on boring, menus. When you kill a monster, you are bombarded by huge, meaningless numbers. The whole game just screams \\"pokemon\\". Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"INSANE graphics... and that's all","review":"If there is an RPG that is the polar opposite of Ephemeral Fantasia this one is it. Whereas in Ephemeral you have graphics that look as if they were made for a first generation PS1 game but a great story in FFX you have the best graphics I've ever seen and a story that seems to have been written by a chimp with a banana and a quill pen. The advancement system was nice and non linear which allowed for your heroes to become like demi gods by the end but some of the things you had to do for the legendary weapons were downright annoying and no fun at all. 1 star for the graphics and one star for the advancement system and that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What we have all been waiting for","review":"This game is everyone's dream on the ps2.

It is definitely worth the asking price and without a doubt 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD GAME","review":"To start off, I think this is probly the worst game I have ever played. I thought the plot, characters, and gameplay sucked. I would NOT recomend this, because it can not keep up with Legendary games like the Resident Evil, Onimusha, and Devil May Cry series. Not only that, but I thought the whole Final Fantasy series was BAD. So buy a game worth buying, and get Resident Evil 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a good, fun video games, stay away from this one","review":"While the graphics are good among the best on PS2 the game itself is long, tedious, and boring.

The first thing you'll notice about this game are teh graphics which are really breathtaking. Square has pushed the possibilities of the PS2 farther than any other developer. The main difference between FFX and earlier games, is that FFX has real-time 3D graphics (instead of rendered backdrops). These graphics are so good I first thought I was seeing FMV. I am used to seeing great graphics on my 1,7 GHz PC with a Geforce3-card, but FFX rivals almost any PC-game!But this game also has some downsides. The voiceacting is very, very bad. The story is also a bit dissapointing.Still it's the best looking PS2 game and it's very addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"FFX- rules","review":"I LOVE this game.

This game rocked, although the sphere grid was a little hard to figure out at first, but good things in time.I highly recomend this game,( if you do buy this game be sure to use Kimahri's Lancet abillity alot, you can steal enemy moves).

Many other games have shared that trait. But Final Fantasy has one thing most games lack. An actual plot.The people in the game come to be more real than those you see in a movie or read in a book, or even sometimes real people. When I played Final Fantasy VIII I fell in love with Rinoa, and in FF IX I felt real pity for Vivi. Playing these games are like having other lives you can visit anytime you want. Had a bad day? Don't worry, once you get home you can become Tidus and save the world from Sin. People who have played Final Fantasies before might think that the changes are horrible and that it was better before, but each game something new changes and almost everytime for the better. It may take up a good portion of your time for a while, but I believe it to be well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best game for the ps 2","review":"if i could say one thing about this game it would be: wow.there are so many good things in this game, for instance: the battle system(finally a true turn based battle system), the sphere grid(level up system), the storyline(so many twists and turns), the character design, the worlds, the side quests.there are only two bad things i can say about this game 1. it is very linear, second the lip syning is not very good but decent.if you own a ps2, go out and buy final fantasy 10, if you dont really like rpg's as i did before i played ff10, you will be addicted after beating this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"final fantasy x oh it is final alright","review":"this game is fun but it get me lost all the time and when you fight you have to wait to take turns hiting your enemy but in other games you can just fight and fight with out waiting to take turns but overall the game is ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"i got this game right when it came out thinking that it would be fun like all the others. i was wrong.

It gets points for graphics and voice acting though."},{"rating":"1","title":"All in all a disappointment.","review":"So far I'm about ten hours into this game. Which isn't saying much. Most of the gameplay isn't really gameplay. On average, for every hour you play for about ten or fifteen minutes you can actually control what your party does. Everything else is just drawn out micro-cinemas. I am a big fan of all the other FF games but I think they went a little overboard on the cinematic aspect of this game. The graphics are amazing. That's true. I'm not trying to dispute that. It does however, take more than dazzeling graphics to make a game work. I think square sacrificed some of the finer points of gameplay to accomodate the stunning visuals.I would recomend this game to anyone because I am loyal to the series and it still may surprise me yet. Just be warned to be patient and be ready to put your controller down often. Also, up until this point the storyline has been relativley flat and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"review","review":"this game is pretty decent aside from how insanely long the cutscenes are. Esp. the one at mihen highroad with yuna, O MY GOD. that took almost 20 minutes! the graphics are pretty decent, probably the best about this game. the battle system, its all right but the turn system is annoying. the little fiend just dances around waiting for u to pick a spell to blow it staight to hell. i would say that the first time u play this game it is fun if you are a newbie to ff and ffx is ur first in the series. its because u dont know what ff was. ffvII was definitly at the top. if this is your first ff game i would reccomend buying it. oh and another thing, what the hell is sin? he looks like a giant blob of horse manure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest Game I Whish I Never Had Played","review":"I have been a big fan of the Final Fantasy series so when X came out I immediately bought it. When I started playing the game and the characters actually spoke instead of just reading text, I went nuts. Then I saw the graphics for the cut scenes and almost cried it was that impressive.

Normally, I had always told people thta if they wanted to learn how to play, a good one to start with was FF1 (Bad graphics, but was a good start to a new RPG'er).

Most of it is just talking and it is even worse than Nintendo 64's \\"Legend of Zelda - Ocorania of Time\\", which was a good game, but about four hours of it is just talking.

I have been a follower since FF7 (my opinion the best game ever!!!). FF8 didn't live up to the hype and FF9 was ok. At first kept comparing the differences among the games, that's where I messed up. FF series is not a sequel, it is a series and collection of enriched storylines and adventures.

The graphics are great, characters are ok. The main character, Tidus, is kind of a brat at the beginning. Everybody else is ok. There are tons of weapons, way too many monsters, (you get tired of them jumping on you when your just walking down a road.), and chocobos! I like the fact that you can go to a theater to watch the cinema sences over again. Sometimes it's more like a movie than a game, but it has a really good story line, and if you can't beat something...you want to see what happens next. The ending is really sad, so beware.

The worlds were attractive and I think that more effort was put into them than into any other aspect of the game (bar the cut-scenes). I also think that the main hero (whom I named Gus) should look different to all of those other heros in final fantasys 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9!

This game had its weak points though, one of them being the ending, i mean, that was so out of the blue, and it was very dissapointing in my opinion. I mean, come on, Tidus, a dream, Auron dies, and Seamour is no real challenge all throughout the game. I would buy the game, but be prepared, it can be a little off topic at points."},{"rating":"2","title":"best rpg for ps2","review":"In a lot of FF games you'll get tired and give up, but this isn't one of them. It is the shortest FF game so far, only about 50 hours. It is so addictive and so much fun. You will have to probably start 2 games in order to beat it, you will have to put extra effort into training your party to beat it. The best part of FFX is blitzball. It's great and the creators put a lot of effort into making this sport along with the great game itself. It is kind of like soccer but a lot cooler. Its better then any harrry potter quiddich [stuff]. The graphics arent perfect but the story makes up for it. Get this game if you are a rpg fan!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"give me something to do..","review":"I'm only a couple of hours into the game, but so far I've been getting a little frustrated. FFX has way too many cut-scenes and I've been finding myself getting really bored and waiting for something to happen- something that involves ME taking part in the action! What's more disappointing, is that the game is very unchallenging. Maybe I'm not far enough into the game yet, but so far it seems I've been babied in the fighting sequences. There's constantly someone telling me the best strategies of beating the bosses, and so far I've had no trouble staying alive. The graphics never cease to amaze me, and the fighting sequences are absolutely astounding. It's a very entertaining game. This is my first PS2 game, and it's been well worth the money.

Final Fantasy 9 got me in kind of a light hearted mood, and this game is anything but light hearted. (For instance, don't look for a Hollywood ending!)However, die hard fans will probably enjoy the overall experience. You will find yourself confused sometimes (but we FF fans are used to that, right?) and depressed at others. But what was unforgivable to me was seeing as it took me 70 hours to beat, I was really hoping for a much better (longer? happier? You name it!) ending.But really, if you aren't looking for an uplifting game, but rather a dramatic, almost movie like experience (with interruptions in which you battle monsters) go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Game","review":"First let me say this, FFX does not live up to FF7. Much of this game is simply watching. I am about 5 hours in and so far i have only played about 45 minutes, excluding battles. Also it is pretty much straight forward, there is always a map in the upperleft hand corner that always has a red arrow on it telling you where to go...not much required here. I get kind of bored of it after awhile, storyline is very interesting either. I think id rather go play ff7 again. Also another huge con is that you cannot skip through the scenes, this can get VERY tedious. Voice overs can get anoying sometimes, although it is a step up from stictly text games. Battles are good too, some times overly chalenging. I am really dissapointed in this game. The only reason im gonna finsih this game is because i bought it and dont want to waste the money. Definitley rent this game first!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Calling this a \\"game\\" is a generous use of the term","review":"I was expecting this to be a role-playing game, but what I found instead is that it's a movie, albeit one where you have to hit the buttons every few minutes to move the story along.The plot seems very linear to the point where there's not a whole lot you can do to influence it. It seems pretty hard to die, and a great majority of my time was spent watching cutscenes rather than doing any role playing, or for that matter playing of any kind. I'm actually a bit baffled by the sheer number of positive reviews. Sure, there's brilliant eye candy and a gripping plot, but there's no compelling game underneath."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is crap","review":"If I wanted to watch a movie I'd rent one. How can games like this be called \\"games\\" when all you do is sit there watching tv while the controller lay helplessly in your hands? I rented this game (thank God) before I was going to buy it. I think I put up with it for about an hour. Once in a whie you get to push a few buttons to fight and then you're stuck watching another movie forever!!! PLUS, I hate this crap with new games not letting you skip scenes. This goes for Jack and Daxter too. Dark Cloud is the only PS2 game that I actually enjoyed. I like Baldurs Gate too but it was WAY too short.Bottom line: this game sucks. I'm bored. I need a game that I can play and not just watch for crying out loud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Final Fantasy","review":"This Final Fantasy brought me to tears many times. Mostly, it was because of the horrible dialogue. The character's voices only added to the intense pain, which was already extreme due to Tidus' complete and utter stupidity throughout most of the game. What happened to the powerful leading roles like back on the SNES? I don't really like the new AP system, because it makes you constantly have to upgrade your guys, instead of automatically doing it for you at level up. It would be alright if maybe parties gained abilities doing that. Also, Kilmahri's character basically just ends in this system, forcing you to take him on another route no matter what. I also disliked how Aeons could only fight by themselves, unlike the others (Espers and what not) in the series. However, I am willing to give it 2 stars. 1 for the graphics, and 1 for the music, which is excellent throughout the game. I do not recommend this game to any real Final Fantasy fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good game","review":"I bought this game at the full price, and discovered that all the hype was flat wrong. The cut scenes were amazing, and the character leveling it very interesting, but that is all. The game is very linear. There is NO decision making on the part of the gamer about where to go or what to do. The battle scenes are contrived and turn based, which I've always found boring and irritating. It takes no skill or imagination to manuver through this game. I wish I'd never bought this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game just plain ......","review":"This game was so [sad and simple]compared to any Final Fantasy game! It had a terrible story line, gameplay was repetative It told you where to go instead of talking to people, the lack of world map and terrible no-strategy-required battle system, the...sphere grid was annoying and stupid, the ending sucked, there where about 3 looks for any weapon, the characters where [sad and simple] being that Tidus is such a wimp and a [nithing], and the ending was [so bad]. Blitzball was stupid. The only good thing was the graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This has to be the lamest excuse for an RPG ever created. The story has little depth, the characters are bland and the sphere level system is very tedious and annoying.

I see all these 5 star reviews and i realise these people wouldnt recognize a good rpg if it bit them on toe. It has the same repeating storyline throughout the game, the fighting in this game is not great at all and the only good graphics are during movie sequences. square- what were you thinking? Ill sumarize what you do through the entire game in a single setence. Walk, fight, watch movie repeat. and thats it.

On the demo, you can't access the menu, so you can't understand the battle system until you play the game. A lot of people have been whining about how there's no world map, that \\"the voices suck\\", and that the new battle system sucks too. The truth is, there is nothing wrong with this game, and it is exceptional in every light. The voices are for the most part very well done. The new battle system, which utilizes a Sphere Grid, is a nice change from the traditional level/experience system. On the topic of the world map, there is still a lot to explore even though you're guided through each passage. The graphics are simply amazing. This game is so addicting. After playing the demo, I thought the game was just a rip of Final Fantasy VIII, but it's not. So far, Final Fantasy X is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best So Far!","review":"This is the best, and most complex \\"Final Fantasy\\" game so far (at least until \\"Final Fantasy XI\\" comes out... lol).Guaranteed to keep you busy for at least 60 hours.Definately a MUST BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, unless you play games to watch movies","review":"I admit this is the first Final Fantasy game I have played, so maybe the others are like this one. However, I can't see how a series can be so popular if all you do is watch the game being played in front of you.Another thing that I will admit is that I haven't finished it. I only played it for a total of 3 hours. The truth is it is too boring to continue.The graphics are great, but the story is stupid. You can't move two steps without having to watch a 3 minute movie. When you do get to move you can't possibly go in the wrong direction or make a mistake. It is way too linear.The battle sequences are moronic. You take a turn, then the person you play takes a turn, then the enemy takes a turn. There is no defense or strategy to it. Absolutely stupid for a PS2 game.My main gripe is the lead character. I hate him. I have no interest in controlling a ignorant surfer-dude. He should have died in the flood.Don't waste your time with this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Fantasy BITES!!!!!!

Yeah, the graphics are dazzling, but the interaction between the gamer and the game is nil-nothing, nada, zippo. You have no control over what you do during the game's progress, the story line is terribly lame, the cutscenes are numerous and verrrrry long, and the main character which you have to \\"control\\" is a boring, pathetic character that makes one not really care if he lives or dies. Truth be told, if this dude would have died when the game started and spared me the agony of wasting one second of my time playing this one, I'd have been forever grateful. Bottom line is don't waste your hard-earned cash on this one-the people who made it should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this montrosity on the buying public. It's that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not the best, but it rules!","review":"Final Fantasy X was the first PS2 entry for this incredible series, and I believe the second PS2 game from Square Enix (after \\"The Bouncer.\\") The game is, for the record, not nearly as long as the three previous FF attempts from Square, but it does have several great new things that really add to the awesomeness of the game.Pros:-Phenomenal visuals, both in-game and CG.-Decent voice acting.-New and much improved battle system.-Unique summon system.-BLITZBALL!-A great soundtrack.-A totally new story.Cons:-Some voice acting is pretty laughable.-It's a bit short-I beat it in about 50 hours.-Some gamers may see it as more of a movie than a game.The reason I say this is that there is a lot of story, and it may bore some gamers. However, it has plenty of action, and it also is much more challenging than FFIX. Overall, I highly recommend it to fans of FF games, especially FFVIII."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I thought this series hit it's apex with FFVII. Make no mistake, however, this game is the absolute CROWN JEWEL of the FF series.Anybody that enjoys role-playing games should be MANDATED to own FFX.

As good as that book was, however, its follow-up is, in many ways, superior--richer in anecdote, more analytical, covering hundreds of years of history. For those readers with aninterest in Japan, *The Dark Side* is, it almost goes without saying, a must-have. But this is also a painlessly instructive volume for those with an interest in the more general, and always fascinatingly complex, subject of crime and punishment.

But this is post-cyberpunk with better language - rich vivid and dense at times but never off the point.Like some other recent SF writers she sets up characters who look like cyberpunk stereotypes (karate-kicking street kid with a heart of gold etc.), but who in fact turn out to vulnerable, messed-up and, well, human.But it's missing something that I can't quite work out... perhaps a particular spark of originality that would have made it something really special."},{"rating":"2","title":"a compulsive read","review":"This is a good one, and hard to put down.

Perhaps not as good as Tinker Tailor... but few books are, even by Carre. The reason I gave this recording such a low rating is that I cannot STAND the narrator's delivery or voice. He reads the book as if perusing a last weeks newspaper-- no sense of pace, long pauses between the sentences. And that appalling voice! Dry and rasping like a used sandpaper but at same time rather effete! Dreadful.Unfortunately, the narrator Frederick Davidson is used on a lot of British audio recordings. I had to return his P.G.

In some ways, with the advantage of hindsight, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the transformation of China into an economic power, and the end of the Cold War, the book serves as a useful reminder of what the world was like in the mid-1970s. Le Carre's plot, as always, is complex, his characters compelling, and the deliberative pace (matching George Smiley's personality and work method) is captivating. The reader is drawn into a many-layered and intricate web that only slowly reveals itself as the story moves toward its ending climax. I did not read this book when it first came out, but as a look back at the world as it was, it is fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lengthy but worthwhile","review":"The story is as cerebral as Tinker, Tailor, and perhaps more ambitious, but I thought easier to follow and of course he doesn't prostitute himself to the Clean Ending at the expensive of realism. It's an adequate successor and continues the tradition of highbrow espionage from JLC in that it's more about how these people are changed by this work than it is about dead letter boxes and tradecraft. If you've taken the time to research it to the point that you're reading this review, you should read the book. However, if you are looking for more immediately digestible thrills, look into Frederick Forsyth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Le Carre's Mastery","review":"This novel, the centerpiece of the Karla trilogy, is an engrossing example of Le Carre's genius.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly excellent","review":"This is not only the best by le Carre, it is also one of the best written, most entrancingly hypnotic books I've ever read. Yes, it's about spies (boring, boring?) and foreign lands (of which we know little - and care less?), and it's quite long and pretty difficult, but I think it's great literature.

The horrors of Cold War espionage - deception, blackmail, torture and murder - are all here, along with one of the most unlikely love stories anywhere. The reader is slowly and relentlessly drawn in as loyalties are gradually stretched beyond the breaking point.At the center of it all: Jerry Westerby - the unforgettable war correspondent/spy whose choices lead the reader to a place where we don't know who to root for anymore.Le Carre's descriptions of Hong Kong, Tuscany, London and Vientiane offer an evocative portrait of the mid-1970's, but it's the moral ambiguities of his shadow warriors and the choices they face - those are what keep you turning the pages.Highest recommendation.

Jerry Westerby's quest all over East Asia for not even he knew what and his bull-headed stupidity all the way through bored and frustrated me. I loved the sections about George Smiley's slow, careful investigation in England, but the writing style that worked so well in the England sections just got boring in Hong Kong and Laos. Le Carr�� said he wished he'd kept Smiley out of the book because he detracted attention away from the main character, Westerby. That's only because Westerby, after a promising beginning, became such a dull and muddy-mettled wanderer that I longed for him to go away and for fascinating, clever Smiley to come back.Thus far this is the only Le Carr�� book I have not enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I've read a number of LeCarre novels (most of the Smiley series) and this one was a fight to get through.

This interior rear view mirror with map lights is the exact same design, cut, style, etc. as the rv mirror I had previously that came with the car when purchased at the the dealership. If you need a rv mirror replacement for a 2006 Toyota Corolla S, this should be the exact same one you will need to replace the old/broken one, unless you prefer other designs/added features. However, before I came down to purchasing this one, I did read that some Toyota Corolla cars do and/or don't come with map light features on their rv mirrors.

However, I was expecting it to be able to plug directly into the line, or the power cable that I already had from the rear view mirror that came with the car. This one had a whole new wiring kit, which I didn't need. I looked up what kind to buy for my vehicle (1999 Chevy S-10) and all I was able to find was this one. My plug is small and square, where this one is small and oblong, or a long rectangle. I haven't had a chance re-wire yet, but thought I should mention it before someone else thinks the same.Overall, great quality, but not what I needed.

The buttons are soft and grippy which is a nice touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality issue on this one.","review":"Look out. It's hard to look back. This mirror maker has made a lot of mirrors for GM and probably others, but the one I got from them is terribly inaccurate. When flipping the lever to a night mirror, I have to re-adjust the entire mirror itself as the inner angle is way off. It's an unnecessary pain. I'd have sent it back if it hadn't taken so long to find out. (wife's car) Very poor quality control. Paid too much for this $8 mirror. You might ought to pass on this one...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD Player...love it!!","review":"I just bought this player because my old Hitachi wouldn't play anything with a high digital content (Star Wars ep 1&2, Monster's Inc, Spiderman etc..) or any of my homemade dvd-r's, which was very frustrating. I read a lot of reviews of this and similar products and I finally decided to give it a try and I LOVE IT. It has played everything I have put in it. Star Wars ep1&2 have never played so beautifully, my dvd-r's made on my imac play flawlessly with no skipping or garbled sections (I have used expensive 4x Apple dvd-r's and Compusa's 1x cheapies and they both played great), jpeg cd's work great and you can even put them on slideshow mode to watch your pictures like a movie. I haven't tried any SACD's (I don't own any) but I thought the audio was great on all of the dvd's I tried. The player itself is small and compact and makes almost no noise at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pioneer 578 - not for SACD","review":"I bought one at Best Buy and picked out a number of SACD and DVD-Audio disc to take home and try out the new machine. Well on a few of the disc it was very nice but on some there was a horrible popping on some tracks (not just between them). I went back to the store where they had the machine set up as a demo and I was surprised that it didn't have the same problem. I then realized that they had it playing through 2-channel and had not used the 5.1. When set to 5.1 it had the very same problem. I'll be taking it back and saving some more money for the Denon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver SACD quality playback","review":"I bought this after reading a review that it sounded about as good as a Denon SACD player with 4x the price. However, I find it to be unacceptable as an audiophile SACD player. I did an A/B comparison with my 3 year old Sony DVP-NS500V player (which sadly is not now recognizing the SACD layer on most new Hybrid SACD/CD discs!). The difference is decisive. With the Pioneer you cannot hear the \\"space\\" of the hall which you can hear with the Sony. And sibilants sound hissy and sandy on the Pioneer, while they sound airy on the Sony. In short, it suffers the defects of CD sound. I have read that some SACD universal players convert the DSD signal to 192 KHz PCM streams upon which they do D/A conversion. I suspect this is one of them. There ought to be some regulation requiring the disclosure of such \\"cheats\\". Caveat emptor. Don't buy this as an SACD player because it doesn't deliver SACD quality sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of a Ne I bw Pioneer DVD player.","review":"The product proved easy to hook up.

Quality control for this unit seems abysmal. It crashed nearly each time I tried to use it, and it hung while it was supposed to be calculating the route. I am reasonably confident that with some software tweaking, this will prove to be a pretty good unit, as is it isn't a good unit for someone expecting a GPS that will be ready to roll as soon as they receive it.Given that it was for my wife, I returned it and got her a TomTom One, which is much more plug-and-play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it was working","review":"I bought this in August 2007 and it worked great for a few months. Then suddenly one day, it did not boot up any more. No matter what I did, it was stuck in the \\"Loading...\\" screen. The manufacturer's policy is that any defective unit must be returned to the seller for repair. They did (probably still do) offer customers to swap their defective model with their latest model for $135. I could not find review or customer experience with their latest model and finally decided to go with a Garmin. With prices coming down so much recently, there is no reason to go for an unreliable brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"stuck on the loading screen","review":"well, it worked for just long enough to get past the warranty period, now it is stuck on the loading screen. This is way too common for this model (do a google search) Just stay away from nextar, many reports of failing nextar products on the web.:edit, I just thought I would add that after I spoke to Nextar CS they sent me a newer model as a replacement, even though I was beyond the warranty period. So far the new one has worked fine, so I thought it was worth it to update my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I received this as a gift so I shouldn't be all that upset since I didn't pay for it, but this is a useless piece of garbage.

Amazon said it couldn't replace it with a real new GPS, and since I've purchased several companion items through Ebay, those companion items would be a total loss.

Furthermore, he seems to rely a great deal on a blind \\"classical\\" interpretation of the ideas that these men have, so he doesn't capably manage to give much new information.

While the overview and topic of the book seemed like a good idea I found it significantly lacking. The writer is strongly biased towards one interpretation and the section on Nietzsche's writings contained many egregious errors. Most of the conclusions in the book were almost forced and author's opinion usually stood without any objective merit. I believe there are better books on these fine, talented individuals that you can spend your money on. Please keep in mind that this book was originally writen in the 1950's and this plays into the author's views, being focused highly on WWII and Religion.

That is unacceptable for a children's toy--parents shouldn't have to sandpaper down the edges of a toy down before they give it to their child. Also, the design of the box is not great because, as another reviewer already remarked, the lid doesn't close. It simply sits atop the toy, making the lid and the pieces inside easy to lose.

Although the video, runs only 37 minutes, cameraman & creator Fortney uses amazing techniques including slow-pan & time lapse....images that create a haunting & reminisent effect on the human mind. Just be forewarned that the music is not composed by Patrick O'Hearn (as advertised) but by native American flute players R.Carlos Nakai & John Huling.

The scope isn't functioning properly - it has too narrow a view. I bought the unit based on good reviews from several sources. This item was listed as used and I took a chance. It turns out to be a big waste of time. Nobody wins, so why list a defective piece? It's being returned. I usually get aggravated when I see people review service instead of the product. But I wanted to get this out there. So, I'll give 4 stars just to keep from skewing the overall rating. This complaint is specific to WAREHOUSE DEALS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"This book represents a collection of articles that review approaches and technologies useful in the analysis of global protein expression, or proteomics. An introduction to the relationship between genomics and so-called proteomics is followed by chapters devoted to genetic based methods to study protein expression, reviews of two-dimensional gel electrophroresis, mass spectrometry, image analysis, high throughput / automation and some applications. Despite the title of the book, there is little on protein function, and a major facet of proteomics, that is, quantitation is all but forgotten. Some chapters overly cite the authors own work and ignore others, some errors are also encountered. In Chapter 5 Patterson and co describe post souce decay or PSD as occuring IN the ion source and repeatedly refers to MS measurement of mass not, more correctly, mass-to-charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid book","review":"This book is a great addition to any exercise library. It wouldn't be what I can a stand-alone book, and it doesn't try to be one. The book lists and describes about 3-4 workout plans with everything you would need to follow, including nutrition and supplementation. The workouts are well documented and based on solid science, instead of fad ideas. The writing is personable in explaining technical ideas that would normally be a bit boring. Overall, a great book. As for the guy who complained about the \\"race\\" issue (no people of color photographed in the book), the book only has 2 people photographed in it. One is DR.

I love to eat and if 10% of my daily intake was fat....well that would be an almost impossible feat. You can still get cut with 15-20%. The book was a big help for me as far as training goes. My workouts are shorter than before and just as effective if not better. Lift heavier, take shorter breaks between sets, change your routine often, etc.... I leave the gym crazy pumped (careful, you can get carried away and overtrain in a hurry). I like the author's straight-to-the-point approach and his writing sounds intelligent, too.

The modules can be put together in many creative ways for unusual color effects. But I bought it because the design tips in \\"Domino Knitting\\" by V. Hoxbro are too vague. Ginger Luters is a bit vague too, but she does have graph paper. The only way to design is make a swatch, measure it, make drawings and calculations, and dive in. The sweater is still in progress but is coming along just fine. I'm in my 50's and wouldn't mind wearing any of the women's sweaters in Luters' book, especially \\"De Colores\\".

I have read a lot about collaborative learning in the classroom, but Digenti provides a way for businesses to profit from the same approaches. I found the boundary-spanning skills outlined in the book a useful approach to understanding what it takes to be successful in collaborating for learning.

In comparison to Price of Honor or other more reader friendly texts that in my opinion carry as much critical information about the volatile region, it pales in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid introduction to the region","review":"This book is a very solid introduction to the modern history of the region. Although it covers a much longer span, the first chapter is subtitled \\"from Ancient to Modern\\", the book spends 34 pages on the entire period prior 1800. Rather skimpy. But, it does well given its limited treatment of pre-1800. Another problem is the lack of spirit in the book. One can tell that author is British just by the style.Having said the above, it does a very good job of summarizing the major history since 1800. And, I would recommend it to any seeking an introduction to the Middle East, esp. the modern world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, yet a terrible pain","review":"I like the fact that the unit is so small and light, and using it to listen to MP3s is a breeze. However, I highly recommend against buying this player for these reasons:A) While I was able to get the software running ok under Windows 98, getting the player to communicate under Win XP is seemingly impossible.B) Compaq customer support is useless. I've sent multiple emails regarding my problems with the unit and have gotten no reply from them, period.C) The RioPort software is very weak in features, and is poorly designed. To my knowledge the player only works with RioPort software.D) The MMC memory is expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice player - but lousy software!","review":"If only there were a way to avoid using Rioport to load songs onto the player. I wouldn't have bought it had I known what a pain it was... The smartmedia cards used are also a dead end - there won't be anything bigger and technology has passed them by. There'll be something along the lines of the iPod coming soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy, insubstantial MP3 player","review":"Save your money, and don't purchase this player. Despite what I had heard from others, I did purchase the Ipaq. Just like everybody says, it is darn near impossible to get the player out of the packaging without cutting your hands. I got two cuts, and I was as careful as could be. My first impression was that the player seemed really flimsy and insubstantial. The battery door kept coming open on its own whenever I touched the player. And, the memory door was a disaster waiting to happen. It too was barely hanging on. I was so disappointed that I returned it. Wait for the next model of the Ipaq; maybe they'll correct some of these errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"I bought my first Compaq PA-1 over a year ago and am now waiting my third. The same thing keeps happening... after some use the player will not recognize the usb connection to the computer, thus making it impossible to write new tracks. This is horribly aggravating, but not nearly as bad as the support for this product. As with any tech support, the tech's tend to know less about the product than I do.I would not recommend this procuct unless you want to keep sending it back to the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Player's OK, but Customer Service Sucks!","review":"As long as the units works it's OK. Not the best, but not the worst. However when it stops working (which mine did after about 4 months ownership, and use on 3 round-trip flights and 2 trips to the gym to use the stationary bike) after what I would call, not much use it stops working. Why? the batteries would not stay in place, hence no power to the unit. Considering I had not been using it for jogging etc., I would have expected it to last more than 4 months!! Customer service was not very friendly or responsive to a player dying after such little use. I had to pay for shipping and insurance for them to repair the unit. So keep this mind when you think of buying this unit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to work with. Poorly supported.","review":"I have found this device to be very difficult to work with. It has successfully connected to my PC--via the USB port--exactly once. I have since tried to connect to another PC on my network with even less luck.I have attempted to remedy the problem via the Compaq support site and the Rioport site. Next time I plan on asking my grandmother for assistance as this will be less time consuming and will have identical results. For the kids in the back of the room, that means no results.I've gone from the Sony to the Compaq in my attempt to find a fully functioning .mp3 device that works simply and cleanly. So far both have been pretty bad but at least the Sony worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product","review":"I had a compaq iPAQ PA-1 64 mb player, but it was hard to opperate.

I researched many players before I decided on this one. I actually bought a Rio 600 first but returned it because it didn't hold much music. The Compaq holds over 100 minutes in .wma format on the two 32mb cards. The download speed isn't really that slow - it's a lot faster than burning a CD - only takes a few minutes. I also don't have the same problem with batteries as the other reviewers - I use the Duracell Ultra from a warehouse club and get about 10 hours on each set of 2. The size is great - we took it to Europe this summer and used it while traveling for 5 weeks - the player is small, lightweight and has great sound. Now I use it daily at work. I did replace the headphones... The only thing missing is a radio tuner. Overall this is a great player. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"good player depending on price","review":"The pa-1 is a good, small, dependable player...depending on how much you pay for it. I bought mine for under $200, so I am satisfied with what I got. the player does have some negative aspects, such as a flimsy memory door, ineffiecient software, and lacks in a variety of functions. But, if you like a player that plays and gets the job done, get the pa-1. It has serveral preset equilizers, and also one that you can set manually. I personally think that the sound is great and the volume level is more than sufficient (I usually leave mine on 5 out of 10 or less). The size and weight of the unit are a definite plus. Battery life isn't that much of a problem if you just get a couple of rechargeable NiMH batteries. Overall, it's a good player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I've read a lot of other reviews, and frankly, they are long and redundant. Simply put, the iPAQ is probably the greatest bargain out there in terms of MP3 players. It's size speaks for itself, it has good memory capability, nice interface and good battery life. It's probably the easiest player to use and the quality is amazing. My one complaint is the software, the RioPort software isn't wonderful but it's easy to use and so far has not given much trouble. I would definitely recommend this MP3 player to anyone looking for ease of use, quality, and convenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"They tried...","review":"Honestly guys, I'm a big pc, compaq, bill gates guy. I really like them. But I must admit that this attempt at mp3 players crashed and burned. This is an older model. DO NOT GET IT. Mine came with ZERO internal harddrive. Get one that COMES with something. Like a rio chiba like I now have. I might pay 40 bucks for this. I received this as a gift and kinda liked it. I could only get 20 songs on it with my 64 megs of space. I would only recommend this, more like give it another star, if you had a couple of 128 or 256 meg mmc's lying around that you're dying to sell.

The sound is good, the memory is as good as most comparable players and the features are well designed. However, the software, RioPort Audio Manager, is worse than worthless: it may be impossible for you to install and will almost certainly cause you headaches. In addition, Compaq has designed their web site in such a way as to almost make it impossible to contact them for support for this product. Think twice before buying the PA-1."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best there is","review":"Well if you could get this mp3 player for FREE then maybe you should go for it, otherwise steer clear! The cost to keep up with the batteries has cost almost as much to buy the whole player! And the software it comes with is *horrible*--it takes forever to download songs to the the player, and its virtually impossible to delete a song once you've put it on there. (And don't even bother with the Compaq customer service..they're no help) Also, many times, it will only record the first 20 seconds of a few songs.(And then if you want to go back and delete that songs..well like i said--IMPOSSIBLE)One more thing. It doesn't even have a stop button on it...so no wonder it drains the batteries. Most of the CD's I make have about 20 songs on them, but this will only let you have about 13 songs max (thats including those few 20 second songs it sometimes records.)

A couple of bad things though. 1) The battery life is pretty small, as mentioned in the other reviews, especially when downloading. 2) The packing it comes in is a terror to open, I got pretty scratched up. Otherwise, it's great! No sound skipping, no same ol' CDs, and you can download MP3 files, or convert your existing CDs to MP3 files, which basically combines your whole collection to be at your disposal when you want to put it on your iPaq.

I am not very proficient on the computer but it wasn't hard to install and run the software. Besides the fact that it came in a really hard to open plastic package, the complaints I have are: 1)There is no cover for the usb port. 2)It really eats up batteries! Be ready with a few on hand-especially if you plan on listening to it after d/l music to it. 3)The MMC's are way too expensive. The good thing is that it's small and light. I pretty much take it on the train and can even get away with playing it during class and work. And even though it's just 64 mb, it's good enough for me b/c my taste in music keeps changing so I don't really need 128 mb of memory. It'd be nice but not necessary.

That is when I realized it was the machine that was defective, not the CD's. When I called Amazon to get info on making a return, they told me we were outside the window for their return policy, even though it was purchased as a Christmas gift. I am so disappointed. I will never make a purchase through Amazon again. I spent just under $100 on a machine that doesn't work and had to see the disappointment on my daughters face thinking Santa brought her a broken gift.

Or you can set the legs flush for maximum stability it space and the stand's footprint are not problems.I will admit that for lighter duty duties, especially indoors and occasional use, theOn-Stage SM7211 Professional Folding Orchestral Music Stand, Blackis a sufficient alternative. While I do not have the same confidence in the On-Stage stand, it works well for indoors use and situations where it is rarely transported.

I never knew about Michael Shayne mysteries until I saw one on Netflix. And then I was hooked. I went to Amazon and I found this box set. Only draw back is they recorded the DVDs on both sides of the DVD. It plays well but I prefer separate DVDs instead of flipping them over. Quality is pretty good but it is not HD. But shows are a must see for mystery buffs. They are witty and fun. Fun for the whole family. Well worth the money for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pulp Detective Mystery.

I didn't know about the films before stumbling upon the set at a local store. Being a big mystery fan I purchased sight unseen. Well worth the splurge.

Two days after using it for the first time (I was at the gym), the armband undid itself and off my arm and to the floor my Nano ALMOST went (I was able to catch it before the unthinkable happened). It happened twice more since. And what is very annoying as well is that the wheel isn't always responsive through the plastic window.Otherwise, the case itself fits the Nano 2nd generation perfectly and this product came very close to being a good one, except for the minor fact that I almost smashed my brand new toy to the ground because of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Disappointed in product and company-Ace Photo digital.

The \\"claymation\\" type characters were cute, as can be expected from Sanrio, and Badtz Maru building his house was adorable. Unfortunately I was taken aback by the downright rude and crude antics. Booger jokes (including sticking one on a drawing), toilet jokes (including POV from the toilet), a flatulence line-up reminiscent of frat boys, thievery without apologies or remorse, and just general bad behavior with little repentance abound in the ridiculously short episodes. The credits make up for the blink-and-miss-it runtime by rolling for what feels like ages. Sure, the DVD has its place, but I wouldn't recommend it for kids.

He protests too much not to reveal his personal involvement with the Bible. If he truly had so little regard for the Bible, why would he invest so much antagonism for it? He would simply not bother. Perhaps the real burning issue is his own struggle with and search for faith! There is something very sad about his stance and seemingly causual and one sided treatment of the subject matter. His turmoil is obvious to me. Perhaps true research and comprehensive study of deligent modern theologians would give him the peace and humility that would serve him much better. I am also disturbed about his readers that will accept this as truth and not, what seems to me, just one man's struggle for a reasonable faith.

I have had the hardcover version since it came out twenty years ago, and have given softcover copies to my now grown children. It is much better than Julia Child's famous iconic book on French cooking, lavishly illustrated and with a number of American dishes as well.In life there is a right way and a wrong way to do anything. This cookbook shows you the right way to do it in cooking -- everything from carving the turkey to making the basic stocks and sauces. Then it's up to you to embellish, simplify, customize. I simply cannot think of a better way to start cooking than to read how Julia would do it; then you can check for variations on Eipcurious, Marmiton.org etc., but at least you will know how it should be done. It is really difficult to mess up a dish, no matter how complicated, with Julia Child's clear descriptions and color photos.A classic, as I said. Every kitchen should have a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I love this book! There are master recipes in each section, and then additions or changes to the recilpes to change it to make something else. Julia does make everything from scratch, from cream of chicken soup to spaghetti sauce. SO if cooking form scratch isn't your thing, this might not be your best investment.

I chose this one over Mastering the Art of French Cooking, because I have no interest in mastering the art of French cooking. This 500 page over sized paperback book is BEAUTIFUL. And even though I will probably NEVER cook oxtail soup or sauteed scallops of fresh duck foie gras(with hearts of curly endive and cracklings), it was worth every penny, just to have a big and beautiful cookbook by this amazing woman. I have learned to make boeuf bourguignon, much to the delight of my husband and friends with whom I've shared this amazing stew. This recipe is included in The Way to Cook.

Moreover, the book itself is so sturdy, the publisher clearly knew it was a keeper, the kind of book parents pass down to their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Cookery","review":"This is an excellent dvd for a novice cook.

The recipes on the DVDs and in the booklet are numbered to make finding them easy in either medium. What a wonderful product and it cost only $23. It will more than pay us back in meals eaten at home instead of restaurants. I am no longer surprised why Julia Child has an enduring reputation for delicious, do-able cooking.July 20, 2012I continue to reference these DVDs frequently. As with quilting, I find cooking-technique DVDs are worth 1,000 still pictures. This one is among the best in value and continues as a favorite in my how-to DVD library. P.S.

It is easy to see why so many subsequent authors refer to, and liberally 'paraphrase' Wright's work. Almost a hundred years after it was written, it is amazing to realize how much later writers based their work on this book. Wright chronicles his rise from enthusiastic bear hunter to preservationist who regrets his earlier bloodthirst.

To be fair, the first chapter is entitled 'Ghost Stories' - what should I have expected?!

It was a great read, I had trouble putting it down and getting my work done, but it was a different suspense than what I'm use to. The love story of the book was as forefront as the suspense, it wasn't a side line like in some other books.

A lying, prevaricating, domineering, proud, greedy, irreligious prelate that reflects what we know today about Cardinals and Bishops and Popes. Huston hits the mark of our time over and over, but the focus of this film is essentially the church justifying its fascism for God wants it that way for the time being, a fascism that includes the exclusion of all truth, so that scandals abound, but they are part of the crosses the Church must bear as well as create. Lies, truth, sex, power, embezzlement,etc etc are all in the hands of the church to do with as it wills.

But now, after having seen a lot of Otto Preminger movies during the past weeks, I must say that I had a tremendous pleasure watching THE CARDINAL last night. The movie handles, among others, a theme, Fate, one can find in some of the precedent Preminger films likeExodusorBonjour Tristesse. It's interesting to observe how those who dare to stand in the way of the Premingerian hero, like Carol Lynley and Romy Schneider in THE CARDINAL or Deborah Kerr inBonjour Tristesse, must disappear in order to let him fulfill his destiny. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ecclesial Epic...","review":"\\"The Cardinal\\" is an excellent film. It covers the life of a young, intelligent American Priest who goes through various personal and societal challenges and eventually ascends to the Cardinalate. This film is very modern with the issues it addresses (abortion, racism, etc.) and the characters are not one-sided. Tom Tyron plays a very human Priest who struggles at times to be obedient as a Priest yet his fidelity and orthodoxy carry him through, a testament to his character."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD of the movie \\" The Cardinal\\"","review":"I remember seeing the movie \\"The Cardinal\\" in the late 1960s. It became one of my favorites! I hadn't seen it listed on TV, anywhere. By chance, I thought I would see if I could get it on the Internet. Amazon had it!!! I ordered two - one for me and another for a friend. It was a very pleasant experience to be able to watch it again, after ALL these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie, not quite as rich as the book, but close.","review":"Tom Tryon was perfectly cast as Father Stephen Fermoyle, lacking only the blue eyes described in the book. I thought his performance was excellent - great supporting cast, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Little We have Changed","review":"This film is the DeJa Vue of what is currently happening in our country today regarding maintaining Religious Freedom and identifying those who are backsliding from saying they support religious freedom and then turn around and oppose those moral values that religions uphold. View this film along with the film \\"For The Greater Glory\\" and you will see the reslemblence."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting product of its times...","review":"\\"The Cardinal\\" could probably not be made the same way today, but it is killfully crafted by Otto Preminger at the height of his powers. Long but never boring, we're treated to a rare English-language appearance of the tragic Romy Schneider, to whom fate brought such misery and ended a life all too quickly. It does bring the viewer a close-up glimpse of pre-Vatican Council church workings and the adequate script is well-handled by even the minor characters. It deserves to be seen uncut and on a big screen where possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdly Crude Social Critique","review":"While Otto Preminger was capable of making a relatively intelligent film like \\"Advise and Consent\\" when he felt like it, this has to stand as one of the most crudely drawn and transparently manipulative sociopolitical films of all time. Notwithstanding a somewhat interesting performance by a palpably uncomfortable John Huston, this picture is little more than a succession of clich��s so childish that even one sympathetic to its broader aims must feel shame at participating in its hamfisted and immoral moralism. As cinema it is little better than mediocre, and it is so awkward and false in its evocation of actual lived experience that only viewers whose wits have been totally debauched by the vulgar manipulations of modern media will find this anything more than a stultifyingly moronic exercise in mass hypnosis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this movie.","review":"After I read the book by Henry Morton Robinson, I couldnt wait to see the film. What a disappointment! I wonder to this day where Preminger got his ideas for the screenplay,and why he eliminated most of Father Fermoyle's family. Although the acting is good, especially, Tom Tryon ,Burgess Meredith and John Houston, there is just no spark to this film. By using flashbacks, Preminger loses what thread of story that is left.Its too bad that he wasnt even a pinch more faithful to the book,his cast certainly could have handled it. And why oh why were the characters of Gaetano Orselli,Ghislana Falerni, and Roberto Braggioti in particular eliminated. Did Preminger reallythink that the character of Anne-Marie would help the plot?? Sorry Otto, that in itself is enough for a big thumbs down. Add it all up and you still get a big waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Information a bit out of date","review":"This book gives the information it claims to - the only problem is, a good portion of it is out of date.

The posters cover a range of Picasso's work through the years 1901 - 1957. There is a brief, yet interesting description of each poster written in English, French, and German. An informative written chronology of Picasso's life is also included in the packet.I wish I could have seen the images on the computer screen before I had purchased the packet, or at least known the contents. The posters included are as follows: Child Holding a Dove, 1901; Family of Saltimbanques, 1905; Portrait of Marie-Therese Walter, 1937; The Pigeons, 1957; Women Running on the Beach, 1922; Guernica, 1937.I rated these posters \\"4-Stars\\" because I use them for teaching art to elementary school children and there is one poster that I cannot show, due to nudity.

I found it especially helpful as I am writing a thesis on \\"third wave\\" feminist art. Her essays are thoughtful and insightful without being full of jargon, so even those with no background in feminist theory can get the gist of the writing. Its great to be able to read the oldies and see how much has- and sadly, hasn't- changed. Most interesting are Lippard's updates and introductions to the older essays, in which she prefaces them with how her thoughts on the topics have changed or shifted since the essays were written.This is a really thorough and broad reaching book on art and feminism.I highly suggest it for all feminist artists (especially younger ones who missed the first wave) and those who study feminism and/or art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Crap","review":"I had had pretty low expectations for the \\"performance\\" for a cheap tool like this but I was blown away by how poorly made this thing is.

The wooden knob is defectively drilled off-center, and it will not turn freely on the swaged pin. The pin and knob bind, so free rotation is not possible.

People who don't like spanking have either never been disciplined or have been subject to the abusive side of discipline.Also, if you don't have children you can't accurately give an opinion.When looking at a group of children you can see who is well disciplined and who isn't by their relationship with their peers.

Maybe this book is for those who aren't as familiar w/ striped bass fishing, but every time a story began to unfold, the writer just moved on. Even the most avid fisherman enjoys reading insightful, exciting, and educational fishing reports in the local paper, so I thought the bar was pretty low.

I also hate when there is an evil MIL. Ever notice it's always the evil MIL or the conniving secretary? The plot is just too canned for this book to be enjoyable. When books follow this recipe, it almost seems like the author is spoofing romance books.Another aspect I hate is when the husband sees other women while the couple is separated and the wife stays faithful. Just once I wished it was the other way around or at least have the husband also stay loyal during the separation too.I have no idea why I finished reading this book.

This story is sadly SO formulatic, just like so many other Presents and I think it's a waste of time. I have to say, I hate a romance where just one good conversation between the two main characters would clear up their issues with each other, and they don't have that conversation for any number of silly reasons. THE GREEK'S MILLIONARE MARRIAGE is that kind of romance novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starting point for low-carb cooking!","review":"I was recently put on a low-carb diet for insulin resistance.

Came to the conclusion I just don't like splenda. Can't even get used to it in my coffee. I'll take sugar (still try and keep things low fat) and concentrate on portion control. I realize that some folks can't have sugar, and I suppose these desserts are better than nothing. But I was very unimpressed with the tastes of the various things I tried (pmpkin pie and chocolate cake; to name two)."},{"rating":"1","title":"sugar-free cooking","review":"Almost all recipes require a special trip to store for ingredients.

Just flipping through this volume, any bibliophile or lover of literature will experience the thrill of getting into the mind of a great writer, and through that nineteenth-century mind, appreciating a unique understanding of the mind of another, earlier luminary of the literary and political world.

The razor-sharp, searing unison lines on the title track are breathtaking. Jackie's starts his solo in high gear while Lee's final notes still linger in the air. Jackie was a cutting-edge improviser by the standards of those times, but he fits hand-in-glove with Lee's hard-bop style. Pianist Larry Willis worked in Jackie's band and was ready for the challenge of playing with Lee. His selection of minor chords is stunning throughout. Billy Higgins pushes and pulls the rhythm in his trademark decisive way. Blue Note first issued this session on LP in 1980, 15 years after its recording; it's great to find it on CD. Lee recorded many outstanding sessions. Despite its late release and low profile, this session takes a back seat to none in his discography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lee Morgan In Top Form Here","review":"Lee Morgan is in top form here displaying his trademark soulful sound and harmonically intriguing lines. Check out his full, round, fat (phat, too!) sound on the opening tune -- he stays very much in the lower/middle register and just plain swings. Jackie McLean is a perfect compliment to Lee and the rhythm section including the great Billie Higgins is cookin' up a storm.

Modern, progressive, and passionate, there is a unique lyricism to the original compositions found on this disc that sets it apart from other Blue Note recordings of this period. From the infectious, undulating pulse of Stanley Cowell's \\"Dave's Chant\\" to the melodic see-saw wail of Harold Land's \\"Poor People's March\\", there's plenty of rhythmic variety, harmonic subtlety, melodic complexity, and dynamic intensity to satisfy even the most jaded listener. Comprising two rare \\"forgotten\\" Blue Note re-issues, \\"Medina\\" and \\"Spiral\\", it's two great albums for the price of one, along with some of the best soloing I've heard from Bobby Hutcherson and Harold Land.

I mean, Aniston's character gets set up with a real jerk by one of her best friends (who knows this guy talks disrespectfully about women). Aniston, meanwhile, does a good job of playing a depressed, too-nice to people character who gets taken advantage of.Catherine Keener's marriage seems troubled because she is overly concerned with other people's feelings and her husband seems blase about them, including those of his wife's.It's sort of an okay character driven movie in terms of the acting, but the ending is not pieced together in a gratifying way...it sort of just leaves you there hanging with nothing concluded."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","review":"THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE!

Catherine Keener is amazing as always, but I was most shocked by Aniston who I have never thought had much range. She finally plays a part realistically, you actually believe she is the sad, lonely lost character she portrays. The dialog and chemistry between all of the characters in every scene is great. In my opinion it is one of the best ensemble casts ever brought together in the 2000s. I am surprised at how many bad reviews it has gotten, especially with the rave reviews it received when it was released. I just watched it for the 8th or 9th time last night and thought I would add my 2 cents. If you, like me, enjoy movies based on character development and good acting, then you will LOVE this movie. If you need car chases, immature humor or for everyone in a movie to be fake happy, then maybe you won't enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quiet Pleasure","review":"Some movies I go to see on the big screen with all it's bells' and whistles. Others I like to savor in my house, sitting on the couch and just reflecting on the story. I found this DVD to be one that I'll buy because I'll keep watching it again and again. I didn't find the story boring at all--it's not a huge thriller or mystery but more a \\"slice of life\\" of four friends. The husband everyone thinks that is gay and his frustrated wife, who doesn't wash her hair in quiet protest. The maid that squeezes out the last of her L'ancome eye cream and puts the high end stuff on her feet in defiance. I realize this movie won't appeal to everyone. It's actually more like reading a book and doing little character studies. I loved every actor in the movie; Joan Cusak was as great as always and Jennifer Aniston held her own. If you like quiet little movies, give this a go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who needs \\"Friends\\" like these?","review":"I'm a huge fan of Catherine Keener, and had high hopes for this film. I disagree with the New Yorker review posted here -- although they are correct when they say Jennifer Aniston is a limited actress, I think she shines by far the brightest in this uneven, annoying \\"indie\\" flick. The characters in this movie are so maniacally irritating and unlikeable, I may have to reconsider my usual preference for \\"character-driven\\" films and move grudgingly toward viewing movies with explosions and car chases. The script is uneven and unbelievable, featuring people unlike any I have ever met -- and to which I certainly cannot relate. It takes a few cliche rich, whiny Los Angeleans and tries to make us feel sorry for them when, in truth, they are much easier to despise. How can anybody care enough about these characters to make this movie worth the emotional investment? Not possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"All I can say is that I really enjoyed this movie. It was just a good movie with depth. Nothing more.

From the Good Girl, through The Breakup, to Rumor has it - every good concept turns into unwatchable mush once she enters the screen. i don't think she's neccessarily a terrible actress, but somehow she just manages to choose material she seems completely unable to connect with.

I feel like to get the point across, the 4 principal's performances could have been slightly more vacant and detached. Shopgirl-esque, n'est pas?

Sadly, watching the popcorn pop was more interesting than the movie. If you went to sleep after the first 10 minutes, you would't miss much since nothing really happens. If it's a comedy, it isn't funny. If it's a slice of life, the lives are deadly dull. The emotional level is so low-key you suspect the entire group is on valium. Jenifer Aniston especially, seems to have phoned this one in.Real characters? As it happens, I've known thousands of real people over the years and not a one bears the slightest resemblance to any of these sad-sack characters.

If Woody Allen were dead he would roll over in his grave. This movie is an obvious attempt at his style and brand of motion picture.. However, even Allen's worse film is better than this!

This film, while not exactly indicative of the east coast world I live in, still has many truths. These people may not be people I know but the situations, the subtleties, the feel of the film is all honest.The film says all the things that we all do and say and sense in others. Sometimes the conversations I find myself or often times others around me embroiled in as an adult just stuns me. Furniture, film tastes, kids, money, paving my driveway. It's funny. It can also be a bit sad. This film captures this dynamic so well. While no masterpiece it is still a simple gem.It was also nice to see a film about women for a change. As a guy I can say it was refreshing. Seems women go through the same stuff guys do after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying slice-of-life about 40 somethings","review":"\\"Friends with Money\\" is a slice-of-life drama about a group of female friends who no longer have much in common but nevertheless are tied together by their long-standing friendship.Many plot threads are begun but few are resolved so the film leaves you feeling somewhat up-in-the-air - it almost feels like a pilot to a TV series.

(I work in ER's and an Urgent Care Clinic)Interwoven through this overriding theme of despair, the values and morals showcased in this movie are typically Hollywood these days--that is to say, abysmal to non-existent.What a waste of some otherwise great talent.

I find these sections of the book less valuable as the examples of how to calculate EVA are extremely simplified. In practice, it is much more difficult to calculate EVA and I find the traditional DCF approach much easier to deal with.Overall, the well written and communicated sections on the creation of shareholder value more than compensates for the weak treatment of calculating EVA.

Sometimes you can but most times you cannot.The stickyness varies over the length of the tape, part might stick well and part will not. I am having a lot better overall performance from Frog brand tapes than any of the 3M tapes I have been using recently.

True, it's not as bad as some of these latter day ain'ts but I think she would have fared much, much better if she had covered some of her OWN hits and arranged them to suit the times.

The special effects were cheap. The acting was a step up from most cheap horror films, but was severely hampered by the script. The killings were for the most part not shown, only the bodies. The film never developed, nor did the characters. It was done done in a hurried fashion.

This cowardly man has been appointed as commander, replacing reluctant Galba, an experienced soldier. Galba becomes attracted to Marcus' young wife and decides to win her for himself.On the other side of Hadrian's wall, a man named Arden will fall for adventure-challenged Valeria, who is kidnapped and torn between her affiliations on either side of the wall when she falls in love with Arden. Cultures collide.This historical novel reads more like a complicated romance than the story the cover of the book implies. If this isn't a deterrent, this book makes for a good read involving greed, passion and war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hadrian's Wall","review":"I enjoyed the opening and I really liked the battle with the blue-painted barbarians.

I want to assume that for certain songs they only had a the shortened version?Knowing the technical deficiencies, the material contained on hear is pure gold and classic C Rayz. Easily better than Year of the Beast - and the beats are banging. C Rayz drops some gems \\"we both bleed firetruck paint!\\"At the price on amazon it is definitely worth a purchase.

Many of Mr Wafford's biographies have incorrect or incomplete family data, or the families of similarly named soldiers were intermingled. A simple review of census records might have straightened out some of the misinformation.Although much of the biographical information is suspect, the book is helpful as a research tool. Rather than going to each regiment and company roster to compile a list of Davidson County Civil War soldiers, they are already listed. Individual data can then be cross referenced with Civil War records, censuses, marriage records, cemetery surveys, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Research issues","review":"I commend Mr. Watford for his effort, but he seems to have gotten mixed up on his facts. My ancestor too, is misrepresented. Watford records him as having never married (something his numerous descendants find either vexing or humorous) and attending a college he did not attend. I think that data got garbled in his notes, and that the bio he gives probably connects to someone else.

It is a series of essays with no real tangible advice or meat to work with. When you read the book you are just seeing exerpts and platitudes not an in depth analysis of writing mysteries. Though many of the essays are beautifully written, it feels like you are reading the same thing you read in all other writing books. Kill that demon, called the internet, set down time or word length, make your characters multideminsion, do not be scared of said and asked.

This is easily one of the best indie pop CDs of 1999. You can pick out the influences, lots of 80's new wave pop like OMD and the lightning seeds and yet the album sounds so fresh and original. Don't let the new wave tag fool you. Its not an electronic album. There are lots of guitars and nice boy/girl vocals. Great melodies and songs that will be stuck in your head.

More like novel, a bad one where characters are thin, events are hackneyed, and idiom is cliched. Intent is to portray to Americans the courage & character of Brits & their fighter pilots during the Battle of Britain, through a compendium of tales fictionalized for retelling. Interesting for its 1941 idiom and occasional oblique mention of new weaponry, such as radar and proximity fuses. Amusing, too, for moral values that produced shame then, but seem laughable today. But taken whole, a wide-eyed account of life on an air base from the point of view of a socially, politically and militarily correct scion of Britannia. Not a novel of war like \\"The Cruel Sea\\" or journalism like Casey's \\"And I was There,\\" but readable. Nothing more than an an adult version of \\"Dave Dawson in the R.A.F,\\" except that Ayling feels obliged to kill off his hero in the last paragraph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake Dr., Bad Book.","review":"This guy is not a Doctor of ANYTHING!

With a raw sound that is reminiscent of Motorhead, \\"Blessed Black Wings\\" features some pummeling songs that will make any long time hard rock and metal fan put the devil ears in the air with pride. Opening track \\"Devilution\\" is a prime example of this, while \\"The Face of Oblivion\\" and the title track are standouts as well. The closing \\"Sons of Thunder\\" is hypnotic in it's delivery, and is a great stoner-esque cut that is the album's highlight. The only problem with \\"Blessed Black Wings\\" is that it will leave you wanting more, which isn't such a bad thing. All in all, \\"Blessed Black Wings\\" finds High on Fire improving on their previous releases (\\"Art of Self Defense\\" and \\"Surrounded by Thieves\\", which are great as well), and this album is a perfect starting point for new fans to the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"High on Fire, indeed","review":"This band is on top of there game!

It is a especially useful reference for divers because of the great underwater photography depicting the animals as one would while diving. This guide also has information on the taxonomy, popular and scientific names, size and depth, as well as visual id tips, abundance and distribution, habitat and behavior, reaction to divers, and additional information of interest. In some cases, there is information on effect on divers if the species is known to cause a negative effect or potentially dangerous.

How could they leave out the likes of such annecdotes as \\"MFI pickup point\\" and the attempts to exchange empty bottles of wine for a Franc a bottle during leave in France. What took the biscuit were the vain attempts to feature Schoon in the book to appease readers like me. The mention of a man wearing a Santa Pod raceway jacket being part of the RAF Mechanic squadron in the Gulf was encouraging but was hardly expanded on.

Character developement is fair, but plot and background science are just plain hideous. This novel is full of fancy French words, point is, who cares, and it is so excessive it detracts from the story line. The writing style makes reading a chore through much of the book, very vague at times and jumps back and forth a lot with the reader struggling to figure things out.Explicit sex is graphically portrayed two or three times, and to no point whatsoever.

For positive proof of this, the viewer should observe the alternate endings and deleted scenes with director Gavin Hood's commentary ON. He explains the choices made and what ultimately led to them in such a way that I am eager to seek out more of his work. I think this is the first time that I can say with no hesitation that the director actually made ALL of the right decisions for ALL of the right reasons, rather than being blindsided by his own ego.The non-professional actors are top-notch as well, and their inexperience lends authenticity to their roles. \\"Tsotsi\\" is not a suitable vehicle for a high-profile prima donna actor.I mention these things rather than the plot itself, which one can read about in other reviews.

There is hope for the alcoholic and that comes shinning through in Mr. Erdmann's book. The machinery has to stop somewhere in the family of the alcoholic. It seems to be a genetic, inherited disease that needs early intervention. People do not have to go through the hell Jack did if they will heed the warning signs. Friends and family have a mandatory responsibility to intervene when the signals of alcohol or addiction are waving frantically in their faces. A great book!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!","review":"This is an extremely well written account of the effect drinking has on families. From the tyranny of his drunken father to his own acts of mindless, unheeding drunkeness as an adult, Erdmann paints a vivid picture of what it's like to drink too much, too often, and not seem to be able to stop even though it's destroying everything in your life.

But Dreaming In Smoke had me drowning in math, strange arguements, and a world that would have been better served if the author (luv ya, Trish, really!) would have spent less time on the mechanics of the colonist's existance and more on the mechanics of their emotions. The biggest problem with the book is that I really didn't feel like Azamat Marcsson was much of a threat or why the book spent so much time revolving around his experiments. Not to admit a cheesy past addiction to Nintendo or anything, but dern, I wanted to know more about what life was like for Ganesh during this crisis, it's almost as if the sky was falling, but nobody bothered to spend enough time talking about how and why.

The writing was awkward and full of unnecessary exposition and \\"telling\\". The characters' behavior seemed nonsensical, unconnected to what was happening around them--often their reactions seemed weirdly casual, and at other times just inappropriate and lacking perceptible motivation. I couldn't relate to them, and because of that it became hard to focus on the convoluted plot.I like the author's Someone to Watch Over Me, but I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! Might have been a good novella","review":"Talk about overblown hype. Passages of this book just drone on and on without going anywhere or contributing to the plot. The writing ain't all that \\"lyrical\\" or literary either. I read one other review here who said the reader was \\"drowning in math\\" -- what a crock! this is no hard sci-fi, this is no cyberpunk \\"redefined\\". I will grant that there are some interesting concepts such as the sociological makeup of the colonists and the biology of the native fauna of T'Nane. It might have been a good short story or maybe a novella, but Tricia Sullivan has stretched her ideas too thinly over a book filled with fluff and lacking much in the way of a compelling plot or characters.

Not deciding if the book should aim more mature readers (as Keith Giffen did) or infants (as Tom McCraw and Tom Peyer did), this story put an end to the first LSH saga. After this one, the book was started from scratch and any one over 13 should skip what the Legion has become.

I would have thought that the Oxford University would have taken more care in making a dictionary. And I feel sorry for anyone that bought it (including myself).As a beginner in Irish I have a few grievances. First and most important, there are no plural forms. Anyone learning Irish seriously will learn that Irish plural forms are not very predictable, thus they need to be learned with the singular form of nouns. This dictionary only lists the singular form for most nouns!Secondly, and not as serious, it doesn't have any phonetic pronunciation for the individual words. Now the phonetic pronunciation is a mixed blessing anyway, but it does help. I say mixed blessing because the pronunciation represented may not be the pronunciation used it the area. There is no single standard pronunciation for Irish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oxford Irish Dictionary","review":"Yes very helpfull!

There is a pronunciation guide on pages v-ix, but it's useless when you are looking up something on page 427. The editorial review above which said there was a pronunciation guide for each entry must have been reviewing a different book. I was completely disappointed and annoyed by this book.

Even the cartoon Scrooge McDuck version was better than this.The presentation of Scrooge was dismal beyond any sense of proportion. The extended chin and nose were so blatently overdone, it was embarrassing. And the development of these features, from childhood to young adult to middle age, was over the top outrageous.Bob Cratchit and the Ghost of Christmas Past were poorly conceived and presented. The race with the hearse was way to long and is no where within the original story.Were there any redeeming features? Well yes a couple. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come was well conceived. Furthermore, the overhead travels across London were well done.Nonetheless, this version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" isn't worth the time nor money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I just finished watching this for the first time and I was rather dissapointed in it.

The characters are cartoonish, poorly created and for CGI creations do not have much humanlike action. If I had previewed this DVD, I would NOT have purchased it.

First, there are scenes in this movie I wish my 10 year old hadn't seen. (Watching the \\"Ghost of Christmas Present\\" turn to ash and bones isn't a delightful Christmas experience, for example.) Second, Jim Carrey . . . he is typically awesome. Apparently, they didn't let him make the part his own. Scrooge stunk in the movie. Finally, the animation falls FAR short of what one normally expects from Disney. My opinion: save your money . . . I, and my son, absolutely hated this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather poor","review":"The animation and character design were a mixed bag at best, and seem to be a step back from BEOWULF, Zemekis' last Mo-Cap feature.

The animation is interesting, but off putting, and although I have never been a Jim Carey fan, this is not his best or worst effort. All in all the movie is creepy, that is the best word I can use to describe it, it made me uncomfortable.

In the case of \\"A Christmas Carol\\", the effects are quite moving. Londontown never looked so forbiding in the dark, nor so cheerful on Christmas morning. The ghosts look as scary as they were meant to be; after all, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is about motivating a stubborn old miser into better behavior. The movie effectively captures all the essential elements of the story, including the presentations by the ghosts of past, present, and future. If some scenes are a bit over the top, such as the exotic dancing at Old Fezziwig's, or Ebenezer's flying sequences, it's a bit of relief after Scrooge's unhappy confrontations with the ghosts. Jiim Carrey does a terrific job behind the animation as Scrooge. Highly recommended, as long as you like this particular style of animation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney's a Christmas Carol","review":"I didnt really care for the animation syle in this movie.

With all due respect to the other reviewers who thought this was faithful to the original story, what Christmas Carol did you read?! I don't recall Ebenezer surfing a rooftop on an icicle or rocketing into the stratosphere after snuffing out Christmas past in the Dickens classic.This is a prime example of a movie made solely to showcase 3D. Zemeckis has proven with Polar Express that he can make a great movie where the special effects are embellishments to a good story line. Not here. Lest you forget, nearly every scene is designed around showing off just how cool 3D can be, whether it's Marley spitting or an insect sized Scrooge rocketing down a drain pipe (I'm sorry, what page is that on in the book?)If you want a 3D thrill-ride, where Tiny Tim takes a backseat to the special effects, you'll love this.

I realize the regular BluRay 3D like that used in Polar Express is kind of crummy, at least we are able to watch it in 3D. To watch \\"A Christmas Carol\\" in 3D you have to buy a new 3D BluRay machine plus a new screen. That is unbelievable in these hard economic times to expect people to go out and buy new expensive hardware for the few movies that will be available in the theater version 3D. Then I don't like the fact the shuttered 3D glasses have to be hooked up by wires to the 3D player. If the also offered a regular 3D version in the set then I would go a head and buy it hoping that in the future I might come into some money to watch the theater version 3D.

We felt no Christmas Spirit in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the Muppet's Christmas Carol instead....","review":"I was excited to watch this on DVD and was thinking about buying it. Glad I waited to watch it first. Honestly, they made Scrooge so grotesque, I had trouble even wanting to look at his face. Not a good way to start off a movie. And it was very morbid, very vivid and went over the top on anything that could be the least bit scary. This is a horror movie. It's great if you like that kind of thing, but I much prefer to have a little bit of Christmas cheer mixed into A Christmas Carol. Yes, the storyline does have ghosts and scary parts in all versions, but this would definitely terrify children. After about 25 minutes in, my husband begged me to please turn it off and we put on one of my favorites, The Muppet's Christmas Carol which is just brilliant, heart warming, funny, pleasant to watch and has great music as well. I recommend that one over this any day. I can't imagine even wanting to see the entire thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of time","review":"I don't do many reviews but this movie was so bad that I had to. So many unnecessary and stupid variations from the original story. Dark would be OK but most of the dark parts were just plain stupid. Marley's mouth dropping open, Scrooge chased by red eyed horses, sliding on a chunk of ice and shrunk to miniature size? What? Just awful. This was a chance for Disney and the director to use the technology to enhance the story but it misses on so many levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not enjoy this much at all","review":"Like other reviewers of this movie I was expecting something special from Disney with an old classic. While the animation graphics are very detailed and impressive, the movie is not interesting or entertaining. I have other previous representations of A Christmas Carol that I have enjoyed watching over and over. I can see no reason to put myself through another viewing of this one. Also, I strongly recommend not showing this to younger children (older children will be totally disinterested). I feel it very inappropriate for young children which is surprising considering it is a Disney product."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for small children...","review":"We rented \\"Disney's A Christmas Carol\\" with plans for a family movie night but soon realized it was way too creepy and scary for our kids to watch. They didn't even argue about having to leave the room since they had lost interest in watching it from what they had seen in the very beginning. The ghosts were extra creepy and Scrooge was more unlikeable than ever with no redeeming qualities at all. The voices were so over-done and heavily accented that the dialogue was difficult to understand. Very, very disappointed in this movie. I didn't even care how great the animation looked, I just wanted it to end. I'll have my kids watch the Muppet's Christmas Carol instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you Disney","review":"I had high hopes for this movie. I expect when I watch an animated movie from Disney with my children about Christmas I do not need to screen it ahead of time. I was appaled at how scary they made this movie. Did they really need to have Marley's jaw come unhinged and flop around..and his face rearrange. This movie scared the hell out of my 7 and 5 year old children. They said it should be called a Halloween Carol. To me it was just boring. I was so disappointed and ultimately a little angry that I had to spend the night up with my children who had nightmares over it.I would not recommend this to children under 10 at all. From now on I will make sure I either watch it first or clear it with a friend that it is ok. It is a shame I have to do that with a cartoon. I was expected something warm and uplifting, like the Polar Express. This was the opposite of that. I HATED it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely HORRIFIC","review":"We were excited to watch a Christmas movie of a classic story, but this was not at all what we were expecting. It has some very scary and disturbing scenes for kids so let me be quite clear THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE!!! There are much better versions of movies for this great story. This has nothing to do with the quality of the movie, just the content. I really don't like writing bad reviews, but this was sadly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney's A Christmas Carol","review":"This is the worst version I have ever seen!!! The fist two ghosts were silly and totally out of character. And what did the sequence where Scrooge is shrunk add to the story at all? Please don't waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney's A Christmas Carol","review":"Every year I look forward to watching A Christmas Carol and over the years have watched many renditions of Charles Dickson's famous classic but this version is by and far the worst I've ever seen. I eagerly awaited Disney's version and had high expectations since Jim Carey was the voice of Scrooge. As I watched Disney's version I had a hard time staying awake, and my sister who was also watching, or should I say tried to watch, this version fell asleep half way through the movie. I found it difficult to connect with the characters and found the \\"spirit\\" of A Christmas Carol to be lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprising","review":"I saw this movie in the theaters on Christmas day when it first came out. I love the story of the Christmas Carol and sometimes when it's redone, it can be really good. This was not one of those times. The movie was not quippy, cute or funny, and I would have expected that, being that it was made by Disney. I realize that certain part of this story are meant to be scary, but some parts were overdone. Overall, I couldn't wait for the movie to be over and I was a bit sad that we picked that one to watch on Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney's A Christmas Carol w/Jim Carey","review":"I am not a fan of Jim Carey, but I love the story, A Christmas Carol. My family also likes the Pixel movies, however, this movie is a real disappointment. Parts of it are o.k. but some parts are dark and eerie. I know the ghosts are supposed to put fear in Ebeneezer's heart, but this was somewhat overkill. Jim Carey is still recognizable in spite of his portrayal of Scrooge, but I could overlook that had the movie been any good. Love Disney, but this one fell a little short, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC ANIMATION","review":"Such a great remake of a classic. The animation so great.

I was very pleased that most of the dialogue as well as the rest of the movie was identical to the book with some creative liscense taken in the final scene where Scrooge meets his final spirit. All in all, very well done without being over the top Jim Carey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Because this is computer generated graphic there is a lot move of following closer to the book.

If you didn't see it in the theater thinking you'd save money and buy it for this holiday season, I have to say I don't recommend it. If you want a fun family version of this, I recommend going instead with Mickey's Christmas Carol or The Muppet Christmas Carol!I saw this in the theater with my kids and spent the whole movie helping my son cover his ears in anticipation of the next loud surprise. When the ghost of Christmas present screams and writhes while he rapidly ages and turns to dust was a low point; it required some convincing that staying for the end would be worth our while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney's Christmas Carol","review":"When I purchased the above item, I thought I was buying a new product, however, the product has problems and I assume it is used.

It must have been hard on Carrey to take that huge check when he had to endure such a horrible film. The sound was mediocre, the animation average, but the scenes were uninspired and flat. I have never been so bored as I was watching thisd movie. I tried to stay focused on some endearing or positive quality. I even felt pity for Tiny Tim's character, all but forgotten in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is #2 to the Alastair Sims version!","review":"Wow, that's about all I can say- I bought this online from Target on black Friday for $8.99 and this by far is the best bluray purchase I've made yet.

I Highly recommend this!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Blu-ray Quality","review":"I saw this movie in 3D last year and really enjoyed it. So, I was really glad to see it finally on Blu-ray! I have watched it twice since I bought it yesterday. The Blu-ray quality is excellent. If you love Christmas movies then you need to see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST-SEE IN 3-D!","review":"You all know the story, so I'll just skip to what's great about this version. \\"The Polar Express\\" has become a Christmas classic to me so I really enjoyed Robert Zemeckis' \\"Christmas Carol.\\" To me, it was simply magical. I've always enjoyed the Victorian London films such as \\"Gaslight\\" or \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" with the fog, snow, & gaslit streets. This is really as if you're experiencing the story yourself with Scrooge. You're transported into the story & to me, that's what makes this film special. It's the best 3-D movie ever! This is a must-see in 3-D this holiday season. Merry Christmas early! Da' Wolf"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I saw this movie at the IMAX in 3D and was completely blown away with the special effects and 3D experience. I watch a lot of 3D at the theaters and found this to be one of the BEST ones that I have seen. I am on pins and needles to get my copy of this for my 3D TV in November! The 3D ghost experience was electrifying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Rendition","review":"I have watched and collected \\"The Christmas Carol\\" with Albert Finney, George C. Scott and Patrick Stewart. This version is awful. The dialogue is hard to follow, and it leaves out much of the IMPORTANT dialogue that have made the previous versions as good as they are. I would NOT recommend anyone to buy this version. The CGI is great but whoever wrote the screenplay left too much out, and relied on the viewers knowledge from other versions. Do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"great animation, but I fell asleep.","review":"while the animation was superb, I still fell asleep- which rarely ever happens in movies.i guess part of it was TOO over-the-top... perhaps TOO 3D heavy-handed...the story isn't new- through, it is signature...I'm sticking with the Muppets Christmas Carol..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was excited to see this movie but.......","review":"The animation is great...however for younger children this movie is hard to understand. Some parts of the story were quite scary and I don't know why they had to go so far as to have the ghost of Jacob Marley's jaw break apart and what's with the ghost of Christmas present and those scary looking horses? I was hoping for a Christmas movie that we would want to watch over and over again, unfortunately we watched it once and now it's collecting dust. Again this is totally my opinion, someone else might love this movie. My 3 (out of 5) children watched it, their ages are 10, 5 and 4. My ten year old son had a lot of questions, things didn't make sense like the scene with the 2 nasty looking children that hang around the feet of one of the ghosts. So just be prepared, I was even scratching my head thinking, \\"what..\\" Hope this review helps you, have a Merry Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Memories","review":"This is a great CHRISTMAS addition to a video library.The special features are great.My only negative about it is how long it takes to load and access the special features on the blue ray disc.This particular movie is special to me as it was the last movie I saw with my Dad before his passing away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Format BS!","review":"Are they deliberately trying to kill 3D? To get a 3D Blu-Ray format of this movie you have to pay for a Blu-Ray format, a Blu-Ray 3D format, and an E-Copy. It is no wonder it costs $31.49. And it seems to be that way across the board on most of the 3D movies worth watching. Just give us the option to purchase what we want, a copy of the movies in Blu-Ray 3D format. Now that the technology is up and running it doesn't cost any more to produce it in 3D than in 2D. Enough of the BS!The 2 Stars rating was because of all the BS. The movie was excellant and on its own would have been given 4 Stars. The sound affects especially were great. The ticking sound made by the sleet impacting the roof tops was right on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor stream","review":"I loved the movie. I may even purchase it for next Christmas. It did not stream well though and eventually cut off all together towards the end. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful animation","review":"This movie was done very well. The animation was wonderful and very life-like. It was perhaps a little too realistic as my 6 y/o ended up covering his eyes at several parts in the story.

But my husband and I enjoyed the remake of this classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"out of the book","review":"Kids will not care for this film but in truth its one of the most accurate portrayels of Dickens work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"A nice take on a classic film. The whole family enjoyed it and highly recommend it. We watched it several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie OK for me, but 2 discs wouldn't play in my DVD player","review":"Unlike others I had seen the reviews before seeing the movie and knew it wasn't oriented toward small kids. I also saw it in the theater (in 3D) so I knew what to expect of the DVD in terms of story and the telling. I also have several versions of A Christmas Carol and don't need then all to be the same with only the actors being different. I enjoy the retelling from the classic to the Magoo to this version.So the reason for the 1 star is for the DVD itself. I have no problems playing DVDs on my Denon DVD-2200, but the first disc I bought would stall and freeze, showing pixels. I returned it and got a replacement. That one was even worse. I've played numerous older and newer DVDs on my player before and after trying to play this DVD. They all played fine this one would not."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIDNT LIKE IT..BUT REALLY WANTED TO!!!","review":"Hey everyone, well I really wanted to like this movie... however it was just to weird... funny at very very few parts....

A CHRISTMAS HORROR MOVIE","review":"\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is my all time favorite story. I have seen every version ever made including most plays. This is an over the top Jim Carey movie. I watched it with my 7yr old grandson and he was so scared he couldn't sleep. All the horror took away from the moral of the story. It makes me very angry that Disney was a part of this. THIS IS A CHRISTMAS HORROR MOVIE not for children. So many good versions out there, get one of them and let Disney know this is UNEXCEPTABLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply AWFUL","review":"I believe this is the worst version of a Christmas Carol I have ever seen. What did the Disney studio think they were doing? It is simply horrible. The rudeness and crassness of the dialogue seems untrue to the original story. They released this as a children's movie, yet they depict the ghost of Christmas present (Santa, of course) ending his life on the planet by decomposing to a horrid shell and then dissolving to dust -- leaving a skeleton in a cloak on the ground. I wish I could return this DVD immediately. There is no way to complain to Disney, but this truly proves that Disney is no longer the company they used to be. I think this picture would cause nightmares for children. Apparently these animators have some secret hatred of Christmas or Santa or perhaps the story of a Christmas Carol itself. I am sorry I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save you money!","review":"Horrible attempt at the classic. I thought this would be good for all the actors in it and it was VERY disappointing.

Skip this one altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zemeckis Makes Another One.","review":"Motion Capture gets slightly better with every film that Zemeckis makes, but why in California's holy name does he keep making them? With Polar Express and this one, they are both stories which strain under his efforts to make them feature length through pointless lengthy action, over-dramatic pauses, and obvious hamming on the CG process.If you don't know what I'm talking about, then observe as you and your friends look at each other saying, \\"why doesn't he just get on with it?\\", and sigh loudly as moments are stretched intolerably. There's a \\"roller-coaster\\" sequence near the end that made me almost walk out on it. On the upside, the performance capture of Scrooge is pretty good, and each frame looks like a painting. So: hats off, Modelers, Lighting Directors, and Rigging Directors! Get out and support those guys, and look for the amazing, magical Geordie Martinez in the rigging and animation credits, and shout \\"HUZZAH!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Scary For Kids","review":"I bought this movie when it first came out The Beginning was Really good Until Jacob Marleys Ghost showed up with his Broken Jaw I was creeped out and I'm an adult The Other Part that was extremely Creepy was the Ghost of Christmas present after he showed scrooge the present he was on the ground laughing and started to decompose into a skeleton laughing what The Heck was Disney thinking?

And the Ghost of Christmas Present with his incessant booming laugh is the most annoying character since Jar Jar Binks. The characters and storyline are two-dimensional, and are only there to justify one heavy-handed dramatic scene after another. If you must see it, rent it for a buck ninety-nine at Red Box and be glad afterward that you didn't pay full price for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I love this story, I have every version of it that you can find, I wish I would have stopped collecting them before this particular movie came out.

All they had to do was copy it, they left out key ingredients to bore us with flying characters & buildings.

One glaring example was when the ghost of christmas past was showing him his past, they left out the death of Scrooge's sister & how he screwed over Mr. Fezziwig (hope I spelled it correctly). All that happened in his past was he was left at school over christmas & his fiance' dumped him. There are better christmas carols out there.

Also, I thought this doll looked more Hispanic in person than Native American, mainly the way the clothing was made and the type of dress the doll had.

I'm sure Bogert and Pattison must have had a few dozen songs, half-songs, partial songs lying around somewhere that they could have brought to life.

Even the VEGETABLE soup has a pound of steak in it. So do the Minestrone and Tomato Soup recipes! Most non-vegetarian recipe books have some recipes for non-meat eaters, but this one really has nothing (except the dessert recipes which manage not to have beef thrown into them). The Busy People's Slow Cooker Cookbook has a MUCH better variety of recipes for meat and non-meat eaters. I recommend that book over this one. If it didn't cost more to return this cookbook than to keep it, I'd return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy - but unimpressive","review":"The beauty of a slow cooker is that you can dump things in it, go out, and come home to dinner! Further simplifying things by using \\"ingredients\\" like condensed soup, pie filling, and cake mix is not only insulting, but unhealthy. Unfortunately, most of the recipes in this book rely heavily on prepared foods (Scalloped Chicken calls for 1 box of scalloped potatoes, 1 can of chicken, and water). The recipes that shine are the ones (such as Cranberry Pork Roast and Almond Chicken) that use basic ingredients instead of prepackaged foods."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Rating as Comedy, Low Rating as Food","review":"A bag of frozen tater tots, can of chicken, can of green beans, can of cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup of cheese all in the same vat plus additional salt? A lot of these recipes call for at least 3 canned foods, some call for an entire bottle of bbq sauce or 24 ounces of cola. A friend gave me this book as a joke when I got my slowcooker. I read the recipes to my husband over real food and we laugh at the idea of eating some of these things.So, yes, if you guessed that I am reviewing this book without trying any of the recipes, you're right. But since I do not regularly eat canned or processed foods and will not put high fructose corn syrup in my family's dinner, there are very few recipes in this book I could even consider.You can dismiss me as a health nut, but if being healthy is wrong, I don't wanna be right.

A lovely, recommended pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We tried five recipes from this cookbook and will try no more. It's terribly disappointing. Only one of the four was tolerable, beef stroganoff, but even it was dry (next to the others, I noted \\"don't make again!\\") The recipes are unoriginal and unimpressive.

My copy will be donated to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well thought out recipes","review":"I recently tried two of the recipes in this cookbook. The first one \\"Italian Chicken with Mushrooms\\". The chicken was dry but the sauce was very tasty. I thought it was strange that she had you cook chicken breasts for 3 hours on HIGH and then another 2 hours on high with the sauce. Way too long. So, I decided to try another one - \\"Pork Chop Casserole\\". I followed the recipe exactly as written and this time the meat was tender and juicy but the rice was a gooey gelatinous mess - gross - gave it to the dogs. Can't figure out how she came up with these recipes. I am not going to make any more of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You might like some of it","review":"I tried two recipes - one good (easy taco soup p.43) and one too horrid to eat (chicken teriyaki p.87). The teriyaki recipe calls for an ENTIRE BOTTLE of teriyaki sauce. The result was disgusting and nasty. Many of the recipes are retarded in their cooking requirements. For example, you need to add soem ingredients in the last hour of cook time in a five hour meal. I did not buy a slow cooker so that I could babysit my food for half a day ... and many recipes have less than an 8-hour cook time, so forget leaving the cooker on and coming home from work to a fresh hot meal.

Becks has long been adored by Man United fans and the book shows us why. Although the beginning started a little slow, the reader can learn a whole lot about the backgrounds that created the man Beckham as we see him now.Beckham's writing style can sometimes move in a direct address to the readers which some readers may find annoying. However, this just adds to an all-too-human portrait of the star himself. In this book, you will find out many things which are completely opposite of the British media depiction. Is this book a spin as a counter to the media? I doubt it. Rather, it peels away the myth surrounding Becks (and even Posh).If you are curious as to why Beckham chose Real Madrid, how he felt after the recent two World Cup exits, what playing inside Old Trafford is like and many other Beckham issues, this is the book to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"I thought this book was awsome.

Team Achilles does a good job rehashing the timeless 'who watches the watchmen?' (topical!) question about keeping superheroes in check - and the morally-ambiguous Wildstorm setting is a perfect place to ask it.Although a bit too super-macho (can anyone in this title do wrong?), and relies a little too much on prior knowledge of the setting, this is solid read. Worth pairing with Ennis'sThe Boys- same subject matter with a dramatically different tone of voice"},{"rating":"2","title":"great political/conspiratorial/action comic","review":"I read this comic because of its premise: a team of ordinary military people whose job it is to bring down out-of-control superhero types. It was a great read. The art, however, was lacking--too many over-muscled, steroid-pumped characters with not-so-well drawn faces. It reminded me of why I hated the Image comics of the 1990s. Because this book was so well written, I was able to plow through the lackluster art.The good thing about volume 2 is that you get an infusion of new artists who give Team Achilles a dramatic improvement in the art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef?","review":"My first bad review for a Cisco Press book. They have to agree that this book should never have been printed with Cisco's name on it.This book lacks information in so many ways. Read the section on CBWFQ and you get 1/3 of what you're looking for. I have to use Cisco's website for the rest. The FRTS section is lacking. These are just 2 examples in a book that is 1/3 the size it should be.Don't buy this book. It's simply not worth the money. No hard feelings toward the author, but I did waste my money and I have to tell others not to.

I found his rich writing style reminiscient of Wallace Stegner. Beautifully written and masterfully conceived, this is an enriching book."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR KINGS AND PLANETS=BRIDESHEAD REVISITED","review":"I was stunned by the close parallels that one could draw from Canin's book \\"For Kings and Planets\\" if one had ever read Evelyn Waugh's Novel, \\" Brideshead Revisited\\". The latter book is the far superior version of this story, as well as the original. I am amazed that Mr. Canin, a usually very talented writer was allowed to plagerize with such a heavy hand. If you do not believe me read both and see for yourself, it is glaringly obvious. It is well written regardless. And , if you have not read Waugh's novel I am sure it would seem very good. But, I suggest if you want a really extraordinary read you should opt for Waugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short story master once again out of his league with novel","review":"A book filled with lovely prose but a superficial story and hollow characters. Ethan Canin is perhaps one of this country's premier short fiction craftsmen but this second attempt at the novel (after BLUE RIVER) falls flat. Canin portrays his characters as all this or all that, failing to add dimension. The plot chugs along as predictably and as innocuously as any familiar parable. Devoid of danger and development, FOR KINGS AND PLANETS gives Canin two strikes at bat in the game of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on melodrama, short on character","review":"What he does brilliantly in stories--the lush language, the small moments of tenderness, the smart, clever scenes--is overblown and overdone in this novel that desperately wants to be about something big but amounts to nothing more than a story we've heard time and time again. The characters are all merely cardboard, going through their tired roles--hayseed, eccentric NYC kid--and Canin never pushes them beyond their assigned roles. In the end, this reader thought: Who Cares? A major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"He could do better","review":"Ethan Canin's previous two books were works of genius. I especially enjoyed Emperor of the Air, each story is simple but poignant, almost Carver-esque. Which makes For Kings and Planets so much more of a let down. Instead of the unobstrusive prose, Canin chose to write in flowery prose, something he is simply not good at doing. Writing a novel instead of vignettes is also not Canin's forte, as the plot goes everywhere and the third person is unconvincing. The book is also too preachy, especially about the meaninglessness of education in favor of precocity. I highly recommend Canin's short stories, they will change you. But don't pick this book as your first, because you'll never want to read this guy again. If you like to read about Ivy League schools and precocity, check out Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise and Salinger's Franny and Zooey, respectively. About boyhood relationships that turn sour, read Chabon's the Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thrills, no surprises","review":"Not the worst book I've read this year, but by no means one of the best. From the first page, when we are introduced to one \\"Orno Tarcher\\" from the midwest, I knew we were in for some serious manipulating on the part of the author. I was right. Velvet smoking jackets came later. Maybe Canin should stop watching soap operas and read some good books on developing characters. John Gardner comes to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canin is Not a Novelist","review":"It's 0-for-2 on the novel front for Ethan Canin. I enjoyed his ten-year-old collection of short stories, \\"The Emperor of the Air,\\" but found everything he has written since disappointing. Canin's characters in \\"For Kings and Planets\\" lie flat on the page, and the plot is so derivative and stifling I could see what was coming at every juncture. I found the ending especially maddening because I had invested a fair amount of time on this novel. It left me hungering for something surprising or meaningful or even conclusive to happen. Mostly, though, I found \\"For Kings and Planets\\" BORING. Canin just keeps reworking the same theme over and over and over in his writing, as if stuck in an adolescent script he can't see his way out of. Save yourself the money and pass this one up. I sure won't be buying any more books by Ethan Canin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable Addition to Modern Fiction","review":"I recently read For Kings and Planets and have given myself a little time to digest the novel. My conclusion: I'm most impressed with Canin's work.The tale of two college friends, one acquainted to a posh New York City lifestyle, the other from the heartland - not a new concept but one that deserved revisiting. I have noticed many comparisons to The Great Gatsby and I have to agree that there are some similarities (although I disliked the Great Gatsby and enjoyed For Kings and Planets). This is a wonderful story, written with great care. If I have any criticism of the novel, its that the post-college portion of the novel seeemed slightly rushed, not nearly as detailed or heartfelt as the first half of the novel. However, this is good writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Sadly, the writer has run out of things to say and has produced a banal novel for commercial purposes.

What drives the the genius, in From Kings and Planets, Marshall Emerson, who consistently envies the ordinary Orno Tarcher because Marshall feels empty? And what keeps the ordinary Orno in Marshall's orbit? What must he do to escape Marshall? This character driven novel explores these questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an irritating, banal, self-satisfied little book!","review":"This is the story of Orno, who goes to college, dentistry school, marries his smarter, more interesting friend's sister and has a baby. I started thinking about that name \\"Orno.\\" Is Canin slyly signalling to us that he agrees with us that his protagonist is a zero first and last? I wish I believed he were that subtle. (Although Dr. Canin certainly doesn't go to great lengths to hide his contempt for dentists.) The characters are two-dimensional, great swathes of the plot are boring, and all of it is derivative of the work of better writers. The real conflict is between Marshall (\\"Martial,\\" get it?) and his father. The problem is they're off-screen most of the time, and we have to see everything through Orno's infuriatingly dim eyes. Skip this book, and read \\"A Secret History\\" instead. Same plot, much better written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell is full of all types; accountants, judges, book critics","review":"I enjoyed this book.

Some of the memorable tracks on this CD include Solar Myth by Piece Process (perfect start to the CD) along with Afterburner-Madoka and Tennis by Junkie XL, the perfect ender to this compilation. Those familiar with Max Graham know that he pours his heart into his music and this CD is a perfect example.

But if you listen to this mix on its own, you will enjoy it quit a bit. This CD starts off with a disco feel to it, which is similar to Pete Tong's Essential Mix works, which is not my cup of tea but it picks up soon after that. Before you know it though, the CD winds down and leaves you wanting a little bit more. I would have liked a 2-CD set.

I found his book to be extremely biased, uninformed, hysterical and obviously meant to discredit all people who disagree with this government. The majority of his \\"supposed\\" facts are based on internet websites, anti-militia organizations, and personal opinions. Although the author claims throughout the book his observations are based on having attending meetings and interviewing militia members, there is not ONE documented interview cited. The author frequently (nearly every chapter)reminds the reader that anyone who is interested in a miltia is uneducated, unemployed, racist, psychologically imbalanced, and angry at the world at large. Anyone who reads this book should be compelled to investigate his sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misconception at its best","review":"The american militia represents a diverse segment of our society.

Basic introductions to the topics debated are not always given, so it might be best to pair this book with a text that provides basic information about the major topics and themes in epistemology.Some of the pairings in this book are fantastic (I particularly enjoyed BonJour and Devitt discussing a priori justificaiton). Others are less than ideal, but still interesting.The structure of the book: Two philosophers write on a common topic. Each will write an essay of around ten pages. Most of the time, the philosopher will address the essay to her or his opponent. In some cases, the two essays will be followed by one or more replies."},{"rating":"1","title":"the divine no","review":"Possibly the most unjointed and contradictory religious literature i have ever read.

The main reason for this embarrassing state of affairs was the CITES ridiculousness that crops up again and again. Can people in positions of power REALLY be so stupid? Well, yep, they can, sadly enough for the thousands of plants that are destroyed in the name of \\"development,\\" illegal to save by conservationists.But the people Hansen meets are equally worthy of a jaw drop. Their passion--there's truly no other word, unless it is obsession--for their orchids simply astounded me. Wonderfully humorous, enlightening reading.Now that I've read it nearly a decade after many of the encounters described, I am longing for an update. What's become of the CITES laws? Has common sense prevailed? What about the individual scientists and growers? Are they still as enthralled with their plants?

The orchid world he describes is something I never could have imagined!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly....Orchid Fever","review":"After living in denial for many years about desiring orchids, the coming out party just got rowdy with this book. It speaks to the true orchid enthusiast that enjoys the fascination, mystery, and excitement of orchid collecting. Each bizzare, descriptive story felt like I was on location in some sci-fi adventure. The author's writing style paints amazing pictures of each place while trying to understand the obsession orchids can create and in the search discovers many diverse personalities of the orchid world. The book didn't leave my hands until it was finished.In sharing this book with a fellow enthusiast, I've made plans to travel to different places in search of the inspiration for many of the chapter stories. Each one was unique, but all shared the same passion.Orchid lovers will enjoy, anyone else, can't tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"never finished it","review":"i thought it would be similar to the fruit hunters, which i adore, but alas, i could not even finish it. there was too little substance and too much fluff"},{"rating":"2","title":"Botanical Cravings","review":"Orchid Fever reinvents horticultural non-fiction with its sensual imagery and thrilling accounts of real-life adventures in the mad, mad world of orchid fanaticism. From the very first sentence, I was hooked and could hardly stand to put this book down until I had found out what exactly was meant by each of the tantalizing chapter names. Hansen has a way of bringing surprising sex appeal and glamour to a subject that most would have treated with far less inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orchid Fever","review":"\\"In my 40 years as an orchid scientist, author and book editor, I have never read anything quite like ORCHID FEVER. It is part absurdist black humor and part horticultural expose. Mr. Hansen displays a rare talent for capturing the allure of orchids, describing the dubious characters who lurk in the shadows, and exposing the small handful of self-appointed power brokers who rule the orchid world. Frightening, funny and full of tantalizing insider knowledge. And yes...there are strange and wonderful stories about orchids as well. I have a distinct feeling that what was left unsaid about several people is much more interesting than what was written. I look forward to a no holds barred second edition.\\"Dr. Joseph Arditti Editor, Orchid Biology Irvine"},{"rating":"2","title":"orchids are addictive","review":"This is a very interesting book for any plant lover especially those who try to grow orchids.

I am that much an amateur orchid enthusiast, no foreign travel, no cloning, no $1000 species for me. Certainly no show winners. But orchids thrill me. I have 14 plants (I just bought another one: dayglo green with fuscia petals)all of which are in rather good health. Some have little nubs of flower stems on them.This wonderful book has inspired me. It has entertained me, and made me laugh too (\\"What's dog food?\\"). I have learned so much, and I now feel the depth and tradition and botanical (cellular, even) heritage that motivates and directs the DNA, hypothalamus, and higher-functioning regions of the brain of the orchid-lover. This book and its stories have added a romance and knowledge to my love and care of my plants."},{"rating":"2","title":"A RARE HERMAPHRODITIC TALE","review":"The name said it all. \\"Orchid Fever: A Horticultural Tale of Love, Lust, and Lunacy\\" is one multi-faced novel which most readers would either cherish or dislike. Its pattern is dynamic: the initial momentum was sustained till the very end.The 272 pages that constituted this true story explored the strange world of orchids using men and women as its horticultural tools. It is one ominous tale that is rich in humour.This story has a hermaphroditic outlook. It shuffles between a crime thriller and a love story. It is well-written, and very captivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six thumbs up!","review":"All six people in our book club liked this one--a first since I've been a member (2 years). It's a great read. Wacky characters that are too \\"out there\\" to be made up. Smuggling. International intrigue. Obsession. The law of unintended consequences. Stupidity and/or corruption in high places. Big laughs. Environmental outrage.Hansen puts himself in the book as the active narrator, not in the heroic mold but, charmingly and candidly, as a guy who is just following his own curiousity and who often is mistaken in his intitial understanding of what is going on.Pick this book up and read the first paragraph. If you can walk away from it at that point, the book is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased Journalism","review":"Hansen is a reporter who makes a guy boading a plane with orchids hidden inside his clothes sound like a nice man, while making environmental agencies sound evil. He spends many pages letting likely criminals tell their stories, while providing only a brief and biased view of the people trying to stop them. It's an entertaining story, but it's false. Please read Susan Orlean's \\"Orchid Thief\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Absurdity of Reality","review":"This delightful book charmed me from the first and kept me reading in amazement until the end. More bizarre than the most irreverant satire, Orchid Fever examines the incredible characters, situations and locales that make up the world of orchids. You don't need to know a thing about plants to enjoy this book, for it is the people and places Eric Hansen describes that makes for a fascinating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"neither entertaining nor informative","review":"I have in general been a great fan of Hansen's, and his book in particular about Borneo was a jewel. \\"Orchid Fever\\" trivializes almost every issue and individual that it touches. It is also extremely unpleasant to read if you dislike (as I do) the snide tone that it frequently employs as a substitute for humor. This is one of the most irritating books I have read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly dull","review":"Received book in good order. No problem there.

Cole Richards was not whom he said he was, but Noelle Maxwell was not the woman everyone thought she was. Noelle, a New Orleans native, has been transformed into a glamourous, wealthy woman after Jordan Maxwell sets eyes on her and decided he could mold her into what he wanted. After years of marriage, naive Noelle is on her own after the death of Jordan. But for Noelle, Jordan's death is a mystery as well as the man, Trent, who Noelle feels is somewhat responsible for Jordan's death, but has never had the opportunity to meet. However, Noelle and Cole are brought together and for the first time in years, Noelle has feelings awaken that lay dormant for years. Can Noelle sucumb to the temptation that Cole Richards ignite inside of her? Can Cole Richards unleash the temptation to reveal his true identity in order to gain Noelle's trust and love? Temptation is truly a suspenseful and romantic read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good alternative to expensive grinder","review":"I bought this grinder to replace a worn out cheap geared version.

Obviously, this section exceeds Ms Metzher's technical ability, but one wonders why she didn't increase the tempo digitally.

Also, our washer (in the carpeted bathroom) had a leak and the carpet was so wet it felt as if it was a yard after a septic tank overfilled.(mushy) This is , slowly, taking all that water out. You can 'suck' and not spray water. It is light and easy to use, also we have a tiny bathroom and the large cleaner would not fit well in it.

If you are wanting little areas to clean it is so perfect, but if you are wanting to clean a room it will take you longer than the bigger carpet cleaners. This is pretty much common knowledge, because it is a smaller cleaner, it would take longer to clean a room. I gave it 5 stars because it does the job that is built for and it does it extremely well. I bought it to do little spot shot areas. If you are buying this to clean your entire house I would suggest either a bigger one or take your time and clean you rooms in a few days.

It has a very small track and even though I have only two rooms of carpet, it would take me quite a long time to cover the whole the whole area. And it left the stains in situ. I switched back to my favorite steamer brand so far -- the Dirt Devil vision -- and it works beautifully! It has almost twice the track size of the Bissell, a much larger tank, and it gets out the dog stains - ground in mud and dirt, slobber, urine and other accidents -- quickly and beautifully! Every time I think I finally have a stain that will beat it, I'm always surprised when it cleans my carpets like new again.

After she found the perfect spot to \\"pee\\" on my favorite black floral wool area rug (and returned to it a number of times to complete her work), I pulled out my Bissell and put it to work. The stains and odor are gone and my dog has not returned to mark her territory since. While I had the Bissell out, I used it on some old, ugly stains on my beige carpet. Lo and behold, those stains were almost gone as well. I will probably redo that area of the carpet again and I bet the stains will completely be gone.

This is a 1931 release so the traces of silent films are still evident with minimal dialogue at times. A hoary tale of a spy who falls for a traitor, Dietrich is approximately half way betweeen the German hausfrau she had been and the sleek manicured Hollywood icon she became. The story is unbelievably banal, not helped by the miscast Victor McLaglen as the object of her affection. As usual, Von Sternberg provides some exceptional set pieces with lighting to match so the film looks good but in this case, it simply can not overcome the stupidity of the screenplay. It is a turgid boring film.The print of the film is adequate but the DVD contains no extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"3M Sandpaper always works well.","review":"I've never had a problem with this sand paper and I've been using it for years.

Not the most exciting read this year. The paper is of poor quality, seems to still have chunks of wood in it and the type face is not to my taste. The writing style is pedestrian at best. Lots of detail though, I haven't found any glaring errors, but you really have to be an ocean liner fanatic to get through this. Thankfully I am. For a more entertaining and interesting view, look for something by John Maxtone-Graham like The Only Way to Cross. J. P. Morgan's biographers also have lots of comments about White Star. Pictures are good, information is accurate as far as I know, but definitely not a page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate history","review":"While I do agree that it is not neccessarily a page turner, this book is accurate. The author spent a lot of time putting the research in this book. At times it does seem like a lot of facts strung together, but he keeps the timeline of events very well and I think its better to just state the facts at times rather than write a barage of opinions (let people draw their own conclusions). Anyone interested in shipping history would find this book interesting enough to maintain a focus. If you want this book because you are a Titanic fanatic, your money would be better spent on one of the author's other books which explores the POSSIBLITY of a conspiracy or another book dedicated solely to Titanic. Overall I thought the book was great, very informative and I learned a lot I didn't know before, especially about the very early years. Transatlantic and The White Star Line: An Illustrated History are great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a better book available","review":"Because the previous reviews for this book have already hit the bullseye, I would like to chance tactics and propose a worthy alternative. \\"Transatlantic\\" by Stephan Fox is a well researched and well written history of all the major transatlantic lines. In addition to the history of the lines, his narratives give life and form to the people who owned them, built them, and sailed in them. \\"Transatlantic\\" not only explores the history and personalities that formed and sustained the White Star line, but carefully explains how the various lines interacted with and reacted to each other.

Columbo would be deeply saddened to read how his character has been so trivialized and packaged for sensational appeal. So much of this story is padded with solicitous sex and violence.

Who can't tell what the Hoffa connection is going to be from the very start? I was very disappointed in the handling of this. There is a very minimal story line to begin with and the superfluous verbiage just makes it more tedious. Mr. Harrington can do better than this. You don't have to print ANYTHING; wait until you have the kind of story line that was so evident in the original TV series. That's what brings in the interest.

I never thought I'd see the day when I couldn't wait to finish a Columbo mystery just to finish it and get it over with, rather than for the finale where our hero normally breaks down the case and explains all. As it is in this one he explains bugger all and the 'Hoffa connection' is both ludicrous AND unnecessary. Top that with the fact that the Columbo we see in this book is so far removed from our beloved Columbo on TV that it looks like an entirely different detective PLUS the fact that one of the main characters, Mickey, switches from a last name of Newcastle to Newhouse with irritating regularity and you've got yourself a pretty lame effort... sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike is a great finger style artist","review":"I resently puchased bottom lands and am injoying it very much . the only reason i did't give it a 5 star rateing ,i was hopeing for more slide guitar,but mike does not disappoint in his finger style approch to guitar.

I just put the pastic waterproof case right into my bathing suit while I swim and it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars - leaked immediately","review":"I don't know what went wrong with this. It certainly appeared to be sealed, but the minute it went into the water, it leaked a LOT and ruined my new nano. The nano didn't seem to fit all that well, and it was hard to close. VERY distressing. I was really looking forward to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd year psychiatry resident","review":"I'm currently a 3rd year psychiatry resident and fairly comfortable with computers. I thought this book would show me unique ways to apply computers to psychiatry. Instead I found it to be a small manual explaining the very basics of computers. The only section that's unique to psychiatry is the list of psychiatry related web sites. Unfortunately, this list is sure to be out of date by the time of publication. Someone interested in such a list would do better to look at NAMI's website. If you're completely new to computers this might be the book for you but it's far to basic for anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art Can Happen","review":"David Byrne's E.E.E.I. is a prime example that art can happen in the most surprising places and with the most surprising tools. It's a delight to see something as ubiquitous and utilitarian as Powerpoint employed as a personal medium. Byrne takes this humble, low level technology and infuses it with wit and sophistication. The short (think haiku) but sweet DVD suite is also surprisingly subtle and intimate when viewed on a desktop monitor. The same can be said of the companion book. It's a work of art, a collector's item, and a clever little meditation on the ambiguities of our culture's evolving soup of language, images, technology, and communication. As with most art, some will love it or hate it, but it's worth the leap and look (and a listen to a little more of Byrne's musical imagination)."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly","review":"E.E.E.I. is simply silly - the man is a legend, in person on-stage he can move audiences even when they do not speak english (I saw him in Rio and he lit the place up!)but he is no philosopher, this book is a read/watch one time and file in the round bin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Unnecessarily heavy paper and binding.

It was performed over two nights in Boston Symphony Hall and the recording was assembled from those performances. The performance was first-rate and Dutilleux himself was in attendance. The premiere actually occurred a few months earlier (again in Boston) and the composer made minor tweaks in the score before the recording.This is not the very best of Dutilleux (that's a very high standard), but it's still quite a good piece. It is essentially French--even with its tone rows. The compositional backbone is a little more obvious that some of Dutilleux's other pieces, but we're still fortunate to have the composer doing good work at such a late point in life.The CD is short--holding only this single piece--but well worth a number of hearings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aidyn Chronicles Strategy Guide Review","review":"This guide is very good is because it gives you all the spells you need to know, it also tells you about the characters. This guide tells you how to bring you the characters up levels faster their weaknesses and strong points. There is one thing I did find in this guide that I did not find in some others, is it tells how to search around dangerous areas and not get hurt. The reason I gave it a four star and not a five is because it does not tell everything. Such as some of the things that Nintendo Power tells you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Reger if that's your flavor","review":"Paul Fejko was completely unknown to me before this recording.

Voegelin contends that certain modern movements, including positivism, Hegelianism, Marxism, and the \\"God is dead\\" school are variants of the gnostic tradition. Striving to settle the confusion that arises from the dominance of gnostic thought, Voegelin further strives to classify distinctions between political gnosticism and the philosophy of politics. A lucid yet in-depth scrutiny of the interplay of complex ideals and their reverbations upon mass political movements, Science, Politics & Gnosticism is especially recommended reading for advanced students of philosophy and political science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too \\"new age\\" for me","review":"I bought this CD hoping it would help me improve my confidence with public speaking, but I was very disappointed. It has an extremely heavy \\"new age\\" and hypnotic feel and sound that I found very irritating. I turned it off after about 15 minutes, and I never plan to turn it on again. It will be headed to Goodwill with the next load.I recommend \\"The Quick & Easy Way to Effective Speaking\\" by Dale Carnegie. It is a classic that has never been surpassed. It provides extensive help and practical guidance that has been very valuable to me both in terms of technique and confidence. Dale Carnegie was THE expert on public speaking; his books and courses have helped millions of people overcome their fears and become effective speakers. His books have a positive \\"you can do it\\" attitude that I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Way to Prepare for a Talk!","review":"I found Janet and Diane's CD helped me to relax and put things in perpective before speaking publically. Both of them have soothing voices that are a pleasure to listen to. The CD doesn't tell you how to speak publically. The idea is to help you get calm and centered before speaking. I plan to use it everytime I have to speak. I think it would also make a great gift for anyone that gets nervous before speaking in public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing and energizing","review":"Starting with practices of grounding and kinesthetic awareness, Janet's soothing voice leads the listener into a state of dynamic relaxation. Next, she introduces positive statements that help to channel the energy of fear into power, by shifting the perspective from dread to a sense of humor and lightness.I have found not only the message, but the way in which it is presented to be uplifting and practical. Just by putting in the CD, I build my inner strength to turn the anxiety producing act of public speaking into an opportunity to be on stage with grace and poise.I know I will use this CD many times before I give a workshop or presentation, as it is an invaluable preparation for being both relaxed and energized for optimal performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT WORKS BUT DONT FIT","review":"It did work with my Nissan Quest 2001, but the standard base didnt fit so I had to use the old one... but at the end it fitted and worked the way it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a book with a two song CD","review":"This is a rip unless you want to read a book.The two song CD that comes with it is not rare in any way and it sounds like it was copied from a record.

Then out of the dark you materialise behind the enemy and blow him away !!BUT THIS!!!! THIS TRAVESTY is the saddest effort I have ever seen!!!

The levels are repetitive and very difficult, almost impossible even with invinciblity as another reviewer here said. The game gets old fast, the game play is just the same thing every level.This game is also very dull, I tried to play this game twice and I always stop by the fourth level. The story itself seems messed up since the Excelsior crew transforms into their mirror characters in the game when in the real mirror universe in Trek, there is already someone in an alternate universe that looks like you but acts different. The game just feels really slapped together and made for gaming pros because the game is HARD. That can't be said enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Save Your Money!!!!","review":"I consider myself a gaming afficianado.

It's one of the few that explore the implications of Germany's development of the V1 (buzz bomb) and V2 (missle) but it's one of Sophia Loren's more lacklustre performances. George Peppard comes across as a WWII Banacek. If you're interested in Germany's missle development, take a look. If you're looking for a darned good WWII movie, opt instead for The Longest Day, A Bridge Too Far, The Great Escape, or To Hell and Back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor rendering of the original movie","review":"I rented this DVD and found the production to be choppy, have blurry video and sub-text, and missing any openings and closing of the film. The overall quality is quite poor such that it is worse than the VHS version I recorded for myself several years ago.

Resplendent with MGM's roaring lion logo and the superb Panavision presentation - on which basis I bought this newly issued DVD. What a let down. Only a 4x3 format and a pretty fuzzzy transfer, despite the cover proclaimation of a 'digital'mastering'. No opening logo - straight into the main title and only 4 chapters to the entire film. No extras, not even a trailer. Atleast it could have been issued in the original Panavision format. Barely worth 1-star.

I have had the pleasure of having owned and heard the original release. I just received my CD in the mail today, and, of course, immediately put it on. In a nutshell, I'm very thankful I have my copy of the original LP. So much of the depth of sound is missing from this remix, not to mention entire sections missing. A number of sections that used to build and build and build, tugging a certain way at one's emotions (or at least mine), are now missing. I'd rather hear the pops and hisses on the original rather than this sterile rendition. I guess I'll have to retrieve my LP's from storage and get hold of a new turn table somewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldfield's underestimated masterpiece","review":"In many ways, this album is insignificant compared to its illustrious predecessor. 'Tubular Bells' changed the lives of Oldfield and his boss Branson forever. And although it wasn't the first of its kind, it was the first to find mass appeal. It opened up massive audiences for bands like Tangerine Dream and perhaps even composers such as Steve Reich.In contrast, 'Hergest Ridge' did not change the course of popular music. But in several ways it is the better album. The melody on side one is the most beautiful that Oldfield has ever written. The oboe part is particularly poignant.I've never been so impressed by side two, which is why I didn't rate this a five-star album.Several of the reviews of this album here make comparisons with other mixes of 'Hergest Ridge'. For me, the difference is fairly abstruse. Suffice to say that this remastered version sparkles. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the best.","review":"Herbgest Ridge, Ommadawn and the Origional Tubular Bells Hybrid, are the best of Mike Oldfield."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic","review":"I know that this remaster is based on Mike Oldfield's 'improved' Hergest Ridge mix. But I think this is a case where the artist should have left well enough alone, and the label should have gone back to the original masters and re-released THOSE. Oldfield's tinkering did nothing to improve upon the original work. If anything, it robbed it of some of its most beautiful musical moments.The original version of 'Hergest Ridge' (hisses and all) is still preferable to this one. Tragic, but true."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Disappointment","review":"There's nothing like waiting years for a re-master of a classic piece of music to find that half the work is gone. I love the original mix of this composition but Mr. Oldfield's remix, upon which this CD is based, feels like a randomly gutted version of the original. All the depth and dynamics have been removed in favor of bringing plunky guitar sounds to the front. The flow of the original mix sent shivers up my spine. This version just brings tears of sadness to my eyes. First time listeners may enjoy it but, trust me, go find the original album for a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNFORGETABLE TV SHOW","review":"I am writing this in anticipation of the release of the TV show HOMEFRONT on DVD.

You should, however, keep one thing in mind: second-rate work by Oldfield is still head and shoulders above the best work by others.This is an atypical Oldfield work in a lot of ways. Oldfield, an extraordinarily talented multi-instrumentalist, made his name recording albums where (through the miracle of overdubbing) he played the vast majority of the instruments himself. Here he uses plenty of other musicians. The composition on this album are also unlike a lot of his other work.But different isn't necessarily bad. The title track, \\"Runaway Son,\\" \\"Blue Night\\" and \\"Holy\\" are more than worth the price of the CD. Can you get significantly better Mike Oldfield work? You bet.

I admire for Mike actually doing it in the early 80's, but doing it his way. This album is nothing more than pure pop fluff which sounds, well almost embarrassing. And the cheezy synths that were so in vogue make this album sound completely dated.

Gillian Bradshaw has taken a historical \\"footnote\\"--the arrival of Sarmatian cavalry in Britain--and turned it into a rousingly good story. I sat down and read this book in one afternoon, then re-read it the next day. Characters and their motivations are for the most part quite believable (although the villainess was just a tad extreme) and I found myself caring about what happened to them. This book is a great example of historical fiction, with just a little romance thrown in for good measure. I am quite a fan of the author's -- I have read all of her work -- and while I might not rate this as the best of her books, it's right up there near the top. If you read this book, you will not be disappointed -- I swear on fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"I bought this book because of the (largely) very positive reviews here on amazon.com, and they could not have been more wrong.

Try Robert Graves (fiction), or maybe even Plutarch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent historical-novel writing","review":"No synopsis here. Ms. Bradshaw's novel once again shows her restrained and capable prose hand, as well as her sense for sensible narrative and historical accuracy (as for this genre). Let's face it: life in (Roman) antiquity wasn't all full of sex and violence with iron implements - much as that may disappoint the Braveheart crowd - , and there's little point in writing novels that purport to show what history would have been like, and have them be deliberately distorted. A very definite thumbs-up for this fine effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good piece of historical fiction","review":"A highly entertaining piece of historical fiction set in 2nd century CE Britian, centered mainly on the region around Hadrian's Wall. Lots of action, political intrigue, and even some romance is tied all together quite well by Bradshaw, making for a quick, fun read. The historical accuracy is is also spot on, and the intricacies of straddling two different cultures are poignantly depicted by the author. The ending left something to be desired, though.SPOILERSThe main antagonist is never directly confronted by the protagonist, making the ending feel a bit anticlimactic. But overall, \\"Island of Ghosts\\" is a tremendous piece of historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gillian","review":"I once read this book out of boredom.

At first, he makes the crossing to release a wolf he has trapped and cannot bear to kill. Later, he returns with his brother. In the course of this novel, Billy undergoes just about every misfortune it is possible to encounter, becoming progressively more wretched until the final pages, an understated vignette with a potent, heartrending effect.McCarthy is a fine writer and story-teller, particulary in the early section concerning the wolf, but I have to remove a star because of a number of dull episodes in which Billy encounters various old Mexicans, gypsies, and soldiers who inflict their convoluted philosophies upon us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but a letdown from \\"Pretty Horses\\"","review":"This is an undeniably beautifully written book and wonderful story, but was a little less of a personal favorite than was the first book of this Border Trilogy. McCarthy dropped a bit of the power and simplicity of language of \\"All The Pretty Horses\\" and instead became much more wordy and allegorical. I appreciated the straight-ahead story of the first book that also managed to project a lasting emotion at the same time. In The Crossing, the language was as beautiful, but there were often stories and sub-plots that stalled out the otherwise fast and engaging book. These asides seemed to have been added to build depth in the characters, but for me weakened the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This novel is terrible.

The Crossing is tedious and often illogical regarding plot and motives of Billy, the protagonist. Far too many stories of other people's lives that have nothing to do with imtegrity of the plot. This novel seems to be looking futively to relate SOMETHIG, but fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off okay and then sinks","review":"This story starts off with promise, but then quickly sinks to despair and stays there.

If you want to get depressed turn on the news, don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat difficult but well worth it","review":"McCarthy presents with The Crossing a challenging and hauntingly beautiful novel. I learned much spanish trying to labor through the dialogue and I admit it took much longer to read than most 400 page books. The dialogue, when in English, is understated; the scenery is bleak; and the characters extremely human, sometimes divine. The journey into Mexico is much like Conrad's Heart of Darkness, both physically and psychologically.

I early on stopped even trying to decipher the meaning and just skipped those passages, which are very numerous and sometimes a paragraph or two in length. What is probably an attempt to provide local color becomes merely irritating for those who do not know Spanish. (And I've yet to figure out what Mr. McCarthy has against punctuation.)The interminable mountains and rivers which, after all, cannot differ much from each other, get pretty tedious after a while, too. As do the stories and philosophizing from people met on the journey. After a couple hundred pages, my feeling is let's get on with it! ( It being the saga of Billy and Boyd.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pages out of order?","review":"Much like his other novels, I initially found the story to be absorbing...very difficult to put down until about 2/3 of the way through I noticed that the end of one page and the beginning of the next were completely out of sync (Vintage International, March 1995 printing). At first I attributed this to McCarthy's unconventional writing style (LOL), but as I read closer I realized that the pages at this point forward are completely out of order. I guess I got one that the quality control guy at the publishing house missed! I just gave up after searching for the place in the book where the pages were back in order, because by that point I was completely lost track of what was going on in the story. Too bad...it really started off as a compelling read. I guess I'll wait for movie adaptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dusty, bloody mess","review":"What a long, tiresome, hackneyed description of Mexico, complete with dusty streets, maroon sunsets, sultry and serious women, plates of burritos and beans, and bandits popping out from behind the sagebrush. On top of this belittling and stereotyped background is a character who learns nothing from experience and continues to follow a path of stupidity. McCarthy writes much of the important dialogue in Spanish and rarely 'translates' with any counterpoint English dialogue or explanations. If you don't know Spanish, be prepared for many frustrating pages, or else keep your Spanish dictionary handy. Maybe a master like Hemingway or Casta?eda can pull this off in brief spurts, but McCarthy fails. I gave it two stars because it actually does have some wisdom, in the form of philosophical dialogues."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCarthy is grossly overrate, to judge by The Crossing","review":"THE CROSSING is the first of the Cormac McCarthy novels I've read; I am rather confident it will be the last. This writer is grossly overrated. His style is that of someone who wants to convince us that he is just an ol' cowboy story-teller, never really tried, you know, to be a writer-type feller. Frightened to death by Faulkner, drunk on Hemingway, his prose is overwrought, outlandishly affected. Much of his stuff wouldn't get past the admissions process in any respectable school of writing. It is quite amazing to me that this sort of fraudulent material passes muster with supposedly sophisticated agents, editors, and publishers. National Book Award?

Too much geographical detail -the ennui and angst might have been better without the detail - we might have begun to view this in an \\"everyman\\" light. Part of the story may have been ruled too upsetting, too subversive or too stupid by the editors, who have set it in Spanish so we don't need to pay attention to whatever is happening or whatever the characters are saying.This is better written than ALL THE PRETTY HORSES and slightly riveting, mostly because there is only one point of view. Sadly, the point of view doesn't open on any vista worth seeing or investigating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writing?","review":"I see \\"great writing\\" in some of the other reviews. I found the opposite. I also found it hard to continue after meeting the 78 word sentence in paragraph two. Then the silly indian character appears with unrealistic dialogue. Did not finish it, nor did I get very far into it before giving up. And that with having nothing else to read at the moment.I think it safe to say I have discovered myself to not be a fan of McCarthy, whose novels seem to be consistent with the author eliminating things such as character development, pacing, plot and plot resolution, punctuation...etc. And most are depressing to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed an English - Spanish dictionary to understand the book","review":"I couldn't finish reading this book. There were too many sentences in spanish and I was confused with the translation or at least the assumption of a translation with the response.

I bought again, hoping to keep that forever.About the book:This book deals how corporations are using the same strategies that are used by the military. Best part is, book draws specific examples from real life events and compare them. So vivid and lucid, you will fall in love with the concepts.This book is worth keeping in your personal collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diabelli with a difference","review":"I've always loved Richter's towering account on M&A; (sadly out of print now), but this warmly expressive account by Kovacevich was a revelation to me. There are many extraordinary recordings of the work, but most of them sounds too laboured and self-concious, taking this music as a sort of huge mountain to climb, that is tiring to listen to.Kovacevich's account, on the other hand, is very sincere and wonderfully fresh, letting the music speak most eloquently and also bringing Schubertian lyricism in slow variations. Technically he is solid like a rock, and in some variations he surpasses even Richter, not to mention Pollini and Sokolov. This is a pianism of true maturity and stature no serious collector could miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing much of the history","review":"I enjoyed the Deco Dowager, as I grew up on Miami Beach and am fascinated by the area and the architecture. What disappointed me in this book, is that the author ended her history of the hotel in the early 50's and didn't pick it up until the 80s.I realize that the area was not in its prime during her \\"missing years\\" but something certainly must have occurred. Who owned it? What did it look like? What happened there?Certainly the book would have been better served with more history of the hotel (and photos) along with the author's \\"potential realized\\" with celebrities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat!","review":"These are a cool product! I take my dog in the sidecar on my motorcycle and he wears his doggles. (Easyrider, Dec 2011)My dog is Shepard style and around 120lbs, I ordered XL and they are a little large.But the stay on at freeway speed and he looks really cool wearing them!Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete and Compact. A Smart Read.","review":"I feel that the author explains value investing in a practical and non threatening way to the beginning and intermediate investor. In these times of Investing for Dummies manuals How to Be A Value Investor not only tells the reader how, but why."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read!","review":"Lisa Holton describes the way value investors find bargain stocks. She looks at a variety of financial formulas that can help you unearth good deals. This is a useful primer for investors, since it offers clear explanations of financial ratios. The book includes plenty of specific examples of ways to apply formulas to a company's financial statements. She clearly describes the contents of SEC documents and offers helpful advice about when to sell a stock. We at getAbstract recommend this book for beginner to intermediate investors, for those unfamiliar with \\"value investing,\\" and for those interested in basic portfolio planning. This book focuses on the United States stock market and may be less useful in other countries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed Pop Psycology/Pseudo-science","review":"Save your money. This book is based on mostly anecdotal information and \\"subjective\\" tests. It starts with an assumption that girls are short-changed and sets out to \\"prove\\" it, even though all the evidence from most other objective sources reaches the opposite conclusion. In fact, the original statistical data this book is based on has been \\"lost\\", so the methodolgy cannot be objectively critiqued. If you need ammunition for your agenda, then get this book. But beware: you may have your work cut out for you trying to prove this theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely worthless","review":"If a girl fails it is blaimed on schools. If a boy fails he has a learning disability. This book uses pitiful data collection methods and bias theories in a vain attempt to make us believe what they are saying. Save your money. If your a man just hate yourself for as long as it would take to get through a 250 page book, and if your a woman feel good about yourself for that amount of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of lies, propaganda, and hate","review":"This year, 60% of college entries will be female. Look at this spring's honor role listings. Last year, 78% of honor role members in my community were female. Schools are fails boys - not girls.If you wish to waste your time on a politically correct diatribe that is full of anecdotal and subjective pap, then get this book. If you want to really improve the quality of education, there are thousands of reads better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product was as described","review":"The book came in the condition described and when they said it would. The price was great especially because I was buying it for a class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Descent for beginners","review":"This book reviews the very basics of map design and hardly touches on cartographic representations. It is probably a good starting point for first timers to GIS and mapping, but for the average map maker/cartographer it is too rudimentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Designing Better Maps","review":"An excellent book, but a bit tedious. Gives the GIS user an excellent review of what makes a map visually useful. GIS users aren't necessarily the best cartographers and this can help them along"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Printer, Great Cartridge","review":"I've had this printer in a fitness studio for over 7 years now and have gone through dozens of cartridges.
