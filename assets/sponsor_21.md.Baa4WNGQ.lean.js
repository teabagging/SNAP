If you are interested in natural birth control from a secular standpoint, avoid this book. Even though the information is there, it is difficult to read because of the conservative language.

It is not comforting to have the authors of a book about family planing mentioning over and over again that an unplanned pregnancy is not such a bad thing. Even if you are Catholic,the book is overly complicated. I have read a number of books concerning the subject of natural birth control and this one was poorly organized and wordy.

In the 19th century -- and even in the first half of the 20th century -- its beauty made it a favorite in Germany and reasonably popular in the U.S. Unfortunately, the old-fashioned romance of its plot has caused Martha to fall out of favor in these unromantic times. But the melodic beauty of Martha is as appealing now as it ever was if you will listen to it without bias. I love this beautiful opera and I think you may too. This version is the only one currently abvailable, to the best of my knowledge. It is a re-release on CDs of a performance from the 1940s (hence the four stars for this five-star opera). But the remastering is quite acceptable -- and the opera is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The opera sounded excellent to me until I realized that it w","review":"It is remarkable that such a lovely opera is generally unavailable, even in Italian, let alone in German.

At that point I read the label and learned that it was recorded in 1944, when Jews were being incinerated in the \\"kingdom of night\\" and Allied soldiers were sacrified at the altar of Adolf Hitler. It is incredible to me that these wartime recordings are re-issued without any warning, and I urge all involved to stamp them as Nazi products. The series of Entartete Musik is belatedly bringing to life those whose voices were stilled by the Nazis. These recordings are the real \\"degenerate music.\\" I hope vendors will note in their search data the date of original issue, which was not visible when I erroneously ordered this set.

As for the theory, parts of it sound great, but ultimately he cedes the entire formation of the universe to an evolutionary time scale & formation model. Basically his argument is: here's how I can account for however many billions or trillions of years secular science says it took the universe to form, using all their models of planet & star formation (slow & gradual accumulation of matter into galaxies, stars, planets etc) - but using this white hole theory, it could have taken just a day on earth as the universe expanded!

It is always very sad when this sort of rubbish is put forward as an intelligent Christian worldview! At least the IDS mob have a bit more integrity.As a previous reviewer stated Dr. Humphreys is no ignorant creationist, having received a Ph.D. in Physics from Lousiana State University. this makes it all the more depressing that he can publish such a poorly argued book. However a Phd is no guarantee of sense (I've got one!). Moreover the comment about having had his theory puiblished in the peer-reviewed Technical Journal is disingenuous.

Much of this music -- the major pieces (Fantasia Betica, Cuatro Piezas Espanolas, Allegro de Concierto) -- has been previously recorded gloriously by Alicia de Larrocha. And therein lies the problem with this CD. Weyand simply is not in the same league as de Larrocha when it comes to limning, with utter accuracy, clarity and feeling, the intricacies of the music. At times, indeed, her playing seems tentative, with flabby rhythms, misaligned right and left hands. Sometimes the pianist seems to be on autopilot, and at other times as if she is trying hard simply to get in all the notes.My advice would be to avoid this one.Scott Morrison"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen Jeffreys The Libertine","review":"Fantastic read - this one reads really quick and is quite a page turner.

While waiting for snow/ice that getting these seemed to prevent, I added a velcro strap across the top, because I could see that otherwise, they could come off too easily. As other reviewers stated, definitely don't wear these indoors or on a wooden deck; the cleats will leave marks. They must be put on/taken off outside, which could be inconvenient; hence four stars instead of five. When it finally snowed a month later, for comparison, I first went hiking without them, traveling cautiously over ice, snow, and even a bit of mud. Then I walked the same trail wearing them. I won't go without them again. I could march right through and over every substance in my path, regardless of how slippery it was.

However, the first time I wore them hiking in snow, I lost one within the first half-mile. I didn't notice immediately, though, so I never found it. (They had slipped off other times in not-very-deep snow in my neighborhood, but I had always noticed before and been able to backtrack and find them.) You could probably use rope or something to add an extra strap over the foot, but since I had to buy a new pair anyway, I went with MicroSpikes (more expensive, but much more secure!). I also noticed they were slippery on indoor floors, but you don't want to wear ice cleats inside anyway.For light use, these may be worth $20 - but if you're doing any walking/hiking/running in snow, I prefer more secure cleats with more substantial spikes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous sizing!","review":"The cleats themselves actually look like a good quality product but I would never know for sure as I have returned them 5 minutes after I opened the box! The sizing must be either for sneakers or bare feet lol! There is no way these cleats would fit on a work boot or any type of hunting/pac boot. I ordered the extra large which is supposed to be for size 13+, \\"I wear a size 11.5-12\\" knowing they would be tight as per other reviews and when I tried the product it would not fit on any of my boots. When I finally stretched it over my hiking shoes \\"not boots\\" it still barley fit properly. If you want these for sneakers or light hiking shoes they may work but there is no way to make them work on a \\"man sized\\" foot for ice fishing or work boots. If there is a XXL I don't think it will work out. The boots in the pic must be a size 9 or 10 with an XL size cleat...its that inaccurate.

They give me great traction on paths that I would not be able to run on otherwise. The only drawback that I see compared to other running cleats is that they don't have replaceable spikes, so when they wear down you would have to replace them. But for the few times a year I will need these, they should last me quite a few years anyway, so they are worth the money. The balls of my feet did get a little sore after running 13 miles in these, but I'm guessing that would be the case with almost any ice cleats and may just be related to the way I run, but I would still recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Cleats","review":"The ice cleats fit firmly on my shoes with no problems with them slipping off.

Be especially careful not to wear them on smooth stairs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy on and off","review":"The stabilizers were easy to put on and remove...the added traction facilitated our hike on an icy trail.

I lost count the number of times they came off, but it was at least 6 or 7 times in just 1 1/2 miles of hiking on packed trail snow. That meant that I had to hike basically looking at my feet the entire time to be sure that both were there and I wouldn't have to backtrack to find the missing cleat.Other than that, their performance was adequate on the snow with much better grip on the icy patches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"I bought medium according to the size chat, but they are too small for my size-8 snow boots.

I would recommend buying large if intend to use on snow boots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Got these to do some hiking in the White Mountains. When I put them on, they gave me great grip on the icy trail. However, when it got really steep and dangerous, they just fell off my feet, failing me when I needed them the most. Piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fit problems","review":"The cleats will not stay on your boots, I have size 11 hunting boots and ordered a size large, I had to take decoy line and tie around the boots so they will not fall off. They might be good for easy walking city goers but will not hold up for serious trekking or ice fishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the answer","review":"I was looking for the answer to Yak Traks which always get lost because they won't stay on the shoe. These looked very promising but alas suffer the same fate as most shoe grips. They might be OK walking on a slippery New York street but they're not suitable for serious mountain wear. The grip is very good with these, and the rubber is much sturdier than Yak Traks but poor design gives them a thumbs down. All they need to do is have a simple velcro strap going over the instep and they'd have a winner. They were sized correctly and working on a pair of Sorels, but they slipped off several times during the first few weeks of use and now in under a month I've lost one for good. Waste of money for mountain folks, probably fine for city slickers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wouldn't be without these!","review":"I would not be without these Stablicers.

I bought a small size wearing a 8 in womans and they are snug.. i would recommend going a size up. Both my husband and I don't care for these. They are not comfortable to wear. You feel like you are walking on stilts. However they do grip well. They were cheaper than the higher quality so I suppose we got what we paid for. We recommend put the extra money out for a better quality cleat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ice Cleats","review":"This is the third pair of this particular brand and style of ice cleats. In my opinion they are the best for your shoes and boots when walking on icy surfaces. We live up in the mountains and face some nasty ice each year. Slipping these on my boots allows me to walk on the ice even when water is running down the hill. Trust me without these ice cleats you cannot walk on our walkways and roads. They have been a lifesaver and that is why I have a spare pair in my truck and in the house so I always have a pair handy to slip on my shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Review","review":"Purchased these for the great ice storm of 2012 here in the Seattle area and they did work well. Couple of things; The fit was good and tight on my size 12 boots. It took some manipulation to get them on just right, but once everything was aligned I can't see them coming off by themselves. 2) The cleats are located under the ball of your foot. This was akward for me to get used to for whatever reason. I would have liked the spikes located further forward for my particular taste. 3)These are outdoor only! Want to anger your spouse? Wear these indoors and watch the destruction of your floors and marriage begin. NOT for indoor AT ALL as they will ruin any hard surface you walk on. I would still recommend them as they function as they should in the ice and snow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size 'Large' was too small for my size 10 1/2 sneakers","review":"Already use Spikys for walking in parking lots & sidewalks. The Stabicers didn't fit my size 10 1/2 sneakers, so they definitely would work on the intended hiking boots. Returned them.Get the regular, not 'Lite', Stabilicers (size large) for my size 10 1/2 hiking boots. They not only fit, but did a decent job an easy trail with packed snow & ice; no hiking pole needed.

The stabilizers kept slipping off although they appeared to be a good fit when put on - took some stretching to apply them over the boots. Furthermore, by the time he returned, three cleats were missing. After just one wearing, the rubber was also split on one side. Would not recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good product but maybe a bit small","review":"I've only put these on once so far and they seem like they will do the trick.However the picture shows them in a boot and the sizes are more for your normal tennis shoe.They do fit over the boot but I think in time the rubber will break do to over expansion. My size is 9.5 and they say it will fit to a size 10, but if ordered again I will go 10 to 12 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 1 season","review":"Just got these out since we are expecting snow tomorrow here in the No. Ga. mountains.The rubber on each one has split in two at the main front toe section on each side.

There are many times where I catch myself staring at the problem solution and have to back track to understand how they came up with their answer. The definitions are over-worded and hard to understand. I've had to get online and look up definitions for the laws over and over again because the way they word them, they just don't make sense.

I would have gladly paid twice that for an american product. The steel is as hard as a coffin nail, so he should have a blast in that department. Not a problem if you're patient. The handle has a great feel. The sheath was impressive. It locks up tight and has a velcro button snap. This way vertical carry is no problem.

Secondly I have some problems with the layout and format: 1.) There is no index, so if you want to go to a site, say, to find topaz, you have to flip through the whole book. 2.) Secondly, the book consists of confusing maps of two, three or maybe even only one line with \\"to Clarendon\\" on one end and \\"to Matador\\" on the other end; I'm supposed to be able to picture this within the State by referring to the small inset map of Texas with two crossing geology hammers: alas the hammers are by scale so large that I can't understand what's going on. There are no large maps of areas of petrified wood, topaz or agate; instead there are 75 listed sites within the State of Texas with headings: \\"Cisco fossils,\\" \\"Toyah Agate,\\" \\"Frio River Wood.\\" Some of the sites in the book are areas where rock collecting is prohibited.

In any event, I enjoyed the tough but likable law enforcement officers of Aberdeen, Scotland and the creepy yet engaging crime story in which they move about. \\"Cold Granite\\" also benefits from interesting supporting characters, including an ambitious reporter who keeps getting in the way of the police investigation yet still sort of becomes friends with the central invesitigator, Detective Sergeant Logan MacRae. There's even the occasional romantic scene, between Logan and one of his female officers, to lighten up the dark story from time to time (though the scenes don't so much as depict a romance as Logan's desire for one). I liked the energy and vibrant images of \\"Cold Granite\\", as well as its easy readibility. I'll be sure to look for Stuart MacBride's second offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal; Gory Murders, Foul Language","review":"I found this book very disturbing and hard to take from page 1. There were graphic descriptions of autopsies and horrible murders; nasty perpetrators; sickening scenes; and a lot of foul language. The scenes described in Scottish slang were hard to understand but I caught the gist. I guess I’ll need to avoid the UK murder stories. It had a large number of typos, and missing paragraph separations, so that the action ran together when there should have been a passing of time shown. It does have appeal if you like gore and disgusting murders. Oh, yes, the candy quirk by Insch was annoying and useless.

The writing is clumsy and heavy handed, the characterization is preposterous. It is, however, useful for other writers as a compendium of what not to do. I normally refrain from such criticism, but I bought this book on the strength of the reviews, most of which, in hindsight, sound suspiciously like back page blurbs drafted up by the 'authors' themselves.

The editing is so bad that there are blatant typos in nearly every entry of Wittgenstein's text. There are no notes by an editor or translator, so the reader has no idea who is responsible for this ridiculous butchery of the text. I'm talking about the most basic proofreading here, not about interpretations of the text (I don't read German, so I can't comment about that). For example: \\" If they world had no substance, then whether a proposition had sense would depend on whether another proposition was true (2.0211).\\" They world? \\"It is obvious that an imagined world, however difference it may be from the real one . . .(2.022)\\" -- this kind of thing can't help but distract the reader from the meaning.

The translation is often terribly tacit or outright incorrect. Unfortunately, Seven Treasures seems to be capitalizing on how few editions remain of this work remain in print. This is not a source that should be used for any scholarly work. Hopefully we will see a Blackwell edition comparable to their PI anniversary printing, with the original German text included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typos Are Inexcusable","review":"As others here have said, this edition contains numerous typographical errors.

It's beautiful, but you have to know a bit about symbolic logic to appreciate it. The last few pages are really elegant.

The word \\"hornet\\" connects somehow with the real insect, but, when I try to explain what the connection is, I am left with nonsense--this is the mystic--it is how the world is \\"this is the mystical.\\"He writes only a few lines about God, but I think he acomplishes more than most writers on this subject, since, as he points out in his \\"motto\\": \\"All that a man knows can be said in three words.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition is awful","review":"This edition is horrible. It is peppered with inexcusable typos. Within the first few pages, there are two instances in which it should say \\"though\\" but it says \\"thought\\" instead. If this edition makes blatant errors like that, it will surely fail to deal adequately with the nuances of translating the work into English. DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a dead philosophy","review":"I am a bit surprised at the positive reviews of this book. Obviously, it has a strong historical importance and as such it should be recognized. But it is a stupid, dead philosophy, as Wittgenstein himself later realized. Now, don't get me wrong, there are details (like stipulation), perhaps many details, that Wittgenstein held onto, but the whole was thrown away and considered \\"blind.\\" Thus, when I see reviewers having positive things to say about the big picture (A pun!) of early Wittgenstein, I can't help but think they are very confused or ignorent of the larger whole of Wittgenstein's authorship.Thus, I will say this is an important book. But it is a stepping stone to the later Wittgenstein which is much better philosophy and (heaven forbid!) even phenomenology. Do not just read this book and think it is right. Please read Wittgenstein's own deconstruction of the Tractatus, I mean the Philosophical Investigations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Storage System","review":"The Hyloft is perfect for us, as we have a high ceiling in the garage and lots of things we want to save.

The company, however, needs to make money as well and required me to have at least 4 units to install versus the 2 I bought here. I completely understood, especially given the drive time and fuel costs.The Hyloft system itself is a great way to expand your storage and provide an archival system for things you just can't throw away.I'm very happy I worked through an expert company who installs these daily. It took them less than 2 hours to install 4. They had to drill thru steel to access the wood stud, which was even hard for them.

That said, however, it lacks the one element that sets Hiaasen's other (and better) novels apart from others in this genre--Sick Puppy simply wasn't funny. Whereas Hiaasen's trenchant wit normally breathes life and side-splitting humor into his stories, this one remained flat and predictably formulaic, not to mention overly drawn out. Hiaasen obviously was reaching when the dog became the main character in the middle of the book.We've read every one of his books and eagerly await the arrival of each new one. We hate to say it, but if we had it to do over again, we'd borrow the paperback copy of Sick Puppy from someone rather than buying the hardcover. Better yet, we would reread a funny Hiassen book such as Double Whammy, Skin Tight, or Lucky You."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"This is the fifth Hiaasen book I read and I was really disappointed. I had to force myself to get to the end. The 'heros' in this book were just not likable. I found myself rooting for the so called bad guys by the end. Karl is a great satirist but this book was just to preachy. This Hoot on steroids. He needs to stick to more light-hearted fare like he did with Basket Case (that was one of the best books I've ever read) or Strip Tease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick Puppy","review":"Sick Puppy is the usual mix of kinky villians , odd but well intentioned good guys, level headed women and bizarre supporting characters that we have come to expect and enjoy from this author.In Sick Puppy, the author introduces several new characters and brings back several familiar ones also. Could Twilly be the new Skink? This book is a very fast read and will take your mind off whatever miseries of the day you have endured. You will find yourself smiling for no other reason than the fact that you are enjoying this book. My only regret is that after I am finished reading the book I am left wanting more.

Enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first taste of Hiaasen","review":"It has been a few years since I found Sick Puppy in a thrift store and bought it. The cover was intriguing and the price was right. I was hooked from the very beginning. Since then, I have read every Carl Hiaasen I could get my hands on. Not once have I been disappointed. When friends ask me to recommend a book, Sick Puppy is what I say.

I chuckled and smiled thru the whole thing but there was not really one original concept or character in the whole book. The same thick irony and poetic justice visits the characters in the same old way that it has in the last several books. I hope that Carl Hiaasen is capable of something besides the old \\"I hate Florida developers and Disney\\".

I read \\"Sick Puppy\\" with great enjoyment, but it wasn't the absolute gas that \\"Stormy Weather\\" and \\"Lucky You\\" were. For one thing, the villains in this book were not as equisitely dumb-and-violent as Bode, Chub and Shiner in \\"Lucky You\\". For another thing, Skink came out of his woods in this one, and for me, at least, it didn't really work -- can you really suppose for one minute that a man who was once governor and then disappeared completely would be able to enter the governor's residence completely unnoticed, even if he had changed a whole, whole lot? And finally, the story didn't roar along at quite the same pace as I've come to expect from Carl Hiaasen's books. Again -- I read it with pleasure, and I will pre-order the next one as soon as it comes up on Amazon, but ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"Hiaasen does nothing for over 300 pages but set up straw men so he can laugh as he knocks them down.

Oh, you turn the pages, just to see what ugliness his terrorist hero will get into next. But if you have a brain that actually works, you'll resent having blown any time or money on this piece of litter.

Thought he was kidding with the enviro-nut spin in the 1st 10 pages, but it kept getting worse. The celebrated characters are criminals, and the romantic interlopers are a pair composed of an unbathed deadbeat living off inheritance (obviously wouldn't understand economics) and a cheating wife (who also had not clue about economics).More nauseating than the most left-wing paraphernalia you can buy in the free world (but maybe you could get worse in Cuba or China; maybe France).I can read a book every 1 - 2 nights, but it's been over a week and I can't finish this piece of rot.

Giving Hiaasen the benefit of the doubt on that point (I'm not particularly fond of the gored-by-a-rhino-horn-as-humor genre), I'm having trouble finding a single redeeming quality in this book.Good muckraking is above all realistic. I grew up in Florida. Developers there (anywhere?) aren't known for their commitment to environmental preservation, but this book just reeks of knee-jerk fanaticism. There's as much subtlety here as being hit in the head with a hammer.I couldn't even work up a tear for all the poor little frogs he bulldozed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, very dull and predictable.","review":"I do not understand why people think this author is funny. I have been looking for a really good \\"laugh out loud\\" read, and many people recommended this book and other Hiaasen books. I've read this one and Nature Girl. Neither was funny, and they are set in the same basic setting, Florida. (Really Carl, get the heck out of Florida and experience other places.) The only reason I read the second book was because I thought that maybe Sick Puppy would actually be funny. Dull, dull, predictably boring and blah. The crazy tree hugging lunatic see's a guy throw trash out of his car. Is it really a far or creative stretch to have the same crazy lunatic dump a dumpster full of trash into the littering jerks convertible? I think not. I got more laughs out of reading the Captain Underpants series to my kids.

Unfortunately, this made up only about 40% of the novel. The rest was sex and graphic violence (way too many characters were run over by bulldozers.) There can be some of this in a book, but there was just too much in this one. IF however, lots of sex and graphic violence doesn't bother you, I recommend the book simply to read about Twilly Spree and his anger management issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"GALLANT GALLSTONE REVISITED","review":"NOT FUN.

Could not find anything negative to say about his writing but Sick Puppy is another matter.It just seems more of the same repeated again and again. It does have its amusing moments but they are between countless pages of repetition. If you have read his earlier books, you would know exactly what this book is about and that is normally a good thing, but this time, the characters were a bit dull and the action too drawn out for my tastes.Most disappointing. I will put the book back on my bookshelf and hope that Hiaasen's future books are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild ride!","review":"[...] I appreciate an author who takes his readers on a wild ride. Carl Hiaasen is one of my favorite comedic authors. I have read at least six of his books and I have loved every one of them. While this may not be his best, it is still worth five stars in entertainment value.His humor is satirical and dark. It is outrageous and over-the-top. It is another delightful adventure filled with outlandish characters and scenarios. It kept me laughing most of the way. I gobbled it up like popcorn and it left me wanting more. Thank God, Carl Hiaasen is prolific. He is also consistent regarding the quality of wonderfully engaging humor. Enjoy the ride.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"My intro to Hiaasen","review":"This was my first Hiaasen book and because it I have read everything else that he has written! Yes, the characters are larger than life in many ways, but at the same time they are very real. The story line is crazy. Again from my line of work, truth IS still stranger than fiction. The book is a bit on the crude side with language, but it seems to me to be right on the mark for the characters.Having said all of that, I read fiction to relax and unwind. If I want heavy, uber-realistic plots with in depth character analysis then I would read Dickens or some such. My point is that Hiaasen's books are great fun. I laughed out loud more times than I can remember while reading this book. His plots twist into unexpected directions. Quite simply a very fun read. Sure the language is a bit rough in places, so if you're easily offended, you might want to stay clear, but otherwise this book, as all of his books do, entertained me wonderfully. He is definitely one of my favorite authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snaps to my Father-In-Law...","review":"This book was a really nice surprise for me. I have not read Hiaasen before and was a wee bit sceptical approaching the read as the recommendation to the author came from my father-in-law. It came as no shock that the subject matter included politics. However, I totally enjoyed the cynicism and the natural irony that was wielded with flare over such sordid topics as political deceipt and environmental preservation. I hooted with laughter as the story progressed and became so utterly rediculous that I almost believed it to be true! Honestly, I looked up the World's Most Blood Curdling Emergency Calls to see if they exist. That was too perfect!I laughed. I contemplated. I have even been inspired to look into some of the Florida history so freely discussed. Thanks for a good time Mr. Hiaasen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to chuckle?

It grabbed me right out of the gate, it made me laugh, and it kept me turning the pages. But in the end, I felt ripped off. Not a single major character changed throughout the course of the story.When I read a book, I want to see the main character grow; or at least learn something about themselves or the world around them. 450 pages is a lot of space for an author to make that happen.

The main story is about greed and the over-development of Florida - the stage for all of Hiaasen's books. The book is populated with just about every imaginable character you can find in any book. You've got some good guys who aren't all that good and you've got some bad guys who aren't all that bad - just like real life. The story is funny and tender at the same time. You'll cheer, laugh and cry through some truly funny yet hair-raising adventures that the characters find themselves in. And throughout everything is the sick puppy, which runs, playfully, through the book and manages to make things work out for the better. Hiaasen is a master story teller - this book is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for the price","review":"I got to say I was fairly impressed by how well this works. I tested with just water to clean it out at first and didnt really work, but when it was filled with punch, which is much thicker, the flow was much more steady. You really can't see the lights through anything thick that is colored, so if that is a bif selling point for you, look elsewhere. The \\"cooling ring\\" is basically an ice pack that sits around the main tube and does work pretty well. When I used it I clogged up the little hole in each level with pieces of fruit so the beverage would spill over the sides and used a bunch of those little reusable plastic ice cube things after the original cooling ring started to melt and everything worked well.

Lastly it splatters, and it's alot if you run it for hours. With a sweet drink you will have a sticky residue all over the table and floor. I am ordering a Rival brand that claims it runs quieter.

Specifically it just stopped working after we poured the gingerale in the fountain. While we waited for the soda to get FLAT we used a punch bowl ladle to pour the soda. One other downside is that the fountain splatters/sprays a fine mist of beverage in the air, therefore at the end of the day you will need to wipe table area where it was located really well.

They left it all behind except for Credit Cards which were easily reported stolen...but if I kept cash, or other items of value...they would BE GONE!!!If you would like to see pictures of what it looked like once they got done with it email me and put safe pictures in the subject so I do not miss your request. mthomp7025@aol.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Safe, Lacks ONE THING.","review":"When the safe arrived I was more than pleased, took me three opens before I memorized the 4 digit combination, it feels very rugged and sturdy.

I am very hard woman to please so I know if I enjoyed this book, you will also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time consuming, yet soul soothing","review":"This book is crazily funny! It's very time consuming yet soul soothing. Every character the reader encounters is tied to Vaughn some kind of way. Each character has his/her own personality, which makes the novel very realistic. The southern lingo Author Kenneth Devon Hawkins scripts is directly tied to Louisiana culture. I have friends from bayou areas of the boot shaped state that talks similar to certain characters of this novel. Although the novel is funny, it has a romantic twist also. This book definitely poses a great read. As mentioned earlier, it simply soothes the soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I read the reviews on this book, and could not wait to order and receive it. I was so dissapointed. The storyline was hard to get into because the whole book was dialogue. It was few and far between statements to set the mood and help the imagination.

However, I wish the author much success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Sappy","review":"I admit that I have enjoyed some sappy romance novels (Sandra Brown). I also enjoy science fiction from time to time (Heinlein). However if this was the first romance audiobook I'd ever heard I would never have returned to another. I gave it two stars only because the premise had promise. The story is secondary and reliant on repeated descriptions of passion to fill space. I found the passion unexciting and unwarranted . I have to think this is an early book of Brockman's. I've read at least one other book by her and know she has progressed well beyond this level.I can't recommend this book and find it a bit surprising anyone would. There is so much better out there even for romantics like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring story with a cofusing name","review":"Boring story, and one third of the book is filled with things like \\"you're gorgeous\\", \\"got powerful-looking arms\\", \\"it made him look even more handsome\\".This book's sci-fiction part is just stupid, using the same name as Heinlein's is just ironic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashby's tea - better than I expected","review":"Just came across this tea recently when a co-worker brought it to work.

Topics addressed include natural resources, the commonwealth motto (\\"Joannes Est Nomen Ejus,\\" which means \\"John Is His Name\\"), the capital and capitol building, the flag, etc. One of the more interesting sections is about the cocqui, the tree frog which is considered the island's unofficial animal.What the book lacks, and which would have enhanced it, is a list of famous Puerto Ricans.

You are better off reading the documentation in ColdFusion about components. The examples are very simplistic and do not help to address why and how to use components in real-world applications.There are also dozens of mistakes, including spelling, grammar and in the code examples which often make the examples difficult to follow. The numbered paragraphs are useless and seem to serve primarily as a way to increase the number of pages in the book. (If you do not include the code examples, this book probably contains only about 20 pages of writing.)If you do buy this book, I implore you to skip the \\"Closing Thoughts\\" section which is an imaginary conversation between 3 developers that rambles on for 10 pages yet says nothing of value.I will say the book is aptly titled: it helps you \\"discover\\" CFCs, but it does little to make them useful.

I was surprised to read the mention of Nixon and the Vietnam War as the song was written during the Johnson era and those of us who lived through that time as adults know that Kennedy and Johnson were the Presidents who got us into that.

The no-tool blade release is great except it does not hold the blade securely when in use. When I tried to cut at a 45-degree bevel, the foot plate exposes so much blade it is very dangerous if the blade should ever break. The plate is also difficult to adjust. The rip guide bent when I tried to rip a straight piece. Forget trying to use the rip guide on any bevel. When trying to cut curves, the blade easily comes out of the \\"wheel guide\\" and the blade then bends and wonders off line. The trigger on-off switch is too easily accidently turned on. All in all, I am thoroughly unimpressed with this Skil jigsaw and wish that I had never bought the thing. I thought I was getting a good saw for the reasonable price of $69.00. I guess you do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"a hazard","review":"first of all, like someone already mentioned 2 finger start button is dangerous. second, the blade fell out while i was cutting twice, and i wasn't putting to much pressure on it either. just an accident waiting to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me immensely","review":"I am just now picking up Texas Hold em even though I played for several years using my own intuitions and lost a bundle.

The most useful reference point is probably the early \\"pretty\\" Tim Buckley albums with their florid mix of folk and jazz, but Earth Opera comes off more dainty and less tuneful. And Peter Rowan's voice isn't nearly as powerful or versatile as Buckley's. On the positive side, the clear production and polished, acoustic arrangements make this disc surprisingly undated and easily able to blend in with contemporary \\"freak-folk\\" acts. So, I see potential for this album being re-discovered. And of course, the Grateful Dead fanbase always will be around.

For my future cabinet projects, I plan to use a table saw and miter saw (Given the wasted time and materials, it would have been cheaper to have simply bought more accurate tools(s) in the first place.)

It does cut fairly well though and is comfortable to use. For a circular saw it is fairly accurate and easy to cut straight lines, but just don't adjust it or it will break. The case is also a joke.

Based on reviews and the very interesting/ moving author bio I had big hopes for this one and it fell short. Middleton is clearly a gifted word-master; however, he fails to present a cohesive novel. The book is billed as both quality nature writing and literature, but in reality it exists in the undefined and, thus, unfortunate space between the two. That is, it falls short of, say, Rachel Carson's social portent, but also of the graceful emotive power of Maclean or Hemingway (both of whom also base novels around fly fishing, for whatever that is worth). Let it be said also that this book succumbs to the most consistent flaw of nature writing--it is often effusive. If you just want to read an account of the good ol' days in the rural south where life consisted of witticisms and outdoor activities, then go for it; otherwise, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Is Enough","review":"I picked up this book based on the reviews and would have to say that I was dissappointed. It's a essentially a character piece with the problem being that the writing is overdescriptive to the point of clumsiness. Middleton's style ends up bogging the book down, and with little in the way of plot, this proves disasterous. If you removed Middleton's descriptions of the color of clouds and the sky alone you'd shorten the book by twenty pages. Look for books by authors that practice a little more descriptive economy and don't write like a seventh grader trying desperately to stretch an anemic thought into a 1000 word essay."},{"rating":"1","title":"faux faulkner","review":"In his foreword, Russell Chatham writes, \\"It was shortly after reading Harry Middleton's \\"The Earth is Enough\\" that I made the decision to give up flyfishing.\\"If I'd read the book first, I might never have taken up fly fishing.

Within a few days of being in the box all my documents had gotten damp, and unsealed envelopes had gotten moist and sealed themselves. I tried adding additional desiccant packs, but that didn't help. I called Honeywell and they said they were aware of the problem and they recommended opening the box up and airing it out at least once a month, which just wasn't convenient for me. I had the box stored in a closet, which Honeywell said is known to increase the problem, but as it's a rather large box there aren't a lot of places it fits conveniently in my small apartment. I returned the box to Amazon. The inside storage space was sufficient, though the box itself is rather large. The lock mechanism seemed fine, but I don't think the box is built for high security - more for fire resistance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and roomy","review":"There's a good amount of heft to this safe, which leads me to think it would hold up fairly well in the event of fire. Luckily, I have not had to test it's durability in fire or waterproofness (and hope I never will).There's plenty of room for several important documents and a handful of jewelry. At about 20 lbs it's not something you'd want to move around all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"The lock fell out and broke on this after less than a month. It was cheap plastic and not worth getting at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOLD everywhere","review":"This is a terrible product. Despite putting a dessicant in with my passport and other documents, when I opened the box a few months later they were all COVERED with mold. I live in a dry climate and the box was stored in a dry area (not a damp basement), so how the mold formed is beyond me. But it happened, and it looks like it happened to many other people.Additionally, the locking mechanism is plastic, giving it a very short lifespan in a fire.Considering how much mold was on the inside of this box, I laugh thinking how it would hold up in a flood.I encourage you to spend your money on a better product; this one is too much of a risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible -- everything wet and moldy","review":"I bought this safe in Feb 2009 and placed all my important documents in this safe -- I opened it today to see brown mold on everything and everything is wet.

Product is great, when paired with any dessicant, as moisture trapped inside the safe will bead onto any items you might have. Silica packs absorb water rendering this one of the best safes for the money. Be sure to open at least once every two weeks to let your items \\"breathe\\" so to speak. Otherwise the water seal makes a sort of suction that makes it difficult for the safe to open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible box - Turns everything moldy.","review":"I put my money collection and other money in this box and it got mold on it.

Are you serious? I did not read the instructions to a simple safe, if I would have I would have taken it back. Do not buy this safe unless you want to open and air it out for 20 minutes every two weeks. Spend some extra cash and get a real safe. Good luck dealing with the manufacturer, they don't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE!!!","review":"As the previous reviewer \\"BillyJack\\" stated, this is an awful product!!

I am hoping that I can salvage some of these items. There's nothing really more disheartening than seeing certificates, legal papers and irreplaceable photos and memorabilia ruined by mold in a waterproof safe.

They look great and feel comfortable at first but I've had some of the same problems described by another reviewer. I have average size feet and I normally don't have problems with shoes I buy online so I'll guess that there's something wrong with the shoe itself. The sides are definitely too high at the ankles.It fits well up front but then it gets almost a full size bigger towards the heel and it's hard to keep the shoe on when walking fast. I tried wearing thicker socks and it was too tight in the toe area so I bought some insoles. They didn't help either. I really like this shoe so I haven't given up yet. I'll continue experimenting with other insoles. I'll post here if I find the right one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading!","review":"Factual and very informative.

Schoenberg wrote this over a period of years, beginning before his transition to atonal music. Gurre-Lieder dabbles in dissonances, but is, for the most part a massive dramatic work that's easy to listen to and enjoy. This recording has great balance of the ensemble allowing the listener to clearly hear everything they should. The insert includes the text of the songs, which unfortunately are only in German. This piece is more entertaining if you understand the words that are being sung, so this is unfortunate."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok but not the best book out there","review":"I gave it four stars but it was really more like 3 1/2 stars.

I have read multiple books written by women and one man who have escaped the sometimes horrific lives they were born into. I accepted the amaturish writing style as part of the deal. This story did keep my interest but the quality of writing was mediocer at best and at point the storyline made me groan outloud. The main character Alli went through so many horrible things but I had a hard time liking her because she was so full of herself. w ith the boatload of baggage she carried every man that crossed her path fell in love with her.

Not to mention that he is not very similiar to DJ Shadow: sure, they both construct hip-hop based music from diverse samples, but RJD2 is admittedly more hip-hop, in small measure because of the appearance of three MCs on three songs. Of these, \\"June\\" featuring Copywrite is the best one: not only is his verse touching (a tribute to his dead father, who died in the month Write was born in), but the instrumental interlude is sublime, with classical guitar and synth. The other standouts include the opener \\"The Horror\\", with its addictive, menacing synth line that sounds like an alien invasion, and \\"2 More Dead\\" - not the gangsta workout you'd expect. No, it didn't \\"change the world\\" as El-P claimed, but it is a fine album on its own accord."},{"rating":"1","title":"dead ringer is pretty dead","review":"turntablism is a genre with a lot of room for innovation, its a shame that so many artists choose to box themselves into the cliches which make it so boring these days. and after reading like a billion reviews calling this the genres resseruction, ive got to say its a disappointment. even more so coming off the totally awesome def jux label which really has done no wrong outside of this. dull, derviative, had this album been released in 96 it wouldve been a masterpiece, released today its nothing more than a car commercial. buy the dj rupture album if you want something new. but if you dont go back and listen to some dj shadow, dead ringer is basiclly the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"why the shadow comparism?","review":"This is a really poor cd. I really can't understand why all the reviews here are comparing this record to Endtroducing by DJ SHADOW. This doesn't even come close. I also can't see how the reviewers are putting Moby and Dj Shadow in the same sentence. These are two completely different styles of music, one also being a lot cooler than the other. I really wouldn't read the other reviews. There are a couple of promising moments where you think something exciting could develope, but this never happens. The beats are boring, and samples poor too. The hip-hop tracks on the album too seem unimaginative and boring.so all in all, steer clear. If you want intereting hip hop, get cLOUDEAD or early BLACKALICIOUS. If you want some amazing instrumental hip hop, check out either of JEL's releases or ODD NOSDAM.

This CD seems like a damn \\"party mix\\" more then anything. DJ Shadow's mixes are dark, moody, and have feeling.

RJD2 and Shadow arn't even in the same playing field if you ask me.I would reccommend Shadow anyday over this guy.

(anyone want to buy mine?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"So it's not Dj shadow, who cares","review":"Point is, if you're looking for Dj Shadow, get the new shadow cd. This is Rjd2's production and he does it lovely. I feel this is a really soulful album, his intrumentation on tracks like \\"Ghostwriter\\" is amazing. I think its unfair to compare RJ to Shadow, almost like a double standard. If you like funky uptempo stuff that rocks, this cd is for you. If you in for some moody darker stuff get some Boards of Canada.Also, all other producers should take note, pushing this underrated sampling artform and paying attention to detail, instead of blatantly ripping some recognized riff as \\"hiphop\\" samples are done today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Rjd2 is nice, but a number of his songs tend to follow a very similar run down chord progression, and there's the feeling that some of the songs didn't sound all that different in their original non-sampled form, more so on this album, less so on the following. (Which granted could be taken for masterful sample blending, but i think not.) Though, they're good songs. If i were to rate them on their production/sampling originality, i'd have to go 3 stars, but i'm going to rate them on their good songness factor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brand New Retro","review":"Just when we were asking where music is heading and how will it sound in future,will it be more digital and more artificial, RJD2 came up with the answer.This is the sound of the future.Retro packed in brand new suite - that's it.Funky hip-hop beats with eclectic melodic (never too old) samples.Sounds like hiphop/breakbeat remix of early 20th century music.RJD2 designed the suite that will fit all sizes and all tastes.It's unique and universal.A Must Have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you rate a staple?","review":"These staples were purchased with a stapler that uses this type of staples.

I can honestly say I have never had a problem with these particular staples. They fit the stapler, they staple things together and the price here is relatively cheap and the shipping is relatively fast.

Some of the pictures are good, but there aren't nearly enough, with the vast majority of the conditions going pictureless.My advice is to pay a little more and purchase the baby Fitzpatrick's color atlas & synopsis of dermatology.

If you're expecting epic plotlines, you will be disappointed--each episode or group of episodes is a \\"day in the life\\" of the mercenary Bolt Crank, with no overall story arc. However, the standalones are quite good, and reveal a little bit more about Bolt's character each time. Ultimately, the series focusses on \\"ain't Bolt cool?\\" If you agree, you'll have fun--but if you don't, you'll be screaming about the tenth time he calmly walks in to save the day, accompanied by an appropriate theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!","review":"I was really looking forward to this 2 set DVD collection of Eat-Man '98, but was horribly disapointed! There are so few cells of animation in this series, you feel as if you are watching a slide show! Pan's and zooms on average pics is not animation.... I hat to sound too harsh, but I was watched over 300+ anime videos, and would classify this as one of the worst 10 when it comes to money's worth..... DO NOT BUY THIS DVD SET!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague","review":"Eat-Man 98 is a vaguely interesting series. The show is made of short story arcs, ranging from mildly entertaining to downright ridiculous or boring. The animation is average and the music selection is nothing special. The only thing that kept me interested was Bolt Crank's character who remains a mystery till the end. His motivations were unclear which I found more intriguing than irritating. Bolt Crank could be a much more interesting character if the anime had better storylines and direction. Not recommended but worth a peek if you enjoy the strong silent characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good western!","review":"I found this book to be quite good. The story was good, with a lot of color to it. Nice characters and small plot twists that made it really interesting.Perhaps the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that I couldn't relate entirely with the main characters. The hero was a little selfish for my taste and the heroine's insecurities were not really believable.

Pearl was too good to be true, Drake's character was ill-defined, and there needed to be better editing and proofing."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY, REALLY BAD","review":"I am always looking for a good western romance and bought this based upon the reviews. After having finished it, I wondered if I read the same book as the other reviewers. This book was awful. The heroine is the typical virginal saint seen in the older romance novels - she is nice to all sorts of downtrodden invididuals and animals. The hero is the cliched man with a tortured past. The book is so poorly written that the very premise (man marries unsuitable woman to thumb his nose at his family)is not believable.

Considering Becker and Fagen's legendary anal retentiveness this doesn't make sense. Answer: is twofold. Money and Cynicism. The two motivating forces driving all the major labels.

I should really try some of their newer stuff too (the singles sound great)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throw back the little ones........","review":"... and pan-fry the big ones... This record showcases B&F at their finest. The songs are intricately and subtly arranged, with the piano really being given the spotlight on most of the album's tunes. Examples that immediately come to mind are 'Bad Sneakers', 'Doctor Wu', the memorable electric piano solo in 'Everyone's Gone to the Movies', and of course the great little album-ending coda at the end of 'Throw Back...'. The guitar also gets it props (as usual wih the Dan), as heard on 'Chain Lightning'. And of course the biting lyrical sarcasm is ever-present -- too many classics to quote. This album is slightly more mellow than, say, Royal Scam, but a little more adventurous sonically/ melodically than Pretzel Logic. One can hear this disc as the step in evolution between those two records.... Maybe not the record that will convert you, but a must-have for any Dan-fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands Up 35 Years Later","review":"What is there to say? KATY LIED endures over all these years.

After listening to it, I'm sure you'll agree this Album sums up there earlier efforts and paves the way for thier next generation of more 70's Fusion-like aspirations. The next album, \\"The Royal Scam\\" has that transistion completed. This effort therefore stands alone, in that it hints to the future in sound and style, echos to the past in the materials construction and overall direction, while doing what this band does best, making excellent tunes. Quite often, with groups from the seventies, transitional efforts like this one, are left in a finished, but incomplete state. Not so here! This album reveals their musical genius with some fantastic material,and paves the way for their future efforts as well.

Recorded around a transitional lineup that included Mike McDonald and Jeff Porcaro Katy Lied also marked the emergence of Donald Fagen as one of the leading vocalists in the rock world. Now only a part time keyboard player (getting major help on this lp from Vic Feldman and Michael Omartian) Fagen jumps full force into the 'Katy Lied' project with vim and vigor. Katy Lied also marks the emergence of Walter Becker as a prominent lead guitarist and includes stellar contributions from Denny Dias, Rick Derringer and jazz great Phil Woods, whose haunting solo on 'Doctor Wu' ranks among the great moments in 'Dan history. Again the CD remastering is suberb and brings to light much of the audio skullduggery undertaken by engineer Nichols and producer Katz.....'Katy Lied'...a tour de force!

It takes up very little room and does the job well every time.Just use the staple remover on the front or top of the staple (the part that is smooth and not the side of the staple that has two edges to it). This should be on the top of the documents that have been stapled together. Use this device to grab hold of the staple using the steel jaws and simply pull up or away from the pages. There you go! The staple comes loose or comes all the way out the first time--and your pages are no longer stapled.This nifty little product is sure to do its job well--if you catch a sale, stock up for your other office workers if you need to do so.

The percussion sound leaves a bit to be desired as well. I have been seeing and listening to moe. since '96 and have way better sounding tapes and CD's of live shows than this one. In my opinion, moe. can do away with the audience microphone mix and just stick to the soundboard, or turn down the levels on the mics in the mix. Volume 2 is a bit better, but for The Tabernacle in Atlanta, it is way below par (judging by what I have heard released by other bands at this same venue).The show in Volume 1 is stellar, but if you want great sound, you won't find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first show of the series","review":"I have been listening to a audio version of this show since 2-28-01.

I was driving in my car when it came on. I knew immediately from the style that it was Kenny G. (Thank you, Amazon, for quick delivery!) Goosebumps, tears, lumps in my throat, smiles, nostalgia, sadness, hope, gratitude and appreciation for how very blessed we are, especially in this country -- all these emotions welled up during this amazing creation. The rest of the album is wonderful. But I bought it for this one song. And it's worth it for this one song alone. My thanks to Kenny G for a song that will no doubt touch the hearts, minds, and souls of millions -- in a way that I hope and pray will make all of us strive to love better, to work with more passion, and to give thanks to those who have gone before us, and to those whom we have the privilege of living and loving today."},{"rating":"1","title":"People like this stuff?","review":"ive been playing sax for 5 or 6 yrs and have tried to play along with his cd's. most of his pieces are written in easy keys. he just takes old favorites and jazzes them up. if u really like true sax music instead of kenny g junk, try listening to the glazunov concerto or creston sonata, or maybe milhaud's scaramouche or maurice's tableaux de provence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the Key of G","review":"Have been a great fan of Kenny G so rushed out to get his new holiday album..The arrangments for this album are not up to par with any of Kenny's work.

I'm nimble-fingered, but I found it pretty damn hard to pry free one of these staples without dropping it, push it through the stack of papers with my fingers, and then bend the little metal arms down to hold it in place. Ended up poking a hole in my thumb a couple of times.Well, it turns out that there's a catch to this product. If you really want the staples to work well, you have to go back out and buy a STAPLER to put them in. I'm not sure I'm ready to shell out the extra bucks for one of those, though, so I'm going to see if I can't improve my manual technique with a little more practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the job but cuts the letter's contents too frequently.","review":"I had hoped this would help opening the volumes of business mail we get daily.

You didn't have to like the film to aprreciate the sheer genius of the soundtrack. If you liked the soundtrack then check out Seu Jorge's CD \\"Carolina\\" it's beautiful.

It is a very different, original and fresh TV show, very different from any other movie or TV show I've seen. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 1","review":"A weird show about a controlled serial killer. Dexter is not realistic but it has relatively good acting and some suspense. I actually find it much less offensive than the usually serial killer movies, TV shows, and books. The first season has a theme which moves in the opposite direction of the first season of Breaking Bad. In Breaking Bad, Walt goes from being a normal law abiding guy to a manufacturing meth and killing. Dexter goes from a unfeeling killer to a killer (of only those who deserve to die) to someone who experiences at least some emotion.Overall, I think the first season is interesting and worth watching. I don't know that I will make it through the next four or five seasons. Compared to the usually TV show, Dexter is much better than The Shield (totally unrealistic), any of the CSI shows, or Law and Order. It isn't as good as the Sopranos or The Wire. I recommend it but really wish Showtime or HBO would do another realistic crime series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody","review":"Bloody.

Dexter Morgan is a blood spatter analyst for the Miami crime lab who moonlights as a special kind of serial killer. Dexter pursues his real passion (killing) while still trying to fit in with the real world, including managing personal relationships that he's not capable of understanding. The show has suspense, tension, pathos, and a lot of dark humor. The writing in this is fantastic, the acting, especially by Michael C. Hall, is first-rate, and the first season's held together by a great plot line. But, if blood spatter, gore, and a lot of moral ambiguity is a turnoff, this isn't the show for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious Escapism","review":"Michael C. Hall does deliver a compelling, disturbingly simpathetic performance in this highly entertaining and inventive TV Series.Writing is as sharp as Dexter's knife, the stories are tight, and the characters, three-dimensional. Not once does the series underestimate its audience. That is a rarity in the field nowadays!!And unfortunately, we live in a world where it wouldn't be overreacting to ask for more Dexters - that is, asking for the existence of more killers.... of killers. Violence is everywhere we look and watching Dexter is this sort of delicious escapism where the 'bad guys' are in for a treat.Highly recommended, but its grisly nature won't appeal to everyone. If you're not into blood, this series isn't for you - and too bad, you don't know what you will be missing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I ordered a tv season and was sent the wrong one.

This product is falsely advertised. You are not buying YOUR DISCS; you are buying Showtime's advertising. SHAME AMAZON"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Wrong With Me???","review":"I bought the DVD set of the 1st Season of this show due primarily to the glowing comments of Amazon reviewers. I watched the first two episodes of last night and must confess to being a bit bewildered. What is so entertaining about a sociopath mass murderer who brutally tortures his victims as he decapitates them alive or chops off their limbs? What on earth is entertaining about a protagonist who nearly has an orgasm over the idea of another serial killer who is even more clever and sadistic than he? I really tried to give this series a chance, but I found it mind-numbingly sick!! I can't find much of socially redeeming value in this work. it really doesn't matter to me if the victims of Dexter are bad guys - his way of killing them is so barbaric that I find my sympathies leaning solidly toward his victims. But, of course, the problem could just be with me - maybe I have too soft a stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken disc 2","review":"love the series, however, the second disk was broken. have not contacted amazon concerning this, since there is no returns on dvd's. help... amazon, want to send me disc 2?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in Mexico CRAP","review":"I wanted to buy the first season of Dexter so that I could finally catch up on what all the fuss is about. I love this series however the copy of this series is CRAP! Its made in mexico stamp on the front distracted me at first but once I started watching it, the quality is awful. Fuzzy picture, sometimes scrabbles, picture is grainy. Will never buy a movie from amazon.com again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter Season 1","review":"Watched entire season, discs were in excellent conidition. Still in original package when it arrived at my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent show, typical cheap Showtime DVD transfer.","review":"Dexter is the best thing on television today, but the DVD release is marred by the fact that Showtime continues to release heavily over-compressed DVDs that look like they were transferred to VHS then copied to DVD. It does look good on my old low-def 7 year old TV, but it's blurry, choppy and has a considerably annoying combing effect on my PC. It's not as bad as Huff (which is nearly unplayable on my computer), but pretty much every other DVD I own plays and looks great on it.I give the show a definite 5-star rating, but the horrible Showtime transfer gets a big fat zero. What were they thinking?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new type of drama","review":"Most dramas resolve into a limited number of different plot types. This, to my knowledge, is new. The main character, evil and inhuman, but with good motives, has to outmanuver all the good characters--his friends and coworkers. This creates a dynamic I have never seen before, and it is pulled off by what I think is the best group of actors in any drama on television. In lesser hands, it could be either campy or over-dramatic. There are about seven really good actors on this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"I havent gotten into a tv show in over five years. Ive been pretty bummed about that too, then someone recommended this to me and I havent stopped watching! Im now watching the third season on tv. This show is so wonderful and awesome, you wont be able to turn your tv off! Give it a chance! The guy from Six Feet Under is back and sexier than ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars!","review":"I love this show. The acting is good, but the script and story are amazing! It is a bit gruesome, that never bothered me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter is worth buying","review":"Dexter - The First SeasonDexter, the First Season is one of the most interesting, bizarre, sick, twisted, amazing shows that I've seen in a long time. The character development of Dexter is interesting to see, as this serial killer who kills serial killers appears to start to have actual feelings. His whole life, he's been faking it, with the skills his adopted father taught him.This show leaves you feeling something each time, sometimes its just pure entertainment, but more often, you are left with a gut reaction of repulsion or sorrow, but always wanting more. The only thing I would say is that if you're watching multiple episodes back to back, you need a sorbet before going to bed, otherwise the dreams you may have are completely whacked.I can't wait for Season Two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done!","review":"Excellent. Didn't think it would be as good as it turned out to be. Heard about it on the radio and figured I would give it a shot.Plot got a little thin in some spots. Very few though.Highly recommend to people that like a smartly written show with a dark sense of humor.I'll be buying season two.This is based on the first season. Will do another review after seeing all of season two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter Delivers","review":"This is a great series, made all the better by Michael C. Hall as the eponymous anti-hero. Without him, the series might have floundered; a lesser actor may not have walked the delicate tightrope between murderous and magnanimous with the same masterful balance. The series is well written, with a very cleverly conceived title sequence, but it truly is the reliable performances which make this show. Highly recommended (especially for those who love themselves a bit of Michael C. Hall)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Good Fun","review":"Very interesting show about a forensic blood specialist with some secret extracirricular activities. Michael C. Hall is brilliant as Dexter Morgan, a sociopath with a conscience. A killer with a code. The writing is very clear and sharp, and the supporting cast is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly ingenious film entertainment, extremely well written, brilliant, fun actors","review":"Thank goodness for Dexter, the first serial (get it?) show I've found fills the hole vacated by Tony and the gang from North Jersey. Start from the beginning and you'll fall in love with Dexter, his beloved and brilliantly hilarious and crass sister Deb, and the cast and crew that is so fantastic, ... they're delicious. I've had so much fun watching this show that I wonder if its just me, or am I crazed to find this show so enjoyable despite its crass and crude subject matter. But there's so much truth to this show, ... we all wear a mask, and we all act out, ... it's just what's acceptable versus what's not that begs the question.Check this out, ... Dexter is brilliant, I can't wait for more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant show! Michael C. Hall is a real talent.","review":"I was a big Six Feet Under fan and was anxious to see what Michael C. Hall's next project was going to be. Dexter is a fitting follow up to showcase Hall's brilliant acting skills. He manages to make the impossible possible by giving a serial killer likable qualities that create a sympathy for his \\"hobby.\\" We've all seen the worst of the worst escape justice and hoped they would get theirs in the end. Dexter feeds that dark place that wishes the guilty who are acquitted get what's coming to them. The ice truck killer plot was just mind blowing and I didn't see the ending coming. This series is amazing and would be a killer addition to your DVD collection. (Insert collective groan...sorry!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"love to see justice done on the bad guy, but too greusome, and he likes it.. not for me anyway"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Picture quality","review":"I bought Dexter based on the good reviews and on the DVD I ordered from Amazon, the picture is barely watchable. The picture is blurry and completely lacking in sharpness you would expect from a DVD. I cannot watch past the first episode due to the poor quality of the DVD transfer. I would not recommend this DVD based on the picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest shows ever","review":"There are few shows that can grab a person into them, but Dexter is one of them. I would tell any one to watch this show. It is about a killer that works for a police department as a blood splatter analysis. He only kills murders and lives by a strict code in order to kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome service","review":"This was sent out the same day I placed the order and received it just a few days later! The 1st season was amazing and I've now boughten the 2nd & 3rd season & I am now waiting for 4 to be released. A must see show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter: Born in Blood","review":"The first season of Dexter is an absolute gem. Introducing you to Dexter Morgan, a morally bound serial killer with an intriguing past (who happens to work for the Miami police department), the first season of this show takes you on an addictive journey into the mind of an atypical murderer with a persuasive point of view. Though dark in nature, the show has a great sense of humor and a cast that grow on you almost instantaneously. Give this show a chance, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"I bought this for my wife - she likes it ... I think the show it utter stupidity! Why they make movies, shows like this is beyond me. No wonder our society if so messed up. Dexter, The walking Dead all need to be banned! It provides ideas for people to do crazy unthinkable things."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best shows ever!","review":"Dexter is a good example of why TV these days becoming superior to film. It's a fantastic show and it's nice to actually own the first season on disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous show...one of the best ever made...","review":"I read the first book, Darkly Dreaming Dexter, which was amazing, and that prompted me to check out Season 1 from our local library. It was even better than the book..Michael C. Hall is perfection in this role and every one of the 12 episodes in this first season was riveting. I am totally hooked and look forward to watching Seasons 2-5 which are available also through our library. Yes there is some violence, but not really like you see in extreme slasher films. Much of the actual killings are implied with the scene cutting away right at the awful moment so it is not TOO graphic....considering that that main character is a serial killer focused on catching another serial killer throughout the twelve episodes.If you haven't given Dexter a watch yet, you won't be disappointed. He's really quite likable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked me from the start","review":"I'm not a fan of the CSI-esque shows. Don't get me wrong; I was a big fan of them before I earned a degree in the subject matter, and the techniques used in the show became too silly to enjoy. I picked Dexter up on a whim because I am a fan of Michael C. Hall's. The show snagged me from the start and hasn't let me go.The constant character study that takes place in the show is amazing and it's what keeps me watching. I've always been fascinated in psychology, and Dexter constantly explores himself, his need for killing, and the pseudo-personality front he paints to keep people from picking up on his \\"dark passenger.\\" It's tastefully done and very believable.Analyzing what makes a hero out of a serial killer, or a serial killer out of a hero is truly enthralling. I definitely suggest Dexter to anyone who's tired of Horatio. This show's got what it takes, and Michael C. Hall pulls it off without a hitch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I never would have thought I would enjoy a show like this. WOW...what a show. Honestly, I could do without the foul language and the nudity and in most cases such would cause me to go elsewhere. But this show is one of the BEST crime drama's I've ever seen. The main character, Dexter Morgan, is one of the BEST lead characters ever. The supporting cast of characters (everyone from his sister to girlfriend(s) to the many police officers) are all excellent as well. But wow...the story is soo good! It just pulls you in and keeps you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk on the wild side","review":"started watching the 4 latest episodes because several co-workers are crazy about this show and talk about it frequently. One fan said to watch years one and two and I would catch up. Was hooked and am looking forward to the rest up til this year. It is interesting because it is such a dfferent topic from all the other crime and comedy shows. It is very dark and the writing keeps you guessing and allowing one to come to several different conclusions about the action. I find that so many shows on the pay per view channels have this quality and more freedom to explore off the wall themes. I can say that this show sometimes gives me the creeps, especially the opening sequence starting with Dexter killing an insect on his arm. I fast forward this intro. This does not deter me from watching the rest of the shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This show left nothing to be desired. It was a completely original idea and very well-done. Dexter is surprisingly relatable."},{"rating":"2","title":":) dexter dexter dexter.","review":"this is my absolute favorate show on television. It catches your attention then just drags you in. I love phycological things like this im a big fan of ted bundy, and the river man. but dexter is diffrent exciting and embracing. I have never been so hooked on a show!It gives you chills, makes you laugh, makes you feel heartwarmed, and makes you feel hatered. It is the ultimate combintation all put into one amazing show. i can't wait for season 4 :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Original!","review":"Dexter Season 1 is an excellent show. It is a great blend of drama and black comedy. I watched this show in almost marathon fashion and couldn't wait to see Season #2. Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously Disturbing","review":"Dexter is great. Shocking and impossible to look away. The writers did a good job of injecting Dexter with his own brand of dark humor about what he does. It's always interesting to see who he selects as a victim and how it fits in with the larger story."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Die For","review":"Must say that Dexter is one of the best crime drama's in the media today. It's full excitment and Dexter actually has you feeling for him as a serial killer. I tend to support Dexter's killings as he only killed guilty people who have done horrible things, those who he kills do not deserve to be alive. Also the Forensic Blood Spatter information given through the show is quite ture unlike CSI. I rate Dexter very close to Prison Break as they are related in emotion. If you like crime drama's this is the best you'll ever get..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter","review":"We loved it. Loved the star from SIX FEET UNDER and knew he would be great in this. Another show where you are pulling for the bad guy. LOL......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood splatter","review":"Reading the story line is why I purchase the movie. I thought it would be simular to Criminal Minds but it does not come anywhere close. I can understand Dexter\\"acting\\" as he does because he is suppose to not have any feelings, but the other characters have no excuse for their poor acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't beat me up for my faux pas...","review":"But I am rating the error in what we watched...the picture is right...the title is wrong...Love American Style? Really? Okay and $2.99 meant I found an alternative real quick to view the remainder of the Dexter Series...which we love. At one time it was represented that Prime members got a reduced price, but I guess that is over...I did get a penny off. So yeah, my rating is basically about Amazon here and I usually voice my disapproval when others complain by using the star system for their beef..."},{"rating":"1","title":"dexter","review":"I never actually got to watch it.

You can not be disappointed with Season 1 of Dexter, that is for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite series","review":"I would say Dexter is my favorite series. If I could only pick one series, it would be 24 or Dexter. The first season was darker, more gory and generally a bit more depressive than the other 3 seasons, but it was necessary to develop the character. The first season also has a bit of the off-beat humor that typifies this show. If you've never seen Dexter I highly recommend it. Other shows currently playing that I watch: 24, The Office, Fringe, Eureka."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"After reading the story line, I was cringing to watch this serial at first. But, was pleasantly surprised to see no yucky stuff. Good story, very well directed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show!","review":"Doesn't follow the books word for word, but the interpretation for the at-large audience is very good.

Seriously\\"--The motto for this show sums the premise well. More than just about a vigilante serial killer and his crimes, this show analyzes and at times, mocks the inner Freudian Id in all of us...the darkness of human nature. I can't believe that the writer, Melissa Rosenberg is the same writer who wrote the screenplay for cheesy teen flicks like \\"Twilight\\" and \\"Step Up\\". She obviously found her niche here. As other reviewers have stated, this is the best Showtime series yet. I'm usually not a fan of crime fiction, but I'm definitely a fan of Dexter. Excellent cast choice, acting, and writing. To those who think the premise is hokey, first of all this is fictional entertainment. Secondly, there are parallels to real serial killers such as the famous Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Showtime Series Yet","review":"Very addictive show,best series since the sopranos.I had never seen the show just heard a lot about it so I purchased it and man was it great.Strongly recommend to anyone.I'm not a CSI fan by any means but this adds a certain twist that makes it so much more.Every episode will have you dying to see the next.Simply great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome show","review":"I heard about this from a friend at work my wife and I are always looking for a great series to watch.She and I try to find something that has been out a few years so we can buy the seasons and not have to wait a week to see what happens.

Usually they screw it up, whether it be Hollywood big screen adaptations of the Sci-Fi channel - they all usually suck eggs.But not Showtime! They are currently way better than HBO. With the richness of feel and look at the miami-based Dexter, the actors and writers here truly shine above most others of all arenas of television and/or Box Office standards.And the 2nd season thus far is just as good - if not better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky...

The only other series I have ever boughten is Band of Brothers and that was really a mini-series.This is good stuff. It is intelligent, sarcastic, sexy, vulnerable, justifiable and you laugh at the narrative and some of the dry humor that goes on. There are very contrasting characters set up. A good guy serial killer series basically in a nutshell.I watched the second series too and enjoyed that enough to buy the 3rd season.For me, I rent other movies on the weekend and when I was watching the 2nd season, I would not take the time to watch my rented movies because I wanted to watch Dexter instead. It will suck when I run out of episodes to watch.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy but captivating!","review":"One show got us hooked! If you have the stomach for it, this is one of the best shows to watch. The character development and story lines are written wonderfully. It is a pleasure to be entertained by good writing and fantastic acting. I liked Michael C. Hall in Six Feet Under, but I think his performance as Dexter is even better. The 12 episodes in Season 1 offer a fluency that most series do not. It tells a complete story and leaves just enough of a \\"cliff-hanger\\" to make you anxious for Season 2.The characters are developed and you sympathize with each of them...even the cold-blood killer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter Season 1","review":"I purchased Season One of Dexter and I'm enjoying every second of it.

I love Michael Hall and have loved him since Six Feet Under. It was hard to see him as a straight man in this serious for an episode or two and then I got used to it. That was the only hitch but not anyone's fault. People write horrible reviews for Dexter because their sense of morality feels to be in jeopardy by watching it. Its a great show. Depth, cliffhanger suspense, peril, gritty insight into each character as the seasons pass, unexpected twists. You really cant get better television than you get with Dexter. By far my favorite show ever put on the screen. Blu ray is definitely worth the extra few dollars as it is masterfully done both in sound quality and picture clarity.

I was a bit wary about the premise of the show,though--a forensic crime professional who commits murders???? WEll, i bought the first season and watched it practically nonstop !!!! I haven't been so entertained by a show in years! Michaels character is beyond quirky in many respects, and his acting is superb,as usual! Shocking,funny and offbeat.....love it! There arent many gross scenes ,either...jsut a spattering of blood here and there.....i recommend it to anyone who has a any sense of humor and enjoys and appreciates something original--with offfbeat peculiar characters....Kudos to the writers of the show ,also!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick, Twisted, and Amazing!","review":"I discovered Dexter a few years after the series' original debut, but instantly fell in love! Once I watched the very first episode of Dexter: The First Season, I simply could NOT stop watching! I may have even watched the entire first season in one day. Watching Dexter struggle with his \\"Dark Passenger\\" and his serial killer tendencies is absolutely enthralling. You never stop rooting for Dexter, even when he's cutting people into little pieces... after all, he's a hero, AND a serial killer! An unlikely combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly Delicious!","review":"I LOVE this show. Some bits are a little too graphic and gorey for me, but it doesn't stop me from watching.

Yes the subject matter is a bit macabre, (socially acceptable serial killing) but I can't wait to see the next season. Dexter is one of the best dramatic series I've ever seen. Michael C. Hall is totally believable as a blend able monster stalking his twisted prey at night in the streets of picturesque Miami. And before you know it you find yourself secretly cheering for Dexter. Given the level of violence roaming the streets of our nation, it's refreshing to imagine the hunters being hunted and put down; subsequently, protecting our loved ones. The reason I gave it four stars instead five, is because I went back thru the series to watch the episodes along with the commentary, only to find that only a few episodes had additional commentary; which was disappointing. Aside from that the series was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the books","review":"I was disappointed by the books that inspired this series - the premise of a serial killers serial killer was different, but I felt that the writing/stories failed to live up to the potential. However, changing the medium to television creates a much better product. The supporting characters that are somewhat flat in the books are vibrant, alive, and almost as interesting as Dexter. The theme drifts from the nature of good and evil, to what makes us human, and the story takes on new life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick, Perverse and Sadistic","review":"The best words to describe the show . . . sick, twisted, perverse, and sadistic. As America's fascination with sadism and death grows, so does our hunger to watch executions and gawk at grizzly car crash victims. Then, people who flock to \\"art shows\\" full of mutilated corpses and take sadistic pleasure in growing more sympathetic with a serial killer watch their evening news and wonder what's wrong with everyone else and how this world got so sick and twisted. If you aren't fascinated at the prospect of watching Internet videos of beheadings or snuff films for family entertainment, then you won't like this show either. Its as though the people who brought this show are conducting an experiment on how desensitized they can make people and how little regard for human life they can instill in the mind numbed TV watching drones of America. I won't even watch anything on ABC any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"This is not a nice program. There is nothing about it to enjoy. Dexter, the main character, has the eating manners of a dog and is disgusting to watch.The acting is below the level you see in High School plays and the story lines are even lower quality. If this program is what America is about, we are in trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dexter Season 1","review":"DEXTER SEASON 1 DOWNLOADI viewed episodes 1-10. This series is a cliffhanger.

What is this, kindergarten???","review":"This is probably the crappiest, most irresponsible piece of dreck ever foisted on the public by Hollywood. It's really just a warmed-over Clint Eastwood/John Wayne fantasy for idiots who think they (and society) are somehow served by some douchebag who believes he's been touched by God with the ability to decide who is guilty and should die. Frankly, the main character is such a despicable bit of pond scum that it's hard to imagine who with an IQ above the single digits could admire him. The most laughable part is those of you who say he \\"only kills bad guys\\", and therefore it's okay. That's the sort of reasoning that grade-schoolers, bin Ladens, and Dubya Bushes accept as logical; the rest of us long ago grew out of it. Jeez.

I don't regret the choice, just the fact that I didn't have more than $15. This CD is another stellar effort by JOC. I really need to listen to it on a deeper lyrical level to understand everything that is being said. Musically, this CD is genius. These guys have proven that they can move from one musical style to another and execute them brilliantly. The only reason this CD didn't get 4 stars resides in the lyrical content. I have no doubt that they are trying to tell a great message in their songs, and I believe I will understand it by and by, but I'm concerned about the highly esoteric, poetic flavor of IF I left the Zoo. The Ist CD had such an unabashed, this-is-how-it-is feel that seems to have \\"degraded\\" since Much Afraid. That's all I have to say. As I stated before, I need to listen to this CD to get the full message behind these riddles."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN AMAZING THIRD RELEASE!","review":"When I heard that Jars of Clay was releasing another CD, I couldn't wait to get it. But, I really didn't expect what I got. I was expecting a CD more mature and a little different than Much Afraid. It is more mature but way different. JOC really experimented with different sounds and more diverse songs. Yes, it took me awhile to get used to it, but listen to it a couple of times before you judge.As for the lyrics...They are rather cryptic, but hasen't JOC always been like that. I see the lyrics as urging us as to not be afraid to get out there in our Christian walk. While not openly seeming to pertain to God, I don't think a lot of the songs would fit very well as love songs. The reason I like JOC is that they aren't preachy so that we are encouraged. Well, my personal favorites are \\"Unforgetful You\\", \\"Collide\\", and \\"I'm Alright\\".Also, in a previous review, someone compare JOC to the Backstreet Boys. While I have nothing against the BSB, I really don't see a connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"God or your boyfriend?","review":"I am so disappointed. Jars of Clay was so passionate about Jesus on their first album. Along with the quality of music, their spiritual ferver has been dampened to the point where, well, they don't even mention JESUS in their lyrics. Sure, the songs are probably about God, but then-- they could be about your boyfriendfriend too. A call to prayer...? Amen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrics are getting worse","review":"I have listened to the previous two Jars of Clay Cd and I liked them, especially the first one. The reason I liked it is because of the Christian content and the message, it seems this one is going more mainstream and dropping in the content. It is a horrible album and the only song I liked was unforgetful you, I am highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traveling backwards....","review":"Well, very disappointed with this CD. No moving songs at all. Nothing to sing along to. How music can travel in the wrong direction after such an amazing debut and powerful follow-up.

I am all for artists developing their work over time like PFR, but to me they seemed to abandon everything I liked musically about the first album and started over with an inferior sound. Speaking of PFR, on first listen through I thought this album borrowed from PFR's \\"Them\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty different from the previous ones","review":"This album is another different type of album. Its not as alternative as 'Much Afraid', on the other hand its not as acoustic as 'Jars of Clay'. The band has basically added much more variety to their songs, many more instruments. Overall the album is very very good, but only if you can appreciate a band that has a lot of variety to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"easily their strongest effort to date","review":"We just got this disc and listened through twice. It's excellent. We kinda fell of the jars bandwagon after much afraid - it was just plain awful! This album is even stronger and more consistant than the self-titled debut. One track - \\"famous last words\\" - is a bit weak and sounds like a muchafraid outtake, but not enough to knock down the whole lot. \\"Goodbye\\", as an opener is great - it's like a modern day \\"rainy day women\\" from dylan's epochal blonde on blonde. it sets the pace for this moody and definitive collection that's like a soundtrack for these chilly fall philadelphia days. the album's also definitely \\"bottom heavy\\" - by that i mean, as good as it is, once the 7th tune kicks in - there's no stoppin it. a work of art in these days of musical doldrums. enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is powerful music with and heartfelt message.","review":"I have been a fan of Jars of Clay ever since their first CD came out. I like the acoustic style, and raw reality portrayed. I think this newest CD, If I left the Zoo, is one of the most innovative. They've incorporated so much diversity into their traditional style, with unusual parts that don't overpower the message. Some people think that the vocals are weak, but they really speak to me. I like how Haseltine's voice is so raw and true. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who likes diverse music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christian music","review":"I know that a lot of people probably won't agree with my rating (Five stars!) but I'd just like to say that this CD is really amazing. The lyrics are wonderful; they seem playful, but as you listen to them, over and over (and over and over and over and over, in my case) they become deeper and richer. I gave this CD five stars mostly because of those amazing lyrics--sorry, I that's mostly how I judge songs. The music is perfect, too...what makes it really amazing, to me, is the simple fact that this is CHRISTIAN music. By real CHRISTIANS, but it's not 'Hosanna, hosanna, 'alleluja'. It's modern, thought-provoking, and you can sing along to it. What else do you want? (My only regret is that I bought the tape instead of the CD--trust me, if I had heard this before, I wouldn't have minded spending another ten dollars for the CD. Phooey.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I had it for a couple months","review":"I had this album for a couple months and then decided to sell it. Why? Because I rarely listened to it anyway.It is obvious in listening to this album that Jars of Clay was attempting to be more playful in the way they played. However, I think, if anything, this album comes across as being too playful, and not serious enough musically. (Almost like Jars of Clay are two-year-olds or something).None of the songs really inspired me musically. \\"Goodbye Goodnight\\" is just plain annoying. \\"Unforgetful You\\" is ok. There are a few other ok tunes, but nothing's worth the price of the CD. If you want to hear \\"Unforgetful You\\" just buy the WoW that it comes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huh?","review":"The funny thing to me is this cd doesn't sound THAT offbeat or strange. Maybe if you grew up listening to Michael W. Smith or something, but this cd just isn't that 'weird'. It's very good though. I LOVE all three of their cd's. And if they want to release a techno tuba cd then go for it. I'm amazed at the people complaining about how far afield this cd has gone...absolutely amazed at the criticism. I also don't get the lyrical criticism that Jesus is not mentioned in each tune. How many of your church hymns actually mention the name of Jesus? And if a song is not a complete love fest then it's watered down...huh? Read the Psalms. Read the prophets. Life is tough and this Christian likes to hear about the struggles others go through because it's REAL life. (In a review before someone inadvertantly wrote \\"tracts\\" instead of \\"tracks\\"....funny.) I'm so thrilled a band like this exists and that they are willing to try something different.

Anyhoo, Great CD, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes my breath away","review":"This is such an awesome CD! The Jars have definitely done their best on this CD, and I love how unique their style is. They have a little bit of everything, from rock music on \\"Collide,\\" to pop on \\"Unforgetful You,\\" to slow and meditative music on \\"River Constantine.\\" This is their breakthrough album, and they have definitely improved their quality of music overall in this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jars of Clay's third CD is a different animal","review":"I admit that I have been a Jars of Clay fan since the first time I heard their first single \\"Flood.\\" After listening to the cd for months I was eager for the follow up. When their second release \\"Much Afraid\\" was released I had to take a second listen to make sure it was the same band. It was a typical sophomore release. Now with the release of Jars of Clay's third cd \\"If I left the Zoo\\", I can honostly say that they have came out of the sophomore slump and hit a homerun. The opening track \\"Goodbye, Goodnight\\" is a catchy sing along dealing with the millinium in a sarcastic tone.

This makes a lot of sense, today we are tied to looking for the one thing that will bring us happiness, and by just looking for that one thing we pass up so many other things in the process. Every thing we do we should be looking for a significant outcome, and it may not be the one we were expecting. This is just one of many exciting concepts in the book. The book is not about being lazy or just going through life with no direction but instead going through life with a theme. The book is very easy to read and is short. Enjoy, and continue seeking different knowledge not just more knowledge.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unhook Yourself from the Future","review":"I always thought that having goals was overrated. Things change in our lives all the time. What I desired in my twenties are not the same things I aspired to in my 30's, 40's, and now 50's. The journeys have been far more engaging than the things I achieved. I found when I reached a goal, I felt empty, almost sad.It was not a beginning at all-it was an end! Today always brings another challange, another opportunity. As Joseph Campbell says, we are all on a Hero's Journey. We fight the good fight, battle through demons and dragons, love and lose love and ultimately either perish or live to tell our stories. Perhaps a bit dramatic but nevertheless a wonderful metaphor for confronting the challanges of life itself. You cannot leave your life to a precarious future the time to act is now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goals Really Do Suck!","review":"Steve!Thank you for validating my life and offering some new ideas as well. Too many people in this world are so busy worrying about reaching a certain destination, when there probably is a better destination; attaining one status, when there is probably a better status waiting for them. Your book reinforced that for me! So I'll keep living my life that way; especially now that someone has said it is okay to do so. I hope a gazillion people take this or a similar message from this must-read.I'm going out to play now.Rich DiGirolamo, The Big Kidwww.nevergrowup.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Simplistic","review":"The book feels as though it caters to those looking for the quick, simple, check-list approach to life. While the thoughts in this book aren't wrong (in my opinion), they lack much depth. It is a quick read but not something likely to be remembered. Luckily it is well organized and short, so it is easy to find topics you want to review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting concept","review":"This does seem to be an interesting concept - that setting clear, detailed goals can actually be counterproductive. In my past experience, I'd agree that seeing yet another \\"achieve-by\\" deadline zoom by can be very demoralising. I must admit, though, that I haven't yet really tried Mr. Shapiro's alternative strategies; but I'd be willing to give it a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I believe this book's advice is downright dangerous.","review":"As someone who was named \\"The Bay Area's Best Career Coach\\" by the San Francisco Bay Guardian, I am in a position to assess the wisdom of the advice recommended in this book. Of course, the author can point to examples of people who succeeded despite not having goals or a plan, but they are the exceptions. To urge goal-free living is no wiser than urging that people take up cigarette smoking because some people don't get cancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was very dissapointed with this book.

With a wide range of stories for varied ages, this collection grew with me.

I did not read the fine print and got burned on this purchase. Honestly volume 2 was the only volume I wanted because it is the volume that my grandmother use to read to me on the farm and I am having the hardest time finding it. I wanted the full collection for when I have children so they could have fond memories of me reading to them. VERY DISAPPOINTED by this sellers description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointed","review":"Very disappointed in this product. They work just fine but re-installed the factory speakers since they are louder and have better sound quality with the aftermarket Sony X-plod head unit. Also didn't fit in the factory location even though they are supposed to be \\"the same size.\\" Wouldn't waste money on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a worthy compilation","review":"The tranceport collection has proven to be one of the weakest compilations to date. I suppose it is my distaste for trance music that leads me to such a conclusion, but I find some trance to be dominant, such as Future Primitive. The music compiled on this cd (with the exception for maybe 2 songs), is weak. The beats are not hard, the mellow, laggard trance style is preserved and for those of you who love to feel the music you dance to, this doesn't necessarily make the cut. The beats extract nothing from the soul.Those of you who enjoy listening to Sasha and Digweed would love this one, it's your cup of coffee, but I submit...and leave trance music for those who love nothing more than tasteless, monotonous, dead, limpid, weak, floating music.For those of you who love this style of music, grab your glowsticks and wave your hands to this one.....it's good for a soft, mellow hand motion....nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was bored stiff","review":"I listened to CD one and was bored to tears. It's plodding, why he used the word trance in the title and was allowed to get away with it is a mystery to me. CD Two wasn't much better. He takes recognisable songs like Stella, Belfunk, and Toca Me and distorts them so much you can hardly tell the original classics that they are. I didn't appreciate wasting my money on this compilation as I have not listened to it since that first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Smooth Trance","review":"Good CD, can't really decide which one I like more but track 9 (Velvet) on disc one is superb.

There is often much repetition as if to fill a 20 minute gap. I even found a editing error in the first CD (see if you can find it).As you come to the end of the second CD, prepare for its peak. It ends in a beautifly mixed piece of work that makes you feel good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the first Tranceport - DON'T get this one","review":"There are two subgenres of trance that have emerged over the last decade. The first is what I would consider anthem or drama trance - big blow-ups, lots of dynamics, uplifting and energetic. The second is the resurgence of highly repetitive, mind-numbing trance.While Oakenfold took us through exstatic anthems in Tranceport 1, Ralph goes for the loop-laden modern trance experience in this album. I must admit that I'm no fan of this style of trance and I regret purchasing it when it first came out just because it had the \\"Tranceport\\" name on it. Long, loop-heavy songs (or in this case an entire album) are great for clubbing, but they are annoying to listen to while sober and at home (or in my case at work ;-P ).This album is definitely geared toward the deep trance fan, and not the trance anthem fan. If you're looking for anthem, check out Trance: ASC and Trance II - they're much closer to Oaky's Tranceport. -tN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Ralph on of US best","review":"the CD Tranceport 2 is the latest of the Tranceport series. Dave Ralph blends in a mixture of Euro Trance with a blend of a UK style. The style is a very good one I might add. For all you Euro lovers Eyal- Dreamcatcher, Art of Trance- Madascasgar (Ferry C Mix) and basically all of CD2 is your liking as for CD1 it's a blend of tracks that have no euphoric melody. Although CD1 is my fav a lot of you will like more of CD2 since it has more club bumping beats. But if you do buy it check out CD1 Andy Ling- Fixation, X Cabs- Infectious 99 (Evolution Mix), Resistance D- Feel High are a few of what the CD1 has to offer. CD2 is also great you can totally groove to this CD either CD1 or 2. Dave Ralph is truely Americas finest jewel...his mixing style totally get's Euro lovers into a new feel for a different style. Check out the new Tranceport CD coming out by Sandra Collins the release date is kind of not set but when it does come out I'm sure it won't disappoint the Tranceport series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trance from Dave Ralph","review":"Dave Ralph plays an excellent variety of trance on this disk with some brilliant standout tracks including Feel So High and Rock With Me. Dave Ralph has a special touch that sets this mix apart from the millions of trance mixes out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"I don't understand what the big deal with Dave Ralph is. He's not a bad DJ, but there are dozens of others (both underground and mass-market) who equal or surpass him. Certainly he is nowhere near the incredible talent of the other two Tranceport artists (Oakenfold and Collins). His music makes great low-key house/trance, good for unwinding, or maybe listening to after you're cracked out. But it lacks the energy and the progression that is the halmark of the greats, and I'm not sure why people here and elsewhere insist on elevating him to such status."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow-up to the classic first version.","review":"This 2 CD set is a great second effort from the allmighty Tranceport vol. 1. It includes some of today's best trance music mixed to perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely separate style when compared to Tranceport 1...","review":"Tranceport is probably the best CD I own; it's a trance CD that can get me to feel amazing emotions I normally wouldn't be able to even fathom...Dave Ralph has a few catchy-ish sounds here and there...but it definitely doesn't invoke the same emotion as Oakenfold's CD did. For most of the tranceheads out there...I'd suggest Tranceport 1 and 3 only...2 is alright...but it doesn't envoke real emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd rocks","review":"i had never heard of dave ralph until recently. i found out that he opened exclusively for the master, paul oakenfold. i bought the cd because i loved the first edition. this cd is as good or better. the first cd is some fun trance beats. the melodies are thick and the baselines awesome for those of you who have a stereo system in your cars. i love the 6th song...talk about deep bass. the second cd is a harder continuation of the first. with songs like toca me and bedrock it is a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tranceport I takes you on a better ride","review":"Okay, disc 1 started off great with Rabitweed from Sasha then it started to die off. Disc 2 did shed some light on the CD set but it didn't surpass Tranceport I. I say it's a GREAT CD set IF YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON IT FOR FREE. If you buy this then it's an okay CD. I don't regret buying this but I guess it would have more kick to it if I listened to Oakenfold's Tranceport before Dave Ralph's one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, well-mixed sampler of contemporary trance","review":"1999 has brought a spate of trance releases, and this is one of the best. Dave Ralph has prepared two fine mixes, which together comprise an excellent cross-section of the best trance tracks currently shaking dance floors all over the world. The first cd is more low-key, eschewing the \\"nothing but anthems\\" approach used by Paul Oakenfold on Tranceport volume one. For those whose taste tends toward Top Forty trance this may disappoint, but I find it hypnotic and fabulously well-done. On the second cd, the tempo picks up, and the trance is higher energy. Terrific! Overall, this is an excellent cd set, reasonably priced, and terrifically mixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"dark and long","review":"dave ralph definitely scores with this set. the songs on here are dark and deep trance, perfect for setting up a relaxing mood. there aren't really are muscular trance anthems on here, but if you want something smooth and relaxing to drive to, then this set is it. i think dave eclipses oakenfold on this second collection in the series, both in song selection and set structure. he tends to stay away from oaky's lush vocal-styled mix, and his own tastes definitely evoke a feeling of deep mood. a winner if you're a mellow kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's in my survival kit - need I say more?","review":"I purchased a SOG Seal 2000 back in the mid '90s and after carrying it in my earthquake/survival kit for over 15 years and using it for everything from opening boxes and cutting rope to hewing tree branches, I can't recommend this knife highly enough. The durability and edge retention are outstanding, the grip is sure and comfortable for extended use, and it is completely impervious to the elements. Mine looks practically new even after my ham-handed abuse. While I have never had to use it as a weapon I would feel confident doing so due to it's balance and sharpness.

You may need a little learning curve to use it (how to position it right and the right force to boot the staples out). It works much better on 3 or more pages thick.

I bought the album because I'm an old Saigon Kick fan. They cover \\"Bodies\\" by the Sex Pistols. The other covers by little-known musicians are okay.

I went to write a note to the seller, vitaminanswer in Santa Cruz, and noted the page I had ordered them from listed 15 sellers, all charging several dollars more than a few days ago, when the prices were mostly competitive with the ones I finally ordered. Also, the vitaminanswer company was no longer listed, even after a search for the product.My wife has a separate Amazon account and doesn't use Sam-e -so she goes out to the same page and the prices matched what they were for me a few days ago - and vitaminanswer was listed.Caveat emptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a bad brand.","review":"Brand is as good as any other known brand.

His three-hour set (which closely reflects this album's body of music) was relentless -- oh yes, flawlessly mixed -- naturally (he is a knob tweaking crossfading professional), but lacking in the soul, spirit and creative genius behind his previous work.If you like trak after trak of *bangclikbanksmakbangbang* music that takes you down a long road to nowhere and back again, then this is your album.

True, it is not very accessable by the general public, but that's not the point, now is it? \\"...909's\\" subtle complexities are its greatest strengths; and just as Bach's fugues mesh layer upon layer of melody and rhythm, so does Hawtin with his 3 tables, drum machine and mixer.

When I shock treat it by putting the shock in the skimmer as recommended, I can see that the shock doesn't get to the other side of the pool. It's a disappointment because they sell this pump with the pool. I honestly think they ought to sell a more powerful unit. I had an old intex pool that I bought a number of years ago and finally replaced because the plastic parts and pump dry-rotted.

Buy the accompanying hoses, but for whatever reason Intex doesn't put inline valves on their pumps so you can change/clean the filter without having to pick th epump up above the waterline. Buy the hose adaptors to install shutoff valves. Finally get the pump installed a month or two later and I'm pretty sure they sold me a remanufactured unit. It's as loud as my old pump when the impeller broke and it doesn't flow nearly as much water as the 1000GPH it replaced. Don't get me wrong, it does technically work, but if it's flowing 1500GPH then my old pump must've been a 2500GPH.

I also noted the same complaint with the the impeller fins being broken. I did not order this particular model as a replacement but upgraded to a 2500gph unit.

While it claims to be a handbook, it is more of a dictionary, but nevertheless it is good if you need a quick reminder.I recommend buying this book along with Basic Japanese Sentence Patterns by Naoko Chino for maximum effect. The book does no attempt in teaching anything about the example sentences, only the particles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for particles","review":"This book gives you many examples about how to use the different participles particles but you should take care not to let yourself be overwhelmed by the number of different ways to use a particle. baby steps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the other book by the author (see review)","review":"You get information about 69 particles organised alphabetically.

He lives in the small town of Bricksburg, Virginia, and we get a good understanding of his life. This book is pretty typical a mediocre story.At times I felt Hite was trying just to hard to appeal to a young audience. The results are boring scripture and over the top narrative that seems to turn off many young women. The only thing I liked about this story was Cecil's Aunt June. She's a very lively character who lives in a mental institution.Overall, this book is just...ok. It feels rushed and incomplete. I don't recommend this book for anyone, but people desperate for a quick book report might want to check this out.

He loves this DVD, and has watched it for a total of probably 40 hours since we bought it a few weeks ago.As parents, I like the series for both the lessons each episode teaches (just to be clear, they don't preach. The lessons are subtle and light, more like, play together and if you take someone's toy, give it back when you're done) and for the music. Since my son started watching these DVD's about 8 months ago, he's begun constantly singing and dancing around the house, and he utilizes ideas and imagery from the show in his own very creative play with other kids his age.

Carmen McRae, the seasoned jazz singer, has the chops and the prestige to go out on a limb for these vocal arrangements of Thelonius Monk's best compositions. Backed by a quartet with outstanding tenor work by Clifford Jordan, she let's them share equally in the creation and improvization. Normally Monk's pieces wouldn't be thought of as compatible with a vocalist, so much dissonance and strange melodies. A number of people wrote the lyrics, notably Jon Hendricks, and some are outstanding, especially \\"Well you Needn't\\"(It's Over Now). She also does a wonderfully long version of \\"Round Midnight\\" which introduced me to extended lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carmen's Monk","review":"Beautiful!Very rarely have I heard so distinctive interpretations of Monk's music by other artists.

The book gives only a brief description of the agile methods (XP, Scrum, FDD, etc.), but you will find a detailed presentation of the best practices common to agile approaches. For each of them, the author exposes the purposes, the prerequisites, the implementation, the opportunities and obstacles.The books provides an agile treatment of many of the daily problems of software development projects like database management, data conversion, test data management, project communication, documentation, end-user contacts or developers management. The most interesting point for me in this book is that the author recognises that you cannot always start with a white page and require an \\"all-agile\\" process. It provides information on how to integrate gradually agile practices in a traditional software development context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracks are...","review":"1. O Du Froehliche 2.

I was impressed that it was so cheap for a knife that has a blade made from 440C stainless steel. Out of the box the blade was not terribly sharp (could be sharpened easily but should have a razor factory edge in my opinion). The handle was lightweight, but felt and looked cheap, as well as borderline flimsy. The blade was not smooth or quick in opening and the liner lock device is thin. The blade also had a lot of play from side to side while open and locked. I promptly returned the knife as I felt that is was too cheaply made for everyday carry. If you want a knife at a cheap price and don't plan on using it for any serious activities then this might be the knife for you. As for me, I am going to take a pass on this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+ for Comfort and Style","review":"These Columbia Fyter shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn right out of the box.

If you are seeking reprints of Tesla turbine patent applications and circa 1911 newspaper and magazine articles, this book is a great collection.I was somewhat disappointed, hoping to find higher-level engineering technical information. Several reprinted articles do have some tidbits of technical information. Unfortunately, the same few tidbits are scattered through the various articles in the book over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I purchased this T-square and the one I got did not have a perfect right angle. The T-top is made out of wood as is the straight edge piece. These two pieces of wood are held together by 5 small screws. The low grade wood used in making this t-square will have a tendency to warp. The screws in the one I purchased weren't all uniform to begin with so that leads me to think that either the machines used to make them are imperfect or the workmanship is lacking. (By the way, I bought mine at Staples and ALL of the T-squares had the same issues with the screws.)If you're just look to make a straight line fairly perpendicular to an edge, then it's okay for that. If you're looking for something with a perfect right angle, I recommend staying away from this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innamoramento","review":"Well, the only thing I have to say is that music is an individual thing and everybody's taste is different. You can never suit everybody fine,when being a singer/musician. You try, but that's almost impossible by all those millions of people existing in our world. So in time you try to do the music you feel fine on your own as an artist,more than thinking in the people's taste. Mylene has sometimes a very strange sound of music like \\"Mylenium\\", but that's the interesting point in her music,it's not common.It's the way she expresses herself as an artist. And for me such sounds like Mylene's are even more interesting than those radio sounds you always hear all over and over again, but they have no soul. Creativity is beginning when you do things on your own and not copying other artists as many musicians do. Mylene is definitely a real artist. And I love this way of expressing, especially as a writer this is very inspiring for me personally.Really!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good album","review":"This album is a good one.I still prefer the one before \\"Annamorphose\\" which was a bit more happier than this one.

A must-buy..","review":"Just got the CD last week... It is actually very good. Most of the songs will make excellent singles. The first one taken (L'AmeStramGram) is already a great success... great beat, kind techno sounds... The album also contains rock traxxs with more guitars (Dessine moi un mouton), or very efficient ballads (Innamoramento, Pas le temps de vivre). An excellent CD. And the french inport (Digipack) is very nice. A good purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mylene's BEST BY FAR","review":"I am baffled that some reviewers think that this album is inferior to Mylene's previous work...HELLO!!! This is by far her best album to date. Not only is it a lengthy album, but each song is distinct and beautiful in its own right. For example, \\"Innamoramento\\" is a stunningly lovely slow song, while \\"L'Ame Stram Grame\\" is trance-y and rythmic. \\"Mylenium\\" reminds me of Adiemus--tribal, but ethereal. \\"Dessine-Moi Un Mouton\\" is amazing with its catchy electric guitar rifts and Mylene's cooing voice. \\"Je Te Rends Ton Amour\\" is a laid-back, slightly trip-hoppy groove...Ahh...I just hope that Mylene keeps doing this kind of music. It is far more mature and moving than anything she's previously done. And may I say...this album is far better than ANYTHING Madonna (with whom Mylene is often compared) has ever done. Even English speaking music-lovers should purchase this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innamoramento - Mylene Farmer","review":"Canadian relative gave this album to me in cassette form and liked it after first listen and loved it after 2-3-4 and 5th listen.

If you like Yellowman, but can't bring yourself to buy a Yellowman album, check out Toyan. And if you're a Toyan fan familiar with \\"Spar With Me\\", check out \\"How the West Was Won\\". So raw. Listen to the fullness of the low end on this record, it's ridiculous. A good 60% of this album is Scientist's huge drums and bass with Toyan over it. Then just when you forgot there were other musicians in the studio, here they come, reverbing and echoing back into the mix. Listening to this makes you feel like you smoked a mountain of weed, even when you're totally sober.

I know some French and find it to be a fairly faithful translation into very persuasive English, and a wonderful read both as a version of Sophocles' original and as a political adaptation, used to speak about France under a Nazi regime. After finishing Antigone, I read the other four plays in the book for the fun of it, and thouroughly enjoyed Eurydice and Romeo and Jeannette. Anouilh seems to obsess over young love, loss of innocence, and the ideals of static perfection in a changing world; these themes seem to hold the five plays together. In my opinion, his work is worthy of a broad audience and broad acclaim, and this edition of the plays is a very decent set of translations."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A waste","review":"hey people if you wanna read a good book this is robably the worst choice!! i would reccomend other books to you by the same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far The Best Blues Reference Guide Available","review":"I've read them all and this is the very best of all the blues guides available.

(May be a switch problem) This saw has been in production for a long time and the manufacturing problems should have been solved by now.If I was to buy a trim saw again, I would buy a small battery operated saw (the 18 volt Dewalt is nice). I used my sons dewalt and was impressed that the distance from the blade to the edge of the base plate was a standard 1 inch on one side and 4 inches on the other so it was easy to clamp a staight edge to the line of cut. It had plenty of power and could cut thru thicker stock than the Porter-Cable saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best parenting book so far!","review":"This is the best parenting book I've read, and I've read many.

All aspects of her character are dealt with: psychological, physical, and social. Beth's relationship with Nora, and the end of the story, beg the question \\"is she a lesbian or isn't she?\\" This reviewer takes exception to the ALA's review (first on this page), which states that Nora is emotionally disturbed. Is this yet another way for the \\"het\\" world to imply that being gay is tantamount to being emotionally disturbed? The reviewer should have qualified her use of the phrase \\"emotionally disturbed.\\" An excellent book, highly recommended to all. We look forward to more work by this Canadian author. Part of the book's excellence lies in the fact that the reader continues thinking and wondering about the ending, long after the cover has been closed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canadian version of South American \\"magic realism\\"","review":"I'm writing from southeastern Ontario, Canada.Just finished \\"The Cure for Death by Lightning\\" and tonight, my bookclub (12 people) will discuss it.The book strongly reminds me of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende's \\"magic realism\\" style.I thoroughly enjoyed it.As a Canadian, I wish the American reviewers would get more specific - this story happened in a specifed place which is well noted - not \\"western Canada.\\"If the Australian, reviewing at this site could name the province as British Columbia couldn't the much-closer Americans?"},{"rating":"2","title":"deserves the spotlight","review":"I'm pleased to see others here who discovered this book...This is one of my favorite debut novels ever.

Boy, were we ever wrong! Just shows you can't judge a book by its cover. We thought the author went overboard by trying to cover all the \\"hot\\" topics, e.g., incest, lesbianism, murder, beastiality, Turette's Syndrome, etc...etc...Yawn. Thank goodness the chapters were brief because every new chapter provided the reader with some new horrendous insight. All in all, we all agreed that you couldn't pay us enough to read her next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"weak, reductionist, yet a page-turner","review":"I was extremely disappointed with \\"A Cure for Death by Lightning.\\" Although I found the book hard to put down, I felt the writing was weak. Mainly, I was stunned by the fact that the terrible dysfunctions of the town and of the family were minimalized, reduced to nothing more than the ever-present (too much present, agonizingly so) \\"coyote spirit\\". Are we to believe that the father was not to blame for his abusive behavior, that the horrid boy Parker was simply possessed by the coyote, that Billy didn't have terret syndrome after all? The coyote lurked all through the pages of this book, far too often. The coyote stood in the way of dealing with real and gripping issues. To deal with those issues in a realistic manner would have made for a much more compelling book. I understand the author wanted to use some sort of mystic symbolism and magic realism, but sadly, this didn't work to entice, but rather, to frustrate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad book","review":"I am not complaining about a novel dealing with grim issues. That is a perfectly good thing for a novel to do. But Anderson-Dargatz seems to throw any controversial subject in just for the hell of it. Lesbianism, insanity, rape, bestiality - this novel has it all! And she does a bad job of dealing with those issues too. For example, the main character's father becomes incredibly and dangerously mentally unstable. He becomes violent and hot-tempered, when previously he had been a good father and husband. Anderson-Dargatz writes about the fear he generates, but there is no sense that his family members would and should *miss* the man he used to be. Beth doesn't ever seem to miss her father. Likewise, her mother doesn't ever seem to miss her husband. He's a monster now, and that's that. \\"Shallow\\" is the word that springs to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible mistake","review":"I've just started reading this book that I bought in september.

The direction comes off as lacklaster, even amaturish. The plot does move fast, though.Somehow, Universal released this; AIP was better with such material. A very 1970s movie, also kinda akin to ACROSSS 11OTH STREET, with a similar mafia/cops chasing anti-heros angle.This movie and the book it adapted from came out before THE STING----so, THE STING ripped off the opening scene of two hustlers accidently ripping off the mafia!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?

I had never seen the series until last year on Sky Angel Satellite. I wanted to see what it was that intrigued my mom. In the process, my wife became a big fan of The Loretta Young Show and asked for this set for her birthday. We both enjoyed watching the complete first season and look forward to more collections. What I am sure my mother liked about this show (& Loretta Young, in general) was her faith and moral values. It's too bad television today has gone so far over to the dark side that one could never imagine seeing a program like this produced today! The extras are nice, but we found the biography a little disappointing. It ends with her starting the TV series! Nice price and definitely worth every dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the 50s","review":"This collection of Ms Youngs first season on television is not only a great vehicle for her acting talents - Loretta Young plays a different character in each of the then-weekly episodes. The series takes on many ethical and philosophical issues which are topical today. The programs are short (half hour each) and surprisingly entertaining. They represent the best of the Fifties: a willingness to take on tough and in some cases unusual issues coupled with a belief that ordinary people have the innate ability to solve difficult moral and ethical conundrums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loretta Young Show Season 1","review":"Loretta Young is my all time favorite femail actress.

Ansermet leads a disciplined, cool, clear performance, though not as dramatically incisive as those conducted by Fricsay, Kertesz or Dorati. Gilly and Lovano, two noted French singers of that time, complement the conductor with equally cool, but convincing portrayals of their own. Gilly is not as dramatic as either Christa Ludwig or Hertha Topper, but is quite good. Lovano, another French stalwart of the good old days, is a fine Bluebeard, though not as powerful as Walter Berry or Fischer-Dieskau.The orchestra plays well ( in those days it was always a question whether or not a French orchestra would give it their all -- this one did ). Malibran names neither venue nor orchestra and the sound is merely adequate.

I need a container in it to put the garbage bag in. The way it is with the hinged lid you can't put a bag in and get it to stay. It would not even work for paper as you would have to pick it up (heavy to turn upside down) to dump it into a garbage bag. The inside is narrow and tall and I can't find anything that will fit in it. Not a good choice for me to use for garbage, I wish I would have know that I couldn't put garbage in it before I bought it. I had one I liked very well but it was old, the lid lifted off and I could put a bag in, then put the lid back on and it was great. This one looked just like mine but lid doesn't lift off so you need a inside container for it.

Why have you never heard about it? It was considered obscene, and parts of it are shocking, still. It demonstrates that Taylor was a very talented actress strangled by the star system in the US, of which she was the last studio product. The film is damaged by extraneous scenes not in the novel, set in a police station. But when Taylor is on screen as perhaps the most neurotic woman in screen history - besides every Joan Crawford performance on film - you won't forget it. Sparks' dialogue, as in 'Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' - taken intact from the novel in Taylor's scenes - is sparkling. To best view this film skip any police scene, and the end will surprise you more as well.

The presence of Andy Warhol and Liz Taylor makes it seem like a project where all of their 'beautiful people' cronies got together to make a movie, the way you and your gang in your neighborhood put on a show using dad's old suits and the rusted farm implenments from the barn for props. The plot makes no sense, Taylor's purpose in the film plot is look good while wandering through it and the inevitble payoff in most 60's angst ridden films comes up at the end.

But, I need help with installing the code."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken and not complete?!","review":"I just received my Neiko 61013 550 Cubic Inch Fit Anywhere Digital Electronic Safe Box today - purchased from the seller ALS Group Inc. It came in a box that was totally destroyed that the post office had put in a plastic bag with a note basically saying (I'm obv paraphrasing) \\"sorry your box was in pieces.\\" It came with three batteries instead of four (it takes four). And the piece of plastic that is meant to hold the batteries in place didn't clip in like it was supposed to so I improvised and taped it shut with masking tape. Also, there were parts that it came with such as screws and bolts, but they weren't mentioned anywhere in the directions? I think they might be for mounting it onto a wall? Anyway, not pleased at all with the condition that this arrived in."},{"rating":"2","title":"awasome protection but one flaw","review":"This safe works great , i bought it and i only found one thing wrong with it . the electronic keypad runs on 4 triple a batterys which die in two weeks . other then that it's structurally sound and tamper proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose latch/knob, not very good quality","review":"The safe came brand-new in box, but the moment I took it out, the knob was noticeably loose. I ended up having to open it up to fix the know, but it seems something was missing with the knob assembly. Also, the instruction said you have to use \\"B\\" after the secret code to unlock, but \\"A\\" will also work. The keyed lock is not very sophisticated. This safe is only good for putting away small items, but is by no mean safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived in good conditions, but as already said, you can open it with a potato","review":"I've seen in one of the reviews that you can open safes just by hitting the door while trying to open it. So when my package arrived, I immediately tried the trick and it actually works. I opened the safe in 30s without the code or the recovery key. Well, the package arrived in good condition, the safe is working but it just can't be called a safe as soon as you can open it in less than one minute and without any particular tool.... I won't return it because I'm just lazy to do it and if you don't know the trick, I don't think it can be opened easily. But if you are looking for a REAL safe, don't even expect something from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Control","review":"The knob to unlock the door fell off after just a few days. Using the key, I was able to open the safe anyway, take the the locking mechanism apart and reinstall the knob; I trust I did a better job than whoever assembled it the first time.

Comes with lags to secure in a building if you own the building. Drawbacks are that this is a thin lightweight construction, even if bolted down a thief could potentially take it away given that they had a pry bar and enough time, having been a Security Expert in the past I know that the purpose of a safe like this is to create a delay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Received this product with a damaged keyboard. Contacted the seller who stated it was a shipping problem. The safe was packed in 2 boxes with packing material. Neither of the boxes showed any sign of damage & the safe did not have any visible marks or scratches. I had to take the safe apart & repair it myself so it would function. VERY UNHAPPY with this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken","review":"This safe arrived with the thin plastic exension for the control panel broken, it will not open with default electronic code or bypass key. The safe was not packed with any real packing material. It makes me wonder what would have happened if I had put my lifes papers into this box and dropped it on the floor once. It is obvious that it cannot handle shipping.

I could change the combo easily. The bolted door seemed solid and it would hold several small valuables. However, after about six months the locking mechanism failed.

It was also missing one of the straps that hold the package together. I opened it up and the plastic had a hole in it just below the keypad.

I took a closer look and saw that combination panel on the door had some how cracked into 8 or 9 different pieces and was more or less ripped off the safe.I understand things get damaged in shipping, but this is supposed to be a safe. The panel should not be made of glued on 1/64\\" plastic. Won't even consider anything from this manufacturer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is EVA","review":"An above average start for an average series. The plot follows several 14 year old kids that were conceived on the date of the second impact, the second attack of the Angels, the villains of this story. These Angels, do represent conventional western Christian religion and also as villains, so you decide for yourself. 5 of these children are discovered in the story, though only 2 are introduced on this DVD.The series as a whole, suffered from budget troubles and the ending was changed rather quickly, though later, the End of Evangelion movie showed the true ending to the series. If you like giant robots and mecha busting up big cities, then you will love this. Gundam Wing fans may be put off by the primitive animation in places, but this holds true for everyone. Just sit back, switch off your brain and enjoy it. You will understand it better as things are explained as the story progresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Eva DVD","review":"Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the best anime's to come out of Japan in a looooong time, if not ever. This first DVD only scratches the surface on the immense depth of plot that this series has. Highly recommended. Five stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't get any worse than this","review":"EVA is the absolute worst show anyone can watch its so boring and retarded. Who actually likes this show. the plot is so predictable and stupid. Something is wrong with you if you watch this I mean really. If you like mecha series you should try a better show like Gravion the best mecha show ever unlike EVA which is absolutely horrible. I hope you all love my review. stupid EVA watchers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for things to make sense","review":"This anime seems to be very highly recommended by nearly everyone. I am sorry to say that I have a very different opinion of this show. Granted it is not your typical boy-pilots-giant-mecha, as this show focuses on character development instead of action. One may think that a high level of character development would be a good thing, but it is very tedious here. First and foremost, I did not like any of the characters in this show. Experience with other anime programs has led me to identify with characters like Spike (Cowboy B) and Vash (Trigun). Don't expect any prototype heros in Evangelion because there are none. It is like a bad episode of Jerry Springer.I do not doubt that this anime will be very satisfying for a large audience of anime fans, but I would like to warn anyone who is expecting this to be another gundam show. I liked Cowboy Bebop, I liked Trigun, I liked Outlaw Star, I liked Lodoss War, I absolutely hated Evangelion."},{"rating":"1","title":"great animation but bad dvd manufacturing","review":"Even while writing this review, after viewing the ADV DVD, my eyes are color-separated because of the bad transfer of DVD color separation.

I grew up as a Robotech fan and have always been dissapointed that there weren't more of them available. This show captures a similar feeling to that series and combines greate suspense as well.There is the hint of behind the scenes evil that pervades the episodes similar to Madeline and Operations in La Femme Nikita.Unfortunately, new releases are excruciatingly slow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evangelion, the way it should be.","review":"At first I was doubtful about buying this DVD, but I have no regrets; it's one of the best, only compared to Ghost in the Shell and Macross (1st series and Plus).Awesome animation, music, and history make Evangelion a blockbuster.A must have for every anime fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD version is bellow standard","review":"I am an avid fan of Evangelion and was eagerly awaiting the DVD release of the series. Unfortunatly whoever was in charge of this disc at ADV films simply butchered it. The video quality is way bellow DVD standards. There are lots of convertion artifacts and the worse problem since to be a convergence issue which gives the video a dated look (similar to looking at a really old color TV set)IMHO VHS actually look better than this. Evangelion is my favorite anime series but this DVD simply made me sick. My only hope is that ADV films will correct the problem in future releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"No transfer complaints here!","review":"I originally had the series on VHS, and the first DVD in the series is no worse than the tape, transfer wise. If I was upset over anything, it's the limited bonus materials on the disc. I'm just glad I can finally have my EVA on a non-degradable media AND in the original soundtrack w/ subtitles. I haven't seen the region 2 disc that everyone keeps raving about, but I'm still very happy with my purchase. The show itself is wonderful, very exciting and intelligent. Your emotional investment definitely pays off in later episodes. Highly recommended for any anime fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Mess!!","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of Evangelion and I like to think it's the best fictional material I have ever seen, real or cartoon!!The Collection 0:1 DVD is simply horrible to watch!! It's the worst picture quality I have ever seen on a DVD. What the hell was ADV thinking?? And why on earth did Gainax Studios approve of this releas? It's beyond me... I have to agree with another reviewer on this page; I was shocked to see the previews of other ADV titles were of far greater picture quality than the program material of the disk. The Evangelion DVD looks far worse than the VHS release. And that is almost unbelievable, and most certainly unforgivable.Very, very dissapointing indeed. Collection 0:2 looks slightly better but not good enough. I expect some heads to roll at ADV Films for this horrible looking DVD! Releasing Evangelion -or any title for that matter, in this poor quality should almost be considered a crime punishable by law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kawrou is wrong, EVANGELION is the greatest achievement of m","review":"I absolutely LOVE Evangelion, I deplore this DVD. The menus are shoddy, the picture is cack, and the monsters hacked EVA apart and pasted English over the Kanji. For example when Shinji is at his desk and his classmates send him a message... in the VHS release the message is in Japanese. Some hack video editor translated it to English and slapped it over the kanji. This DVD is equivalent to the painting of the Virgin Mary covered in elephant dung. I read that ADV could have gotten the same *angelic* quality that the Region two DVDs have; yet they didn't want to fork over the woolongs. So if you're reading this ADV.. I'm not buying another EVA DVD until you do it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Anime, Poor Technical Quality!","review":"Evangelion is surely one of the best animes ever made, but this DVD series are flaw in quality. The original anime was made in Japan ( 29.97 frames per second NTSC ) then it was \\"restorated\\" in germany ( 25 FPS PAL, needed transcoding, that interpolates and mixes frames ) and it came back to U.S. where it was converted to NTSC again ( more intepolation and loss of resolution and color added). The final result is an image full of transcoding artifacts and with poor color. I was told by a person from ADV films that they are remastering the DVD using original japanese masters. That will surelly improve the quality of the series and make it worth purchasing. Until then, I'll watch it on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to see Evangelion again.","review":"Let's face it: Hideaki Anno's masterpiece, Neon Genesis Evangelion was probably one of the most successful anime series of all time. However, this is the beggining of a better version of this series. The video and audio have had major improvements. There was some footage from the original cut that didn't make it the first time. And there are some rather informative commentaries done by the cast and crew of the English version.Now, the series itself can be very intriguing, but weak in some areas. And the unexpected plot changes can leave you confused. Other than the fact that it's confusing, Neon Genesis is an excellent series, and should be watched by all anime fans, even if you already have the original version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't seen the rest of the series, but so far looks great.","review":"...First off, this is not a stand alone DVD, it is sold my itself, but you would be really disappointed if this was the only DVD for this series available.From what I understand, and it seems so far to be very true, this series starts out very slow. This DVD basically has four short episodes, with everyone of them wanting more. It's like watching half an episode of your favorite tv show. You can't not watch the rest of it...After watching many other anime, I find that this series has very basic animation, and fuzzy sound quality, but I find this to be not so important compared to the actual storyline.I can't wait to watch the next 4 episodes.Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Anime, mediocre DVD","review":"Neon Genesis Evangelion is visually beautiful and impressive, fast paced, yet contains significant depth in the plot line.The first DVD in the series is unfortunately not a very good transfer, suffering from some visible MPEG artifacts. This has been corrected in the subsequent collections, so don't let it deter you. The extras on the disk consist of typical Anime trailers and really minimal character bios.Five stars for content, three stars for technical implementation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best anime in my opinion!!","review":"Eva is about biomechanical robots w/c are piloted by 14 yr. olds. Aside from the cool robots, evangelion has a great story. The first 4 episodes will hook you up for sure. The version of evangelion is way better than the vhs. It contains 4 episodes, dubbed in 4 languages and you even have the choice to view it with subtitles. Some extras include character bios and previews.It's true that the dvd quality wouldn't measure up with the quality of most dvds today, But believe me..it's really acceptable and it's not that bad. Besides the price is really unbeatable. With this price you can only get 2 episodes on vhs. Not to mention it's only in 1 language or subtitled.note: ADV films just anounced that the release date of collection 2 will be on nov. 21st(and i am eagerly waiting for it!!). They delayed it for quite a long time, mainly because they want to improve the quality of the dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show! Horrible Commentary","review":"I really enjoy this show. Its captivating on many levels, believe the hype. The new platinum dvd looks and sounds great but I was a little peeved by the commentary. Is it just me or does anyone else find 2 guys yapping on and on about what other shows they acted on and how the episodes were recorded at all captivating? For such a important show as Evangelion you would expect a commentary that might at least once mention the characters, plot, or design. Perhaps someone who studies anime might have gave us some more depth. Nope. Instead we get two full episodes of completely boring facts. Sorry, Just a small bone to pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche Queen, ho!","review":"NGE embodies the worst elements of anime, and those elements are anime cliches. Impossible and inexplicable mechs, adolescent heroes (the first of which is angst-ridden and emotionally unstable, another is a loner, and the third is sassy), busty curved women, and mystifying plot. I guess if you're one of those \\"otaku\\" freaks this DVD will be right up your alley. Others can move on to something worth watching, like Mononoke, Rurouni Kenshin, or Excel Saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest anime of the decade - worst transfer in awhile.","review":"I'm not really into anime in a big way. NGE was so impressive and unusual that it became the first anime series I bought in several years.I was so happy to finally get a subtitled version of this show. Then I saw that ADV have done to this disc.First off, they've digitally manipulated frames in this show to add in really cheap looking English lettering. They've even done it to the credits, and chosen terrible lettering to do it in. Maybe you'll appreciate this - I for one couldn't stand it, and don't buy into any Eyes Wide Shut style tampering. Especially as it means that ADV will have put the video through some process that will change its quality.Then you just see how badly it's been transferred. Extremely muted colors that shift, disturbing artifacts here and there, terrible black levels.It looks like muck."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad work","review":"Well, Evangelion is just one of the best anime series i ever seen. So i didn't wait a lot when I knew its release on DVD. But this DVD is of very poor quality and just make me regret not to have the VHS instead. Hope next volumes will be much greater to reach the OK level for a DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS was better","review":"Neon Genesis Evangelion is by far one of the best animes ever. Something like bringing it to DVD should have enhanced it. Though this was not the case. The DVD by far is horrible. They changed signs and paper to read in english which is an insult. The video quality is horrible everything looks still. The scenary is in total contrast to where it should be, it's horrible. The VHS is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atencion!

The story starts very slow, and this DVD is more of a prologue to the rest of it. So, either buy the whole series, or don't buy any of it. The series gets 4 stars, this DVD only gets 2. Trust me, the second and third DVDs are a lot more exciting, and lay the groundwork for the really [messed] up stuff that happens later.I believe the company that distributes Evangelion in the stater ADV, now has a box set that wioll save you money in the long run.

Between half-cooked electronic disharmony and relentless thrash-and-pounds, hardly any tracks feel developed past the effect of constant bleed through, track by track. Still, there is no denying the short-lived, superficial intensity to some of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmore album syndrome","review":"The worst 'new album let down' since Metallica put out the black album, the Page and Plant albums, or even Smashing Pumpkins' Adore. The elements that made Hold Your Horse Is so excellent are almost completely missing on 7 of these tracks. Sounds like the guitarist ran out of ideas and decided to make up for it by cranking the distortion.While it is still a thousand times better than anything Nu or MTV, if you heard Hold Your Horse Is and are looking for more of the same, forget it. This sounds closer to the noisy ep's in between lp's.Sorry Hella! The cult of HYHI has been established."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hella Bad","review":"I've heard alot of hype about these guys, so when I saw this album at the library, I scooped it up and gave it a listen. Made my head hurt. I can see how people are impressed by the drummer...he's phenomenal, no doubt.However, this is just not music. It's really fast, technical drumming accompanied by guitar noise. Unless you are into this kind of stuff, steer clear.

Gotta watch that bottom line for the investors, eh Epson?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper feed nightmare","review":"Inconsistent paper feed. Took me 2 hours once to get card stock, with all settings correct, to actually work. The problem is once you print anything else, it will not feed card stock anymore.

I used a package of 13\\" x 19\\" Office Max photo paper (not even Epson's brand) and achieved perfect results. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it does use a fair bit of ink, but it doesn't appear to be unreasonable considering the size of the image and the fact that it is 100% coverage. So far I've printed a dozen images and one cartridge is at 25%, two are at 50%, and the other 3 are at 75% or more.I couldn't be more happy at the quality for this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"If I listened to all the negative reviews I would not have purchased the 1400.It's replacing my Epson Stylus 1280.....

You'll be happy you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great brand - bad model","review":"I've been using and testing Epson printers since the late '90s. This model is a lemon. Either it's the print drivers or the internal board, but it cannot reliably read the print commands. Multiple paper feeds occur before it finally starts to print (sometimes up to 10 sheets feed through without printing). Reinstalling the drivers has not worked. The quality on the best print setting continue to include lines and poor print artifacts on the correct paper (this is before or after cleaning), but printer is basically new. I'm not that surprised, the early printers were \\"tanks\\" like the 3000 I used to have, but the newer ones are built to fail and there is much less quality for your money spent. It's really too bad that the consumer priced printers are so poor. The high end printers continue to print incredibly well, but I'm not about to dump $5K into a printer for a 8.5x11\\" print."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY","review":"This printer was such a disappointment. I returned the Epson 1400 because the quality was awful and I couldn't get the colors right no matter what adjustments I did. I have always been a fan of HP but I had read reviews for the 1400 and got it instead. What a disappointment. I returned it and bought the HP 8550 and it is best purchase I have made since my Nikon D50. I printed a borderless 13x19 and the quality is better than anything I have had professionally printed. The ink levels didn't even move. The software takes a little while to load but that's it. If you are looking for a quality photo printer the HP 8550 is the best way to go. I should have trusted my gut and the bought the HP to begin with. I wasted so much time trying to adjust the Epson and only ended up frustrated. My HP all in one did a better job. Then I got the 8550 and WOW - what a difference. Don't waste your energy and time with this Epson.

BUT... the paper feed continues to be substandard, must be monitored constantly and always wears out early in the product's life cycle. What great, great printers these would be if that long standing issue was solved.

The printing only works with Epson cartridges and they are a real headache to install. Most of the time after you have just installed the cartridges, it states that the cartridge is not an Epson compatible cartridge - well duh - I just took it out of the Epson box. The box contains no instalation instructions. The printer itself has some very small line drawings on instalation, but they might as well be in hyroglyphics for being easy to understand. I curse the day I purchased this printer. I feel like smashing it into pieces and sending it back to Epson with a note of thanks for the junk. It infuriates me to spend money on Epson enrichment with ink cartridges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading many positive reviews, I am disappointed about the quality of this printer.

Also - 2 of the ink cartridges are already so low that I had to order new ones and I've only had this printer for a week. I bought the printer from Amazon because it was the best price I could find. If it wasn't such a hassle to pack it up and take it to UPS, I'd probably return it.

It has never once printed something properly the first time. We constantly have to clean it which immediately prompts that the printer is now low or out of ink. Which means every single time we need to print something, regardless of whether its a 4-color print on photo paper or a plain black and white, 8.5x11 print, we have to go through a lengthy process before it prints even remotely close to right and often ends up with us buying $40-60 in ink. I absolutely loathe this printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"large format for those who need it","review":"This printer creates high quality results...at significant expense. Artists will appreciate the beautiful results (ink droplets dispersed in 5 sizes, beautiful archival inks, ability to make large prints). But by my calculations each letter-sized print costs about two dollars, and the printer won't work if any ink level drops to low. I'm not tech-savvy so am a little overwhelmed by the thought of having to recalibrate, etc. But for beautiful results I'm not sure this printer can be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointing","review":"I've had this printer about six months, and it has really been a let-down. I bought it for photos and CDs.For a couple months it produced lovely photos. Now, the ink has to be recalibrated every time, which takes about 45 mins and pounds of ink. After calibration, it prints about 20 good-looking photos, and then they look like trash again.For such an expensive printer, I expected better.The CDs on the special tray always come out looking great. For that, I give this two stars. I wish I had bought a cheaper printer. I will NEVER buy another Epson."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big Expensive Headache","review":"I bought this printer about 3 years ago on the recommendation of a friend. The up-side is that it makes beautiful prints. The down side is everything else about this machine. As an artist I make a lot of high quality prints of my work, and when using premium paper, and calculating that a set of ink is $120, A HQ 8x10 costs about $2. I estimate that I spend almost $500 a year on ink and paper. The other issue is that the paper feeder is very tempermental and often has to be hand-fed one sheet at a time. If there is even a slight flaw to the paper, it jams the rollers and eats the paper. Another consideration is that it is huge! about 3ft wide. Recently the printer has been giving me so much trouble I'm ready to throw it out. I need the large format, but this printer is a big expensive headache. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondeful Printer!","review":"I have had this printer for about a month. The output is crisp and clean. The over-sized prints I have done (up to 13x19) have all gotten \\"wows\\" when they have been displayed. The print quality is the best I have seen in an ink-jet. As others have mentioned, it is hungry for ink, but when you enter a high end printer your gonna pay a premium. You get what you pay for. Ink is still hard to find, but this model is still fairly new. I can almost always get the ink at staples off the shelf. So if your looking for a serious over-sized printer... this is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A banding nightmare","review":"I had high hope for this printer but turns out no amount of head cleaning and realignment can resolve the horizontal banding which gets worse toward both ends of every photo paper.

I made the mistake of thinking of the stylus photo as an upgrade, but in fact, the (much more expensive!) ink in this printer is not even a little bit water resistant (even though they claim it is), and prints horribly on watercolor paper. Even on photo paper, I'm getting better prints out of my workforce all-in-one, they're just too small :(I'm returning it and going for the workforce wide format printer which I almost bought in the first place.

But the worst of all was when I printed a CD, the met\`al rollers left small marks. I emailed customer service and they responded with links on how to print CD's. Then they said they didn't understand. when I emailed back asking them what they did not understand they told me to take it to a repair center. No help, guidance or troubleshooting at all.

The prints were pretty good, as long as it worked, but now it's nothing more than an unusual centerpiece. And from what I read, Epson couldn't care less. When their company folds owing to this type of shoddy merchandise, guess what, I won't have a speck of sympathy for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad printer","review":"While a bit on the big side because of its large format printing, it is a very nice printer. The quality of printing is excellent with its Claria inks. Text printing is speedy for an inkjet while photo print speed is actually quite reasonable considering its size. Price is less expensive than some of the other comparable printers but inks are very pricy in my opinion (each cartridge is $20). This is where Epson really makes its money. Everyone knows that when you buy a printer, you are buying the inks and getting a free printer for the most part. A set of inks for this printer cost $120 retail... yow.... at least they give you the 079 ink cartridges which is the big brother to the 078... same size, just more ink in them. Now I know why generic cartridge manufacturers are so popular with the Epson crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great printer for everything","review":"I've only had this printer for about a month, but so far it has lived up to my expectations with Epson. I've owned a half dozen Epson printers in the past and currently own 3. I was looking for a printer to make 11x14 to 12x18 prints and this one was priced right. So far the prints have been superior and the printer easy to set up and use. My only complaints are: 1) It uses a great deal of inks, especially the light cyan, light magenta, and yellow. The specs said it was easy on inks, but I'm not finding that true. 2) The inks are expensive (as usual) but I can only get them from Epson store. Epson does have specials and when I get 10% off and free shipping, I usually take advantage of it. All in all I would recomend this printer to anyone needing a larger format without the larger price tag. I've tried HP and Canon and find them good printers, but I have found the Epson line of printers superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad,Terrible customer service","review":"I've had this printer for a year now. I have bought Epson Ink Jet printers ever since the first one came out, and the quality and amount of ink needed has gotten worse with each new generation.

I find myself using it less and less as I can barely print ten pictures before I'm looking at buying new ink jet cartridges. And even that MIGHT be OK, if the quality of the pictures were good, but they are worse than the ones I printed years ago on the first printer.And to top it all off, the absolute worst experience I've ever had with customer service was when I called to get help with the printer. I was sent to somewhere overseas and talked to people who couldn't understand my issue, couldn't communicate at all. It was ridiculous. I would rather pay less and simply not have support. This is my last Epson."},{"rating":"1","title":"a LOT of aggravation...","review":"I got this printer over a year ago, mainly because I needed something to print images onto CD's, and also for general office printing. The print quality on the CD's was really lacking, the colors were way off (heavily magenta), and I had to adjust my images to compensate for the color issues. I would NOT recommend for printing photos.I've used it since for office printing, and when it's working, it's fine, but there are so many times that it gets a printer error, and doesn't give any details on what's wrong.

Made repeated calls and after all kinds of actions at long-distance rates, was told mine was inop and another would be sent. Another week elapsed before it showed up.

In comparison this Epson is awful. It prints at the wrong scale and in the wrong position on the page time and time again. I've worked through various settings and print from various file formats and programs and it prints correctly about 10% of the time. In addition, the paper feed is incredibly poor, requiring sheets to be repositioned for every page printed. An absolute nightmare to my workflow. Maybe my printer is a lemon, but regardless, the Epson software is nothing special either.Maybe for the discounted price this printer is worth it for some - but not me.

I explained I purchased a new printer and if I send it to the seller they will give me a refurbished machine. The company refused to make a wrong right.

Basically, Elena Jr.'s lover finds out that the mother is still alive, and not killed in Africa in 1975. Then, Elena goes to New York and then Kenya on a whim. We met a stoned, confused man named Forester who was Elena Sr.'s lover. Then we are bored to death, and cannot care less what happens to the whiny heroine. Next time, Ahl should create a character we can actually relate to. The novel takes its title from a 1975 Dylan album, the perfect title that a poseur would use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar Entertainment!","review":"Fantastic book! So funny and informative...

Concrete is a solid album, capturing Fear Factory during their extreme death metal days. Aswell as some classic songs revisited (and better sounding in my opinion), we are also given some never before heard material. Songs like \\"Anxiety\\" and \\"Ulceration\\" are probably the best examples, seeing as there some of the best songs. The production has a very raw muddy feel to it, which makes the album all the more brutal and better (is that an amp line buzz i hear in begining?) Either way this Fear Factory album is a must have for any die-hard fan, or anyone who is still healing from the wounds of their break-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmmm","review":"This cd has a real raw and gritty sound to it that you won't find on their other albums. The only bad thing is that all the songs sound just alike. When I first got it I stuck it into my cd player and started to listen to it and after about ten minutes I thought that this was 1 long song so I looked at the track number and it said number 3. I was shocked because those songs sounded the same. Sometimes I put this on the stero at work and turn it up because it it helps me get my work done faster.

Slayer completely blew them away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear Factory's unofficial first album","review":"This album was recorded back in 1991 before Fear Factory even had a label. But it was recorded at Blackie Lawless's recording studio, so it has quality to it. It was never released however at the time because the band left the producer who threw this album together for them, so when they signed with RoadRunner, they re-recorded most of the songs from this album. Unfortunately, although exactly half of the songs from this album were re-recorded for their official debut (Soul of a New Machine), they were never able to top the recordings on this album. It's bone-crunching in every way you can imagine. Nearly all of the songs were later re-done by the band, even beyond Soul of a New Machine, but you'll never find better versions of these songs than on this album. Bone-crunching, loud, heavy, death metal from Fear Factory, if it wasn't for a select few tracks from their official studio release, this would be all you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Demo Now Released!","review":"Previous reviewers either did not review this fairly or with much information. This is the first FF demo, recorded in '91, produced by a then unknown Ross Robinson. It contains a few songs later rerecorded on \\"Soul Of A New Machine\\", and other treasures never otherwise released. However, some of the songs possess a rawer, harder edge on this album than the aforementioned successor. If you like FF's earlier work, this is a must buy, and will not disappoint fans of grindcore or early death metal in the Carcass and Napalm Death vein. Arguably FF's best release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality!","review":"I was very impressed when I received my Medline transport chair! It is very heavy-duty and of excellent qualiity!

Please note that I have given this item a one star rating only because the form would not accept a zero star rating. This item was manufactured in China, as are most of the wheelchairs.

While strolling through the cobblestone streets of Sorrento, my husband stepped on the rear foot pad for leverage and pushed down on the handles to lift my mother up onto a curb and SNAP! The left handle broke in half and was dangling! My husband is strong and was able to maneuver her so we could get through the rest of the day, but the very next day we had to find a hardware store (not an easy task in Italy) and have a metal rod cut to size so we could fashion a make-shift handle.

The chair has 2 types of brakes. One is a lever brake on each side of the rear wheels. This brake works fine. The other is a hand brake used with each of the handles used to push the chair. I have adjusted them according to the directions and they still do not brake the rear wheels very well. It's not a huge problem due to the fact that I always use the lever brakes to secure the chair anyway. Overall, I am very pleased with this chair.

I, like many of you true music fans, am cursed with a song always running through me cranium, and this is my new ailment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Folds is a musical genious....","review":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet, Ben Folds is one of the absolute best modern singer-songwriters around today. He is a story teller, that is for sure. He gets us entrapted in the story of the song. He is a musical biographer, painting pictures with his piano the way few today can. He leaves me speechless. He is one of the few artists whose albums I can play start to finish and never skip over one song. He is always a \\"hit\\", never a \\"miss\\". Not to mention his piano playing and overall musicianship is beyond comparison. I have seen Ben live now three times and his performances never get old. Buy buy buy this album. Even pay for it new, instead of used (something I rarely do). You will not be sorry. And oh yah, this album surely kicks butt. Can't pick a favorite, I love them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Disagree With the Other Reviews","review":"This is a great CD, probably the best disc I have purchased all year. I agree with the reviewer below, this is just a solid set of songs. The title track (not bad) is the weakest song on here and it is not horrible by any means. Melodies, and hooks galore but there is a maturity in writing that Ben Folds has only hinted at in previous discs. Messner (the last CD) only hinted at what is on here. However, while I thought that disc was a little uneven, this one is solid from start to finish. If you are looking for something you can buy and play over and over, this is it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ben Folds Music.","review":"On hearing \\"Rockin' the Suburbs\\" on the radio, I thought Ben might be on a new tack- it's a catchy, poppy head-bobber with prominent guitars and Ben's signature sense of humor about being white and middle-classed....I bought it, curious.If \\"Rockin' the Suburbs\\" could be compared to a tasty burger and fries combo, the rest of the album is filet mignon- with a rich, sweet dessert at the end.Standout songs will vary, depending on your taste. If you like Folds' upbeat songs, you'll like \\"Rockin',\\" \\"Annie Waits,\\" and the poignant \\"Gone.\\" If you like his quieter, more somber tone, try \\"Carrying Cathy\\" and \\"Fred Jones Part 2,\\" which features a recurring tragic hero who first appeared on \\"Whatever and Ever, Amen.\\"Somewhat of a departure is the final track, \\"The Luckiest,\\" which is an unashamed love song. It's sweet and slow-moving, but original and not at all sappy.I love Ben Folds and everything he's done to date. This album is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Songwriter","review":"This is a very good CD. Ben is definitely a great songwriter and composer. I do wish he would \\"rock this b**ch\\" a bit more though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who likes Ben Folds, I do","review":"Ok, Fred Jones part II is one of my all time favortie songs. How anyone can say that song is just ok is insane. Blink 182 songs are just \\"ok\\", this song is a masterpiece. This album has never lost its zest for me and i could out this cd on every night and it is still just as moving. This is one of those albums that is great to listen to when its raining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folds Does it Again","review":"Being a fan of Ben Folds Five, I figured I would like this as well. Got it from a friend, but didn't really listen to it right away. I went to a wedding and the song the bride and groom used for the first dance was \\"The Luckiest\\". I hadn't heard it before, but I could tell it was Ben Folds and I assumed it was on this album that I hadn't listened to, so I got it out.This is an excellent disc. I have always enjoyed Folds lyrics and writing, and this is no different. There are some very somber songs, like \\"Fred Jones Part 2\\", and others with Folds comedic geneous, like the title track. A couple songs I don't care for, which is why I can't give it five stars, but other than that, this CD is very well done. Very much along the same lines as previous Ben Folds Five releases. If you like the older Ben Folds Five stuff, this will not dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben is back and as good as ever","review":"A great solo debut...Ben didn't disappoint his many fans, especially those of us who were there in the early Cat's Cradle & Brewery days of Ben Folds Five and still thirsty for more. I admit I was very nervous, not being a huge fan of Fear of Pop, over what direction he might take with this album. Ben did what Ben does best, making fun of Pop Music by mixing intelligent and sarcastic lyrics with his trademark piano and a great mix of guitar and drums. Excellent work Mr. Folds"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Folds Flawless","review":"Ben Folds bucks conventional wisdom and produces a solo album better than his already fabulous work with the Five. Everything on this CD from the ironic lyrics of the most commercial track, \\"Rockin the Suburbs\\", to the breathtaking \\"The Ascent of Stan\\", to the simply flawless \\"Still Fighting It\\" begs for a re-listen. This CD is destined to be on many people's favorite list. It's already on mine, and I've owned the CD for only a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top five albums of all time!","review":"Its a strange story how i discovered Ben Folds... I was having a rummage through songs on a particular guitar chords achive and accidently clicked on Ben folds....I had never heard of him and being extremely bored at the time... i tried playing the songs how i thought they would go and then listened to them....and instantly fell in love... Brick was the first song I heard and you'd be surprised how similar my version was before even hearing it! I then searched through everything that had the slightest connection to this songwriting genious....This is by far my favourite album....And it has a pretty damn good chance of being one of my favourites..... of all time....Fave songs.... Gone, Still fighting it, Fred Jones pt2... Annie waits.... oh jesus christ! I love em all!Beautiful piano... delicious vocals..spectacular songs... get this album!!!!!!!!!!1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Brilliant! Wonderful!","review":"Ben Folds is the only musician i know who can sing the line \\"Mother[...]\\" with a beautiful melody and harmony and gets away with it. Totally brilliant album! I can imagine this album with the Five still around, it could have been better with Robert Sledge and Darren Jessee. But, what the heck, let's move on, don't we? The album is still one of the best in Ben's catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben's genius did not \\"fold\\" with the end of the band.","review":"Pardon the pun :O)Ben Folds Five, one of the many bands that had an impact on my life in some way or another. When they announced their breakup I felt heart broken, only to have my spirits rekindled with the release of \\"Rockin' the Suburbs\\". True, Ben's style is a little different this time around, possibly because he is trying to prove his individuality. One thing that truly impressed me was the fact Ben played most of the instruments on this release, aside from the electric guitar on \\"Rockin' the suburbs\\" that is. We can see that he hasn't left behind his old musical style completly, which is brillantly showcased on the sing-along anthem \\"Still fighting it\\". But don't get me wrong, those who loved Ben Folds Five will more than likely find themselves immersed in this amazing, amazing, amazing (sorry couldn't help myself) album. Keep up the good...actually keep up the great work Ben, for one, I can't wait for the next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"This CD is great. Ben Folds has done it again. The lyrics are great. A cd you will listen to over and over. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The four stars for for the original CD release . .","review":". . . however, I can't see any reason to pay $35 for one bonus track, when I was able to download \\"Hiro's Song\\" off the internet. Save your money and buy the domestic release of this great CD :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad track on this CD","review":"This is one of those rare CD's where every single song is fantastic. I purchased this 4-5 months ago and have not been able to remove it from my CD car changer. I really can't understand why this guy isn't more popular than he is, I picked up \\"WAEA\\" and \\"Biography...\\" and they are also outstanding. \\"Annie Waits\\", \\"Losing Lisa\\", \\"Still Fighting\\", \\"The Luckiest\\" are my favs but the whole CD is terrific. This gets my highest recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben Folds has talent but bad language.","review":"Some of the songs on this album are excellent (The Lucky One, for example), but I was disappointed with how much profanity there is in this CD. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet sweet Moses, incredible CD!","review":"If superlatives ostracize then this review is doomed to be prematurely ignored. Simply wonderful. Each song is a joy. My favorite is Not the Same, where Ben laments the ineluctable change that life brings about. Who hasn't had a friend who was changed brutally and wistfully wished you could make it better: you were not the same after that! The Luckiest is sublime, and Carrying Cathy is sad and marvellous. I could keep going, but see for yourself. It will be very hard for Ben to follow this one up. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Magnificent","review":"When I first heard the song Rockin' The Suburbs I was some what put off by the explicit lyrics. The second song I listened to by Bed FOlds I absolutely loved. I kept listeneing and could not put the music down. I love his music and I have listened to his CD hundreds of times. His voice is beutiful and the lyrics to his songs are wonderful and touching. When it comes to the paino accampaniment I have heard none better. The last songf on his CD \\"The luckiest\\" is the absolute mmost beautiful song ever written and I listen to it over and over again. His other top songs are \\"Annie Waits\\" \\"Still FIghting It\\" \\"Zak and Sara\\" \\"Fred Jones Pt. 2\\" and \\"Losing Lisa\\". Thy are so wonderful. I reccomend this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Spectacular Work from Ben Folds","review":"I must agree with the other reviewers here. I'm amazed at Ben Folds' ability to always deliver a fresh and inventive set of tracks. This album continues in the great tradition of Ben Folds Five albums. I also was taken aback by the breakup of the group after having loved \\"Messner\\" so dearly. In any case, this is an excellent CD and guaranteed to fix your Ben Folds needs. I'm currently enjoying \\"Gone\\" as we speak.You won't be disappointed; I know that I wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without it!","review":"This album is one that I can't imagine having to live without. Each track is extremely powerful both musically and lyrically. As a fan of Jellyfish, They Might Be Giants, and the Barenaked Ladies, I highly recommend this album. My favorite tracks are The Luckiest, The Ascent of Stan, and Still Fighting It."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent piano action","review":"This is a pretty good album. I bought it for the single Rockin' the Suburbs which the version on here isn't as good as the single version but is still pretty good. Other songs on here also have some great piano action. Annie Waits would be the best and the fastest one. Zak and Sara starts of instrumental wise like the song by Robbie Williams Let Me Entertain You then becomes unique and is not bad. A lot of songs on here are sort of television show/movie soundtrack instrumental sounding with lyrics over the top. Most are a lot slower than Rockin' the Suburbs and none except Annie Waits reach that song's brilliance. That doesn't mean those songs aren't good though. This is an excellent CD to have as background music or when actually concentrating on listening and enjoying the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I think that this was one of the most complete, well-done albums I have listened to in years. Flows from the introspective on \\"Still Fighting It\\" to the rocking, smart, catchy title track, \\"Rockin' the Suburbs\\". Not a bad track on the disk. I HIGHLY recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben's Return","review":"When Ben Folds Five announced their break up, many fans like myself doubted that any of them could be as spectacular in their solo careers as they were together. Much to my surprise, this album is actually BETTER than the albums the group did together.Ben has matured as a songwriter, adding more subtelty where there was once raw emotion. The painstaking recording process has paid off. The instrumentation is varied and tight, and the arrangements leave nothing to be desired. There are no bad cuts, with the notable exception of the title track. Highlights include Annie Waits, Still Fighting It, and Fred Jones.All in all, this is a tremendous album, a seminal work in the career of one of the worlds most underrated songwriters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solo album worth waiting for","review":"Ben Folds Five is my favorite band, and it was sad to hear that the trio decided to part ways. However, it's a welcome relief that the songwriting of Ben Folds continues, and is richly displayed in his new solo album. I admire his talent for being able to compose, as well as play most of the instruments on the recording as well as provinding his own harmonies.The magic of his music hasn't changed much from his creative phrasing and catching tunes. The mood of this album is introspective melancholy and mellowness mixed together.It's rare that I buy an album which I enjoy every track from beginning to end - and after the twelve songs on this CD, I'm left wanting more. This is definitely a CD which will be well loved and well played."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few decent songs, mostly pop schlock","review":"This is certainly not the worst album I've heard or bought, but it's pretty far down there. I bought the album, like many, because of the title track because it was clever and fun. However the rest is pretty much pop ballads, and it becomes painfully obvious how important the other two members of the five were to Folds' creative process. It really is disappointing because Ben Folds Five is among my favorite bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Ben folds, But not his Best CD! Not too bad though!","review":"What happened Ben? I just love your piano playing and almost all of your other songs. This is not the best album he has done..But it is still very catchy. Check out his others for his better work too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five stars?!?!? Are you people high????","review":"It's the rare brilliant musician who can simply go it alone, dump their band, and do one of those self-produced, hey-I-played-all-the-instruments-on-this-album albums, and have it really have it all work out and be as groovy as they planned. Ben Folds, sadly, is not one of those rare, brilliant musicians. This is, sadly, a leaden effort, aided in a macabre fashion by all the antiseptic glory of modern recording technologies; technically without flaw, yet utterly without the compelling vigor that once typified Folds' work. I suppose it was inevitable that something like this would happen, after this quirky novelty rocker became a fixture in the \\"modern rock\\" Top 40. But for whatever reason, this album sounds belaboured and sterile, and isn't worth the listener's time. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me want to shoot myself (in a good way)","review":"This is perhaps one of the most depressing albums I've listened to in a long time. Just about every one of the songs touched me in a very deep and personal way, especially Gone, Fred Jones pt 2, and The Ascent of Stan. All of the albums Ben's been a part of (with the possible exception of Fear of Pop) have had haunting tracks which have stuck to my soul for a long time and given me shivers just on recollection, but this album has pinpointed areas which reflect my deepest fears and insecurities, and placed them under intense scrutiny. Many albums have songs that evoke tears - some of the tracks on this nearly got me to sob. The beautiful, chilling music fits this theme wonderfully. The music is beautiful, haunting, and of the highest quality. Just do yourself a favor and keep it put away for a rainy day. This album has the potential to kill a good mood, at least for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is great musically and in general","review":"this cd is great for all ben folds five fans and those who appreciate good music in general.....by far my favorite song is \\"the luckiest.\\" i must admit it has a tendency to bring tears to my eyes...still i like the majority of the rest of the songs, if i had to pick two more they'd be \\"still fighting it\\" and \\"fred jones part 2\\"....i loved fred jones part 2 initially but once i realized john mccrea of cake provides additional vocals i had to like it even more........in conclusion....get this disc if ya know what's good for ya!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Folds' Tremendous Solo Effort","review":"I was a big fan of Ben Folds Five, and so I've eagerly awaited the release of this CD. It shows that even without the rest of the Five, Ben Folds can do what he does best- write music. \\"The Luckiest\\" is a beautiful love song that will either make you think of your significant other, or dream of the one you wish you had. In my opinion, two of the best tracks are \\"Losing Lisa\\" and \\"Carrying Cathy\\", which show Folds' unbelievable ability to convey compassion in his music. All in all, this is a great CD, that I would have given five stars were it not for the title track, which falls just short of being truly comic material in its annoying repetition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still awesome","review":"Like many others, I was skeptical of this album after the breakup and after hearing \\"Rockin' the Suburbs\\". Those fears were unnecessary. The honesty of Ben Folds' voice and lyrics still amazes me. \\"The Luckiest\\" may be the sweetest, prettiest love song I have ever heard. If you liked his previous work, you must own this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I love this CD. This is one of the CD's that you can like every song on the album. It is one to have in any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Pop Power & WASP Angst...","review":"This is my first Ben Folds Cd. I bought it on a whim, (along w/a Radney Foster cd). To this aging boomer's ears this is pure ear candy. Not everyone can pull off this type of smugly cynical tunes.The man turns his musical eye on almost every phase of upper middle class life. The lyrics are spot on, & hooks abound. Religion,relationships,retirement & everything in between are all here. Great lyrics that continue to jump into your ear abound. When Ben screams the F word it's almost impossible to not scream it w/him. The title tune is the center piece. It also ends the song cycle. It is followed by a somewhat treacly love song that's just ok. The rest rocks & if you don't like the CD,YOU'Re FIRED..."},{"rating":"2","title":"looking for decent learner's dictionary","review":"As a new learner of welsh, the strength of this dictionary is it is easy to use, highlights clearly where the mutations occur and is good on examples of usage.

If I had to choose two books to own for guitar repair and general info, it would be this one and the Earlewine book. The first thing you'll notice is the quality of the illustrations and the photos. The pages are coated stock and all the photos are in color and incredibly detailed, unlike many other guitar books that have \\"cheezy\\" grey scale photos and crude hand drawn diagrams.What really amazed me was how current and relevant the information is. Many of the pickups and bridges mentioned for example, are the newest models available. The wiring diagrams and modifications are very easy to understand and are quite useful.If you're looking for info on setting up your Gibson or Fender, this is the book. It's well laid out and written, informative without being boring, and has incredible photographs, illustrations, and diagrams.Once again, five stars and a definite keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Starter","review":"Dan Erlewine is great, but can be daunting when you are just starting to work on your own guitar.

Some of Todd's \\"third rate\\" former rockers are...good, and his songs are so wonderful that I never get tired of hearing them re-interpreted. (These sound like all-new arrangements to me, not old vocal tracks with new bands. Listen.) When it comes to romantic pop craftsmanship, beautiful lyrics and passionate singing, Todd is tops. I think his songwriting alone ranks with Cole Porter, and he stands the test of time very well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skunk Does Todd Just Fine - No Stinker!","review":"I'll make this short. Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter, the author of perhaps the greatest if not the most recognizable rock solo of all time ('Reeling In The Years'), cooks up a splendid version of 'Something To Fall Back On.'

That's a lot of hype of course, but I have feeling about this guy. Maybe I'm wrong, but I heard him on NPR reading two pieces from a collection that he's working on now, and I had to stop my car to listen. This is what I heard: here, a rural man speaks to his \\"boss\\" an overseer of some sort--God I guess, but less remote:I drew a little line Boss / then I drew a little circle / then I spit in the dirt / and rubbed it all together / but nothing happened Boss / nothing at all so I wiped / my dirty hands on my face / and walked around bare-chested / as ever but I didn't go to the river / no I just walked around and around / the way a bird drags a bad wing Boss / and I was dragging bottom / you must have seen me there . . . .Listen to those beats humming from the simple repetition.

This book is a theatrical production--a triumphant coming together of imagination, personality and style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical book","review":"A pitch-perfect collection; he trains our ears as we read these poems. There is an excitement and a perfection to the phrases, which are rollicking at one moment, then in the same moment turning humble and steady, quietly suggesting meanings so subtle you could never have seen them coming (think, Bishop). There is true word-magic here, that hits you before you've had time to get beyond the surface of the lines; you feel the meaning before you apprehend it. Also, there's incredible humor shooting through all of it, and things you've thought a thousand times but have never heard expressed before (drinking down firefly light, so it lights up your own chest, on a lonely summer night)! Definitely read this book; it will open anyone's conception of what poetry can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profiles secular people very well","review":"Hunter effectively pinpoints and labels the different personality catorgories that \\"secular people\\" typically fall into.

Dipping into Shattuck's guide helps to keep your spinning thoughts in their proper orbit. I checked five stars, although reading Proust has raised (for me at least) many questions this book simply does not seem to address. At least Shattuck provides a really decent basic orientation. I am not certain a Kindle edition is the best way to go on a \\"Field Guide\\" where flipping back and forth between pages is helpful, but I was anxious to have this in a hurry. Odd -- to be in a hurry when reading Proust! Not advised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Read Proust","review":"No book as good as In Search of Lost Time needs a reading plan. Books like Shattuck's, while not without interest, create a silly mystique about texts which are quite approachable on their own.Bottom line: if you're looking up this book and reading this review, you can read and enjoy Proust without help. If you find that In Search of Lost Time is too confusing or boring (rather than the invigorating, funny, moving spectacle it struck me as being) then stop and read something else. It's OK if it's not your sort of book.

I needed video switching too for the VCR and DVD and the NAD stereo receiver I considered did not have this feature or phono. The H/K 3380 ties eveything together with a nice sound signature, but no musical magic as my separates do. Phono preamp was a suprise, very good, but the linestage does lack that something special. The tuner was another suprise, as I am in a very bad FM locale, but the H/K pulls in everything and I don't have to set it on mono to get rid of noise. Overall, I think this product is a very good value. H/K needs to solve the iPod linkage issue for their stereo models.

Seriously. Not what I expecting from Nash. I had been anticipating this CD for some time and was totally disapointed.Get rid of the duets, get back on the booze, call up King and tell him you need a swift kick.

On a lighter note, I cracked up over the entire Chunt Brothers/Herr Starr sections, especially where Starr gave Cyrus a hand! (too funny!)

So it was not a \\"talkie\\" per se, but something in between. Without those sound effects, this 1929 silent two-reeler directed by Lewis Foster is obviously missing something. In the first reel the boys try to serve Edgar Kennedy with a summons for his radio, while the second finds them pursuing him in and around his house in high slapstick style. As is true of many Laurel & Hardy comedy shorts of this period, the story is be Leo McCarey and George Stevens is behind the camera. Of course, both would go on to cinematic fame in their own rights. Kennedy's wife in this film is another one of Hal Roach's stable of players, Jean Harlow. \\"Bacon Grabbers,\\" a great title although I must admit I do not see the connection to the story, is an above average Laurel & Hardy silent short."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely","review":"I ordered these for a show I was acting in, and they are beautiful!

Virtually every song plods along at about the same speed. Further, \\"Misery\\" hides the guitars and drums way in the background--many of the songs are less like songs themselves than excuses to structure boring harpsichord loops and melodies.I'm not calling this album a \\"sell out\\" or anything like that.

It's good if you're a Simpsons fan who just wants something to view on a plane or long car trip. It's only 9 bucks, so it obviously was popular with the average fan.But if you're a hardcore fan like me who's collecting every season, you won't waste your money on this and instead wait for the next season to come out.It really depends on what you're looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel cheated","review":"I bought this DVD because I thought it would contain spoof's of Star Wars for my son.

Under the Influences has so many great songs from the past, brought back to life with a standup bass, power chords and one hell of a voice. I defy anybody to listen to \\"All I Can Do Is Cry\\" and \\"Big Iron\\" and tell me this is not a GREAT album. Those two songs alone make this a five star album.

But once you've heard the real thing you'll never want to listen to anything else. For example, the \\"Dream Ballet\\" music in this new version stinks in comparison to the wonderful movie version, which so perfectly depicted the joy of Laurie's wedding day turning to horror at the hands of the menacing Jud Fry.

The orchestrations have been livened up, and the ensemble work is impressive all around. Reading the booklet, one gets the sense of what Trevor Nunn et al were going for in this revival, and seeing the photos makes me wonder why the heck this isn't on video or DVD?

This cd is House, dance music that will keep your ears and feet interested throughout the CD. I do highly reccommend this CD. All these tracks at a very good price too.

Just listened to it for the first time, and while I don't know how I'd feel about it years ago when I first picked it up on impulse, based on the strong roster of artists, it certainly is a big flop today.

The widescreen print is marred by minor imperfections every few minutes, but is basically in good shape, with rich colors and good sound. I have my doubts that the comic-relief chicken appeared anywhere in the original Poe source material, but I guess worse travesties have been committed in the name of \\"artistic interpretation\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design, break easily","review":"I am an Art teacher that has been using Fiskars student scissors for 10+ years. When I received my latest order of scissors, they were of this new type with the \\"larger\\" handles (exactly like these, but without the \\"softgrip\\"). Because of the new way that the blades are seated into the handles, they are prone to become loose and wobbly, eventually rendering them impossible to cut with. This is at the plastic connection point, not the pivot screw, so they cannot be re-tightened. I have 10 year old pairs of the other style that cut better than these new ones. Furthermore, the new, \\"larger\\" handles actually have smaller finger openings-- so they are uncomfortable for larger-handed students to use or for adults to demonstrate with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Craft Scissors -- TSA Safe","review":"I have a pair that I used for years. I have them on a cheap chain I can place around my neck so I do not lose them. I have had more expensive 'needlework' scissors that I often misplace. I work on needlework when I can and these do what I expect them to do. They have blunt tips, so if you need to 'un-stitch' something, you have to use something else. They have not caused any notice from security as they are blunt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid Friendly","review":"When my niece and nephew come over, they like to do crafts and these scissors work great for them.

Standing still, they are crystal clear. I own a dozen Blu-rays of ballets, including several produced by Opus Arte, and they all look magnificent and sharp - even in extremely fast movement. I previously bought the DVD of this title, but returned it to the shop as defective. So imagine my disappointment when I saw that the Blu-ray was just as blurry. Hopefully, Opus Arte will correct this when a new pressing is due, but that might take years, I'm afraid. I advise potential customers to stay away from \\"Jewels\\". Watching this \\"smear\\" gave me a headache and was painful to the eyes. What a pity, as this a a gorgeous balett."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 star production, blurry image","review":"I had to chime in to (unfortunately) totally agree with Lars Sandell's \\"Beware of fuzzy dancers\\" review, in hopes that it might speed Opus Arte to remaster and re-release this wonderful ballet. This production of Jewells is beautifully danced by beautiful dancers but, as Mr. Sandell said, once they start moving, the blurring begins. And watching it did in fact begin to give me a headache. I'm a bit torn about a purchase of this blu-ray. I felt lucky to acquire it at a good price and, having never experienced this ballet before, loved being able to see it - sort of - but I can't recommend anyone purchase this particular disk. Opus Arte MUST remaster it. Otherwise, I suggest looking for a different production."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is outdated!","review":"We just returned from a trip to New York City. I am a HUGE fan of Access books and have used them for cities around the world for the last 14 years. However, the current version of the New York City Access is woefully outdated and was a waste of money. We found several businesses had moved and one, the venerable Balducci's, had gone of out business. Needless to say, this de-railed us a few times and was inconvenient to say the least.Things change quickly in New York. If Access wants to be in the business of publishing guides of New York, they need to commit to annual updates."},{"rating":"2","title":"New York user's manual","review":"This book has undergone some big changes from the last edition, namely in the format which is less readable than before. But Access doesn't get bogged down in history like other guidebooks feel obliged to do, and the listings are snappy without being smarmy like, notably, the Rough Guides. There could have been more listings downtown and some of the gay listings are out of date but for restaurants and hotels the book can't be beat. Too bad the reviews can't be downloaded onto a Palm Pilot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has anyone told the author how out-of-date he is?","review":"I have always loved the format of ACCESS books but to be honest, the last 3 guides to NYC have been very outdated. I feel as if the author has told a flunkie to \\"check the websites\\" of all the places listed in the book, and that the flunkie then quit his job and the author just published the edition from 10 years ago. I cannot continue to purchase the Access books knowing this is the case. I wonder if the author reads his own reviews on Amazon (I kind of doubt it). He should stop wasting his and our time by publishing out of date books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Access New York City (Access New York City, 9th Ed)","review":"I did not find this book to be a helpful guide to New York. Instead of interesting tidbits about each neighborhood, I found that this guide is comprised mostly of lists of restaurants and businesses. In addition, commercial logos are printed all over each page, making the guide seem more like a touristy advertisement. If you're looking for an \\"insider's guide,\\" this is not it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"who wants a book with a weak, pathetic hero?","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The hero (who is a Duke) is morally and physically weak. Usually an author gives her characters some positive characteristics to balance out the non positive characteristics... You know if the Duke is morally bankrupt at least he's rich or charming. This Duke's totally pathetic. Yuk. His only \\"obsession\\" is his love for Maria who has been incarcerated in an asylum for the last few years thanks his grandmother the Dowager Duchess. He's so whimpy that he even abandon's his search for his missing child so that Dowager Duchess won't reveal that he is a bastard. None of the characters in this book are likeable, the main characters are so caught up in their personal angst that there's hardly any interaction that's positive and zero romance. Despite our hero's eleventh hour epithany, the book is a loser. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this supposed to be a romance novel?","review":"The back cover of this book in no way let the reader know what she was in for. Had I known the heroine had been in an insane asylum for 3 years, I would not have touched the book. I have never cared for stories told in the \\"first person,\\" so that was initially a strike against this book for me also. While I have always admired the beauty of Katherine Sutcliffe's writing, this book was indeed a struggle to get through--the main male/female characters never even had a conversation until nearly 200 pages into the book much less had a chance to have any kind of progress toward a love story. Save your sheckels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are you Katherine Sutcliffe?","review":"I refuse to believe that Ms. Sutcliffe wrote this god awful mess. I think this was one of the biggest disappointments I've ever had with a book. This was an author I would automatically buy as soon as her books came out and I feel almost tricked. This was not a romance. The hero and heroine have about 5 pages of actual dialogue together. I don't mind dark gothic styled stories, they're actually my favorite, but this story was just depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got my money back!","review":"Thank goodness the store where I bought this book had a money-back guarantee if you didn't enjoy it, because I HATED this one! I would give it zero stars if I could. Does KS really think she can pass these off as the same two people from \\"Devotion\\"? Because I don't recognize either one of them now. The two strong people who fought for what they wanted (each other) in the previous novel are nowhere to be found here. Trey is the worst - where is his spirit and backbone? And he and Maria don't get so much as a tender kiss in the whole novel. I gave \\"Devotion\\" 3 stars because it ended so abruptly, but looking back I wish KS had left us hanging forever with that one. This wrap-up is a disaster and I will try to forget I ever read it. If you liked \\"Devotion\\" at all please don't ruin your memory of it with this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not a romance.","review":"This was my first book by this author, and it will be my last. When the book first started, I was a little surprised to see that it was told in the first person from the hero's point of view, and that snagged my interest. I spent the rest of the book simply becoming more and more angry at the weakness of the hero and the fact that he allowed his lover to continue to live in his house and share his bed (you read that correctly) while his supposed love of his life was down the hall, having been rescued from an insane asylum. He was no hero. The only character with personality was the lover, Edwina, and she was manipulative and self serving. Trey and Maria end up together at the end, and it is by some miracle apparently, because they certainly never had a real conversation. This book had real potential, but was obviously poorly planned and written to make a buck. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whine, wine, whine and wine!","review":"No, make that port.

Not for Ringwald's (or anyone's) performance, however.The payoff of the plot--the actual \\"brutal truth\\"--was horrific, unexpected. . .and upsetting. Such scenes are usually handled with tact, grace, respect for the audience and the audience's responses. This scene in particular did not do so by any stretch of the imagination. Following on the heels of disjointed scene changes and little character development (who are these people? tell me, as the audience, why I should care), the payoff scene was even more offputting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Idea Executed Poorly","review":"The actual plot of this movie was not that bad, but the casting and dialogue really destroyed any chance this movie had for being watchable. Christina Applegate is a good actress, but she has a very small role. The storyline strayed here and there and never successfully satisfied the viewer's curiosity. The only aspect that kept my interest was Moon Unit Zappa's performance, as a quick-witted and lonely lesbian. If you like Moon Zappa, get the movie; otherwise, save your money, and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christina Applegate did not star in this movie","review":"Christina Applegate was on screen for a total of about 10 minutes. While that may work for Marlon Brando in Superman it did not work here for Christina. This is a very pretentious, predictable mish mash that actually stars a bunch of people better suited for an Ed Wood production. This is another example of a movie trying to get milage from a performer with name recognition, no matter how small her part. The same was done in \\"From Dusk 'Til Dawn 2\\", starring Tiffany Amber Thiessan. She was in that movie for about 5 minutes, then killed off. Don't fall for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brutal Truth","review":"If you're a stoner, you may enjoy this week-end cabin flopping, never-ending drone of apparently a half-dozen out-of-work actors who clearly had nothing else better to do but to transcript one of their pot-head boring parties. It was one of those few misconceived independent film attempts that is amateurish on every level, and I couldn't fast-forward through it fast enough. All the while I was watching it, I was hoping Christina Applegate (Married with Children fame) would come in and save this story. But she only shows in a disappointing series of short flashbacks, except for her terrorized cameo roll toward the end that she performed near perfection. In a short while, you quickly hope this film transforms into another teen hatchet picture---if only to halt the harangues. But these resilient characters just keep on breathing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRUTALLY BAD","review":"If you liked THE BIG CHILL, you probably won't like THE BRUTAL TRUTH. Trying to set the same kind of mood as the CHILL, TRUTH offers us characters that are hardly likeable, a slow moving and banal plot, and acting that should make the actors responsible feel very embarrassed. The writer tries to make Emily (Christina Applegate in a very small role) appear to be some kind of saint who changes everyone's life she touches. The big \\"secret\\" is hardly that devastating for Emily, but one of her friends is pregnant with a baby that was the result of a brutal rape. The movie has about a dozen worthless songs that they keep putting in, along with mood shots of the reflective actors. Johnathon Schaech (Judas, The Forsaken) appears as some writer who ends up narrating the story, with a really coy and ridiculous ending. Moon Zappa appears as a lesbian, and the other actors merely go through the motions.An independent film that proves that not all indies are so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brutal Truth","review":"This pretentious and uneven movie tries to be a twenty-something Big Chill and fails miserably. What Christina Applegate (who is in the film for all of five minutes) is doing in such a horrible movie, I have no idea. The film centers around a group of old friends, none of whom are even remotely interesting, and has a \\"message\\" about not running from your past that's about as insultingly simplistic and empty-headed as the rest of the script. In addition, it uses something as hideous as sexual assault in a cavalier and \\"oh by the way, this is what happened\\" manner that brings new depth to the term \\"gratuitous\\". How and or why this movie was made is beyond me. Awful, not even worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE LITTLE CHILL","review":"The film is divided into two parts. In the first part Emily has a great relationship with a swing. A group of friends have a reunion at a country home which Emily invites them to. Then Emily has a bad relationship with a swing and the group becomes isolated due to the earthquake that happened at the same time. They examine their lives and ignore the gorilla in the living room, i.e. the reason why Emily had a bad relationship with the rope of the swing.The dialouge bored me as did the soundtrack and the lame narration at the beginning of the film. If anything, it was funny to watch good actors struggle with a lousy role and lines. Worthy of a pass. The flashback scene was stupid. They could have done a far better job.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, brief nudity (Jennifer Daly?), off screen rape."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish it were good, but it just wasn't","review":"I like Christina Applegate and Molly Ringwald, which is why it is hard to believe this movie was so bad. And not in any kind of cultish or campy way. It was just bad like it wasn't done from a script, just from jumbled notes, with pages missing. Characters seem to explode or make speeches at random, and you feel like missing scenes and lots of characterization that should have preceded these episodes might have explained them and made them relavent/believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is not Christina Applegate's caliber of movie","review":"I'm a huge Christina Applegate fan. I have been since my days in the Marines, when all we could get on the tube were \\"Married w/Children\\" reruns, in the Gulf War. I was very angry when \\"Jesse\\" got cancelled also.

The commentary is also very informative concerning breeds not necessarily known by horse enthusiasts in the U.

Written as if it could be a sociology text, there is more interesting cultural information than in anything I've read in a long time. The history of the horse as we know it today is laid out in such a fasinating way that even those who may not love horses will come to admire the remarkable relationship they have with man. True, we have organized their strengths around our needs; however, this book captures the essence of their unique spirit and spiritual connection with man."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"I am disappointed with this purchase. I didn't realize the book is so small, about half the size of an 8\\" by 11\\" piece of paper. The pictures are all very dark, set against a brown backdrop.

I wish I had gone with another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but I don't get it.","review":"Maybe this deserved a three, but to offset all the 5's I've entered a two star rating. Basically, I agree with the comments made by the two and below star commenters--darkish photos, small book, disappointing. Maybe I just don't have a discerning eye for photography(?). Am I missing something here? The paper quality, size of the book, lighting of the photos, clarity, all seem lacking to me. Maybe it's art and I'm missing something. But if you are looking for photos that jump out at you like say photos suitable for a horse calendar, this is NOT it. Amazingly, I would venture to guess that not even one photo is \\"horse calendar\\" material. Not one. So back to my point. Maybe horse calendar photography is \\"commercial art.\\" I must be missing something here because the photographer is said to be award winning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half painted bycicle","review":"I ordered the Pt Cruiser Tour Edition for my daughter birthday.When it arrived....it was not the same bycicle showed in thepicture!!

So, bought the Sourdough Rye instead, and glad I did because it has broadened my selection of favorite WASA brand crispbreads. And while I normally avoid products with yeast, I feel that the toasty crispness of the sourdough rye has neutralized any negative aspects (that yeast is a negative is my story and I'm stickin' to it!) that may be derived from containing yeast. As for taste, great by itself or topped with a slice of ham with sauerkraut, or even with other varied toppings such as water packed sardines or blueberry preserves. Oh, some more good news is that moths will try to eat through the package of rye crispbreads, which means what's inside is edible for humans too. I keep mine stored in the freezer, because it is so valuable. Should be a good nutrient source in case of prolonged emergencies as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with supplier EVA","review":"Ordered 4 in 1 steel commode and received product described as 3 in 1 commode.

I have tried several others and I like Panasonic the best.I have not had them long enough to know anything about the battery life, but read the reviews and hope the batteries will be easier to find and cheaper.The first thing I was not happy with was the instruction booklet. Second, the phone keeps a list of every phone call, even if the same person called 5 times. Therefore, there is a lot of deleting to be done or it takes up space for numbers you want to keep. Third, there are more steps to take to get to caller log.I still kept the phones becaude of the quality and I would recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"phone","review":"This was a terrible phone it was not what I expected the quality was poor the sound was terrible.

MUCH better.If, like me, you are the sort of person who finds \\"ringing\\" phones extremely jarring, then this set is a great option. I really enjoy the gentler selection of melodic ring tones -- wish there were a few more, though it's fun to use the holiday ring tones. My kids think it's hilarious when someone calls us and the phone plays \\"Jingle Bells!\\"Excellent sound quality and range. Not at all \\"tinny\\" sounding. Easy to read screen, too. I also appreciate the small footprint of the base (even the main base.) Truth be told, I have not utilized the answering machine feature (it's a voice mail world out there,) but it's nice to know it's there just in case.Finally, the speakerphone option on both handsets is really handy and user friendly. A great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery gives out too soon","review":"This phone was a monumental disappointment. The box says it has 17 hours of talk time, but for both handsets, the charge gave out after 17 minutes! Then it takes another 7 hours to fully recharge.

I don't use many of the features (answering machine, caller ID, different ringers), all I wanted was a good cordless phone to go where my corded phones won't. Works fine, no problems, a big improvement over my old 900GHz phones in that it's as clear as a corded phone, has no external antenna to break off, and uses ordinary AA NiMH rechargeable batteries that are cheap and easy to replace when they wear out.I like that I can dial either before or after taking the phone off hook, that the display shows the number I'm dialing, and I have the option for either automatically answering the phone when I take it out of the cradle or waiting until I hit the button. And although I haven't used it and I suspect it's slightly non-intuitive, I like that it has the ability to transfer calls from one handset to another and to conference in a second handset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic Dect 6.0 - great phone","review":"This phone has met all of my expectations.

After loading all phone #s into phonebook, the phonebook feature only works about 10% of the time. Most times I retrieve phone #, click on talk, and get a dial tone. Extremely frustrating. Once in a great while, it works. Also had same problem with erratic volume, mentioned elsewhere, and recently got message that I was too far from the handset even when I was standing next to it!! I do like the ease of dialing, the large numbers, and the features of this phone, but we use the phonebook constantly. If the phonebook worked, I'd be satisfied, even with the other defects. Not sure if it's too late to return, since we didn't take the time to enter phone #s until we'd had the phone for almost a month. Then we thought it was just that we were not using it correctly.

Also the buttons have a nice size and the numbers are big compared to other similar units.The battery life is great and voice quality is clear on both ends.This unit is Energy Star compliant, for those of us concerned about the environment.There is a voice mail indicator but no counter.I would have liked a lighted keypad.Be careful not to accidentally erase unplayed messages, since the erase button is close to the play button.Overall it is the best phone system I have seen when it comes to price, features and performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad QC, technical support even worse","review":"Less than a month after the purchase, the base-unit button for retrieving the message stops working.

On one occasion I tried to share a call with a 2nd handset and received a BUSY message and tone. Too bad since this phone system has many admirable features.

The handset in our office, regardless of whether the base is in another room, or in the office, rarely works. We always get the message that it is too far from the base.

We're planning on returning this phone and buying another because we need a phone in our office. Had we known what we know now, we NEVER would have purchased it.

Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't have any trouble with the wall mount (it isn't very attractive, however). When I read other reviewers' comments that they wished the handset buttons were lighted, I didn't give it much thought, but actually it really matters, and that's why I didn't give the phone the fifth star. I hadn't realized how many phone calls I make in the dark. Most importantly, though, the reception is good. I can vist my brother at his nearby house and still get my phone calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete lemon","review":"This is one of the worst purchases I have ever made on Amazon. Although the description touts a substantial signal range, no one on the other end can understand me if I am more than ten feet away from the base station -- the signal just breaks up. When I leave the room where the base station is, I get a message that I am too far away and am unable to make a call. To top it off, sometimes the buttons stick down, which is particularly annoying when you're trying to get your bank balance, for instance.

I think some people don't bother to read the manual. A back lit keypad would be o.k., but I don't dial in the dark much anyway. Great range unless you expect it to pick up on the back 40. I also like the AAA rechargeable batteries. When they need replaced, you don't have to worry about trying to find special ones that only fit this phone.

If you are looking for a great basic phone, this one is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, but not the best phone","review":"For the money, this one's hard to beat, but unlike my last cordless phone, this one does not have a lighted key pad. It does not tell, at a glance, how many messages there are. If the light shows 'red', you have at least one message. A better system would be to have a flashing number of new messages and then after listening to them, a non-flashing number of messages. It would be better if the scroll key could be used to go through the 'phone book' rather than hit the 'phone book' key first. There are other small issues, but overall, it's a good phone for the money. The sound is clear and the speaker phone works well. If desired, you can listen to messages with the handset instead of being at the base. You can't hear a message while it's being recorded, which may be a good thing if you have company and don't want someone to hear your business. It could be bad if you are considering picking up the phone if the message is one that would have prompted you to so do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't answer!","review":"I bought this phone 5 months ago.

They take AAA rechargeable batteries. I had Uniden phones before this and when the batteries went, I bought new ones and they didn't last any time at all and were quite expensive. Also, surprisingly, these phones are very simple to use. Love the Speakerphone and built in phone book. The volumne on these phones doesn't go as high as I'd like. Sometimes, if I'm in the middle of something, I like to lay the phone down and continue working. I still do that, but not if I have to lay the phone too far from where I am.

The call quality is exceptional and the price for this phone makes it a great value. The only knock I have against it is it doesn't have a lit keypad.Having recently switched to Verizon Fios, I am able to place calls and receive calls through call waiting. But when someone tries to call me, it does not ring. I called Verizon about this and they told me that there are some compatibility issues with some phones. He asked me to borrow a friends phone to see if it had the same issue. If not, it is probably a compatibility issue with this specific phone. So I borrowed my friend's Uniden and it had no problems receiving calls.So now I am shopping for another phone and hoping to find one that is compatible with Fios."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Product","review":"This is a good set of phones. Call quality, battery life and range are great. The only small problem I have is with the headphones I bought which were the panasonic headphones recommended by Amazon. They work fairly well but if you move the connector during a call it causes static which can be heard by both parties. As long as I use the clip to rest the phone on my belt or pocket I'm usually fine to walk around without static. But if I hold the phone in my hand with the headphones on there usually is static.

The DB8 has a 15.8 dBi rating and I believe it has good gain for HDTV channels in the UHF spectrum but is inadequate for the channels that still occupy the VHF spectrum. Compared to a large Yagi from Radio Shack the DB8 falls short. The Yagi pulls in the VHF channels that the DB8 doesn't. Both antenna's are attic mounted and I believe my best chance for good reception would be to mount the Yagi outside. The VHF spectrum requires longer elements because the wavelength of the signal is longer than for UHF signals.

When a program is broadcast in 1080i HD, the reception is better than with the satallite dish.The only complaint that I have is that the assembly instructions were pretty vaque and the photos that were intended to help with assembly were terrible quality, so they were of little help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, don't waste your money","review":"I got this to replace a couple year old Phillips rooftop antenna that was falling apart because it was made of such cheap materials. The Phillips wasn't designed for the new digital channels, but it did a much better job, even after several of the elements fell off because it was cheap garbage, than this DB8 piece of junk. Why can't anyone make anything that just works like it should anymore? This antenna can't pull in channels that are only 30 miles away, and yet it's advertised for 60+ mile range? Yeah, right. Where I live it's about as flat as it gets and there are no obstructions between my house and the transmission towers. I have it on a 3' tripod and another 2' pole above that on a rotator on my 2 story house and still it can't pull in stations where my old Phillips that was practically laying on the roof did.

Typically we suffer from loss of signal, presumably from absorption, being so close to the mountains. Prior to putting the DB8 up we got about 4 digital channels off our old (massive) analog antenna. We replaced it with the DB8 and jumped up to 20+ channels immediately. We seem to do well getting channels from Cheyenne to Denver without a problem. We have one Denver channel that fades occasionally, but in general I've been really impressed with the performance. I don't have an amplifier in the line. I tried a decent amp, but it didn't seem to make a difference. Also, I have a single 50 foot cable from the antenna to the converter (yep...I have an analog tv). I think having the single manufactured cable does help.There's a bunch of places selling this antenna, so shop around and figure the total price to get it to your door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Work As Well For Me","review":"Although the antenna appeared to be of good quality and went together fairly easily, I had expected it to be stronger than my old 12-year-old old-style antenna that I already had in the attic. So I was disappointed when my TV indicated that all of the channels were in fact several digits (out of 100) weaker than before. I even tried ganging it together with my old antenna, but that did not work better either. So I left my old antenna in place, took apart the new one, and returned it. Of course, your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reception","review":"I was using a directional antenna for year and was getting 16 channels, but the channels would not always came in when you wanted them.

Worse reception of the single station we pull in clearly with the set top antenna, and marginally better reception of two other stations - still grainy and noisy, however.What a waste of money.

The opposite is true. Bjorn manages to be exciting and original without ever alienating the listener. He has tunes in abundance - even the guitar lines are singable. 'Wolves' is probably his best album so far. A heady mixture of ambient moods, cinematic soundscapes, and heavy metal. If you like none of these styles, you still may love this album, for there is no simple way to describe Bjorn's music.The last two minutes of 'Shapechanger' alone are worth the price of the CD.

They come shrink wrapped in a heavy plastic. The one sword was perfect. The other sword was not. While I was getting ready to remove the plastic I could see alot of black bumps on the sword. Upon removing the plastic I figuered out what those black bumps were. MOLD!!!! There was mold growing on the sword. There were chips in the blade area and cracks all along the handel. I could have washed and wiped the mold off and dealt with that if the sword was for me, but I'm not giving that to my son. That sword found a nice home in our outdoor fireplace that night and was burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"Purchased these for training purposes.

They were the weight and length of actual samurai swords, which was good, but they came with woven grips that I did not ask for. The color was also NOT what it appears. Rather than being the dark cherry color advertised, it was light with patches of dark and green-very nonuniform. The hilts are also nonexistent-they simply didn't have them. I was disappointed with the look of them to be honest-not what was advertised. After the first sparring session, the grip (that was not expected in the first place) began to unravel. Also, the bokken have already began to get serious dents and scratches only after a few uses. This is a great TOY, but a serious sparrer may want to go elsewhere or purchase something without grips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorex Laser Lens Cleaner for DVD - REVIEW","review":"This product seems fine for occasional DVD laser cleaning.

As a Marine who fought in the battle of Narsiryah I was anxious to have the story come out. Livingston, however, does a poor job of telling it. Thanks to his personal interviews he does a pretty good job with the facts. Unfortunatly his mechanics and style are atrocious. There is a mispelling on the jacket of my edition and countless other gramatical mistakes inside. The descriptions of the barve men and women that fought that day are lacking. The reader doesn't learn much about the Marines, other than where they went to High School and what they want to do when they get out. His credibility is challenged further by the use of military and Marine terminology that he obviously does not understand. The novel seems rushed and there are entirely to many mistakes. The Marines of Task Force Tarawa deserve better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems","review":"My family was very interested in this book as my brother-in-law was a Marine killed on the 23rd.

It totals about 100 pages and there is much repetition to get it to that point. I'd suggest looking at \\"How to Win Your Personal Injury Claim\\" which is a NOLO book written by an attorney. The substance of the book is substantial and doesn't take the other book's simplistic approach to judging the value of the claim. Importantly, there are a significant number of cases shown that will provide benchmarks to real settlements.

I bought the book some time ago, followed the instructions, and just settled my claim for so much more than I thought it was worth before I read this book. I had no idea of what a fair settlement value was in my case. The adjuster seemed in such a hurry to try and settle and I didn't want to hire a lawyer and pay him a third of what I would receive.

This book was awful. The heroine was your typically really dumb virgin (BORING) who was so good and kind that she adopted children from the streets. The hero was your typical rake with a tortured past. You probably can figure out where the story goes from here. One final note, the author has this annoying habit of sprinkling the phrase \\"Um\\" throughout her dialogue. I advise a more judicious use of the phrase, because it became very annoying!

The plot, although a little predictable is interesting, and it's nice to see old characters again, as well as Sarah as a grown up.The characters however are a little flat. There's a bad guy, a horribly bad guy, and the good ones, without many interesting twists to them.An exception may be Storm. And I'm sure that if there is another book in the series it will be about him.-spoiler-What happens between Sara and Nate was a little unbelievable to me. Although there is enough proof that extramarital sex has happened through the ages, it is also true that in victorian times it wasn't a common thing, specially among \\"well bred\\" girls. I'm sure that when it happened it was after a skillful seduction or perhaps when the girl was so ignorant that she didn't realize on time what was happening.

The sections on inspection and clearance of steerage (3rd class) passengers turned out to be the highlight of this book. There is a clear description of the passenger experience from the time of their ship's arrival at Ellis Island to when passengers were finally cleared. Turns out that the inspections were a multi-step process, partly designed to make some evaluations when passengers were not even aware of it.

They add a little something to the game,but only the first time you watch them. And that's theproblem -- its difficult if not impossible to stop themonce they've started! You have to set through the entirething every time you replay a mission.

There are too many cut scenes that you can't button through (can be frustrating).I didn't give the game a chance to play repeatedly so I may have missed out on some important things (like how to skip the cut scenes) but I found the game play boring.

Los Gatos I think are very inspired by Latin Jazz legend Cal Tjader (a vibraphone player), and this certainly inspires me to go and find out more about him. If you're into Salsa, this will be a bit different - there's only 5 of them, no horn section, no leathery voiced crooner, and they throw in a few tunes in odd time signatures (I'll not embarass myself by guessing what form they are!)

Better even than the almighty South Park, which, in it's later years, is starting to lose it's kick. Too bad. Fortunately, we've got Family Guy. The only thing is, the the fourth season is incomplete.

Basically everything above the arrow keys has been moved down one row, which causes me to frequenly hit the wrong key.The worst thing about it, though, is that the keys are difficult to depress. They take a little extra force than that to which I am accustomed, which puts extra strain on my wrists.

But when we hung wet clothes on the Coghlan's, the yellow dye bled into our light-colored clothes [e.g., T shirts, undies] where the wet clothes contacted the clothesline. Bummer! Otherwise, the Coghlan's would have been perfect--long length/stretchability, versatile clips that allow many different attachment options. The Rick Steves' white bungee clothesline was too short and had too little stretchability to be usable in many of the hotel rooms while in Europe. Recommendation to Coghlan's: either make the clothesline white, or use a dye that doesn't bleed into wet clothes, and you'll have the perfect travel clothesline. Amazon was--as usual--terrific in promptly paying for return shipping and issuing a refund after we explained the problem with the Coghlan after we returned from our trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential item for ALL Travelers!!","review":"I wanted an alternative to the name brand item and this fit the bill perfectly. While the name brand has three twisted cords and this has only two, I found this worked well enough to hold heavy and light items perfectly. I found the only challenge was finding secure places in the hotel room that it could be attached to. I used this almost every day for 2 weeks and am so glad I did. I found I could have packed HALF the clothes I did and would have saved my arms a lot of work from hauling suitcases all over Italy.I was traveling with two others and we had two of these. I recommend one per person. It stretches even longer than listed when needed, but the total weight of the wet clothing was a lot to hold.I also purchased Woolite packets and never used them.

By doing occasional clothes washing in the sink, I was able to pack light and travel more easily. The hooks enabled the line to be looped around or attached easily to a variety of fixtures within hotel rooms for quick overnight drying.

So, when I heard that Hez was coming out with a new album, I rushed to get it. When I heard the entire album, I was sorely disappointed. The writing was really poor. The songs on Live in Atlanta and Live in New York (By Any Means Necessary) were much better written. The songs on Family Affair are Mickey Mouse songs with only a chorus and a drive. It was almost as bad as the LFT album. A few years ago, there was a rumor that the Love Fellowship Crusade Choir was going to stop recording.

It was the same buttons as before but it took forever for it to explain them all, and it was dull, nowhere to go, so you had to just sit there waiting for Orcs. After what seemed like forever I moved onto the next scene. The fighting was horrible, I could have taken \\"The Nine\\" in LOTR: The Return of the King but the combat in this game wasnt any good so the moves that happened so quickly before were slowed down to an agonizing rate!

In order to regard the Krumpers as coming anywhere near the BBoys in the final battle, you have to toss out such silly ideas as skill and technique. It all becomes a matter of how strange you can look. I waited patiently for one of the Krumpers to tear off all of his clothes, simulate raping a women, cut himself with a razor blade and then leap from the rafters.

I shopped around and saw many different styles and sizes and with cost being a concern, I chose this one. When I received it, I was VERY pleased. It was heavier than I had expected (for the cost) and was bright and shiny. It is a nice piece of jewelry. The chain is plain and simple, and may be something others choose to replace, but I found it perfect for a young lady who chooses to wear it under her clothes, discreetly.

The best tracks are definately better for the visuals like the film's opening listed on the CD as track 2 & 3. The retro refreshment song \\"Groovy Time For A Movie Time\\" by the Soda Dog Refreshment Squad, juxaposes the \\"evil snacks\\" with their \\"Cut You Up With A Linoleum Knife\\" by Mastodon. OMG, make sure u get to the theater on time for that opening! The animation and subtitles revealing the awesome lyrics is ultimately essential for the punchline of the joke. Maybe an enhanced CD with video would have worked better.Some tracks don't need a clear set up like Shake's NUDE LOVE, M.C. CHRIS' I WANT CANDY and CARL'S THEME.

The main caracter's mission is hazy at best, his location is never mentioned (they never say he's in Tasmania, the only clue is references to Tasmanian tigers and devils), and his prey itself, the Thylacine, is not mentiond until almost half way through the book. the book jacket says he is employed by a biotech company, but that also is never mentioned in the text. I puchased this book because I have an acedemic interest in Thylacinus Cynocephalus, the Tasmaninan tiger or thylacine, but the book gave little information on the creature, only loosley describing it's appearance. I would describe the writing in the book mediocre at best, but the story is half-decent. Due to the poor writing style, I feel that The Hunter is doomed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless classic","review":"I read this book back when I was in Jr high school, It remains a classic and very dear to my heart to read it once more.It has many of your basics for reading a fantasy novels such as magic and dragons, and of course a love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like magic & fantasy buy this series of books!!!!!!!","review":"A Spell for Chamleon is the best book I have ever read, that is with the exception of the rest of the Xanth Series. The reson I love this book is because it is full of fantasy, magic, adventure, & an element that only P.A. can give it. Piers Anthony is the best Author that I have had the Privlege to read. My dad gave me a book one day said read this I think you'll like. I was prepared to be bored out of my mind, but for once my dad was right. I loved the book so much I couldn't put it down, approx. 3 hours later I asked my dad were the next one in the series was. Unfortunely we don't have all the books I hope I can add some more of Anthony's Masterpieces to my family library soon. I hope you love these books as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the early Xanth novels!","review":"This book was truly excellent. Piers Anthony took a new concept and developed an entire fantasy world around it. It had great character development, with Bink learning and growing, while examining the flaws in the system used in Xanth. It also addressed the issue of perceptions of who is \\"good\\" and who is \\"evil\\".Many other characters were extremely interesting as well. \\"Justin Tree\\" was a great character.I really wish that Piers Anthony kept this up for the full series. This one was designed for adults. The later ones seemed aimed at children, with the main thrust of stories being the use of bad puns. I kept buying them hoping for a return to the original writing style until finally Piers Anthony himself said that he reread the first stories, found they were a completely different style, but never planned to go back since the current style seemed to sell so well. At that point I stopped buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's that good","review":"Although it's book 1 in the series, it has it's own story line that makes you want to read it more and more.

It's definitely a good book to pick and read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of the Xanth series","review":"Unlike future books in this series, the hero Bink, isn't a child, he's 25, and isn't obsessed with stork summoning(sex).

It makes for a neat adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great beginning to the Xanth series","review":"Peirs Anthony is incredible. . . and his Xanth series is a perfect example of that. Although my favorite book in the series still remains The Source of Magic, A Spell for Chameleon was what got me hooked. Bink is the best!!!!!! Fantasy fans, rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for those who like crazy magic","review":"A Spell For Chameleon is a wonderful book. In the magical world of Xanth, almost anything can happen, from a carpet flying overhead to trees growing food and clothing for any passerby. The characters find themselves in all sorts of kooky dilemmas, keeping the reader guessing as to what a character will stumble upon next (if it's a Tangle Tree, they're in for a fight). From colored hail storms to computers that can control others actions, these books are nonstop fun and fantasy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jem I Missed For a Good While","review":"I have stayed away from Piers Anthony for a good long while. All it took was the recommendation from a friend and a few descriptive things from the book to get me to actually crack one open.I certainly found this entertaining. There is just something about turning standard myths and magic onto its head. If you have ever read 'The Enchanted Forest Chronicles' you have found the child version of these books.Truly this book has a much more 'mature' nature to it, though not a terrible one that turned me away from it. It is slight whimsical and fun as well as a fairly likeable storyline. Many times I put the book down to only pick it up again a few moments later ... it really did not take me long to read it.The world that is created is one that does catch my interest as I have a good few of the following sequels and look forward to reading them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spell For Chameleon","review":"I have been enjoying the Xanth series for several years. The kindle version of this book is the fourth time I have read it and enjoying it just as much as the first time. However I'm a bit frustrated. There were several printing errors of misspelled words. It seemed like the book was scanned in and the computer miss reads a letter every now and then. It would be nice if someone would proofread an ebook before it is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect book for light hearted readers","review":"This is a fun adventure for the right reader. I hate to narrow it down too much, however I get the feel its prime audience would be young adult men who like puns, silly humor, and a variety of creatures and adventure. It's a slight blend of Monty Python & Benny Hill humor wrapped up into an exciting adventure. Don't buy this is you're looking for a serious epic to dive into and absorb. This is a light-hearted don't-take-me-too-serious story. If this is what you're looking for, then this is one of the best you will find. Enjoy your way past various obstacles as you laugh along the journey. I wouldn't change a thing. Piers Anthony wrote it perfectly for a specific audience in mind. And if that's you, you'll be glad you found this gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spell for Chameleon","review":"A Spell for Chameleon is a great book it has many plot twists and a good ending if you like surprises (and adventure) you will love this book. It is about a man named Bink who lives in the magical land of Xanth, where almost every one (but him) has a magic talent and, if you don't you are banished to our land but he wants to stay so he can married his fiancé .So he travels to magician Humfreys casel to see if he can help him and on his way he finds out what he really can do.(...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"On a Scale of One to Ten...","review":"While I haven't actually read the first Xanth book, I've read a lot of them. I noticed a lot of rather harsh comments about the series and almost died laughing. To put it like this: If you don't have a good sense of humor and an open mind, stay away from this series. Far too many people seem to be seriously thinking about everything they read in these books. Why? Kick back, relax and ENJOY them. Stop being so stuffy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"xantherific","review":"I would have given this work 5 stars if the main persons name was not Bink. That was hard to get passed. Besides that the rest of the book was wonderful. The juxtaposition (no pun intended) between xanth and dreary old mundania was facinating. The character development was first rate. The puns were very entertaining. The world he created in xanth was so real it was just amazing. I would hope in his future books he could develop mundania a little more. It could have used more detail, so that we could learn a little of what mundania was like besides being dreary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book yet i find","review":"I found this book to be very good and i was from then on very interested to read the rest of his series. I think that he has a great imagination but i found the other novels in this series were not as good yet I would class this won as great fun.

What a terrible mistake. Anthony's much vaunted \\"humor\\" boils down to lots and lots of idiotic puns. Add to that a so-so plot, half developed characters, and blatant sexism, and you have a truly bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fantasy novel","review":"This is witty, exciting book. It keeps you enthralled, but it isn't too serious. It is a fairly light read, and is good to take on trips with you, but be forewarned -- this book is hard to put down once you've started it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Xanth's Spell","review":"Piers Anthony is a master at crafting new things out of old elements. This fist book in the Xanth series is a masterpiece among fantasy novels. It tells the story of a young man on the verge of exile. He must embark on a journey through a land alive with magic to find his own unique talent, and the key to saving his home from a mad magician. Even if you don't read the enire series, I strongly reccomend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Punderful Adventure","review":"I was quite taken with this tale. I claim no expertise in the field of fantasy, or anywhere else, for that matter. But I do have a fairly well-rounded reading experience and I found this little book to be a refreshing escape from my Mundania existence.The hero, Bink, is a hero inspite of himself. Bink is a resident of Xanth, a land filled with magic, of which Bink has none and he has precious little ego. He is to be exiled to Mundania, a land filled with ego and no magic. From this premise many delightful adventures in the world of Xanth ensue; a world much better visited with Piers Anthony as your guide.On second thought, maybe there is some magic in Mundania after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite Bink's Sexist Attitude, I Enjoyed \\"Chameleon\\"","review":"I read this ten years ago and with a rereading I still enjoy the characters and the introduction to the imaginative world of Xanth. Maybe I am more politically correct these days, but Bink comes across as shallow and sexist. He is an interesting character, but his attitude toward women leaves something to be desired. I'm not sure what the author's trying to say--Bink decides he can't settle down with just one woman, but a woman like Dee will do because she never looks the same way twice. Besides that, I thoroughly enjoyed this tale and am looking forward to reading other books from this series--again."},{"rating":"2","title":"a spell for chameleon","review":"Although the magical aspect of the book, A Spell for Chameleon by Piers Anthony is fake, of course, the author pulls you in and paints a realistic picture in your head. This books creativity and writing style makes all its concepts realistic. I read this book because it was recommended to my by my parents who had agreed that this book had a great plot"},{"rating":"1","title":"The first, but not the best in the Xanth series.","review":"One thing thi snovel has going for it is that it is the starting point for the Xanth series. It is not as pun-filled or sarcastic as some of the others in the series.If you like your light fantasy reading with a bit of comedy, then this is a book and a series for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"First admission into an infantine world","review":"I finally found this very first book all about Piers Anthony's amusing little fantasy playroom of Xanth for any young kid who could read. Unfortunately, I didn't get very far - especially after my unfortunate experience with the other Xanth book, \\"Ogre Ogre\\", which carried so many blatantly sexual references to the female characters as well as lecherous behavior from the males. This book here very obviously has the same thing. Too bad I'm female and WELL over the age limit. In fact, I was actually THE SAME AGE as the hero, who was about 25 at the time. So the double standards prevented me from taking a carefree romp into Uncle Piers' Fun-'N'-Pun Land. Oh, well - too many unwashed little boys and street punks casually hanging around it. They would probably grow donkey's ears in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blueprint for making money","review":"Ok, this book is not so bad by itself.Obviously written for a younger crowd with its juvenile puns and predictable plot.The low rating it gets though is becasue it is like the first spot of mold in a bathroom.While not bad by itself it has spawned the Xanth series. A seemingly never ending procession of books with EXACTLY THE SAME STORY.The only thing new we see in the procession is the puns.Oh my lord the puns.Read this one, enjoy it. Maybe even read a few more from the series. But save your money o the whole line if books. You will never see anything you haven't seen before as you keep reading book after midless book.I swear Asprin just has a basic outline of action and he goes in and just changes the settings and names, makes three new trials and works off that."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-rate fiction","review":"Too many monsters that have little meaning to the plot, and stereotypes galore really clutter up this little book, making it 300+ pages when it should have been 200. The prose is fair to lame, the characters flat, and the issues, well, not riveting. The land of Xanth is definitely the most compelling aspect of this book, but the story telling leaves it with little to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price hike?? $4.99 for a paperback but $7.99 for electronic? COME ON","review":"What's with the price hiking? Electronic media takes CONSIDERABLY less to produce and continue producing. I won't be purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The is one of the worst SF novels ever.","review":"It is not so much because of this book, but because of the series that follows that I gave this book such a poor review. This book, bursting over with some of the smallest-minded puns imaginable is a work of what I believe is Science Fiction's Horatio Alger.Piers Anthony relies upon the hormones of his teenage audience when he writes in the sexual innuendo that has been one of the main reasons for the success of his novels.Furthermore, this novel, like all Piers Anthony novels, has a very easily predictable plot (it would be nice if the hero didn't always get laid by the end of the novel).Look, for all you young Science Fiction fans out there, the 11,12,13 year old guys who just starting to really get into this genre, stay away from this guy. You'll regret ever picking up one of his novels in your 20's (heck I sure do)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully sexist and cliche","review":"Anthony seems to lack a basic grip of common courtesy, and any grip at all of sense. A Spell for Chameleon operates on the basic principle that pretty women cannot be intelligent and intelligent women are, by nature, ugly; a theory that is degrading to women everywhere. Anthony also makes no secret of this thesis, stating the above overtly towards the end of the book. Anythony's puns are trite and dull, and his characters tired cliches. By far, one of the worst fantasy writers I have every read, to the point where even mentioning his name is banned at some fantasy cons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I can't believe how popular this is. It was not good. I suppose I would have liked it when I was 10 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the series","review":"I have read the first 17 or so books in the Xanth series and nothing compares to this title. I would rate all the books including Night Mare and back to \\"A Spell for Chameleon\\" 5 stars, but after that the series gradually declines in value. I believe the reason for the degradation of interest in Xanth is that the landscape becomes less lethal in the latter books. In \\"A Spell for Chameleon\\", all off Xanth's fuana and even its flora represents a potential threat, and it makes the book more suspenseful. It could be read alone with out interest in future Xanth books and the final chapter wouldn't leave you hanging, yet it still leaves behind an interest in what future holds for Bink, the main character. A Spell for Chameleon is definitely one of the best titles there is in the Xanth series, and perhaps one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantasy Addicts!","review":"A Spell for Chameleon is a rich, vibrant story, overflowing with the thickest fantasy from the mind of Piers Anthony. Fantasy lovers would appreciate the originality of the world of Xanth, and the creativity of Anthony's style. The world of Xanth is by far one of the most potent fantasy settings I've ever been drawn into, and the content reminds me why I loved fantasy so much to begin with. Complete with it's own history and follow up books, A spell for chameleon is the doorway novel into an extremely colorful and worthwhile read.Xanth is a land of magic. Each citizen born into this land is blessed with their own, unique magic spell. Failiure to display a lack of magic results in Exile from the land. Follow Bink through the mystical realm of Xanth as he searches for the magic within himself, facing many magical challenges, beasts, and friends along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful morality tale meets love story","review":"When Bink is cast out of Xanth for not possessing a demonstrable magical talent, he runs directly into Trent, the man considered to be an evil magician, who was also expelled from Xanth, for trying to take it over.As Bink and Trent are forced together, Bink learns that Trent may not be completely evil, and Xanth may actually need him. Along the way, Bink meets and falls for Chameleon, a woman whose appearance and brain power is are inversely proportional. In this case, beauty and brains do not go together.This is a great adventure story with the strongest moral message of any of the Xanth novels. It is very much about not judging a book by its cover and opening one's eyes to ideas that are uncomfortable.A brilliant novel to start any series, I found A Spell for Chameleon to be heart-wrnching at times, exciting at others, and enjoyable from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was a great book","review":"This book in my opinion was very good. I loved all the short stories, but the only thing that I did not like in this book is how some of the stories were written. The first-person written stories were good and there was nothing I could complain about, but the third-person written stories were horrible! It reminded me of the way I wrote in third grade and some were even repetative. However, the stories were great and it had a very strong and interesting ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Island Like You","review":"This is a wonderful collection of stories about Puerto Ricans living together in a barrio in New Jersey.

Among the 1500 words are such \\"essential\\" words as \\"Texas\\", \\"their\\", \\"there\\" and \\"They're\\" -- which I can assume are aimed at a beginner in the English language; but then there are obscure words such as \\"phaeton\\" -- a four-wheeled carriage drawn by horses that was made obsolete by the automobile. Words such as these I guess would be helpful for anyone who plans to do some time-travel. Some of the words are rediculously basic -- such as \\"cord\\" -- \\"a thin piece of rope, plastic, etc.\\" and some are rediculously obscure -- \\"nonillion\\" -- \\"a very large number equal to 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000\\".

Imagine my chagrin at hearing the Concerto in F major, a disjointed display of technique written expressly for de Sarasate. Olivier Charlier's anemic fiddling, often drowned out by the blaring BBC, was anything but complementary to this concerto. The Concerto russe fares better. Although only one recording producer and sound engineer are noted in the liner notes, I believe they were both taken out and shot between the two days of recording. The balance between the violinist and orchestra in the Concerto russe was grealy improved, and some saintly person involved in this recording got Charlier to play this piece entirely in tune.

You could easily stand there and pound the fire button and get through the entire game. Add in some combos, different weapons, and jumping attacks and...well, you don't add much at all.

None of the weapons are all the same, none of them have special abilitys like the Ifirt gloves.

The prequel was a classic but this game is so horrible in comparison. Lucia, pick an accent and stick with it, nuff said. this game took out the desire of looking forward to a devil may cry 3. stop tryng to make this game look good with positive reviews b/c you're just lying.

Graphics and gameplay make it almost impossible to top. However, there are a few flaws in DMC2. First off the camera angles are horrible. Throughout most of the game, you will probably miss important spots that you won't be able to see due to bad camera angles. Second, the story is very unclear (although I and a lot of gamers could really care less what the story is. And last, there is not a lot of moves you can do while you are in Devil Trigger (most of you might know all the moves you could do in the last game with Alastor and Ifrit). One thing that I forgot to mention that is not one of my complaints is the difficulty level. A lot of people said that the game is too easy. Well, try to beat the game on Must Die mode and see how easy it is. Overall, it's a great game only for the TRUE Devil May Cry fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I DID cry","review":"I was not impressed with this game at all. It seemed to me that the creators were thinking a little too big.In the first DMC most all of the fights were close up and personal so you could see in great detail each and every slash. In DMC2 it's like playing Contra, you just jump around shooting things you can't see and Slashing once and awhile.Also who can forget the great question of the first game \\"would you like to play in easy mode?\\". What made the first DMC so great was that it was a very difficult game to play, and anyone who doesn't think so probobly played in easy mode.However in this newer version I almost fell asleep it was so easy. You can kill almost everything in the first half with just the pistols.I will say however that there were some improvements on the controls and interface of the game. The quick weapon change buttons, and the devil power abilites were nice, but they don't make up for the other stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"choclate mess in a francise","review":"I cant even describe how bad this game is, compare it to the first one and you have a choclate poopy mud stain in your PS2 collection. gameplay is repititive AND TOO EASY! dante never talks, and i liked him in the first and in the 3rd. if you want to get all devil may cry games do your self a favor and pick only 1 or 3.

Boss battles are basicaly the same way easy as pie. Powering up your weapons take forever in fact you nearly through the end of the game before you can have enough red ORBS save up to power your weapons. Story line really sorry too.

If youre looking for a long game with a good story then you should go elsewhere. This game is meant for people who want nothing more than hardcore action and fun. The moves and fighting system is much like the original DMC. DMC 2 However has added more characters, weapons, and moves not seen in the first game. The Bloody palace is aslo a great mode for gamers who think that a minute of plot every half hour of gameplaying is too much. It lets you got thru over 9999 levels of devil hunting without pause. This truly is a great game for action lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the heck?","review":"Good lord, Capcom, what were you thinking when you released DMC2? I can't believe how dumb someone could be. Almost everything sucks, Dante isn't very hardcore anymore, the levels are too open(you can use guns to beat the game, seriously), it's too dang easy, and it's too dang stupid for it's own good.

Believe me, I'm a big DMC freak."},{"rating":"1","title":"STICK TO THE FIRST!","review":"This game is one of the reasons why I don't even own a PS2 anymore so jus hear me out for a minute! When the first came out I bought a copy and I was lucky to find out that the first game had alot to do and the physics of the fighting moves you unleash on enemies was fantastiv but this game was a total BLAARGH! First off the graphics look worse than the first! It has only been proved with PS2 that they have some out of date game engines that they recycle for PS2 games! Thus making the game just look like a horrible demo.

After you beat the game (which took me 3 days, not even playing it alot during that time) you'll be thinking \\"that's it\\"? The camera angels pretty much suck, that seems to be one of the main problems with all of the DMC games though. I should've waited till this dropped to $20 but I liked the first one so much I figured it would be worth the $50 but it wasn't. This is definately a prime example of a game not worth the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major dissapointment","review":"I would describe this game as boring, tedious, lame, waste of money, and most sadly a major dissapointment. I didn't even bother to finish the game and I have heard that you can finish the game in about five hours. The last level I went through I stood still hitting the box button to fire at a helicopter that was not visible. Every once in a while it would shoot a missle at me that would of course hit me because I couldn't see it coming. It didn't matter. I destroyed the helicopter quickly. The game is easy, but unfortunately not fun at all. If I were you and I didn't have the original Devil May Cry I would go buy that one. The original game rocked! If you own the original go play it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not as great as the original.","review":"Let me start off by saying that some people that rated this game have been harsh. It is a sequel, what did u honestly expect. I got exactly what I expected. While it was somewhat easy, it still took me as long as the first since there was 2 characters(it ttok me about a week give or take a day). The story line might have been kinda bad, and the style ratings corny, but it made all of that up in the action. I felt that the first had a great story line, but somewhat lacked the great action that the sequel had. The graphics improved, exspecially on the cinematics. Overall, the game was a very fun play and worth all of the money. It was a sequel, and one of the better ones in recent Playstation history, so give it credit for being a darn good second chance to play as Dante."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game sucks","review":"Dont waste your money this game sucks. I recently purchased this game. Sure the graphics might be nice ,but wheres the story.

Bassicly all you do is run down a level, shoot Identical monsters that have the AI of a dead goldfish, solve stupid puzzles that dont make sense, repeat until the credits roll. Although you have infinate ammo, which may sound like a good thing, is really stupid because you have two hand guns with the power of an AK-47. Your enemys can hardly touch you because you are \\"Too\\" fast, strong, and athletic. you are way too strong too have any fun. You can beat a level without a scratch on you. That may sound cool, but it's really boring. Another Part that Disturbed me is On the back of the box it says \\"Play as theBad-Ass Dante, Or the Sexy Lucia\\". Or something like that.LUCIA ISN'T SEXY!!! She's about as \\"SEXY\\" As Kelly Osbourne. And thats all I have to say about that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"If you loved the first DMC, then stay clear of this stinking attempt to gobble up your money on the success of the first.

Although the game is very repetitive, it can still captivate you for hours.I own this game and play it every once in a while. My only advice is that everyone play it once. The gameplay is so 'cool' it'll trap you in it's spell for hours. The storyline is good but the new character's ending isn't quite as goot as Dante's. That and Dante has more difficult boss battles for some reason. It might be the guns he totes around compared to the various cutlery the other character has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather different Sequel","review":"I was amazed when I played this game at first. Mainly because the humanity of the characters seemed gone. As has been said before, the story and character ambition seems to have disappeared at the get-go of this game, but if you want action, you will not be disappointed! This game seems much more difficult to me than the first, perhaps which is only due to the differentiation from the original's controls. I have, at this writing not completed the game, but so far find it very engaging, and with all good fiction, find out more about the mythology as time goes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devil May Cry 2","review":"Alright game...I bought it when on its release date and liked the graphics...I also liked that it had a differ player in it as well...but the downfall of the game is the graphics of the characters and as in the first DVC game Dante was a better fighter as compared to the second installment of this series....I mean dante cant really do much with his fighing style there isnt really much of it ...He doesnt slash at the monsters like he did in DVC1...It also needs a better storyline, better camera angles, better graphics in the characters, and a better fighting style as to the 1 in DVC1...I think in Devil May Cry 1 dante was much more improved fighter than in this 1...I hope capcom does something better.."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUD GUARDS","review":"Husky Liners 56211 Custom Molded Black Thermoplastic Front Mud Guard - Set of 2NICE TO HAVE, KEEPS MUD OFF THE STEP AND SIDE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob Marley and the Wailers","review":"Customer reviews were misleading.

I was lucky to only have borrowed it from the library. Had I payed $30+ for it I would have been very upset. Half of the people on the second disc never met Marley.

Didn'y explain the example programs clearly all the time. Does have some good info. Didn't explain clearly where to compile the programs and where to save the examples. Had to figure that part out with some further internet reasearch. Several of the examples had errors when compiled (I redviewed the example in the book with what i typed in the computer line by line and still there were errors when compiled.

My take, and my sales peers', have summed it up to this point: MS CRM was designed by a software engineer, not a salesperson. I get the idea it is more geared toward numbers management and not sales process or customer management. Too many redundant steps, no intuitive flow through in the processes. If you are looking for a CRM that is easy to use and can extrapolate data, I suggest looking at Maximizer or Salesforce.com.

This book was a huge disappointment. I was surprised at the lack of content that is actually about the adorable snorting creatures I love (and presumably anyone who buys the book loves). Much of the text (which is wrapped in a cheap looking package--did he self publish?) is self-indulgent and repetitive. He repeats anecdotes from the aforementioned pet owner's guide, and he even repeats the same stories within PUG BUS--does he think we're so slow we won't notice?

Fourth, the big fish-fry-at-night-on-the-beach scene is SO anti-climatic! That is supposed to be the \\"big scene\\"! How did James Cameron ever work again after this? Apparently, whoever thought up this idea had no idea that actual \\"flying fish\\" jump up into the air and need to land into water again to survive. Actual \\"flying fish\\" are still fish and can't survive out of water. If you see this movie, you know why I say that. There is a plus, that many of the guys wear tight short shorts of tiny bathing suits. In fact, in the opening scene, the guy has an actual half-chub, ha.

James Cameron, while immensely popular, is simply vapid. Funny, I just learned that after stealing the idea for Terminator from Harlan Ellison, Mr. Cameron had the nerve to call Mr. Ellison a 'parasite' for suing him for his theft.

Based on his own account however, he was fired after only a couple weeks yet his name remains on the credits. The opening underwater sequence I'm sure is his work. It is suspenseful and scary. There are other effective scenes, but the patchwork of the product is pretty bad. Bad writing and acting doesn't help. Only Lance Henriksen is any good. The Italian producers put out a movie that tries hard to find the teen age audience. There are a few boobies, a little blood and gore, some comedic relief and lousy special effects. It's a stinker but not quite unwatchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"hoax for the holidays","review":"was not the movie i thought it was, but i ended up enjoying it. it has a good christmas message about knowing yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"First waterboarding, now this","review":"All three of these in one box?

The overall sound of it makes me feel like they put a lot of work in making a good product. My usual problem with tributes are they tend to lack the intensity and power of the original so if you listen don't expect any hard hitting intensity. The sound in the album is great be it the orchestra playing together or solos it just reminded me of how great the original sounded. The original Master of Puppets was probably my all time favorite album so this tribute had a lot to live up to for me. I don't really listen to Metallica much anymore since my taste in a lot of things have changed but it sounds fantastic none the less. If you are looking for a good tribute I would give this one a listen be it fans of Metallica or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"[...].

Most of the songs are absolutely wonderful, although I was not fond of \\"Out of Habit\\". This is a great mixture of music by some of the most abstract artists in the business. Lyle Lovett's \\"If I Had a Boat\\" is one of the few songs that I can listen to time and time again and never get sick of. My favorite track on the album is Lisa Loeb's \\"Falling in Love\\" because she puts into words the true emotions that we all go through when falling head over heels. This is truly one of the best CDs out right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music in Film","review":"As most of us know, a movie is not complete with out a stellar soundtrack.

All the songs are great as well you can support the Indie arts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I love this album! I am a big fan of Lisa Loeb and of Jill Sobule, so the recordings on this album made my day. I first heard of it while I was at work (in a coffeeshop), and since then, I've put it into the CD player there so many times, I'm suprised nobody has gotten sick of it. Good indie/acoustic music with something for everyone. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good for a bunch of kids","review":"I've actually heard \\"professional\\" artists sound a lot worse than this. Rock'n'roll is supposed to be about fun, and this album is fun! Imagine 1960's rock'n'roll, instrumental surf music, and a touch of rockabilly combined, and that's The Electras.It's funny to think that one of these kids grew up to become an influential senator and a presidential nominee for his party. Maybe if he and The Electras had reunited for the campaign trail, he would have achieved Bill-Clinton-on-the-Arsenio-Hall-Show level of coolness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Gauthier","review":"I just heard her in concert last night and she blew me away. I love her dry, humerous take on life's depressing ways. We bought this CD last night, and I am waiting on her next one which hopefully will have a new song of her's she sang last night that grabbed me and fascinated me about falling out of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Voice","review":"I seem to be in the minority since the other reviewers loved this disc. While I like Gauthier's low, twangy voice, some of the songs, such as, Sugar Cane and Merry Go Round are too similar to Lucinda Williams work. Other songs stand out (Walk Through the Fire, The Ledge, For Rose) Gauthier is a good story teller. It's a slow paced, brooding collection of songs. The similarities to Williams interfered with my enjoyment. After reading the other reviews I was excited to receive this and ended up being disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you love music? You'll love this!","review":"Mary Gauthier is a force to be reckoned with. Mary's songwriting skills are the things that writers of any kind dream about. You listen to her music and are drawn away from your world, and into her's. You cannot listen to these songs and not be totally captured by their lyrics. If you love great American songwriter's you will love Mary Gauthier. She will one day be recognized as one of our best. Mary has been referred to as a female Townes Van Zandt and this reference captures her perfectly. If you are a fan of great songwriter's Van Zandt, Guy Clark, or Dylan you are already a fan of Mary Gauthier. I will leave you with this statement: You want to buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new voice for the dark side of America","review":"I first heard Mary on John Kelly's programme on Irish radio here in Manchester. Her captivating voice stopped me in my tracks and made me listen. I was immediately enthralled by her sonorous voice and uncomprising lyrics. Mary sings with authority about the alcoholics, the junkies, the down and outs, etc. who have been bypassed by the American dream. These are her people and she sings of them with affection and love. I cannot reccomend this CD too highly, particularly the song \\"Christmas in Paradise\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past the personalities","review":"I can't put my finger on it, but I found Kosminsky and Hurt so annoyingly bland and mellow that I couldn't finish the DVD.

The plot was so exciting and intricately crafted, that I was screaming out for the next book by the time I finished it.

I have recently been told I have angina, so I bought the book. I practised the breathing exercises and angina pains I get shortly after getting up in the morning, no longer occur. Thats after 4 days practice. Similarly, the angiogram I had recently went so much better because as the procedure was carried out I practiced the breathing exercise and was totally relaxed. The book is easy to follow and the diagrammes are quite adequate for the purpose.I can only say that by breathing as she recommends your health will be improved and that must be a bonus to anyone.

There is only the tiniest sliver of plastic to push up to open one of the compartments, and it locks very tightly. I have full dexterity and I often resort to opening it with my teeth.

Now,once a week we fill the roomy compartments with our daily dosages, AND we know for sure whether we took the pills that day because each compartment is marked. Only drawback.

The only claim that the film legitimately has of being based on the novel is that some of the characters have the same names and it is in roughly the same geographic location. Novel aside, the film does little to explain the background information that is neccesary to understanding the plot, it simply starts off in media res and makes no attempt explain anything. Without having read the book, I would have been hopelessly lost. The film also does not define the relationships between the characters. They seem to be wandering aimlessly around the countryside bumping into each other. Badly done, scriptwriters, badly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angel in the house becomes a little devil","review":"I hated this adaptation of the book because they got it wrong, wrong, wrong.

A man goes after a woman not so much because she is a murderer, but because she doesn't return his love. Braddon's book wasn't like that! Robert is a far more sympathetic character in the book, really struggling to make the right decision, and Alicia does not like Lucy at all. I understand that the person who developed this for TV sympathized with Lucy's character more than Braddon did, but this person changed the story too much. And the book's ending was much happier.

Over all, I thought this was a great game but the auto aim can be annoying when you are trying to take out 1 guy that has a gun to a hostage and take out his partner thus making the 1 with the gun panic and shoot the hostage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic source of information , tremendously helpful.","review":"I am now planning my wedding for the year 2000 and it is wonderful to know that there is a book out there that is taking me through this hectic process step by exciting step.

My homemade version uses cream, Beecher's cheese and Dungeness crab. But then on the other hand, I also like both Stouffer's and Trader Joe's frozen, and I even like the stuff in the \\"blue box.\\" Read a lot of rave reviews of Annie's, so I picked up a box at the store today. I'm not sure what kind of mac and cheese the people that loved this stuff have eaten in the past, but I found Annie's watery and bland. I think it might be passable if there was twice the amount of cheese powder, but this stuff had no flavor. Ate a couple bites and threw the rest out. Luckily I only bought one box, but it was a complete waste of money. Even Easy Mac is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be cheesier","review":"I had to add more cheddar to get a real natural flavor and texture.

I usually don't measure the milk in other mac/cheese..it's just a little creamier. This one gets watery quickly with too much milk and the cheese doesn't dissolve very well. The flavor is great though, and I won't be buying Kraft again anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfort Food","review":"One of my sons' favorites when he was a little boy.

Best with buttermilk, sauce is a bit thicker and tangy, add a little shredded cheese and it does seem home made."},{"rating":"1","title":"pasta is okay, but sauce was flavorless","review":"I agree with the other reviewer who called this bland. While eating this, it seemed like I was eating boiled noodles with a little milk poured on top. I couldn't taste ANY cheese flavor.For those who don't want to make their own mac & cheese, basically ANY brand of frozen mac & cheese is better than this box mix -- and most frozen mac & cheese meals aren't very good, either. Best pre-prepared mac & cheese: a tie between Amy's (VERY strong cheese flavor) and Trader Joe's \\"reduced guilt\\" (you can tell there's real cheese in it, though the cheese they use isn't as sharp as I'd like). Yes, both of these are more expensive than this box mix, but if you're willing to eat this stuff you really should just buy your pasta separately and then sprinkle some grated parmesan cheese on top; you'll save money and at least you'll get some cheese flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"yummy with yogurt","review":"We love making this \\"mac and cheese\\" using yogurt instead of milk and butter. That makes it very thick and creamy. The shells are a nice variation on macaroni, gathering more cheese in the \\"insides\\".

(Though we usually need to make 2 or three boxes to feed all the kids.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is just wonderful. It doesn't sit in your stomach like a rock, like some other brands. The taste is delicate and not too salty. Dare I say it even tastes like real food?

There is no substitute and no imitation. If you follow the directions (including the butter), you can't go wrong. I have found that the sauce can get lumpy if not done right so it seems to work best if made in a separate sauce pan and added later. Of course, it may say that on the box, but I've never looked. This is just trial and error here. Much better than Kraft mac n cheese though only this variety.

People visit and don't even know I have cats until they walk around a corner in the house and see the litter box. Since it is clay litter, the bags are kinda heavy (the larger one is anyways). The good thing about this particular clay litter is that it's not dusty at all! I recently tried one of those crappy brands from Kmart because I ran out of this stuff and the Kmart one was so dusty my cats didn't like it(they actually appeared as if they were debating getting into the box everytime they had to go!) and had sneezing spells! I definitely give this litter 5 stars!Also - other than Amazon and possibly other online stores, the only physical store that sells this brand is Petsmart. While it can seem kind of pricey, it is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fun album, good show too","review":"This is a really great album. It has a sort of modernized 80's feel to it. It's very refreshing to hear something that, while essentially electronica, has more of soul to it than alot of the garbage you hear coming out these days. IATWTC also puts on a great show, and when I talked with them afterwards, they seemed to be very nice people - they're the kind of band you want to see succeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED THIS BOOK","review":"This book was so good that I don't even know what to say about it. First of all, Nunez is a phenomenal author with an excellent talent for weaving a beautiful and intricate tale while simultaneously offering the reader a great deal of knowledge. I felt as though I learned a great deal about West Indian culture and the Civil Rights movement in the United States. The characters were very well developed. I felt their truimphs and their short falls as my own. Sarah is a brilliant character, and her relationship with fellow exchange student Courtney, although strange and disturbing, was intriguing as well. This one comes highly recommended to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally found something","review":"I've tried behavior modification, diffusers, etc., but this product was the first thing that made an appreciable difference.

I was washing sheets once or twice per day, but since using this product for the last three weeks, we've only had two incidents. What a change! I'm not saying other things don't help, but this liter made a HUGE difference and probably kept us from putting the cat down."},{"rating":"2","title":"This actually works!","review":"We are a two-cat household. Our female cat has begun to occasionally pee in a corner, despite the fact that we have 4 litter boxes that I scoop several times a day. We think it is a territorial issue. I bought a bag of this litter and mixed it 50/50 with the old litter in one of the litter boxes and she loves it! She almost exclusively uses the one box that has this litter and I haven't seen her going in the corners anymore (it's been 2 weeks so I'll keep my eye out). The litter clumps well, tracking is about average, and no dust. No strong perfume smell. If you are having a problem with your cat going potty outside the box give this a try. I have also had good luck with Feliway diffusers to help decrease the aggression in our male cat. (both cats have been fixed so that's not the issue).

She is just awful and painfully transparent. Her writing isn't simple in a charming, thought provoking way but simple, as in dumb. She is incapable of writing anything complex or creative-whether it's a sentance or a plot. Warner Publishing should be embarrassed that they have given this woman a writing contract. If this is the caliber of writing they desire, then they have 6th grade classrooms across the U.S. full of their kind of \\"talent\\".

The case studies are excellent - learn these off by heart and you will get the numerous IOS command questions correct (you have to type them)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst written book ever read !","review":"This book is quite simply the worst training guide I have ever read. It is filled with typos, contradictions, mixed syntax conventions, and mixed writing styles.In one section there might be an excellent description of configuration commands, while in the next section you will be introduced into an entirely new set of commands in example format with no explanation of what each individual command does.Sections appear to be randomly thrown together in whatever order they were completed, with absolutely no consistency in style even within the same chapter.This is nowhere near the high standard of Cisco's ACRC book.My advice is to avoid this at all costs unless you already know the material, or have the Cisco Dial Solutions book to check out every command for accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"Not an enjoyable book to read. I found this book to be less than useful for a study guide to the 640-505. I'll admit up front that I have little experience with more than extremely basic async configs, but I found the material extremely hard to digest. Yes, I believe all of the information provided is more than adequate to get someone through the exam, however, the presentation makes it difficult to put the pieces together quickly. I wouldn't even consider this book a good reference.I'm guessing it's going to be a dust collector on my shelf. If you're into cram sessions prior to testing, start about 4 days prior with this one. It's probably an easier read if you are already quite familiar with the material, but again, IMO, it makes a terrible study guide. I'm comparing this with books I've read from Lammle/Hales/Sybex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written book","review":"This book does not explain the material well, i.e it is not worth keeping as a reference book unlike Cisco's ACRC book for example.The only reason I bought this book was becuase it covered some of the CMTD exam material (even these sections are badly written), but now I am desperateley looking to sell it.

The new BCRAN beta exam comes out in Novemeber and last through January. This means you HAVE to take the CMTD until Feburary when and if the new Remote-Access exam is avialable.

When will Cisco take it's educational books seriously? This book is better than most when it comes to simple mistakes but there are still plenty of mistakes and when you see complete paragraphs duplicated on the same page you know it hasen't been proof read.There is not the detail that Cisco books normally provide. Some sections go straight to the configuration without any real explanation of what is going on. Screen dumps lack the content to allow you to clearly see the full configuration. There is a real lack of clarity, probably the worst of the books I've read so far, and I've read a few. But, I've come to know that if you learn all that is in the book you will pass the exam.

I'm disabled and have no way of doing that. The second table had the same defects. These are more than just a distressed finish. There is another defect on the second table top that I didn't see until it was put together and turned right-side up. It's a very poor fill job of chipped wood on the inlay.

If she made the choice to to put herself in that situation then she should have been responsible for the outcome. Her daughter Callie was in no way indebted to her mother for her mother's actions. This book was dreadful and I can't imagine any mother indebting her own unborn child.Take responsibility for your own actions, your child owes you nothing.So I guess Callie will be billing her mother for all Callie's psychologist appointments when she is older."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"This book is simple and fun.

Mostly","review":"I purchased the Angel box set having never seen the whole show, only the first season. And though I do not regret making this purchase, I do think that some people might. In watching the series, I found that the 2-4 seasons all had too much rammed in. It seemed more like The Pirates Of The Carribean 3 more than anything else, really. Good content mostly, some crazy ideas that seemed to be made up for lack of other ideas, and way too much of everything. In virtually every episode Angel and Connor feuded, Angel made a show of not trusting Wesley, and they all got beat up by a giant firey unkillable demon. In short, though I personally found this a good purchase, I think that most won't want to waste their money. Better to purchase the first and last seasons, and find a way to watch the others online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel","review":"I love this TV show! It compact!

I went through two different box sets before I found one that had no defects (at least, none that I'm aware of yet). 20th Century Fox was absolutely no help in resolving my issues with mislabeled discs. HELLO!? Fox produced this box set, they are ultimately responsible for manufacturer defects in the discs! When you order this box set, you better make sure that all the discs will play correctly and that they contain the labeled content. By the way, you only have the 30-day return policy in which to accomplish this.

Seasons three and four kind of sucked, they were a little too SciFi, but Joss really flipped things around in Season 5. It's my favorite and I watch it over and over!! I hated killing off Cordelia, but her character was a little compromised after the whole pregnant-with-Connor's-evil-child saga. I didn't like that, but I did like Connor's character and Cordy's visions.What sucks is that you could tell David Boreanaz was getting out of shape, and thus looking older. He was making Angel less seductive (thought he's always been hot) because he started to look older. But it's been a few years, and as soon as Bones started up, he looked almost exactly like his cameo on Buffy! Makes me sad.I hope they get the cast all together again and do one last Angel or Buffy movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"grrr aarrrgh","review":"Box had a slightly crunched corner but hey, coulda been the mailman.

I grew up with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and always thought David Boreanaz was one of the most phenomenal actors on television. When he got his own spin off, I was even more excited. If you want to learn more about the world of demons, vampires, love, sex, but from the other side of things, from the view of a Vampire with a soul, this is the show for you. A great companion piece to Buffy. The entire series has very spot on humor, but is generally darker than Buffy. It still has the wit and charm as the Buffy series, but has its own characters too. Buffy makes some appearances, but it really dives into the world of Angel, and his struggles with redemption. I recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angle the complete series","review":"I liked it a lot not done watching all of it yet but the ones ive seen are in great condition and play well to.

It took a few episodes before it found it's voice, or maybe I just didn't love the plots, I dunno. But I love Angel, and slightly more than Buffy actually. The show is kind of gut wrenching.

While Buffy seemed geared toward teenagers, Angel is more for the adult fans. It deals with many themes, from finding ones path in life to dying for what you believe in. It's hard to imagine a world without hope and Angel proves to us that so long as we do our part, there will always be hope. Five seasons was not enough and I truly miss this wonderful show. I only hope that someday in the future the WB will be able to produce a show that will live up to the standards that Angel left them. In ordering Angel it is my personal guarantee that you will not be dissapointed.

Angel is a wonderful show and entertaining for ages 16 to 120. Like BTVS this show made me laugh, cry, and sometimes even angry but that's one of the reasons I love it so much is all the emotions I feel when I watch it. Angel is a complex character surrounded by a great group of friends (and enemies). My favorite season is #5 except the loss of Charisma Carpenter.

I really appreciate the space saving nature of these boxed sets because I live in a small apartment. However, if you already have all of the seasons there is little reason to buy this set, there is no material that wasn't included with the individual seasons other than a letter to the fans from Joss Whedon. I, however, had none of the seasons so this was a money and space saver. My only complaint, if it can be called that, is that there is no indication of which episodes have commentaries and on which disks the special features are on. It certainly isn't a deal breaker and I can either make a list for myself or go online to find the list as I am sure that several fans have compiled lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice screen cover","review":"Nice hinged screen cover.

It has definitely changed my general definiton of what PA means. I am amazed at how much material is presented for the 5 types of styles identified. How they are manifested in an individual or in otherwords how it all began in the first place. This book is set up for the therapist but it presented in such a manner that an ordinary person outside this field can understand the concept presented. The author is so thorough with his information that he presents a concept and then vividly illustrates this concept with as many examples that would make the material comprehensible. It explores the relationship between the victim and the PA person. It offers a variety of therapy applications for some of the styles presented.A unique finding was the book's glimpse of how the therapist can also be PA towards it client;and how the therapist can miss the PA in a person diagnosis."},{"rating":"1","title":"cold clinical text with high faluten language","review":"This book is not a guid for the patient the victim and the therapist. it is for the therapist alone. as a victim i found this to be like reading a text book. it uses alot of medical and psychological jargon and feels inaccessible to the depserate lay person looking for guidance."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was ok","review":"it was not for beginners, but i still liked it. the instructions went kinda fast though, i had to watch it through first and then i could exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"for some [most?] gamers","review":"Something for somebody.

I love how it folds to take up less room in my bag. It's 1875W so it dries my hair just as well as my big one at home and it comes with the concentrator, which I need because I tend to get the dryer really close to my hair (the heat will burn your hair without the concentrator). The only thing I wish it had is a retractable cord but I guess you can't have everything. I would highly recommend this dryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasted 3 Years...might buy it again.","review":"Well, how long is a hair dryer really supposed to last? I purchased this in February 2008 and used it daily (not just for travel) until it started smoking last week - so almost 3 years. For $15 I think it was worth it. Nice and light, hair dries fast enough and not frizzy. I haven't decided whether I'll upgrade or just go with a known quantity here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I had an old hair dryer from Vidal Sasson which was over 10 years old. When it started working weird, I ordered Ionic Travel Dryer from Amazon, I trusted the brand name Vidal Sasson, but it was defective and I had to return it. Then I bought the same from some place else. It was not what I expected. The new technology \\"Ionic\\" should make the drying time short, but it was not true for me. It was even taking longer time compare to the 10 years old one. And this one was too big and heavy to be a travel dryer, it would take up the space in your suit case. I had to return it again then bought 2 dryer - one for travel and the other for home, from the local beauty store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 1 year","review":"I think a blow dryer should last more than 1 year, so am disappointed in this product's durability, but on the other hand, I didn't like it much, so am glad I am forced to buy a new one. To be completely fair, I am reviewing last year's version of this dryer, which looks similar (gold color), but who knows- they may have changed it, for all I know.Anyway, my gripes are 1) the ON button is a rocker switch which is hard to turn on and with 3 settings, easy to overshoot the middle position. 2) the cold burst isn't cold - it's just slightly less hot and with far less wind force. During the summer I usually dry my hair on the cold setting, as it's already too hot in my bathroom. So what I want is lots of air and no heat - just the opposite of what this dryer delivered.A long time ago I had a huge Vidal Sasson dryer that I loved.

The dryer is only 5 months old, it is on 125V, nothing changed from the previous few weeks... then this suddenly happens. It scared me to death. It is past Amazon's return date and I can't find who manufactures it (it is not Vidal Sassoon) to report this problem, so I wanted to get this review out as soon as possible before it burns down someone's house!

The only complaint I have is it's size. In my opinion, it is almost the size of a regular hair dryer. I suppose if the size is smaller, it would not have the same power. That is why I give it a four star. The price is reasonable for this hair dryer at $25 which includes taxes and delivery.

With major releases by Basement Jaxx, Cassius, Moby, Chemical Brothers, and countless other artists, Dance Party 2000 seems strangely out of place. The song selection itself is strange, with no real method, and a good portion of this music is more top 40 than house. The transitions between songs are absolutely abysmal for the most,as smooth as chopped gravel, and rather obnoxious. This is probably the single most average example of DJing I've heard on record, also displaying just how fine the line is between a true artist and a merely competent one. For those who are looking for an entrance to club music, this might be a safe purchase, but to anyone familiar with club music, this will prove to be yet another boring, faceless mix that you've heard 100 times already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheffield 12705 Knife","review":"Very disappointed with durability. The auto-lock tab broke off immediately after opening then closing the blade ONCE just to test the actuation...I didn't even using the knife.

After watching it I would have to say that this DVD was just a bit over hyped. \`Animusic 2' is not a bad watch at all. I enjoyed watching it, but I think that is the secret word here. This DVD was more visual than musical. The original's music was what really made the overall DVD great. I loved the new sequences from a visual standpoint. It was a huge step forward from the original. The highpoints were the return of the stickman with his new posse as well as the starship grooving robots and who can forget the amazing finale in \`Heavy Light'. The visuals were great but the music was just not the perfect match and that was a huge step back. If there will be an \`Animusic 3', which there are very few rumors about, I feel Wayne Lyttle needs to remember that its not \`Animusic' with out the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME!!!","review":"This is great!

The weakest entries were Resonant Chamber (a creepy and out-of-place guitar/wooden spider fusion), Cathedral Pictures (I don't like religious music or themes), and Gyro Drums.

I have shown it to countless family and friends, and they all love it. I have a rather large DVD library, and this is one of the few that I watch frequently. While I hesitate to compare \\"Animusic 2\\" to the first release, \\"Animusic\\", this really is superior in quality and depth. It is visually beautiful on a widescreen TV, and the graphics are much more detailed and interesting than in \\"Animusic\\". I do recommend both, however.The amazingly cool technology feat behind this production is that it's not simply \\"animation\\" done to to music like you would see in productions like Fantasia. All of the \\"performing objects\\" in each scene are separately tied to MIDI controls, so the objects actually appear to \\"perform\\" exactly what notes they are playing.

But the Hebrew Themes (Julliard String Quartet) is dreadful. Because they slow the tempo (for some damned reason) and thereby ruin the whole piece. I was very disappointed, because the concertos and the Overture all together on one two-disc set would have been a treasure. It was enraging and I wanted to throw the whole thing away, and still may and find another recording of the concertos. I like things to be perfect. On this CD, however, the Overture is perfect. It's played up to tempo and is charming. The string quartets, on the other hand, are a horror! As a contemporary critic said of Tchaikovsky's violin concerto, it's ugly music. I don't expect Prokofiev's string quartets to rise from the ashes as the Tchaikovsky did! Lt. Kije. The Hebrew Themes. The 7th Symphony. The Piano Concertos.

Even later, the cultists weren't really fleshed out. It was hard to tell just who they were or what they were like - the dialogue was often hard to follow - and the end was extremely unsatisfying; it left too many unanswered questions.I remember reading an interview with novelist Robert B. Parker in which he said that his first draft was pretty much what got published, and I couldn't help feeling like the same was true here, and what it needed was another polish. In fact, it needed a whole new ending.Don't get me wrong - I'll read every one of these that Mr. Bowen cares to write, they are that rewarding - but if you're curious and want to try one, don't start here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"This was the first novel I have read in the series, and I doubt seriously if I will read anymore.

And all without the hassle of setting up and using the least user friendly and unnecessarily complex software I have used in many years. This paper ought to cost about 1/2 of the price it is being sold for. If I had not already invested in their dreadful software, I would not be using this.

Also found that if your hard drive fails then you lose the ability to print any remaining checks and must purchase a new code. If the machine misprints and one checks that they did not print properly it still deducts checks from those available to print. Generally I find that the new system is a scam designed to get one to purchase more codes.

I finally called tech support and after sitting on hold and sitting longer I put them in the dumpster and called my printer to order checks. If my time is worth minimum wage I wasted $100 on this box of check paper and software. What a waste of money :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal digitization","review":"This digital edition, produced by PG Distributed Proofreaders using voluteer editors, is riddled with typos, missed paragraph breaks, entires lines out of order, and other formatting errors. If you are interested in reading Disraeli's odd early novel, try some other digital edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent reference for shoppers","review":"Covers all types of spirits and fortified wines. Provides five-star rating system. Brief text entries with no graphics makes book suitable as a reference, but not an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inevitable disappointment","review":"As a long time fan of Bid D & the Kids Table and Ska Punk music in general, this album is simply disappointing. How it Goes set the bar too high for the next album to top; simple as that. While How it Goes had great songs that each stood out because of there unique musical approach and compelling lyrics, Strictly Rude, fails to capture that original quality. There are good songs on the album but not enough to surpass the value of How it Goes or even Good Luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I spent hours trying to get this order straightened out. Finally learned that the vermillion lenses I wanted were no longer available. Not only that but they sent me a pair with the wrong lens color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product! No special ink needed!","review":"I was surprised to see negative reviews on this product..and especially surprised to see that some thought they needed special ink to print the checks. I have been using VersaCheck products for over 10 years and have never one time had any problem printing my checks on my inkjet printer. Until just recently I was doing bookkeeping for small businesses and printed all the checks for my clients. They loved it. Even though I did charge them, the fee was nominal compared to what they had to pay their banks or other check printing companies to print their checks.I still use the versachecks for our own personal checking accounts. Ordering through Amazon saves you big money as compared to ordering directly from G7 or from Office Depot or the like.In my opinion, this is a wonderful and very helpful product. Don't let the negative reviews cheat you out of trying a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"I liked this book so much that I didn't want to stop reding it. I was dissappointed when I finished it because I wanted more. The book told all about the history of Fighting Irish football from the 1940s to 1997. The book was almost entirly written from former ND player's accounts. If you like this book, read Notre Dame's Greatest Coaches by Moose Krause. It is muhc like this book. Talking Irish is one of the best books I have ever read."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],M={key:0},H={key:1};function N(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-ccc3cf1e"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/21.md","filePath":"sponsor/21.md"}'),R={name:"sponsor/21.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
