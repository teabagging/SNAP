If fact, I put it down to read something else and almost forgot to return to it. The story was mildly interesting, however, there were several different \\"mini-plots\\" that detracted from the whole. The story never got moving and there was no sense of suspense. To be honest, I was irritated by the ending, not satisfied as I usually am. And PLEASE, get rid of Laurel! She has to be the most obnoxious character I've ever read about. A little (very little!) of Laurel goes a long way. Also, Max has turned into a mindless playboy who reminds me of a big St. Bernard with Annie as his trainer.

Annie's mother-in-law, made out to be dim-witted and boozy, was constantly being derided, yet she never did a single mean or hurtful thing to either Annie or Max.

It took me two tries to actually read the book. I was disappointed in many ways with this book. The multitudnous synonyms for \\"to go\\" and \\"to walk\\" are indicative of the predictable sentence structure. To give Hart credit,it did take me a while to figure out who the murderer was. However, this was definitely a low point in the series. Maybe it's time to wrap this one up if the plots and writing are as predictably boring and excruciating as in this volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorous who-done-it, but too cutesy","review":"I've read a few Henry-O books and enjoyed Dead Man's Island. I've read only one other Death on Demand series and thought I'd try this one. However, I felt that it drags along, especially when Annie refers to other mystery writers....I skipped a lot of that. Also, I got vey bored at the continual descriptions of the South Carolina heat and humidity. I did have fun counting all the verbs the author used for \\"walked\\": darted, sped, skipped, slid, raced, rushed,loped,jolted, etc., etc.. There must be a list somewhere.

Dalek episodes are always some of my most favorite stories. This is by far the best Dalek episode ever made. I watched this story several times on repeats on PBS as a kid. The story is essentially about how Davros created the Daleks in his own image. He was the great Kaled engineer that was very [..]like. I think he was overused in the later stories of the Daleks. He fit perfectly into this story. It takes a lot from the William Hartnell episode The Daleks, which is the first ever Dalek story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Episodes Of All Time !","review":"Genesis Of The Daleks is the absolute all time greatest Dalek story in Who history ! Most of the time, when a real fan of Doctor Who think \\"Dalek\\" the image in their mind is the shiny grey and black of the classic Dalek design in this story.

I was surprised that the author chose to make her feminist cluture a true matriarchy, rather than the usual egalitarian societies usually portrayed in these books. While I would have liked to have seen more agency and spirituality from Danu and the other men of the cities--for example, what kind of rituals did they conduct while the women worshiped at the full moon?--Tarr managed to create male characters who were strong and thoughtful, not abused, degraded and twisted, like their female counterparts among the horsemen."},{"rating":"2","title":"read it","review":"I found it very interesting to see life through more than one view.It was a hard world then,and blame for many things has been placed in error I believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there a CD to go with this?","review":"I had this compilation on cassette tape years ago and absolutely loved it.

The hardcover and audiocassette versions of Dark Mirror came out before \\"Crossover\\" was aired, and this allowed the paperback to come out afterward.

Also the story is solid, and unfolds in a steady pace. But the end doesn't seem satisfying--the outcome almost seems too easy, and the pacing doesn't feel right (things happen too quickly as we get close to the end, and cause the outcome to be almost unbelievable).I can't say more because I don't want to give away any of the story to those of you who still care to read it. It truly is a great read. Just be prepared for a slightly disappointing ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil truly comes in any form","review":"The way in which this book deals with the alternate universe puts the DS9 version to shame.

I've read a handful of Trek novels, and this is my least favorite by far. It was dry, boring and difficult to get through. The novel had no structure of any kind (no build up and no climax) and the \\"suprise ending\\" was pretty lame. I found a lot of the characters saying and doing things they normally wouldn't do. I know that Duane is no stranger to the Trek franchise, but if I didn't know better I would assume that she didn't know these characters at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Mirror Review","review":"Really good book.

Everyone except Giles and Dawn played a part (too bad about Giles). I could barely put it down. I was wondering how they would handle Buffy/Spike/Angel, but it was very well done. Lots of action, lots and lots of monsters, great character descriptions. Should have been much longer, it was so good.I just picked up Impressions, which was an earlier Angel novel, and am not enjoying it half as much. Angel novels are extremely uneven, from the ridiculous to the sublime. One needs to pay close attention to the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is out of touch with the show..","review":"Another in a long list of Buffy books which are shockingly out of touch with the show after season 3.

It is absolutely ridiculous how obnoxious this monitor is! We finally started using it when we moved the baby to his own room at 7.5 weeks--two days later my husband said either I get a new monitor or he's just going to chuck this one out the window! The baby didn't wake us up for hours, but the receivers woke us up at least two dozen times between feedings! The static and the constant clicking made me feel like we were listening to a CB on the highway! The good news is: I returned it to Babies r Us (even though I threw out the box the week before I returned it) and I bought the Sony 9 channel monitor. It stinks that it doesn't have to receivers, but there is NO STATIC! We are very pleased AND it was $10 cheaper! Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this product--buy the Sony instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE MONITOR","review":"Do not buy this monitor. I am taking it off of my baby registry. It picks up the sounds of the street cars but not of my babies. I have quads and I can't hear them screaming for the sounds of the cars going by in this stupid monitor. Do not I repeat do not buy this unless you like wasting money and don't care to hear your baby in their room."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Monitor is a NIGHTMARE!","review":"Just as the first reviewer on this page - this monitor is horrible! The batteries have NEVER gone out at any other time than 4:00am, there's simply no warning and the static is unbearable. We registered for this monitor because of the two separate monitors, which I thought would save us from having to change the batteries so often and give us a few options for leaving them in various rooms throughout the house. Really, this has been the MOST frustrating part of new motherhood! I highly suggest that you try a different monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Static - Can't hear the Baby!","review":"I was told that this was a top of the line monitor but after receiving it as a gift, I had to return it because of all the static.

It got to the point that every time I would turn it on I would get interference, it was useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"When it worked it worked well. The only problem is that it didn't work very often. This monitor is not worth the money. I constantly got static. When I moved, if I just left it still.

Let me say this, the first night we had our baby home, the batteries went dead in the transmitter!! Not because of the baby crying hard, but because of all the \\"short bursts\\" of static!!

We can fix it for about 15 seconds by changing channels and then back again, but I have to keep running over to the receivers to do it. It basically is static all the time - and we leave it plugged in, since we originally thought the batteries were the problem.

Great at 2am when it's the reciever down stairs! Also at times it does NOT pick up the baby. I will be sitting somewhere that I can hear baby and the monitor and I will NOT hear the baby on the monitor.

I had this monitor and thought I had a bad one so I exchanged it for another just like it and it has the same issues. The static will drive you nuts!!! It continually looks for a different channel and makes a clicking noise. I spent more time awake listening to all the noise the monitor made while my baby slept. I went in to Babie R Us to get a new monitor and asked a clerk about the monitors and they agreed with me that this one received really bad reviews and did not recommend it. I asked why it was still on the shelves. They said they do listen so hopefully soon it will be gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!","review":"This is such a horrible monitor! I received it at my shower because I had registered for it based on good feedback. Once we had the twins and actually used it, we found that there was a popping sound every minute or so and static about 1/3 of the time!! We are planning on returning it as soon as we can make it out to Babies R Us. We ended up buying a Graco one that works just wonderfully!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Monitor [is bad!]","review":"The first day it worked good. But like 10 days later nothing but static, humming, and buzzing. Even opening and closing doors would set this thing off. It scared me because it would make the loud noise as if you shut the base off in the baby's room. And the base was on. I went running into my childs room to make sure he was ok. And the people at First Years were not very helpful. I am going and replacing it after having it less than a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I agree with what all of the Moms wrote...this monitor is horrible.

My family bought this for our second child after our old monitor went out after 3 years of good service. We were only able to hear two things with this death machine, static or complete silence, though I don't know if a person can hear complete silence. Save your money and buy a different monitor, I recommend at least Fisher Price monitor that broadcast in the 900 or better range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time (or money) with this one.......","review":"After having success with an older \\"First Years\\" monitor, we were in need of a new one. Without doing my homework I immediately went and bought this \\"upgraded\\" First Years model. What a mistake. We cannot use it anymore since all we hear is annoying \\"flicking\\" static on one channel, and the second channel picks up the noise in my neighbors house. I spoke to a company representative who suggested that I ask my neighbor to move her monitor further away from my home!! Otherwise, that I should go buy another monitor that is a higher or lower mghz. If this complaint is so common, the company should explore ways to correct. I couldn't be more dissatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"STATIC","review":"We have had a terrible time with our monitors. They pick up every bit of static!

It is so temperamental that if you so much as move you will get this horrible, loud static. Forget about walking around with it clipped to your belt. When you do manage to find a place to put it where it doesn't do this, there is still a low hum of static that makes it hard to hear anything but the loudest noises. And the next day, it might not work in that spot anymore! Very frustrating. Also, if you wave your hand in front of it, the little lights light up... those are supposed to tell you the monitor is picking up sound, so... can't really trust those either. Please don't waste your money. Get ANY BRAND but this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Peace Of Mind\\" Yea Right!!!","review":"This monitor gave me more problems than any other baby item I own.

Doesn't matter where the person is, it will scream until you stop moving. And it usually occurs just as my daughter is settling back down to sleep which means we have to start all over.It is also very loud. Even on 0 (zero) I can still hear my children. On levels 2/3, they are more than loud enough for me to hear breathing. Occasionally, I like to turn down the monitor and only see the lights but with this monitor that doesn't work, you always have to hear them unless it is turned off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static static static!!!!","review":"Awful!! I registered for this monitor and received it as a gift and after using it for about 3 months replaced it. This monitor will scream out with static out of nowhere and scare you half to death while also waking up the baby 2 rooms away!! The static is THAT loud!!! Not to mention I don't really need to hear what my neighbors are talking about on the phone! Worried me that others would hear what all we were saying!!

I was awake soooo many nights because of the static and this incessant beeping noise!! Mom's know how hard it is waking up several times a night because of the baby, but waking up even more often because your baby monitor is beeping at you is ridiculous!!! I hope someone from First Years reads this and makes some serious changes!! In the mean time, buy the Sony 27-channel baby monitor. Sometimes it's hard to find (they can't seem to keep them on the shelves) but well worth it! I even went back and bought my sister one when she got pregnant.

One night...we actually heard someone's phone call coming through on the monitor. For the most part, you don't even hear your baby...you hear static and noise. I can't believe they can even market an item like this which obviously has many problems. We took ours back. Do yourself a favor, if you get this as a gift...take it back before you even open it.

We bought this one because it was the same manufacturer, and we liked the idea of having two receiver units. I wish we had checked here and read some reviews first. We have tried for months (don't ask me why we didn't return them) and have never been able to get clear reception. The unit picks up random cell phone conversations, radio broadcasts, interspersed with maddening static, electronic farts and squeals. Our old model had convenient built in rechargable batteries, but these units take 4 AA batteries each, making them fairly heavy, and they suck the power down very rapidly. Don't make the same mistake we did. Look elsewhere for a monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work properly","review":"My daughter is now 7 months old, and for the first 5 months we used this monitor because we didn't realize that it wasn't supposed to make all those noises.

This product crakles, makes fuzzy noises, and does not pick up little noises from the baby. I would not wast $50.00 on this product. It is one of the most expensive, but yet works horribly. You can spend a lot less and get a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Pretty much cr-p. Sound reception is ok. But it keeps clicking every few seconds.

Last night we even got in an argument, half-asleep in the middle of the night because that stupid thing just flared up and got all loud and static around 2 a.m. Even if we turn on the PS2, the TV or god forbid talk on the phone or walk by it...forget it.

Even one star is rating it too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problems as most everyone","review":"Unfortunately we didn't read the reviews before using this monitor. When it works it's great, clear and sensitive, but that is rare. The unit picks up interference from everything, refrigerator, hair dryer, sometimes unknown.

The static is ridiculous and I find myself repositioning it and turning it on and off multiple times during naps. And while it picks up Avery's sounds, it does pick up everything else as well.

I am actually searching the internet now for a new monitor and I thought I'd share my experience w/ someone else looking for a monitor.I really like the fact that it has 2 receivers and that all units have battery backup. It makes it easy to visit a friend w/o kids. I can just pack the pack and play and throw the monitor and a receiver in the bag and not have to worry about power. (I am now looking for those features in a differnt monitor.)The problem is the static. I keep 1 reciever downstairs and one in our bedroom. This morning my wife brought our son downstairs.

This monitor is NOT for nighttime use because of the static problems, and is not good for any more than short distances. Best works at a distance (base to receiver) of about 15 feet.

Unfortunately, the Fisher Price model has MUCH more static and white noise when turned on than does this monitor (The First Years).

I thought maybe this static thing only applies to others until I started using it more frequently after baby was born. It is worthless. I can't even take a shower without it going static on me, plus then you can't hear if baby is crying so it is worthless.

We registered for this piece of junk without reading the reviews. We used the monitor for only 2 nights before returning it. My son would finally get to sleep, but then the stupid monitor would wake me up!! Besides the constant buzzing sound, it made a loud pop every 5-10 seconds.

Giving us only one receiver that did not function properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible static interference!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This Monitor can be described in one word-Horrible. My Husband and I would awaken in the middle of the night to this wretched static noise. Our baby slept through the night since day one...it was the monitor that kept us up. I finally gave up on it when she was 4 weeks old and got the sound and lights with dual receivers...it's been about 16 weeks since we got it and we have never had one problem with it.

Look at all the reviews and the verdict on this unit is: It is terrible!!!Save yourself the stress and headache of not purchasing this and/or don't put this on your baby registry. Nothing is more annoying or stressful when you cannot hear your baby moan or cry over the static and unnecessary noise of the monitor. You might as well go and sleep in your baby's room...............It worked fine for the first week or two and all went down hill from there. Unfixable static and then an annoying clicking sound every 2 to 3 seconds. Nothing changed in the house, no new equipment added. Then the power brick died and I ended up throwing the device away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"I registered for this monitor without doing any research. I recieved for a shower gift and used it. From the beginning, it had a lot of static. I just figured that it was normal. After about 9 monhts it quit working completly. I returned it and tried another one which was also had a lot a stict. So I decided to try one more. I had an old Graco one that I had bought at a second had store and thought I would try the newer one like it. I have had it for about 1 1/2 years and LOVE IT. It is so clear and nice. I recommend it to anyone looking for good monitor. It is a three peace set, and it was not very expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Peace of Mind","review":"This monitor may be peace of mind for the baby sleeping but not for the parents. The parent's monitors makes a continuous crackling noise and picks up a lot of interference because of the 900mhz. On several occasions it has picked up someone elses phone conversation. The constant noise drives me crazy and it only has two channels to switch back and forth from and I find that one channel is worse than the other.I am taking this back for one that will give me peace of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last thing a new parent needs!!! Horrible product!!","review":"If we only knew when we registered how terrible this monitor is we would have never received one as a baby gift. Unfortunately I threw away the box and never did get a gift reciept so I never tried taking it back. What a waste of good money. The static is horrible. We also had the really loud and constant clicking that the other reviews complained about too. The last thing new parents (or parent) needs is a monitor that grinds on the last sleep deprived nerve in your body. Interestingly, months after we bought a new set (a Graco which we love)a friend of mine was returning her monitor set which was a different monitor by the same company. I'll never buy anything by this company again!!

But it was only when I was outside. We then started hearing clicking sounds all night. I am a light sleeper anyway and found it impossible it sleep. I receatly picked up my neighbors phone conversation as well. This is a horrible product! Dont waste your money.

I was told this was the best one out there (by friends) and boy were they wrong. First of all, it clicks constantly and when it's not clicking the static takes its place.

Same price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good in a High Rise","review":"We live in a high rise condo building. When we tested this monitor, I couldn't imagine how it could have performed any worse.

When we were trying to sleep at night it drove us NUTS! After a couple days of use we put it in the closet and opened a cheaper one that had been given to us and it is soooo much better.

I figured since it was a higher priced monitor, it would be one of the higher quality monitors. WRONG. I am not a review writer but I was so unhappy with these monitors. They are something that you need from day one when baby comes home, and there is a lot a stress created when they don't work correctly. Tons of static and interference to the point where my husband wanted me to turn it off and just check on the baby...well, most moms would agree that is a not an acceptable solution. Anyway, do yourself a favor, don't use these monitors. Whichever ones you do purchase...test them out for a day or two before the baby comes, because the last thing you want to be doing when baby comes home is worrying about replacing your monitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I read all the reviews on this model and thought I would give it a chance. Its performance has been horrible. The popping static is never ending, especially if there is any electrical devices between the baby and myself. This rules out using it in the kitchen, the living room and especially anywhere near the washing machine. In addition, use outside is equally as bad - we are on a clear open ranch. Its range does not even come close to what it claims and the static contiues outside where there are virtually no other electonic devies being used. The only time it works effectively I find my ears work almost as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I hear is static!","review":"Maybe I am using this thing incorrectly, but all I hear is static! I have the units turned down to the lowest possible setting, and it's all static. There is no way I would want that sitting by my bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Static!!!!","review":"I purchased this because of the two parent units. However I never read the reviews here to find out that, even though you have two units you also have twice as much static!If your baby is fast asleep at night, no one will get any sleep because of the static that happens every 30 seconds over each unit.Depending on where the main unit is placed in the baby's room or anywhere in the house will increase or decrease the frequency of the static. Wouldn't you just want to place it near the baby and not have to worry about which way it is turned to avoid the static? It will take too much time to figure that out.Also, there are many things in your house that will interfere with the monitors:Fluorescent lightsMotors from normal household objects like Dishwashers, furnace, air conditioner, dryer, washing machine etc.Save your money and purchase another product that will give you peace of mind. This one will just keep you up at night and give you a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Count me in the group that thought this is a waste of money","review":"Like a lot of the other reviewers, I received this monitor as a gift. I've dealt with the headache for the three weeks that our baby has been home, but I'm going out today to buy another one that WORKS! I would say that it only worked without horrible static about 5-10% of the time. Everything interferes with it - I heard our neighbors' cordless phone conversations more often than I heard our baby! Most of the time, though, it just emits a horribly loud, continuous static. Obviously this is a problem with this product - I wish First Years would either fix the problem or take it off the market. Bottom line: pick ANYTHING but this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Get Much Worse Than This","review":"I couldn't see how you could get a worse baby monitor than this. Ours continually has problems with static and noise, and routinely picks up phone conversations from other houses in our area. Just last night, while the monitor was on, instead of waking up to my baby crying, I woke up to the sounds of a phone number being punch in and then the ringing you hear when calling someone.When our baby starts crying, the monitor instantly goes to static, like we have it turned up too loud. Well, I turned it down as far as it would go, and it still does it! Both units are plugged in, not on battery power.I'm sick and tired of this hunk of junk product. I would avoid this product! If you're still interested in getting this product, you can dig it out of my garbage. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont see why all the negative reviews","review":"I bought this a few days ago and have had no troubles. At first we had a graco and it was horrible static. My parents had the same graco model and it worked perfectly. I think it depends on where you live and the interference.

It is really clear with no static and you can hear every little noise, plus I like the 2 receivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does BABIESRUS continue to sell this defective monitor?","review":"Unfortunately we did not read the reviews before buying this monitor and simply fell into the \\"Its more expensive so it must be a better monitor trap\\".Simply put, this baby monitor cannot be used for its intended purpose. It sounds more like a geiger counter than a baby monitor. The static is so bad no matter where the parent unit is placed that you would be better off just shutting the unit off and listening normally.One buys this product to allow freedom of movement for the parents. A monitor should allow you piece of mind that although you may be in another room of your house, you can still hear your baby while he or she is asleep.Even though nearly every review on this board has shown this product to be defective, BabiesRUs continues to sell it without disclaimer.

This is the WORST baby monitor ever. I am so sorry I didn't read these reviews earlier. The static will drive you insane! I used it for the first time last night, and after about 15 minutes I thought my husband was going to throw it out the window. The only way the static would go away is if I shut it off. I will be going to the store today to purchase a different one.

I can actually turn the thing up and hear my baby breathing (loudly) which is really cool, since it keeps me from getting out of the bed in the night to check on him. It's not really something I would have bought. I do a lot of investigating (usually) before I buy, and I would have been turned off by these reviews. My mother-in-law bought it right after she found out we were pregnant. Sort of an impulse buy. I would take them back if I didn't think it would hurt her feelings. Besides, what's a little screeching anyways? We all need to be on our toes...we're parents now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can You Hear Me Now????","review":"This was the biggest waste of money. I will not buy another First Years product again. I opted for the more expensive product over some of the cheaper monitors on the market.

One of the parent monitors was broken. We even switched outlets and batteries to find out what the problem could be. But had no luck.

The cover for the mirror's velcro doesn't work--eliminate that. The pieces that drop into the box are cute and well made--but the box won't stay together for them to be dropped in.

I LOVE not having to deal with returnables any more! There are two downsides to the kegerator. First, I had visions of rolling the kegerator around in my house or on my patio. The first time I tried, however, the frame members holding the rollers bent and nearly snapped off. Better to put this unit in one spot and leave it there.

The problem with this subbase is that Bosch, in saving a few sheckels, chose to have it cast out of high impact plastic. Unfortunately, the result is that there is 1/32\\" camber in the base. Consequently when you mount it, it's not flat, it doesn't hold the guide template in the proper relationshiip with the base, and even the most minor adjustments to the height of the bit result in a misalignment of the bit to the template guide. I purchased the centering cone, but it had no effect on the usefulness of this base. Since you have to remove the motor in order to get the centering cone out (there isn't enough clearance, as there would be with a normal router), everything gets misaligned and you're better off moving the base around until you get it aligned manually.

However, the recess around the center hole is too small and the outer flange of the guide bushings will not fit. I measured the recess diameter and it same out 1.370. The outer flange on my guide bushings all measure 1.376. The guide bushings are a good snug fit in the sub-base of my full sized router, so I don't believe they are the issue. The center hole measures 1.250, so the bushings will rattle around unless the outer flange is a close fit in the recess. Opening the diameter of the recess a few thousandths appears to be the only way to try to get the base to work correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!","review":"Only 14 tracks???

If you're not familar with earlier 311 works you may like this, otherwise sample this before buying i would say. In the future let's hope 311 won't let us \\"Down\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"311 does it again!","review":"Transistor is a great album, plain and simple. 311 breaks into new territory with this notable effort, and almost - but not quite - tops their supurb self-titled album. This album is better than Music and Grassroots, which were both excellent also, and it's a must-have for your record collection. The best songs are Transistor, Prisoner, Beautiful Disaster, Jupiter, Galaxy, Borders, The Continuous Life, and No Control. Some of the songs do get a little tedious at times...Rub A Dub and What Was I Thinking, for example, but its always fun to listen to them. This is the perfect CD to use if you wanna start a mosh pit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transistor is the best 311 yet.","review":"First off let me say that I was introduced into 311 about 2 years ago by my best friend Kyle. He had the self titled cd and brought it over to show me. It was awsome. but I hated the rap aspect of it. the he pulled out transistor. it was Awsome! I loved it! There is no dought that it is the best 311 so far. (I'm going to go get soundsystem this weekend so I might have a new fav.) And on another note the critcs have major problems. The reason the don't like 311 is because they dont like changes in bands. Your first cd is who you are. Thats bull. You should be able to exparament without have some old person who listend to Jonny Cash judge the music of teens in the nineties. If you like red hot chili pepers youll love it. I myself am a Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and Metallica fan. but I was Ineed of a new sound this was it. I recomend getting this cd. even if it dosent fit in with your greatest. it is one hell of a cd......"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"What I really like about this cd is that it has about 20-21 songs on it, and that gives the album a wide variety of sound from 311.

But it does include the hits \\"Prisoner\\" and \\"Beautiful Disaster\\", and other cool tracks like \\"Electricity\\" and \\"Stealing Happy Hours\\". This is a must for fans.

Nick Leaves his rap style at home and tries to sing through most of the album, Only Martinez Brings it, and that isnt enough to get the funk started, For me, being a true 311 fan since the \\"music\\" Days, the album is a dissapointment.

Yes, Missle Command and Centipede were played with the joystick on the home games, but there was an available trackball at the time that made them 10x more playable.So if Atari has hundreds (thousands?) of titles available, why would they choose to include 5 games that are next to impossible to play?I'd suggest buying the Namco 5-in-1 instead, but it has issues as well (runs much too fast, wrong sounds, etc..).

It is so stiff that even I have problems using it. The second problem is that the software is buggy. For example, unlike the original game, when you are playing Breakout the ball moves FASTER when you move the joystick. It should move at its original pace, but instead it picks up speed proportionally as you move making it almost impossible to catch up with the ball.My advice is to blow your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as fun as i remember","review":"i bought this and the namco pac-man games at the same time because i couldn't make up my mind which to get. i had to have both since i was so pumped up to see both of them and hadn't played the games in years. i tried pacman/digdug/galaxian first and it was great! just like the arcade games i remembered. then i plugged in my atari. what a disappointment. i forgot how crappy most of those games were. if you're trying to decide between the two all-in-one joysticks, go for the pacman 5-in-1. you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT even close to the original","review":"The movement, sounds, and graphics were all poor.

I've played Asteriods, Centipede, Breakout, and Missile Command before and know what they should be. What they are on this are ugly, misscolored, cheap recreations.Seriously how do you make the graphics on Asteriods worse? This thing is a disgrace and totally did not meet my expectations. The only one I found slightly amusing was pong. At least it was able to recreate 2 lines and a dot ball decently. (note, the ball is actually a square but you get over it)Breakout in particular plays like crap.Note - I did play one of these TV plug and games before that had various versions of PAC-MAN and Galaga which was very nice and had the actual original games.

These drawbacks would make me give it a 3, however since it is only $20 I went with 4.Educational-----------I'm not really sure how this could apply. I suppose its \\"educational\\" for those curious as to what gaming was like in the early 1980's.Durable-------Controller is manufactured very similiar to the original.

Other reviewers are correct in that the sound effects are not accurate reproductions of the originals. The major flaw; however, is response time. There is major lag between when you move the stick, or press the fire button, and before this action happens on the screen. Breakout was almost impossible to play because of the inability to get the timing down. The movements of the paddle on breakout were also very erratic. It was difficult to move in a controlled fashion, all I could achieve was a jerky dash across the screen. I grew up playing Atari 2600 and could roll the score on almost any game there was back then, and I am sure that my complaints are not simply the results of a \\"foggy memory.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"NO BERZEKER!!!","review":"You know, out of all the classic atari games, they choose not to put in one of the best.My nephew has this, and there's no Berzerker in it.

Well you'd think that Berzerker would be in there somewhere, but hell no! Not even a revised version of it. Hell I wouldn't even mind that as long as they kept it alive. I tried to explain it to my nephew on what the game was like, he just stared at me with confusion. He didn't know what the hell I was talking about.

Another advantage is that it is easy to unplug and put away when the kids (or Mom & Dad) are done with it--no big equipment or cartridges to deal with.

The old paddle games are not adapted well to joystick control. Gameplay is frustrating and choppy.Paradoxically, the FLASHBACK 2 from Atari is spectacular. The sound, detail, and control is purely authentic. It is fun to play like the original. I have no idea why one version was done with such better care than the other.

One later reviewer said their's was packaged quite well and perhaps Amazon had learned their lesson; well they hadn't. Although a full refund is promised, it'll still be a hassle to take to a shipping drop-off. It's hard to believe that a virtual business depending 100% on 3rd party shippers doesn't know how to pack merchandise, particularly a product with a history of shipping issues documented on it's own web site. I'll buy the replacement at Barnes and Noble where I can make sure the merchandise isn't damaged before I pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible shipping experience!","review":"Yes, the books are fabulous. No question about that. But the plastic case is a total nightmare. My first set arrived and the case was smashed to bits. I sent it back, with a comment that it had been packaged badly, and a request for a replacement. Though I was very pleased with the quickness with which my replacement set arrived, I was disgusted to see that it was packaged in exactly the same way, and it was smashed again in exactly the same way. So disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely terrific","review":"this set is absolutely terrific the items shown in all 3 volumes are perfectly described and the photos addded to each of them gives you perfect view of the thing described - not only the contents of each entry is very precisely formulated and does not cantain many mistakes but you can also see that the form of each entry fits to what is describedI recommend this set to everyone with no exception - it gives you much pleasure and also will learn you more about things you were using for ages but didn't know how they came into their existence and who created them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phaidon Design Classics (3 Volume Set)","review":"Hello,the Phaidon Design Classics (3 Volume Set) is state of art issue must have in any designer office/house, or those how like design.it give you an whole review with pics & explantion.i really love this product and its worth the money and even more.brgds,Eran"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phaidon Design Classics (3 Volume Set","review":"Books are great overview of classic designs, but Amazon service is horrible. The carry case is one of the worst designs ever but customers would be lucky to see it. The way Amazon ships the product, the carry case (a flimsy pastic) breaks in shipping. Amazon refuses to ship the carry case alone and states that it is not their problem but that of the manufacturer. They will offer to send a replacement set once (books and carry case), but it will come broken again as they do not ship it differently and you have to set up return shipment of the original package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky but very fun!","review":"This book does an excellent job of introducing young children to the basic facts of caterpillar and frog life cycles, how they are alike and how they are different. The anthropomorphic bent takes a little getting used to, but it's not a bad quality. Giving the animals in the story personalities makes the tale more engaging and adds another layer of interest. The story has a sense of humor that kids and adults will enjoy. The cartoon-like pictures are fun too. There's a nice subtle message to go along with it--some of us take a little more time to metamorphize than others, but we get there eventually!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a nice looking banjo guitar, but essentially unplayable","review":"This is a nicely constructed banjo guitar, however the tuners make it essentially unplayable. All of Lark in the mornings banjo's (I have owned 3) come with the same tuners, wich are set to a very low ratio. By this I mean that it takes very, very little movement to change the tuning of the string, so its very easy to overshoot your correct note. On the banjo's it was not as much of a problem, however, on the 6 string guitar banjo it makes it untunable.I give this instrument a 2 star rating instead of a 1 star rating on the assumption that replacing all 6 tuning machines would essentially make the instrument playable. However - you should never have to do this with an instrument that costs 250$+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"Just got it and it sure is interesting to weigh yourself and have it fluctuate 1.5 pounds every 30 minutes.

The scale has to 'calculate' your weight each time you step on it and you MUST stand PERFECTLY still for 30 seconds or so before it will show your weight. 3 out of 10 times it would work with most times it showing \\"ERR\\". When it did finally read my weight it was different EVERY time. Never once did I see the same weight pop up. Not only that, but it was off by about 20 pounds?!?

To begin with, it's very badly edited and extremely poorly written. The title is absolutely deceptive because he uses the term \\"serial killer\\" for every person that ever killed and got some public attention for it, even public executioners. The division of the book is very random and while some of the cases are at least presented in a coherent manner, some are very poorly researched, and some are even hard to understand because of the disjointed manner in which they're written.

Included among actual serial killers like Jack the Ripper and BTK are William the Conquerer, Saddam Hussein (a mass murderer, perhaps, but I've never heard him called a serial killer before), and Mary, Queen of Scotts. Most accounts seem pretty accurate in the historical details, although very superficial, but the motivations assigned to the killers don't mesh with modern behavioral/forensic psychology, at least in the sections I read.There are a lot of very good books out there that really delve into the question of what makes some people kill in this way and what we can do as a society, but this book isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful excuse for a book","review":"Beyond te atrocious writing, the author, first off, doesn't even define serial kilers properly. Al Capone, to use just one example, wasn't a serial killer, no matter what kind of semantics you wish to use. Second, he leaves out some of the most infamous serial killers in history. And third, the book is riddled with all sorts of historically incorrect statements. Complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just one example...","review":"I wasn't going to write a review of this book, because other reviewers have already covered all its major deficiencies.However, I could not resist giving an example of the sloppy research and nonexistent editing in this sad tome.

It arrived in perfect shape, was well packaged and was not heavy at all. It was very easy to install and fit nicely into a closet next to our bathroom. We needed to buy an extra hose from Homedepot because the provided one is not long enough. We hooked the washer up to the sink in the our bathroom. It was again very easy.

The supply hose attaches to the top surface of the machine, ruining it's sleek look. Why both hoses weren't designed to exit the rear of the machine makes one wonder.Capacity is very decent, better than the 20 year old Sanyo it is replacing in this hair salon.

It is an embarassment to animated television. I seem to be the only kid who hates this piece of junk. The animation is horrible, and the actors who do the voices aren't even talented, just plain annoying. What kind of a world do we live in where you can just make up moronic and idiotic concepts and actually have people enjoy it? The creator must have dropped out of school when he was 12 or around that age. I have never liked this show, and never will.

Since so many below have described the music so incredibly well, I will keep this simple. If you do not own this album, you are missing a unique, \\"one-of-kind-sound\\" because Captain Beyond has a kind of spacy hard rock sound that alters your conscious as you listen to it.

I based the decision on the many reviews and references I have seen on this album. \\"One of the great forgotten gems of prog rock\\" was a typical catch phrase. Uh, I don't think so. I gave this one several listens. Put it on a shelf. Pulled it out many months later. Several more listens. Back on shelf. Tried again...nothing. I gave this album more than your average amount of chances and I just didn't get it.Average early 70's rock not much more exciting than your average Uriah Heep album.

I have to admit the drumming on this disc is first rate, which makes listening to the rest of the mundane musicianship that much more annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"thumbs down","review":"This music has strings attached that bum me out. I bought this around 1970 as a vinyl. The guitar player I had heard previous to him as a member of Iron Butterfly. He was in a group in Jacksonville named The Load and then The New Second Coming. They played at the Jacksonville Beach Auditorium around the time of The Allman Brothers and The Seond Coming. They had a similar sound like CB, w/meracas used a little. They had some songs that I don't recall the names of, but there was one named \\"Medulla Oblangata\\". Because this song is not on CB or any other of CB's albums, that's why I get bummed out. Or what about the other songs TL and TNSC did? They are not on any of CB's 3 albums. There are no recordings of this song by any of Larry Rhinehardt's groups. I had to rate this album with only one star. I don't own any of CB's music anymore. They're a ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"There were so few negative reviews, that I mistakenly thought this would be a great album. It is not. It isn't heavy in the psychedelic sense, or in any way. Short, with songs that are just OK. Sounds like it would take you places like a trip album, but it doesn't. The cover looks like it, too. Kind of an overpriced fraud to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hybrid Supergroup","review":"If you ever wondered what it would be like to hear Duane Allman playing Jimi Hendrix inspired guitar riffs in a band with an incredible rhythm section with style that defies description this is the place to start.

When it originally came outon CD it was only available as an import. I paid [money] and feltlike I was the one who got the great deal. Now, as you can see, it is available for much less(I own this version as well). No matter what you have to pay for it, get it! Before it is no longer available.

They were warming up the headliners and label mates, The Allman Bros.. I loved them live and rushed out and bought the first album the next day. I had not heard this album since about '78, until I bought the CD. Wow, it still works for me. Being a musician and audiofile, I was amazed at the sound from back in '72. The drums and percussion by Mr. Caldwell, Rod's voice, killer guitar from El Rhino and solid bass from Lee Dorman. You cannot , for my $'s find a better rock album to tease the senses.

I cannot add more to what others have said. To me, this was progressive rock, taking what was and moving it into a new direction. Someone stated that they still can't figure out the guitar licks, that is ok, me either. However, the friend, Steve, who turned me onto this, 10 years later sat on his living room floor and played the whole album on his Ovation acoustic from begining to end. He was so impressed by this album, he would play it \\"unplugged\\" begining to end. What more can one say? Captain Beyond was one of my early musical influences, and set the direction forward in music for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remastered ???","review":"There is absolutely no doubt as to the significance of The Captain's contribution to the early Prog/Metal scene. It's a magical experience that only comes along a few times in one's musical lifetime. Personally, as a 17-year old kid just finding his wings it was something mystical. So, it follows that my 30+ year old 3-D cover LP was getting pretty beat. When I saw the \\"remaster\\" CD was out, I jumped at the prospect of new and improved hi-tech sound. Not!!! Be advised - don't pay the remaster price on this one unless you don't have the LP, or want to play it in the car. The high-end frequencies, especially Bobby Caldwell's percussion nuances, basically stink. I believe my LP, excepting the scratches and pops, sounds better than this stuff. I suppose some remasters are better than others. I hope this helps you Captain fans !"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can't Feel Nothin'","review":"If you think Rod Evans disappeared after he was replaced in Deep Purple by Ian Gillan or \\"Hush\\" is the only thing he's ever done, then check out this CD. Putting a label on Captain Beyond's music is an impossible goal, but if I had to, I'd call it \\"Progressive Latin Folk-Rock Tinged Jazz\\". This isn't a typical supergroup of clashing egomaniacs. Riffmeister Rhino's guitar style ventures into Duane Allman territory, along with some Jimi Hendrix riffs thrown in. Bassist Lee Dorman is unfairly maligned for being a founding member of \\"Iron Butterfly\\". Bobby Caldwell, usually known for his tasty drumming, co-wrote the entire album with Rod Evans. The tracks are catchy, short, complex pieces that segue into each other, which give the album a nice flow instead of the typical endless jamming that dates other releases from the early Seventies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic, Progressive and Powerful: A Drummers View","review":"I still remembered listening to this album with two more Rock drummers. We were totally blown away by the polyrythmic accuracy and creativity of Bobby Caldwell. Really enjoy the open and natural sound of cymbals and tom-toms. Caldwell kept control of the instrument while incorporating several typical and origunal late 1960- early 1970 chops. Highly recommended for percusionists looking for some inspiration and ideas. Tremendous historical landmark."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For Your Collection","review":"Got this cd from Amazon and all I can say is it is fantastic.To be honest I was not familiar with this band from the early 70s and came across it on the amazon site and after reading countless positive reviews took the chance and ordered thank goodness I did and thanks to all the positive reviewers here you are right this album is brilliant.The remaster sound is good and the guitarist Rhino can sure play.I must have played this cd about 10 times already and I love it.This band sound a million times better than some of the tosh thats out there today and this album was done in 1972.All in all this cd is a must for your rock collection,take the chance and buy it you will have invested in a great piece of rock history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like, wow man!","review":"Awesome! Words can't explain how thrilled I was to rediscover this gem. I owned the LP back in 1974 (since lost). It has been over 35 years since I heard the album again with this CD. This is among the best of early 70's rock. Sonically, the CD is of decent quality played through a high quality audio sound system cranked through with a lot of wattage. It was meant to be played loud! Wishfull thinking, but too bad this isn't released in a Hybrid SACD format..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underrated album in history","review":"Every rock fan agrees that there are bands that deserve a lot more attention than they have. The guys from Captain Beyond are the perfect example.After being kicked out of Deep Purple, Rod Evans decided to form another rock group and with former Iron Butterfly members, Captain Beyond was born. The California-based band soon became a cult hit and remains so until nowadays.A mixture of hard rock, stoner rock and a bit of prog rock, this album is simply phenomenal. A perfect and brilliant sample of what underground rock bands are. One of the albums I would recommend to everyone. Captain is now, unfortunately, a defunct band, but whose sound will enchant me forever. This stuff is required for every classic rock fan.

But, I've decided to hold in my upchuck to write this review. First off, I kinda like the movie. I think it starts off strong, but somewhere in the middle (that Office stuff), well it just gets muddy to me. Narratively speaking.I went to film school, which means I'm allowed to say \\"Narratively speaking.\\" I also can say things like \\"Mise en scène\\". No biggie.Regardless, the reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of negative 4 stars is because of the packaging. That's right. Yen Tan's amazing artwork is so good that it outweighs how overrated I think the film is. It also doesn't hurt that the extra features are pretty good. Namely TUB 2: The Fan Film by 14 year old filmmaker Joe Shelleh and that weird Turkey horror/comedy film that I starred in, but didn't write (thank God!)In conclusion, I think you should buy 2 million copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"petal fell off while riding and almost had accident on busy street.

There is one tool required that many will not have and that is a metric allen wrench. fortunately I had one (supplied with a previous bike I purchased). This item should be supplied with the bike since it is not a very common one and would require most buyers to stop assembly and run to a store to purchase one.The assembly is simply a matter of installing the front wheel, handlebars, seat and pedals, then connecting the brake cable and adjusting the brakes. Sounds much more complicated than it is.FINAL NOTE: WHEN ASSEMBLING MAKE SURE THE FRONT WHEEL FORK IS ORIENTED SUCH THAT THE FRONT BRAKES ARE IN FRONT OF THE FORK AND NOT BETWEEN THE FORK AND FRAME OTHERWISE THE PEDALS WILL INTERFERE WITH THE TURNING OF THE HANDLEBARS/FRONT WHEEL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Very nice bike.

Good bike!","review":"Bought this bike for my 18 year old son who doesn't have much interest in driving just yet. He is really enjoying it. It was easy to put together and rides very nicely. The only complaint we have with this bike is the connection where the handlebars attach. It comes loose pretty frequently. My son carries the allen wrench around with him just in case when he's riding - and he's needed it a LOT to re-tighten the connection. Other than that, we have no complaints at all on this bike.

Keller is an excellent writer and a thought provoking thinker. Her analysis is thorough but easily accessible by anyone with a high school knowledge of the biological sciences. It's not ground breaking philosophy of science but it's a refreshing change from the kind of superficial analysis of this trendy issue provided by the mass media. An excellent weekend read for the thirsty mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written look into the history of the gene","review":"Keller has a different writing style then most \\"factual\\" books. Her attempts at literal hooks (ie. introduce ideas that explained later in the chapter) are more frustrating then informative. If the ideas are so imperitive to understand, she should explain them immediately after she introduces them. This is more of a historical look into the gene than a factual. If you want to learn how the gene works and its role in DNA computing - this is not the book to buy. Even more annoying is her constant \\"insight\\" into how surprised researchers of DNA were to learn that genes are complex. Of course they are complex. I wish she would have mentioned it once and continue writing useful information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow characters","review":"This book made me angry at myself for taking the time to finish it. The characters were all one dimensional, shallow and uninteresting. The ending was completely out of character. What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating ending - pretty dumb detectives","review":"So, it takes a special investigator from across the country to think about ordering lip prints and DNA for the beer cans found in the back of the car? And what about those multiple chapters of the boring in-house fighting over jurisdiction over labs? Painful. And no cop ever asked about a second set of keys for his car? His wife had to come up with that? Pretty lame. And the ending was maddening -- who was the killer? You still don't know whether he is saying he did it or he is saying that circumstances forced her to do it. Gosh, anyone can get a book published I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunately disappointing","review":"the beginning was really riveting and I settled down to be absorbed by a great read.

This book kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The suspense just builds and builds and you keep thinking things are wrapping up too neatly and something awful is going to happen. I could not even guess as to what it could be but when I finally found out I was disappointed. The ending just does not seem to go with the rest of the story. It is very off and not believable and I felt cheated. Otherwise I enjoyed the book immensely. I found some parts to be a bit dull about the DNA and the repetition of Ms. Harding's deeds but all in all a commendable first novel. I look forward to reading \\"THE HUNTED\\" and hope the ending is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The more I read, the more disappointed I was","review":"This is a so-so book with a poorly developed plot and disappointing characters. I had absolutely no one to root for. Madison was a wimp who let everyone do for him. Chandler, at the end, pulled the sheets over his head and went on with his dreary life. And how could the author drag us along through a boring trial and reward us with such a contrived ending? As a fellow writer, and an avid reader of the mystery-thriller genre, I believe the creative talent exists, but the author could do a lot better. Keep trying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great read but horrible ending--makes no sense","review":"I was really into this book.

It took about 20 minutes for me to \\"get into\\" the book, but after that point, I was interested in the outcome. The book is not action packed, nor full of thrills and chills. Instead, it tells a story of how devious some people can be. Towards the end, I figured out who the \\"bad\\" character was, but I still listened on to hear my suspicions confirmed. All in all, not a bad read but not the best I've heard. I would however, give the author another chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and predictable. Boring.","review":"A piece from this writer and a piece from another and it all adds up to boring writing. Sloppily plotted with events happening without cause or justification. Bland. The author's idea of a twist is to change the obvious ending on literally the last page!

But we should not be too harsh on him since we all know very well that Dohnanyi conducting Cleveland is second to none when he does his job.

However, this is nothing more than an expensive dust cover. I was a little concerned when it arrived because it was so lightweight-it consists of one layer with no soft protection for the car. Most importantly, the very first rain found my car soaked under the cover. If you are considering this cover for your car, my advice would be to save $100 and just go to a car parts store and by a $30-40 cover. I'm very disappointed with this car cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells Toxic","review":"When we opened the package the pad had a toxic-like odor.

It was a baby gift from me to friends' kids who were having a baby, in Brooklyn, NY. When it was shipped, I asked for a gift card to be shipped with it, by Amazon. The card was NOT shipped with the product, and the recipients had no idea who it came from. I finally asked my friends to ask the kids if they had received a changing pad and let them know that I had sent it. They did ask, and the parents were very glad to know who to thank for the gift.

I used it by the sink and the filling started to grow fungus.I guess the lack of durability is due to its soft but very thin outer material. It also stain like what a previous user said.

It is nice and long and the sides do make it difficult, not impossible, for a baby to roll. But the plastic cover cracked and split before I'd had it very long. Even with the towel cover, there is still a possibility that pee can get through and soaked up in the sponge underneath, making it smell of urine."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Short Life-Span","review":"I was surprised at the many favorable reviews of this product. As I was reading I realized that many of the other people noticed the same problems I had but didn't find them as troublesome as I did.The comfort of the pad is great. However, it does stain quite easily. It is easy to clean, but the stain remains. The main problem I had was that the material rips very easily. The pad ripped before my son turned 1. I would prefer a better made product that would make it through my son's infancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product that went through 2 babies","review":"This actually went through 2 babies. I loved it!!!! Instead of wasting money on a flimsy changing table that would only be in use for a year or so, we opted to get a nice dresser (that the children will use for many years) and put a small wooden box next to it to hold changing supplies.This is so nice in so many ways. The sides are curved up making it harder for the baby to roll out. It is also quite large both in length and width. It is soooo easy to clean. Just a whipe with a baby whipe and a quick spray of lysol.The underneath part did start to wear off so I put one of those rubber shelf liners (you can get a roll for a $1 at wal-mart) underneath it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good changing pad, but can stain.","review":"Comfortable pad with nonslip bottom.

There are some downsides: the underside is slippery, so there is some tendency for it to slip off the table. They provide straps for preventing this, but I haven't found a practical way to use these straps to secure the pad to the table without making it a real pain to change the cover. And I think it's silly to have a \\"safety belt\\" to hold the infant down - you just need to keep a hand on the baby at all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"We love this pad! It's easy to clean and the sticky bottom keeps it from sliding if you are using it on a dresser. The raised sides make it safer than a flat pad, too. The thick, firm pad is also great to use as a travel bed, especially when the baby is really small. Our baby loved to fall asleep near us so we would put him on this pad between us on the bed (although you need a big bed for this), or put him on the floor wherever we were in the house. We also took it to friends' houses and our baby was always comfortable sleeping there during the visit. Keep in mind it's quite high so it raises your changing table surface a few inches.

It works well, it travels well, and it fits all the standard changing pad covers. It's soft but not squishy, so baby doesn't sink into it, and it has raised edges so it's harder for her to roll around/off. Its cover is made of a material that is easy to sanitize and wipe off should there be any \\"accidents\\" while the diaper is off. The clips are sturdy and safe and easy to unclip when you need to. Overall, it's just a good, basic changing pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"I bought this product before my first daughter was born 3 years ago and used it everyday several times a day until she was 2.5. I never used the covers because it was so much easier to keep clean without them. Wipe down with baby wipes as needed and then spray with Lysol once a week to kill any germs. After 2.5 years, it had started cracking a little on the sides. So, I bought a new one for my new baby girl who's 6 months old now. It is working great for her as well. It is nice and cushy with high enough sides to keep her somewhat contained. I also just purchased one for use in our church nursery as well. This is a must have for anyone changing diapers. Great value, easy to clean and sanitize, and lasts for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changing pad","review":"There are no real surprises here, although I bought this thinking it was the same size as another I had and it was a bit bigger, making it more difficult to use as planned.

I thought that was an interesting feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"rips up almost immediately","review":"I'm not remarkably picky about these things and we were happy to get this changing pad at such a great price with lots of colored liners to choose from. However, it rips up almost immediately. This may not seem like a big deal - it won't bother the baby if you have a liner on it. Then you realize every time the baby wets the mattress it is soaking into the foam core where you cannot clean it! Next thing you know you have a forever pee-soaked foam thing sitting on the dresser.

The Bluesbreakers lived up to their name, sounding like a band on its first night out. I would have been embarrassed to be onstage with them, even though they are great musicians in their own right. The worst part was watching John Mayall squirm around like he was setting the place on fire, when in actuality, he was playing some modest licks at best. In whole, the band couldn't start or stop together, and their job of backing up some of the Blues legends was terrible.

I certainly put this above Durafle, and close to, if not on a par with, Faure. Although I respect the respective requia of Brahms and Verdi, both are too scholastic for me, and both strike me as overly long, in consequence. To assist you in understanding my personal tastes, I reject artists that lack melodic tongues.

It looks very possible for the cheap tube and plastic connectors to develop a leak. The manufacturer should have provided a hose that was the overall quality of the washer. So, you'll be very surprised at how tiny this guy is, but it sure does the job. Clothes come out fresh and clean, just like out of the big washers. And the spin takes most of the water out so the drying doesn't take all that long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable experience","review":"The machine began leaking not long after bringing it home. Be warned: the policy of Haier is to completely replace the machine, even for such a minor malfunction. And to add insult to injury, you have to send it in yourself (keep the box, for godssakes) and pay the shipping and handling. And for you Brooklynites, avoid Super Sound Electronics and Appliances on Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint at all costs. Not only wouldn't they service the machine, they refused to replace it. Evidently, the idea of a warranty is a new one to these shysters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great washer","review":"It is so convenient for my family to use this portable washer every week.

Can be easily picked up and moved or use with optional castors for easier portability. Cleans clothes very well. Handles King-sized sheets, blankets, or a week's worth of laundry for a single working person. I'm very pleased with my machine. It gets hard use and is unproblematic. One recommendation.

What a wonderful teacher Mrs. Tilson must have been---and probably still is. What patience and what love for kids she has...!!!These vignettes must be read by all teachers..and shared by all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wise and Wonderful!","review":"This is a delightful, sensitive, timeless book that should be required reading for every teacher, parent and caregiver of young children. In fact, anyone who loves young kids should love this book. Ms. Tilson takes us not only into her kindergarten classroom, but into the homes and neighborhoods of a dozen or so young children in a Puerto Rican barrio in Manhattan. Whether heartwarming, humorous or sad, each child's story is special and gracefully told. While many of the children will remain in my memory, what I treasure most is the author's humanistic view and the following words, which she felt like screaming at many a parent: \\"A baby, a child, is a person, not a possession or an appendage or an extension of you. . . . Childhood is NOT a temporary holding pattern on the way to start life as an adult! Childhood IS living, right now! At every stage a child is a whole person living his life.\\" Ah, if we would all keep that in mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really a childs toy?","review":"I bought this for my Granddaughters, both are Olivia fans, as am I. It seemed like a great toy to spur their imaginations. My oldest Granddaughter asked me to read the playbill that accompanies the sets and costumed Olivia figures so she could act out the stories. Swan Lake was first. Of course the story ends with the Lake engulfing both Prince Siegfried and Odette. Next was Romeo and Juliet which ends when the hero and heroine kill themselves. Last is Turandot who also kills himself. Really? This is not exactly lighthearted play and a child that is of an age to love Olivia might find it difficult to understand and act out these stories. Couldn't they have chosen more childish plays? The girls still play with the sets and figures but we're not reading the playbill ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"It is a little wierd.

Rather than inserting themselves as authorities who tell people with HIV what to do, the authors let people who are wrestling with all the complexities of HIV disclosure--with casual partners, with long-term partners, even with parents and friends--speak for themselves . The result is a portrait that won't satisfy those who want to mandate how it is people with HIV who live their lives, but also doesn't pander to people who want to whitewash away the uncomfortable truths about how people infect one other. Many of the voices here capture the complexity that gets lost in sound bites about HIV. This is just how it should be with a book about an issue that is simultaneously so everyday and so freighted with consequence for many of us. Get it. Read it. It will make you feel human, and appreciate the humanity of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"This spongebob balloon was a really good purchase, i loved how big it was.

It's almost as though the author himself HAS NEVER APPLIED FOR A FELLOWSHIP!Second, the book seems very hastily written. I don't think the author took more than two weeks to write the entire book if you asked me. He probably wrote it during his winter break from college.Finally, I take extreme offense at Mr. Mohamadi's leaving the Jacob K.

It's a great value. It easily holds our two bikes and when properly installed on the car shifts very little (some shift is due to the give of the foam interfaces). I have driven with it on the interstate up to 75 miles per hour. It is important to note that the rack will shift more if the bottom strap (leading to under the bumper or under the hatch) is not pulled tight enough to distend the elastic section.I recommend being careful when installing the rack as the hooks are metal and may damage the finish of the car. However, I have had no damage to mine as of yet by taking care not to allow the hooks to bang or drag across my car. If you are worried about it anyway, you might add a little rubber or foam padding to the hooks.All in all, this is a great basic bike rack.

I went through 3 of these because I wasn't able to get my money back and could only exchange. The motor broke twice and one time it suctioned in and never released. Instead of exchanging it for a fourth time, I just threw the whole thing out. The part that attaches to the motor/handle and the piece that allows milk through are impossible to clean. Eventually, on all 3 that I went through, the milk builds up in the piece that attaches to the bottle (only takes a few pumps to fill this up) and you have to break suction for it to filter through. It continues to do this for as long as you're pumping. If you don't realize that the milk hasn't gone through, the built up milk gets into the motor/handle and leaks out through the suction power control. The massage bubbles on the cup are uncomfortable and only irritate your breasts. The suction dies down almost immediately making pumping take so much longer. This pump is such a waste of money.

The \\"soft, flexible sheild\\" fits over the rigid plastic tube that feeds your milk into the bottle. The hard plastic tube creates a sharp ridge inside the area where the nipple is pulled, thus the pain! I tried using it off and on for three weeks, thinking that I should just be tough and get used to it, however, the last time I used it, the hard plastic tore me just a little - enough to make me get rid of it!

I recommend the Avent Isis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Pump","review":"This is the second First Years pump I bought. I will never buy anything from this company again. The first pump lost suction and I am still waiting on replacement parts for that one, thankfully we bought the warranty from Babies r Us so that is being sent in as soon as the 90 days are up. I bought this pump since the price was right and knew I wouldnt be using it long. It can be painful, it does not mimic the sucking of a baby nursing, it is more like the machine they use to milk cows. Plus since you dont have a steady suction you lose your milk supply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This pump was given to me as a gift. I had been using a hospital grade pump for a while because my baby was a preemie. She has since helped me to establish a good supply and I would use the hospital grade pump after each feeding & would get a good amount of milk in no time. This pump doesn't compare. I will be purchasing another pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"I purchased this pump after the one I originally had stopped working. I am very disappointed with it. I have a good milk supply established and have been pumping since my baby was born but I was unable to get any milk at all with this pump. I had been using a manual pump before I bought this one and got better results with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pump for the money","review":"I purchased this pump b/4 I gave birth & started using it within the first 2 weeks. I have had absolutely no problems with it. I have actually thought about buying another one, just so I could double pump & not have to pay the high price for a double pump. The First Years stands behind their products & when I called to see if I could purchase parts (to have as backup), they were sent to me free of charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want pain this is the pump for you!","review":"I was using the medela pump in the hospital and once I got out I had to get my own, I thought I would save a little money and buy this one. BAD IDEA!! This pump is so painful my nipples were cracked. You are safer manually pumping.The way it suctions to the nipple is very painful. I suggest the medela it may mean a little more out of your pocket, but in the long run you will be alot more satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!!!!","review":"I had originally purchased the Evenflo pump and was disappointed because it kept breaking and then the motor started to go after only 2 1/2 months, so I brought it back and decided to try this pump instead. I put it all together and my first reaction was OUCH !!! The automatic suction/release is a great idea but this also has small bumps in the shield that hurt when using it. I also kept losing suction with the shield being so flexible it kept bending at the neck. Needless to say, it took me 3 days to pump one 4oz. bottle, so I will be returning this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I thought this would be good for occasional pumping. However, it leaves my nipples really sore. I can only stand to use it every few days. I then tried the Medela brand, oh my, it's so much better. Spend your $40 much more wisely!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I don't plan on returning to work, so I wanted a pump to use only occasionally. After using this pump for less than 2 weeks, it completely lost ALL suction. And it didn't work very well even before that. It could take 10 minutes to get 1-2 ounces. Thank goodness Babies R Us allowed me to exchange it. There was no way I wanted to exchange it for the same product. I was able to get an Avent Isis & I LOVE it! I initially assumed electric would be better, but the Isis hand-pump works SO much better! Don't waste your money on the Natural Comfort pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst on the market!!!","review":"After the first time I used the pump the adapter stopped working. I called First Years and they asked me to send it back on my dime. I asked them what to do mean while. They suggested using batteries. I tried that for a couple pumps but the batteries had to be changed after every pump. This was the biggest waste of money. Purchasing this has taught me one great lesson. Do you reseach before purchasing something of this great importance. I have since thrown the peace of trash in the trash. I never sent the adapter back to First Years. To do so would cost me another $10 after using my Fedex employee discount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda noisy, but easy to use","review":"I gave this pump 4 stars, because it is noisy. I was afraid to use it in the same room as my daughter when she was taking a nap. However, the one thing that I really liked about it, was that you decide how much pressure it gives. So when your nipples are really sore, you can start out light, and add pressure as you feel comfortable. It was easy to use, and easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"easy to use but did not last long","review":"I used this pump once a day or less and it stopped working after about 6 weeks. While it was working it worked well and I liked being able to have one hand free while pumping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it negative stars?","review":"This pump is a worthless piece of junk. I received it as a gift and it broke after a few uses. (Even when it did work it was woefully slow, and single pump action is just a waste of time - go with the double!) The customer service people were helpful, and I sent it back. They sent me another pump which broke again after several uses. The problem was with the suction mechanism - it kept failing. The second time it broke they were less helpful and tried to tell me it was my fault the interior mechanism was failing. Did I know I was only supposed to boil the plastic parts? Please, how insulting.I finally broke down and bought the Pump in Style, which, $300 price tag be damned, was SO worth it. I know it seems expensive, but really, the money couldn't be better spent. If you plan to do any more than occasional (once per week) pumping, buy the Medela. I got mine on e-bay for $100 including shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"I bought this pump because I became painfully engorged when I got home from the hospital. Well, that was the only time it really worked! I had to turn it way up to get proper suction, and even then it takes at least 20 minutes to get 2 ounces. The breast shield, with its massage bumps, is painful. And the valve doesn't always release to let the milk collect. I had to break suction every other minute just to keep it from flooding. And the noise! It sounds like mooing. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!!!","review":"This pump sucks!!! Well actually it doesn't. It takes me 1/2 hour just to get 2oz. You get what you pay for, don't waste your money. A good hospital grade pump is still way less then you would pay for formula!"},{"rating":"1","title":"!!!!!!! Money Better Spent On Another Product !!!!!","review":"Well I bought the First Years battery/corded powered brest pump for my girlfriend after reading the reviews on this web site. We have a manual powered pump, yet I decided to buy a powered one, because her arms often get tired after a short period of time pumping. I bought this product because of the price, and the one our two good reviews I read on this site. This pump was a waste of money. It hurts her while pumping, it's loud, the disc is made of a soft material as opposed to a hard material. This makes it hard to apply and stay put - it bends a lot... you get what you pay for - you want a cheap product - you'll get cheap quality.

THE AUTOMATIC SUCTION RELEASE IS SO CONVENIENT. THE SHEILD IS PLIABLE AND FLEXIBLE MAKING A GOOD SEAL. I THINK THIS IS AN IDEAL PUMP FOR SMALLER BREASTED WOMEN BECAUSE OF THE PLIABLE SHIELD.

First track I heard was the Rondo, as it is my favourite part of the concerto. The sound however was very hazy and a strange kind of echo is heard, especially in parts where Schiff is making too much use of the pedal, which devastates the joyful, swift and mainly punctual performance this piece of music asks for. Off to the adagio then, which is beautifully played, but again lacks the clearness I'm looking for. I won't recommend this set for anyone new to Brahms; instead I'd try the GILELS/JOCHUM set from DG. This one provides crystal clear piano playing and a wonderful sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Towering performance","review":"Incredibly fine performance. Note a sour note in the whole concerto.Solti and Schiff make a formidable pair. Of the many versions of Brahms Piano Concerto #1 I\`ve listened to, their Adagio is above all the rest.

There are some slightly fancy moves that change regularly but it is difficult to follow when I can barely heard the instructors cues. I understand that some people like the music but I'm doing aerobics for the exercise not for the music.I also think that a beginners workout should have a little more explaination of the moves.All in all, it's probably a good workout but I spent most of the time trying to figure out what was going on and trying to catch up because I couldn't hear her saying what was coming next. Plus she doesn't give much forewarning that a change is coming, but I think that after doing the workout a few times most people will be able to figure it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This little dragon spits a lot of air and roars in the same way!","review":"Not much to say really ...

Christof does everything to stop him and keep him in the town where the Truman Show takes place- Seehaven. The message of the Truman Show is that our society is losing control more and more and that we let ourselves be influenced by the media and TV.

Probably the same slumming intellectuals who thought \\"The Brothers McMullen\\" was on par with Woody Allen. Ed Harris is an incredible actor, but he essentially got an oscar nomination for wearing a hat. What we have here is Jim Carrey acting like himself, but not funny. That would be o.k, if there was any drama, but there isn't any. Where's the tension? For such a great premise, there's no pay-off.

There were no flowers and looked nothing like the picture. Like several other reviews, the plant was dead within the month, although I followed the instructions. When watering the plant, because the DIRT was so hard, the water just ran right off, rather than soaking in. Finally, I kept it sitting in a pan of water in addition to the regular watering. Unfortunately, by then it was too late. Instead of the package being addressed to me, it was addressed with my daughter's name and my address. I do not recommend buying this plant."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap is cheap","review":"The plant looks like it was shaved. It does not look like the picture at all. No quality.

This is completely misleading! It is also listed in \\"indoor plants\\" and the promotional pictures show it both nestling in a cozy living room, sitting on a porch and planted. HOWEVER, when it arrives, it lacks (1) the pottery container (arriving in a cheap disposable nursery grow pack, (2) contains instructions telling the recipient to plant it outdoors no matter what the season.We are asking amazon to explain and/or deliver instructions on using this as a houseplant and delivering the pottery container pictured.

Don't bother with it unless you just want to see it so you can tell people you have seen it. It is an unimaginitive, un-nuanced rendering of Momaday's Pullitzer Prize winning novel. As the other reviewers note, the flute music will drive you up the wall, the motivations of the characters are lost, and the plot is downright crusty. If you're looking for good Indian cinema, see Smoke Signals, Medicine River, Grand Avenue, and maybe Powwow Highway (if you haven't already seen it 3 dozen times). Dance Me Outside is also pretty good, and for the kiddies, try Mary Kate and Ashley Olson's \\"How the West Was Fun.\\" No kidding, you might like the Indian guy in there."},{"rating":"1","title":"House Made of Boredawm","review":"Worst movie ever. Seriously. The acting is horrible, the music is annoying, the plot is weak. The only thing decent about this video is a cool preview for \\"The Crippled Masters\\".

Here you will find sections from Robert Hunt's, Popular Romances of the West Country (Cornwall). As this is no longer in print and you will probably pay a high price for an original copy of that title, English Fairy and Folk Tales is worth getting for this alone. The book's tales are the usual stories of England and Cornwall, though, nothing obscure or especially unusual and the chapter on witchcraft was disappointingly short. Mostly concerned with the usual tales of ghosts, some good stories of the phantom hounds (i.e. Cheney's Hounds, Dando Dogs, The Barghest), witchcraft, and Fairies. So if you are looking for obscure tales you will probably want to skip it! Once again, it is worth purchasing if you are looking for a cheaper copy of some of the tales from Hunt's, Popular Romances of the West Country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why in the world ...","review":"Why in the world does someone sign up on a site and write one review of an album they have never heard by an artist they are woefully ignorant about?This isnt really my kind of music ...

This video shows the NFL stars laying down their tracks for the cd version of NFL Hits Country in the studio. In their defense, I have a hard time imagining country singers out on the field on Sunday. However, these players prove otherwise. My favorite cut is Jo Dee Messina and Brad Johnson singing \\"I'm a Survivor\\" (which Jo Dee co-wrote). Brad has a great baritone going for him. \\"I Just Can't Live With Myself\\" (Mark Willis/Rick Tuten), \\"Brinks Truck\\" (Randy Travis/Michael Strahan), and \\"Whatever It Takes\\" (Kenny Chesney/Peyton Manning) are also surprisingly good performances by the NFL stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really better than I expected","review":"I bought this soundtrack so I could learn all the songs from the book (I'm a performer/purist about reading to my kids). The music and production quality was far above what I expected. It's worth the price just for the fiddled \\"Irish Washer Woman\\". And the \\"Old Dan Tucker\\" was the best I've ever heard. Even better than the Bruce Springsteen version."},{"rating":"2","title":"So clear it will blow out your speakers---and windows....","review":"This is an excellent recording of the \\"1812\\". Kunzel inspires a surprisingly sparkling performance. The playing is strong and faithful and an excellent early example of digital clarity--a great recording to use if you're testing a new system or speakers. But WARNING! Read the liner warnings about not playing it too loud--the guns at the end were recorded digitally at a military war college using real ordnance and this recording, especially through an audiophile system, is capable of rattling glass, sterilizing cockroaches, and driving away annoying neighbors. At higher volumes (say around 6 or 7), it can do permanent damage to speakers and your inner ears. Take it up to a Spinal Tap \\"11\\" and--well, let's just say that if Bush had done this, we wouldn't have Saddam Hussein to kick around anymore. A MUST ADD to your collection of incredibly recorded classical music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Awesome","review":"This is simply the best rendition of 1812 Overture avaliable. Not only is it an all digital recording (DDD) but it is also true to the original score, complete with church bells (real ones) and authentic cannon shots. There is a note on the CD insert about the recording of those cannon shots that states that while recording the shots, the larger ones \\"managed to remove the windows of the English building [on the university grounds where the recording was being performed] some several hundred yards away\\". Try reproducing that on your system. It sounds really awesome although I have not removed any windows by playing this CD. Additionally, the all digital recording means there is zero background noise (not even master tape hiss) and the full dynamic range is reproduced with stunning clarity. Buy this CD. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaboom.","review":"Telarc's now classic \\"demo\\" disc still holds up, 30+ years after its original release.Erich Kunzel delivers a solid '1812', complete with \\"digital cannons\\", guaranteed to test the limits of even the finest speakers and components.The couplings (Capriccio Italien, Cossack Dance) are pleasant but in reality are afterthoughts. This disc is all about the 1812, and it proves that the Telarc label is sorely missed in today's world of compressed MP3 sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical","review":"I have three recordings of the Ninth from Cleveland, Szell's, Maazel's, and the current one. All of them are rewarding, although Dohnanyi's might be marginally the weakest of the three. The main focus of his interpretation is lyricism. This is not a dramatic or earthshaking Ninth. Rather, it is highly consoling, almost an epicurean Ninth. The sound of the orchestra is breathtakingly beautiful. General opinion is that Szell was the greatest conductor of the Cleveland, but I feel that the orchestra played even more beautifully for Dohnanyi. The vocal soloists are good and the chorus performs with fine ensemble. There is nothing idiosyncratic about this reading. Part of the undramatic effect may be due to the sound engineering. It is well balanced but rather distant, heightening the blend and euphoniousness of the orchestra. I am sure I will return to this Ninth with pleasure, but I suspect Gunter Wand will be in circulation on my CD player to offer a more heaven storming reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly Good","review":"Skrapz and F.R.EEZE are underrated MCs.I recommend you give them a listen, and with such a reasonable price why would you not?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sounds","review":"We play this in thr office when things get especially hectic.

At the time, sound engineers altered the underflooring, which led to problems for years to come that have since been corrected. But Liza still holds the record for an artist at that venue (3 weeks of sold out shows). That summer she toured many cities with the show, and came to Massachusetts to sing for 11,000 at an open-air show. She was great. Saw her last summer at a tent show with 2500 fans; she was healthy and fit, charming and funny, and she sang beautifully. Tabloids be damned, long may she reign.

This book is a painstakingly detailed account of the author's own poseur nature. Everything he does is motivated by a desire to impress others and be seen as a \\"heavy bro\\" (I guess this means a \\"cool guy\\" or something) by his equally poseur friends. This is a book for people who spend more time polishing their bikes than riding them, whose idea of a good time is standing around drinking and ogling the billet jewelry on each others' bikes. Although amusing in spots, it very artfully misses the whole point of riding."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy missed the whole point of riding.","review":"How can a man spend so much money on a bike and ride so many miles and totally miss the point of what biking is about?

Well I just received the set yesterday and I was thrilled to find that it's not velvet at all!

Shaw is at top form here, with a remarkably incisive dramatic reading, and the soloists are top-notch as well. There's no better recording of this best-in-the-world chorus, and Shaw even manages to get some vivid playing out of the pre-Levi ASO. No other recording captures the terror, warmth, or effusive \\"humanity\\" of this work at such a sustained and convincing a level. Shaw's work with Toscanini is clearly evident here, and the unrivaled sound of the Atlanta chorus is unbelievably rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious","review":"Many other good reviews here. All I can add is this set is worth owning as much for the added opera choruses as it is the absolutely perfect performance of the Verdi Requiem. I have listened to Va, Pensiero frequently since purchasing this set, and it gives me goosebumps every single time. The engineering is in top form. You get great acoustics, but still can hear wonderful details in the performances. And of course, Shaw at the top of his game. The orchestra and chorus never sounded better. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verdi Requiem Robert Shaw","review":"This is an excellent recording and fairly easy to follow.

The only thing that keeps this from the fifth star is that the lid is slightly more difficult to place on the pot then some models, but seals easily and I had no problem with it while cooking. The weights are of a non-rocking veriety, so the steam engine effect, which some find disturbing, is not a problem with this cooker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with pressure safety valve","review":"Nice heavy stainless cooker.

I think it's about time he realizes it.The human team G-Force who always follow Godzilla are an able and determined bunch who try their hardest to understand the Big G's reasons for existing.

Katrine makes a wonderful change from a passive wife to a woman with a mind of her own due to the fact that she is pushed into something she doesn't want to do, but finding she likes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Jennifer Blake","review":"Katrine is married to an older man Giles who can not perform his marriage duties and get an heir upon his wife. So he arranges a tournament in which, unbeknownst to the all, the winner will be the man to produce an heir with Katrine. Enter Rowan. Handsome and skilled, destined to be the winner. But he is here for other reasons. The year before his brother was found dead. He believes that Katrine knows why. In the midst of Rowan trying to find out the mystery of his brother's death, Giles tries frantically to push Katrine and Rowan together so he can have his long awaited heir. This story is a marvelous whodunit with enough romance, suspense, and sexual tension to keep any reader hooked. I liked Rowan right off, but Katrine seemed too cool at first, until I realized that she wasn't being difficult. She was merely trying to protect a friend. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrow to the Heart","review":"Wish I had not purchased this book.

Michael Katz outlines his experience with the Gemstone Guardians, a group of spiritual beings responsible for the preservation of the gemstones on our planet. During these spiritual discourses Michael is made aware of the healing properties of gemstones for us as individuals and our planet.One of the most splendid aspects of the book is the enlightening spiritual discourse that accompanies the explanation of each gemstone. This alone makes the book a worthwhile purchase.In my opinion this is an extraordinary book with much to share about the healing properties of therapeutic gems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and eye opening","review":"How can I put this in words?

The late effects of chemotherapy and radiation last for years past treatment for the disease. My 20 year old son is a survivor of leukemia; I got a copy for him and a copy for me. All the information he will need for follow-up medical care is easily accessible in this well-organized book. As a parent, I like the book for the medical and psychological information it contains as well as for the personal stories interwoven throughout the book. Childhood cancer survivors are in a special medical situation in that when they were diagnosed, decisions about their medical were mediated by their parents, while after treatment, the young adult survivor must make his or her own health care choices. This book does a good job of addressing this transition."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALMOST perfect","review":"This book is ALMOST perfect.

The book does have a few good recipies, but is very limited in scope. Of the over 1400 edibile insects, this book covers only a very, very few. Not only were very few insects mentioned, the book offers NO keys to indentify the insects and certianly very little advice on the gathering of them. The book does list a few places were insects can be bought, but that, in my opinion goes against what if feel is the better idea of collecting your own. If you collect your own, you help control the damage done by insects and reduce the need for chemical control. We have plenty of insects, I don't feel that we need to raise more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilton Aluminum Performance Pan 10\\" round","review":"Nice appearance - cooks evenly - the only problem was the sticker that was on the pan.

Now i find myself wondering if i will ever read anything else by him ever again. This book simply was not good. It sounded amateurish. The whole thing was rather trite. It was as if someone took a bad romance novelist and gave him a subject and a list of required gore and horror and sat him in front of a computer. And the dialogue, ohh god the dialogue! Bad dialogue will kill a book faster than anything else. I gave it two stars only because i like books that are not afraid to be frank about sex and gore.

I also couldn't get rid of the Directors commentary with the first section. I finally got rid of it by the second, and I don't have this problem with other DVD's I own. (on the other one's I own, you have to chose that option, it doesn't automatically come on, though there may be a flaw in my copy) As for the plot, it was basically rehashed ideas from hundreds of other B movies, except this one was more vague.

The scene was like a music video with a bunch of rapid cuts and closeups. I don't know if it's me, but i like a lot of wide shots with very little cuts.

I am a kid"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy, with help from his friends, reinvents himself...","review":"I have read the critiques of \\"License to Chill\\" that have berated Jimmy for \\"changing\\", \\"not being Jimmy\\", \\"wanting to make money\\", and blah, blah, blah...Jimmy Buffett, with this last album reinvented himself.His (and other's) remakes of Hey Good Lookin', and Sea of Love are great. They are lively, sound good, with good harmony going on.Some of the originals, License to Chill, Coast of Carolina, Trip Around the Sun, and Coastal Confessions have something to say. A previous reviewer gave accolades to Coast of Carolina. It's a beautiful song, as well as Trip Around the Sun.The Country/Rock/Caribbean blend sounds great.Bottom line, I listened to this album three times driving from Las Vegas to eastern Idaho. It's good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy's The BEST!!!!","review":"I got this for my dad's birthday not to long ago. He loved this CD. Jimmy Buffet has never done a country CD, so it was nice to see him do something different like this. I also have to say that all of the country singers that he sang with did a great job. I forgot to mention that I loved this CD and so did my brother. If your not really into country, you may not want this CD. Although, this is different country music, it has a lot of spice to it. It was defanitly worth the money for me!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Jimmy with a Twist","review":"First things first, if you are a true Parrot Head, go out and buy this album right now. Second, if you are a true country fan, go out and buy this album right now.It is a terrific mix of some country but mostly slow classic Jimmy melodies. For those of you who are worried that Jimmy lost his true island roots and went country, he did not. This album is 20% country - at most.This is truly a great Buffett album but slower than most others. The love songs are terrific, but the fast island beats are few.A must have for all Jimmy fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't enjoyed a Buffett album so much in a long time!","review":"Diehard parrothead finds joy in new album! Used to buy every CD by Buffett, but after a few disappointments, I started borrowing from the library, then deciding if I want them. But, hearing several songs at Blossom on July 1, I immediately went to the computer and ordered a copy. Enjoying it immensely. Duets are fun; the stand-alone recordings good too. It's like back to Nashville and the beach! Can't help but wonder if it was a *business* decision to record with all those big country stars--to open a new audience...but after hearing it, I don't really care if Jimmy's a businessman. If he can pull together names like Martina McBride, Nancy Griffith, Kenny Chesney, etc., more power to him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Jimmy Buffet Album EVER.","review":"With a title like License to Chill, you would think this was a back to the beach - partying, carribean flavor album. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. It should be called, Jimmy does Country-Ultra Twang.It is sad when the steel drums are lower than the Steel Slide Guitar. If he wanted to do this and make it work, he should have done ONE or TWO country-ish songs with artists like Shawn Colvin and Lyle Lovett to at least have some crossover with the rest of the world.Jimmy, Some advice - Loose the twang, Get Fingers Back and get back into writing songs about Passing out in your hammock, before it is too late. Also, why bother to record an album without the Mayer brothers? A waste of almost $20. Should of bought a bottle of Jose Cuervo.There is not one non-twangy song on here. Guess this one is going on EBAY.

This time out, there is far more Hank Williams than Xavier Cougat. But I laughed out loud more than once, especially at his coastline confessions reference to stealing peanut butter. This record will make Buffett a bigger star than he was, drawing the country crowd. And no form of music can break the heart quite like C&W. I wish the liner notes had been more explicit about who wrote what. Sonny Landreth burns rubber with his zydecholdsmobile guitar work. As a long-time fan, I'm completely happy. Thanks, Jimmy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are the writing credits?","review":"Like all true Buffett fans, any new Buffett record is an immediate must-own. All in all a pretty good cd, but I am troubled by the fact that I could not find any songwriter credits in the jacket or on the cd. As a huge fan of songwriters, I recognized several of the songs, but what a missed opportunity for exposure to the mainstream music crowd for folks like Guy Clark and John Hiatt. (I have 3 old LPs framed on my wall, my first Buffett record, my first Guy Clark record (autographed!), and my first John Hiatt).

Not this time. I am amazed that he gave crediblity to Toby Keith by recording with him. At this perilous time for the planet that I know he loves, surely JB could have used his immense popularity to make music that could have helped, not just be a pat on the back to the good ol' boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO DOUBT WILL WIN THE CMA NEW RELEASE OF THE YEAR AWARD 2004","review":"I have listened to Jimmy Buffett since the late 70's, and am a true \\"PARROTHEAD\\" I have no doubt this CD will take many awards at the annual CMA awards, and anyone truly fond of country music will truly enjoy it.The lyrics are Buffett style, songs of thought, humor, life and those situations that cause us all to think. But message clarity is gone as they get lost in the twang and slang of the country slide and those \\"famous\\" artist that seem to need to hit notes that distort the words altogether.It appears to me, and I hope I am wrong, that Mr Buffett has set a new course for his horizion in his music, he's gone country. This is one \\"parrothead\\" that feels left behind.PLEASE JIMMY SAY IT ISN'T SO!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to albums like A1A, Changes, and the like?","review":"Oh yeah, that's right, Jimmy grew up. Oh well, the party can't last forever. At least I can throw on \\"You Had To Be There\\" and listen to what Buffett was really about.We can't continue to expect a 59 year old Buffett to be down in Monserrat with James Taylor drinking and snorting the day away while writing and recording the music. Dude's a pilot now and perhaps too mature for the old Buffett fans that refuse to grow up and realize that 1978 can't last forever.This album is fair in regards to getting new music...but I'll take the old stuff anyday of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his worst, but definitely not his best.","review":"There's no middle ground here. You'll either love it or hate it.Astoundingly inconsistent. \\"Coast of Carolina\\" and his remake of Leon Russell's \\"Back to the Island\\" are probably the best tracks on this disc. The duet with Alan Jackson, \\"Boats to Build,\\" is just dreadful. I barely recognized the song. Jerry Jeff Walker's version is much better.And what is up with the chintzy cardboard packaging? Jimmy couldn't spring for a jewelcase?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I'm a fan of Buffett but prefer the harder, heavier music out there but I was bored one day and borrowed this from my neighbor. There is something wrong with this disc. I keep hearing these voices that are not Jimmy. If it was background singers I could understand but it's not. Someone said Jimmy is not selling out. I agree, he sold out a long time ago. This is a terrible cd. First of all, you don't take a classic song like Hey Good Looking and make it sound like a commercial for a fruit drink. That is a big mistake and even bigger for the respected country singers who joined him on this song. I would not tell anyone to buy this unless they like mindless music. Trust me on this one save your money and buy the Johnny Cash box set."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bitter disappointment","review":"Normally, I am a great fan of Christopher Hogwood/the Academy of Ancient Music and their recordings. It was therefore with great anticipation that I listened to their recording of Mozart's C Minor mass, a piece which I was already quite familiar with and fond of. My anticipation soon turned to disappointment, however, for on this recording the voices -- the chorus in particular, but the soloists as well -- totally drown out the instrumental forces. To be sure, the singing is beautiful; but certainly the orchestra would sound beautiful, too, if one could only hear it. I suppose this is not the fault of Hogwood or the AAM, but rather of the recording technicians, who failed to achieve a proper balance. I now wish I had purchased another recording"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who said Ska isn't cool anymore?","review":"I've had the opportunity to listen to this release multiple times and it is ONE FUN album!

After 3 uses, the finish has flaked off in 5 different places. I am an avid home cook who knows how to properly use and care for kitchen equipment and cookware.I used an old version of this griddle, without a non-stick finish, and I LOVED IT.

That is very important to us as it will be used on our outdoor grill most of the time.

I have cooked my share of eggs over the years. On my first egg-scapade with this griddle, they stuck. Eggs? Stick on a nonstick? With cooking spray applied? You've got to be kidding me. I can't make anything on this griddle without it sticking. Salmon last night?

It's basically worthless aside from being great at thawing foods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look no further this is it!","review":"I got this griddle for my wife for xmas - she absolutely loves it.

I looked high and low for griddles and this one is it - look no further for the perfect griddle.Update - 3+ Year of usage and still loving this. It remains super easy to use and clean up. It does a great job with pancakes, grilling during the winter and anything else we have tried to cook on it. I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"I used this more before I bought the Cuisinart Griddler (the Griddler's plates are diswasher safe, my two favorite words.) I think the key is to adjust the temperature. Start on medium but as the food cooks, lower the temperature to keep juices from burning. I do not suggest it for marinades that contain a lot of sugar because the non-stick coating is delicate. If you do burn something, immediately after cooking, turn off the heat, leave the grill in place and pour water on it. Use a nylon scrub brush to loosen as much food as you can as the water steams. Dawn Power Dissolve works if things burn on it, but do not leave it on for a long time because it will damage the coating.A bonus is that it really does thaw foods fast too.Great product if you treat it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for indoor use.","review":"I use this grill in my apartment, where I have a small (UGLY) range. I have it permanently covering the left side of my range, which works great for me.It's SO easy to clean. The nonstick coating is just as good, if not better than other commercial grill pans. It sets on top of my range like it was built to be there. Even when it is not in use it looks decorative.As for actually cooking with the grill, it is simple! A few squirts of cooking spray, set both burners to medium-high... you have a great, consistent grill pan. No excess smoke or grit.... it's amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great for electric","review":"I bought this hoping to wow my family with some 30 minute meals but this doesn't work great on my electric stove. If you leave it up too high for longer than a minute on the grill side the griddle coating burns off and stinks up the place. If you can't leave it up high you don't get good grill marks. I end up putting on high for a few minutes and then back down. Doesn't cook thick meat for chicken breast through well. You are better off finishing them in a real pan in the oven. The coating chips easily. I am thinking of going with cast iron as it is more work in the begining but I think it worth it in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible surface","review":"I have had this for 3 years and the food has always stuck more than it should and the 1st time using the grill side RUINED it. Worse, any oil I used would never wash off (even in the dishwasher). After 3 years of only pancake making, the build up was so bad I decided one last attempt to save it would be to try it in the self-clean cycle of my oven. Now all the finish had burned off (and likely given us cancer - the house smelled so terrible, we had to go outside) and the griddle is still useless. Going in the \\"donate\\" box. Very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electric stove? Try this other griddle model.","review":"For those who have electric stoves, check out the Dbl Burner Reversible Grill/Griddle, item 3535, also available on this website.

It sort of sounds like someone just took a bunch of Brandy singles and made a compilation album; I mean, where are all the transitions and the logical song order?? Necessary could have been a great track, but they were trying to do too much, the beat sounds out of place. Like another reviewer said, a lot of the songs where technically good but just didn't have a that spark.

She is very talented. You can definitely tell she has matured a whole lot, and yes sometimes it takes us all to go through something to be able to tell a story..and if that's what it takes, then GO BRANDY!!!!! The cd opens up with a great song called \\"WHO I AM\\".......check it out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brandy Takes Control","review":"I have recently purchased this album and I honestly have not been able to stop listening to it! Brandy truly sounds better than ever, as her voice takes on a more husky and strong persona, much like artists as Mary J. Blige & Lauryn Hill. Brandy's collaborations on this CD are also very unique and inventive and add flavor to her sound. Most of the tracks are about her ex-husband and how she is over him now and how their break-up has made her be a better woman. The only downside to this CD is that MOST of the tracks are about her ex, so if she is over him then why does she keep singing about him? Regardless of all of that, I just love this CD and I think everyone should pick it up and give it a listen. I also love her references to Coldplay, she even samples \\"Clocks\\" in the song \\"Should I Go\\", and her references to the late R&B Singer Aaliyah Haughton. Way To Go Brandy! Keep making this great music. I love you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is Off Da Chain!","review":"I've had this album since the first day it came out, I just haven't had the time to review it. I love every track on the album. I am a huge Brandy fan, but if this was crap, I would let Amazon.com know. I really like her vocals on \\"Sadiddy\\". I love \\"Say you will\\" and \\"Necessary\\" Her voice is a lot stronger, though she sung higher on \\"Full Moon\\", another great album. My girl brought them dance steps back in \\"Talk about our love\\" that I haven't seen since videos like \\"Baby\\". You won't be disappointed if you buy this album, even if you're not a Brandy fan at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Summer Album","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this album. I have to admit I was more of an Moesha fan than of Brandy's music. However, I have to admit this ablum is actually good. I listened to the first 10 songs without actually skipping to the next one half way though. I think Brandy has grown as an artist. It seems hooking up with Timberland and Kayne was a great idea.This album is something you can listen to on a long commute home from work. Or on a Friday night when you getting ready to hang out. GREAT JOB BRANDY."},{"rating":"2","title":"IS THIS AALIYAH THOUGH???","review":"IF U WANT GOOD MUSIC THEN I RECCOMEND THIS CD IT IS HOT BUT ALL BRANDY CD'S ARE GOOD TO ME. I LOVE ALL THE TRACKS ON THE ALBUM BUT THE TIMBERLAND TRACKS SOUND LIKE THEY SHOULD BE SONGS MADE FOR AALIYAH. THIS IS A GREAT CD THOUGH AND I WOULD RECCOMEND IT. BRANDY IS A GOOD ARTIST I WOULDNT CALL HER AN ENTERTAINER BUT SHE IS A GOOD ARTIST..TO BAD HER ATTITUDE STINKS AND SHE PROVED TO HER FANS SHE IS A LIAR BY SAYING SHE WAS MARRIED UM WAS THAT FOR PUBLICITY OF THIS ALBUMS FIRST TRACK??????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"This album, I think, was the worst ever. It's good but Never Say Never was the best ever. The songs sound too much like something a new artist would come out with. All the songs are about a guy and then the lyrics sound too much alike. There were only 4 songs total that I listen to on the album. On Full Moon, there were probably 10 that I listen to. Then on Never Say Never, all the songs I like. The first album is good and there are probably 6 songs that I liked. She definitely should've stayed with her old producers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Anyone SING Anymore?","review":"I am not busting on brandy per se, but from what i've heard...i hear more music and technology then i do her voice...sad thing is...that's today's music...i wouldn't buy this because it sounds to much like everything else on the radio these days...i mean if that's your thing, then by all means...pick it up...you'll probably like it...i'm not saying that it's terrible, i guess it's good for what it is...i want to hear more vocals and less of the technology behind making the music...i mean it seems so computerized and less personal to ME... just my two cents...have a happy day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An experiment that didn't work .....................","review":"This is not a Brandy album. This is a Timbaland album with Brandy as a vocal guest. It all sounds the same because 7 of the 15 songs are by the same writer (a Timbaland protege), and most are produced by Timbaland. This album was \\"critically acclaimed\\". That means nobody bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced","review":"This cd contains too much bass notes, and I think that she tried too hard to become poplular again. I bought this cd, expecting it to be like her first and second cds, but it it more like the third one. It has too much production, and too many things are happening at the one time. It is too cluttered, and I find it hard to concentrate when listening to it. I think that timbaland is trying to create another aaliyah, but in reality, we really dont need another, One is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Uncreative, bland, cliched left to right, frustratingly repetitive, lame, and boring. I'm glad Brandy has found herself and has grown up and all, but this album is by far her worst and least appealing. If you're like me, a CD is an immediate hit to your ear, or it grows on you. This CD did neither. Her current singles are by no means hits. I can't believe T.I. agreed to do such a lame track with her. All and all, I listened to three songs in their entirety. I definitely regret buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brandys Time is Up","review":"I've always enjoyed Brandys music. The Boy is Mine, Have I Ever, What About Us?, and Full Moon were all favorite songs of mine of the past 5 years. Therefore, I was excited to get Brandys latest cd Afrodisiac. For the first time in Brandys career, I am very disappointed. With the exception of maybe one or two songs there is nothing memorable here. There is to much production going on which drowns Brandy out. Her voice has never been her strongest suit, but it's never bothered me til now. It's quiet and breathy, and doesnt work for the overproduced tracks. First single \\"Talk About Our Love\\" is probably the best track on here, and I suggest buying the cd single instead of the whole album. Finally, the last song on the album is called \\"Should I Go\\" and it samples the music from Coldplays \\"Clocks.\\" It's a beautifully crafted song, and should be her next single if she's smart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her worst...man she just lost a hard core fan.","review":"Brandy...this was your worst album. You shouldve stuck to your old formula. Your voice and Timb's dry attempt to create emotion didnt work out. Get back with Rodney. And just so you know I brought your cd and then sold it for half price, just to get rid of it. And to make matters worse my friend said she wanted her money back. TSK TSK"},{"rating":"1","title":"..","review":"This is a whatever album... the only reason i am posting this review is to say that there is a riff that has been copied off of IRON MAIDEN's 'The CLansman' in the song I TRIED... being a die hard Maiden fan.. i wasnt happy to see this at all.. Horrible attempt at music .. she doesnt even have a voice to sing with.. would give it 0 stars if i could.."},{"rating":"1","title":"aaliyah, beyonce, ashanti??","review":"The album isn't that great. I don't know who's she's trying to be. First of all she's copying Aaliyah's music, Beyonce style and Ashanti's new single Turn It Up. Im not feeling this album at all except for one song Should I Go yes hun I think it's time to hang it up. Never Say Never will always be her best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tim production in a while...","review":"Timbaland is my boy, so when I heard he was producing most of Brandy's album, I knew I was gonna cop it. Timbaland really did his thang on this album. Stand out tracks are: \\"Afrodisiac\\", \\"I tried\\", and \\"Turn it up\\" which yall might have heard on the radio . I aint no big brandy fan so if i didnt like the album id tell ya. Cop it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Anticipated Return of a Queen","review":"While Full Moon was underrated, Brandy shows her muscle and hushes those who doubted that teen prodigys have what it takes to ride the waves of today's music industry. Brandy latest reminds of of the passion we felt throughout \\"Never Say Never\\" but shows us a more mature side. She gives a us something to celebrate but also gives great emmotion for us to relate too. There were many nights where I popped in a Brandy CD in order to release stress and hear a soothing voice. \\"Afrodisiac\\" is a instant classic! Brandy is the Queen of R&B, like it or not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Brandy you've outdone yourself this time...This cd is FIYAAAA! OMG...Timberland did a very good job as well...This cd is a must have for 2004. See you at da Grammys Bran."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Album From A Great Artist","review":"This new album from Brandy titled \\"Afrodisiac\\" deserves its title because I just cannot get enough of it. Since I bought it 9:00 on June 29, I have listened to it everyday snce then and I just love it. If This album is not hit, I don't know what America or the world is listening to, but this is hot music here and Brandy deserves her props on this album. From album 1-4 Brandy gives us good music and I thank her for that.P.S.: I Like the references to Aaliyah and Monica in \\"Turn It Up\\" and \\"Should I Go\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Brandy leaves me speechless on this one!","review":"Wow, this album is incredible. It shows how much brandy has grown!! I dont understand why some people are hating on her! The majority of the tracks on this album are upbeat and catchy, and there arent that many low-key ballets, but that doesnt lessen how amazing this album is (With the help of Timbaland)... Here are some of the tracks I love-Afrodisiac-AMaZinG Beats!-Saddity-she breaks it down to all the haters-AMAZINg!-I trieD-Emotional song, and amazing lyrics!-FocUs-The type of song everyone can relate to!-Should I go-Song is a brilliant way to end the album-has the background of coldplay's \\"clocks\\" (which mays it even more amazing!!) --overall, ive always been a brandy fan, she's amazing.. and this album is a definite must buy!!!!!!!!!!i give it an A++++++ =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this CD!!!","review":"Ok, I am by no means a Brandy fan. I never really felt her music, and when I heard she was making music w/ Timbaland, I was upset because I felt like she was trying to take Aaliyah's sound. (she is doing the Beyonce look tho)But I was wrong. She and Timbaland kind of created her own niche. I heard the cd on MTV the leak and I've been a fan of it ever since. I can't say much about Brandy's last albums because I never bought them or listened so I can't compare them to her recent work. However the sounds she makes in this cd are so lush and you can hear the emotion in each song. Her background harmonies are tight. And the work Kanye and Timbo made on the cd are great. Now there are a few songs that I have to skip over, but overall this is a pretty good cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SOLID R&B ALBUM","review":"After I read the review in People magazine for this album the other day, I knew I had to get it, and I was going to anyways. They gave it 4 out of 4 stars and said it was like an Aaliyah album, but on Brandy's own personal level. I completely agree, this album is perfect with many stand-out tracks. The best songs on this are \\"I Tried\\" \\"Afrodisiac\\" and \\"Sadiddy.\\" I believe Timbaland made this album the best it could be with his outstanding production on the majority of the tracks. If your not really into the first single, \\"Talk About Our Love\\" still give this a try because I am not really into the song either and the rest of the album is really diverse and fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Solid R&B Album Of 2004!!!","review":"The songs on this CD are about the ups and downs in a relationship.Brandy lets the listeners know what she's been through in songs.She sings every song with so much soul and emotion, That you can pretty much believe every single track on this wonderful CD. This CD is DEFINITELY worth buying. And you will not be dissappionted. A Whole Lot of Rhythm and a Whole Lot of Blues!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Awesome Tracks","review":"WOW.... this is one of this cd's with incredible producers..... Timbaland, Kanye West... just to name a few.... with a mediocre washed up singer.... I just wished Aaliyah was still alive to absolutely rip through these tracks with her incredible voice.... I just think that brandy's voice sounds soo fake.... think Ashanti..... by the way its been selling... I think people agree that the beats are better than her weak melodies..... and non powerful vocals....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brandy's All Grown Up....","review":"I wasnt sure about the album even though i've been a huge fan of Brandy since \\"I Wanna Be Down\\" check out the remix on that its hot as well. Never Say Never was hot as well and had a good 4 or 5 songs released off the album. Full Moon another smash from B-Rocka!!!But with Afrodisiac, Brandy comes with the goods hands down. From the opening Who I Am to the closing of Should I Go. This album is hot. I personally love \\"Turn It Up\\", Talk About Our Love w/Kanye West, Where I wanna Be w/T.I., Saddidy (the song is gritty), Who's She To You, Should I Go.The whole cd is hot and the placement of the songs is on point as well. Dont listen to them haters out there. If you havent heard the cd. You arent giving an accurate representation of Afrodisiac.Its on point, plain and simple. Get the album, you wont be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece of modern R&B","review":"First off, the track listing is wrong, so look elsewhere.Brandy's albums have always been about filler...the bad sappy ballads that carry you back and forth to a couple singles from better producers......that formula has finally been broken. Timbaland strikes gold with the instrumentals and Brandy's voice (and innovative vocal production) are in top form. Sampling Iron Maiden and Coldplay, trying on grittier themes, and finally, FINALLY giving fans a little insight into her life as an artist (as opposed to piles of lyrical poop like The Boy is Mine), Brandy's fashioned a cohesive modern R&B; album...and I do not use the term album lightly. It took me many a spin to unlock the goods of AFROdisiac, but once it gets you, you can't let go.So if you're looking for another retread of generic \\"Almost Doesn't Count\\" territory, buy the new Mario album or something....I hope she tours with this one.And Brandy, if you're reading... Release TURN IT UP to the clubs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad this album floped","review":"this album was very good and deserved the grammy she got for this album should have got 2 more nomination i only think she shoulda did a couple songs with Rodney JerkinsWho I am: BAfrodisiac: A-Who Is 2 U: B+Talk About Our Love: BI Tried: AWhere U Wanna Be: B-Focus: B+Sadiddy: ATurn It Up: D+Nessesary: ASay U Will: A+Come As U Are: AFinally: AHow I Feel: A-Should I Go: BLyrics: AVocals: A+Production: B+Overall: A-"},{"rating":"2","title":"don't listen to the haters","review":"I find it absurd that all of these teeny Beyonce and Britney Spears fans are trying to come here hating on Brandy, obviously without having even heard her album. They fear the competition, and it's understanable. After all, Brandy is and has been making better music than Beyonce, Britney, AND Alicia Keys COMBINED. Beg to differ? Listen to this album. Listen to the lyrics. Listen to the melodies. Listen to the harmonies. Tell me this isn't the BEST R&B album in years!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs many listens - but trust me!","review":"I'd say I'm a marginal Brandy fan... but this album has re-instilled my respect for Brandy after her not-so-hot Full Moon album. You guys really need to turn this up loud and listen intently. The stand out tracks... \\"Afrodisiac\\" (i actually hated this at first), \\"Talk About our love\\", \\"Finally\\" (really gets you going)... and she saved the best for last \\"Should I Stay\\". Please listen to these four tracks on the samples and then buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Afrodisiac","review":"This album seems a bit too over produced.It flows but only because of the production.Her voice carrys well though and she maintains a great fluent sound.It can become much like most RnB these days too much lacking but its a good Brandy album.After it all its sometimes forgettable but I think its a good vocal contemporary album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Talk About Our Brandy","review":"With her senior album, Brandy is back and soulful as ever. With Timbaland producing majority of her album (and let's not forget her hit single \\"Let's Talk About Our Love\\" and \\"Where U Want 2B\\" by Kanye West), Brandy deserves platinum status if not by now. She has grown up so much more from her marriage and divorcee to producer Robert Smith, to having a baby, getting \\"Punk'd\\", and finding new comfort and love from someone new to having a much more mellonic voice than ever. Overall her album has gotten better with songs as \\"I Tried\\", \\"Who Is She 2 U\\", \\"Focus\\" and so many others. Even though she is all grown up, she still has much to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come Back Brandy","review":"I listened to this cd several times in hopes that it would grow on me. Unfortunately, it didn't and I regretfully give it 2 stars. I really like Brandy's voice and her positive image, but I must be objective. I understand an artist's need to change and experiment, but change doesn't always equal growth. Bandy's voice here is as beautiful as always but is drowned by Tim's overbearing production. She sounds totally uninspired and seems to be trying too hard to compsensate for the subpar material. I must admit to liking four of the songs but that's not quite enough to justify more than two stars. I still love Brandy and will buy her next cd.... I just hope she chooses better material next time out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album","review":"Is very different from other albums not the best, but different Listen to this album before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT","review":"I cannot believe, This album rocks!

I am SO sick of the Timbaland sound, not to mention his voice...his \\"uh-huh's\\" & \\"yeas\\" HAS to go! A horrible CD. The only 2 songs I can handle on here is: Saddidy & Should I Go......the rest is just trash. She needs to take it back a bit and pop out the hits like she did in 1997. Do not bother!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AfroWACK!!!!","review":"I just had a feeling that this cd was going to suck from the very 1st mediocre single \\"Talk about our love\\" f/Kanye West. Full Moon surprisingly I would have to say is definately better than this. She let Timberland produce the majority of the album and it has the same type flow that Aaliyah had and we all know that no one will replace Detroit's Angel so just stop it and be yourself. I love Brandy but this cd is just pure garbage, no wonder it came in at the #3 spot with only 131,000 copies sold in the 1st week to Full Moon's #2 debut at 155,000 copies sold in its 1st week release, Things that make you go HMM.

She is the number one best selling RnB artist out there. Come on guys, stop listening to crap.

Thank god for Alicia."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really dont know what to think","review":"When I first heard this album sometime last week, I was very dissapointed. There is only 2 slow ballads. The album to get was FULL MOON, which she didn't promote properly.

However, I was pleasantly surprised by what I heard on Afrodisiac. At times, Brandy's subtleties are drowned out by Timbaland's beat-heavy production. But songs like \\"How I Feel\\", \\"Focus\\" and \\"Should I Go\\" back off of all of the loud beats just enough for her voice to be heard.And what a mature, controlled voice it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"afrodisiac","review":"I have been a Brandy fan from the beginning of her career.

I wanted to be objective and not say I like all the songs just because I'm a fan. But, she really does a excellent job with her vocals this time around. I like the whole CD, and that is very rare, because usually I have to skip through songs on artist's CDs. Great Job Brandy & Welcome Back!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work of Art!","review":"Brandy's new record is something special. She gives you all of her life stories, from sad to happy song, Brandy always give it to you like you lived it. Who I Am is a song that tells you about her past relationship, she makes sure she doesn't leaves anything out. Say You Will is a song that ask for promise in love in a relationship. Should I Go a song that tells you how the music game has changed over the last few years. Last, I say please get this record so you can Learn The Brandy Way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Done it Again!","review":"Brandy's back and as usual she never fails to deliver a dose of music her fans can relate to.

Whether you're in love, out of love, or want to be in or out of love, this CD will cover every last emotion you could possibly feel. A masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brandy's back with sexiness and maturity","review":"At first I was a skeptic like many others. I was a Brandy fan but I really didn't know if I would like the new sexy mature Brandy but low and behold after listening to the CD about 2 or 3 times I found myself liking majority of the songs. Brandy's voice sounds great she has bravado to her now. My favorite songs are 'Where you wanna be' (featuring T.I), 'Should I go', 'Who is she to you', 'Focus' and of course 'Talk about our love'. I DID NOT LIKE 'Saddidy' which really disappointed me and was truly corny. Her upbeat songs on this CD aren't that great (the few that they are)but Brandy is a great ballad singer. I am proud of this CD though it shows that now she is a woman not a little girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good comeback","review":"Brandy succesfully showed us what a woman she has come to be in this album. By being more mature with her lyrics and showing that she can sing more then just ballads. But I disagree with all of the work that was done with producer Timbaland, Brandy should have limited the work she done with this talented man and worked with more producers then just the majority of him. This album is rated as her second best album,even though this album may do better then \\"Full Moon\\" on the charts it will never be better then it vocally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Brandy CD","review":"This is the BEST Brandy CD ever!

Don't believe the hype this album is not that good! I therfore do not recommened it because of it's sheer tackiness and utter disrespect for the sound that made Aaliyah!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected after hearing 1st single","review":"Should of stuck with either Kanye or Rodney on this one. Track one is beautiful and so is Talk about our Love. Brandy's voice is too beautiful to be drowned by Tim's beats and confusion. She can handle a ballad and it just didnt happen. I loved Aaliyah she was more of a performer than a singer and Brandy is a down right singer. She mention Aaliyah in more than one song, not being funny but Brandy this is your time to shine. Never Say Never reigns supreme and i cant say it enough. Rodney knows you best. Full Moon even had more to offer. But if you are happy thats all that matters. I should have went to MTV.com and leaked the cd before i bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"GO BACK TO RODNEY!!!","review":"I am Brandy's #1 fan, but this album does not represent the Brandy I feel in love with. Rodney Jerkins created a sound with her that was incredible, and although he may have prostituted that sound for other artist like, Toni Braxton, and Destiny's Child....He is a producer. That's what they do. Brandy if you're listening, please make amends with Rodney and get back in the studio. We love the way the two of you sound TOGETHER! This cd is not BRANDY quality. I actually bought it and gave it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Work on your voice Brandy","review":"It seems that every year Brandy voice gets worse and worse. Her voice just doesn't live up to the material on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brandy's Back...","review":"Brandy is back with a new album, \\"Afrodisiac\\". She worked with new producers and has developed a completely different sound than her last 3 albums. Different, but ultimately good. People will say that this album is reminiscent of what another Aaliyah album could've been. I think the songs could've been sung by Aaliyah, but I think they are tailored more for Brandy's deep, breathy, husky voice. and that works. The standouts are:*Afrodisiac - inventive and sure to be a classic*Who Is She 2 U - would be a great single*Talk About Our Love - great first single, shouldve done better*I Tried - the first song that really shines on first listen*Sadiddy - the beat is crazyy!*Turn It Up - kind of old, but was effectively used to generate buzz*Should I Go - hands down, best track on the album. sample \\"clocks\\" by coldplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD CD","review":"I am a Brandy fan and I think this is a great CD. It shows her growth as a person and an artist. My favorite song on the album is Who I am because it shows that no matter what a person goes through in the end it will make them stronger as a person. Other songs that are good are I Tried, Afrodisiac, Where You Wanna be, Talk About our Love, Necessary, Say You Will, Come As You Are and Should I Go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return of a Diva","review":"I've been a fan of Brandy's since the beginning of her career. Although I'd rather see her work with Rodney Jerkins again, this album shows so much growth for her as an artist. I'm not really big on Timb and his monotonous producing, but Brandy's sultry, soulfull voice is remarkable. My favorite track is \\"Should I Go\\" where she uses the cold play joint (wonderful). I think this cd is a must have for music and brandy lovers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monica's was better.. but still good.","review":"I love Brandy but it seemed she put something out because Monica had success unexpectedly (for me anyway). Talk about our love is a good start but maybe not the first single but that may be the problem. There is maybe two possible hits on this CD but there not everybody's cup of tea. I tried, Necessary, and Say U will are all good. Better than Full Moon and very underrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Comparison...","review":"For those who made mention to Brandy trying to be like her R&B solo rivals, this album is not to be compared. Credit should be given where it's due. If this album is not your flavor that's cool, but it is undeniable that this is by far one of Brandy's BEST works. It's real, its soulful, it's sultry... and I LOVE it. I can truly relate to all the emotions captured in this CD and I think it's utterly phenomenal! This album is one that captures the essence of the growth and triumph. She's doin' her thing and there's nothing that can stop her now.HANDS DOWN -- THE BOMB!!!!MY SUGGESTIONS: Track titles:#3- Who is she to you#5- I Tried#6- Where you wanna be#7- Focus (*I can REALLY relate to THIS one*)#10- Necessary (*truly my favorite*)#11- Say You Will (*really sweet...I've been there too*)#13- Finally (*ladies, this is our victory song!*)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have saved the money","review":"I really like Brandy, but this time I am not impressed. The beats are way too strong for Brandys sweet,low voice. There are only a few songs that are enjoyable in particular Talk about our love. This cd does sound like songs for Aaliyah. When I put the cd in I knew something was wrong, It just didn't sound like Brandy. No wonder, she isn't with her old producers Dark Child. Now the last Album Full Moon, I played to death. I guess it will take a few more plays before I get used to this sound. The most hated song Necessary. The best song on the album and the trick to get you to buy the album Let's Talk About Our Love. I would find a friend that has a copy and you know the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO SATISFACTION","review":"I was unhappy with Brandy's latest effort.

The songs are melody driven and understated, with each track melting into the next, like a lush array of raindrops falling on a cloudy day. The music is reflective, often bordering on sorrowful. Every now and then, though, an upbeat jam like 'come as you are' and 'who is she 2 you' comes along and breaks the mood, nicely evening things up.The main strength of this album lies in it's lyrics. The lyrics are straight to the point, personal and signify a woman coming into her own. This is definately Brandy's 'coming of age' album. Full Moon was good, but in years to come, many fans will look back at this album as her defining achievement.Simply put, this is a mature album which doesn't aim itself at pleasing the mainstream audience. it is an under-appreciated masterpeice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brandy keeps bringin it hotter than ever!!!","review":"Afrodisiac is one of Brandy's best album's to date. As an artist, with each album she puts out, each one is better than the one before and this is no different. This album stands out with its bass-heavy beats -thanks to Timberland who produced more than half the album, and for the power and emotion in brandy's voice. She's been through a lot in her career and her personal life, it all comes through in Afrodisiac. From the opening track, Who I am to the album closer Should I stay each song is like reading in the singer's diary. Afro has potential for really hot singles, especially the title track, Who Is she to You, and I tried. All in all, this album is a must have for Brandy fans and non- Brandy fans alike. Go Get It! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Brandy!","review":"I have to say that this is the best cd Brandy has done. She has most definitely hit her peak!!

Some of my favs are:\\"Who I am\\"- great song to start the album\\"Afrodisiac\\" -the beat is just amazing!!\\"Who Is She 2 U\\"- another awesome song!\\"Talk About Our Love\\"- Masterpiece!!

Like \\"Aaliyah\\" and \\"Fan Mail\\", the dark- but sexy vocals are like missing pieces to a puzzle when driven over the funky beats. The album's first single \\"Talk About Our Love\\" is reminiscent to the ol' school 90's R&B. Brandy's smooth-raspy voice slithers through the entire track with perfection, only to be met with Kanye's unique rhyming style. Other unique soundscapes on the album include: \\" I Tried\\", \\"Sadiddy\\", \\"Should I Go\\", \\"Focus\\", \\"Who Is She 2 U\\", and the title track."},{"rating":"2","title":"best brandy album to date","review":"i love this album. it's her best yet. it shows that she has really grown up. if you get this album trust me you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfactory","review":"The binding is not leather, which is ok, but it is bound so tightly that the inner columns are hard to read because it doesn't lay flat.Also, mine is missing the entire book of Genesis and starts at Exodus 20.

I also like that this can be split apart and used as a boppy later on.The only thing I would change is to have some sort of a washable cover for when it is in 1 piece.

When I got it I was so happy, but than came putting the pillow covers on which was not fun or easy by any means. But with the pillow covers on, it makes the pillow shorter, which if your a long tall person, its hard to stretch out and even be in it at all. So I just took the covers off completely, which gave me more room. But the main problem was the pillow for your head was the same thickening as the other side which make your head sit up too high, and made my neck hurt. If the pillow on one side was not as thick where my head could lay and be even with my spine, I would be more than pleased. So that's how I feel about it all.

I read it in absolute fascination, the stark horror and desolution, and the world it wove around you. I was still on my mind when we arrived that evening at LASFS (Los Angeles Science Fantacy Society, oldest SF club in the country). Then this grandmotherly woman comes up as the guest. It was Octavia Butler. She talked about how she came up with the idea for the horrific images she can write, and it seemed such a paradox. I don't remember all the words, but it was wonderful to hear a writer so clearly describe the process and impact.It stands with me as one of the best stories I've ever read and one of the most moving because it is in the end something which touched the fundamental humanity in all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butler has been better...","review":"\\"Bloodchild\\" seems to be decent effort, but too much was lacking and too much was added. The biographical prose was interesting, but...it somehow made the stories seem disconnected from each other. All well and good, we don't really need to know what motivates each story. Leave something to the imagination. The title story was too long, and it seemed to be very hard to get into; five years after I first purchased the short-story collection I STILL HAVE NOT read to the end of Bloodchild. And I have read everything Ms. Butler ever wrote, including \\"Survivor.\\" The story about the alcoholic I \\"just didn't get,\\" and the others were okay, but all in all, this book averages out as being not very engrossing.

Perfect for all GBA games, like Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best buy ever","review":"ok, I got mine from eBay because I wanted a spacial color (pink/japan - had to spend extra money for that)BUT, this GBA SP is one of my best purchases EVER1. the own backlight is a great improvement2. because u can fold this thing, the display doesn't get too many scratches3. it's small, light and the battery works for ever (so it seems to me and I'm playing A LOT)Even so I can not spent my money for everything I would like to buy, I did never regret this purchaseNow there is this new nintendo DS on the market, but I love my GBA SP TOOOOOOO MUCH to buy something new ^^"},{"rating":"2","title":"My red Gba sp","review":"I love it because i can play it anywhere and still see the screenbut.

I've just moved so I have a commute to work and I was bored senseless (and reading book after book which isn't a bad thing). Anyway, I travel a lot and love to game so this was the perfect gift. It's light, compact, and not to bad with the layout of buttons - thought the L and R button on the back sometimes are annoying. I haven't gotten any major hand cramps yet from the small size. The screen lights up well and for it's small size gives a good amount of graphics to get the job done. And the battery life is way longer than I expected! A great portable system!!! The only thing I wish is that the games available were better. I find that a lot of them are for a very much younger audience. But I have been loving playing my old school favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME! a game boy sp!!!","review":"You know what my friend got a gameboy SP.It\`s like a lap top all smushed into one little laptop.I felt like I was hipnotized to playing it.I also think it is a little educational because it helps youwith stratages and problem solving.I think I should haven\`tgot a gameboy advance[even though I like it]I think I should have got a gameboy SP."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really love my gameboy advance sp","review":"this is best gameboy ever. it is the same as gba but with better features and a cooler color schemes but i still dont get why it has no headphone jack. the graphics on it are not much better but it seems like it with the backlight and this is really good with super mario advance 4.

I love playing the older games like Donkey Kong Country, and I have the first version of a Scrabble Game that I still enjoy. It cheats and I find that amusing. I thought getting a new unit to have as a backup would be a good idea. It was a birthday gift from my husband and I was excited to get it. While it was on the charger I was playing a couple of new 3D DS games which kept me busy. When I turned on the new unit it was noticeably darker than my old one. When I pushed the backlight button, it got even darker, so dark it was unplayable. I had to return the item .

This story is very true to life about what's going in small town America. We have a tendency to think that once we leave the city we are also leaving the problems. WRONG. Sin is everywhere and is really running wild in small towns.I want to read more about Ava/Eddie, Joyce/Imani and of course Mrs. Gerry.Excellent job for a first novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I'm sorry I don't agree with most of the reviewers. Although the book was easy to read, I found it to be slow-moving. I was so excited to finally read it but I couldn't figure out what all the hype was about. I loved the male character in the book, although for the life of me, I can't remember his name. I also loved the bonding that the sisters had. I think the AIDS tragedy wasn't developed enough. This book is one that I'll soon forget about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah - give me a break!","review":"Please, just because the topics are timely and the text is easy to read and hip; that does not make this a good book. Lets see.. the protagonist is HIV positive, runs away from her problems and falls in love with a man who killed a couple people and did time. There is no depth to the characters or the plot. I kept turning the pages waiting for more to happen, but it didn't. What a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"This book was one of my all time favourites. I have been dissappointed with some of Oprah's selections but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was everything a book should be: educational, funny, suspenseful, thought provoking, etc... I would recommend this book to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great quick read that deals with some tough subjects.","review":"Our book club will be discussing this book this month and Ican't wait. Cleage so delicately deals with complex subjects ofdysfunctional families, AIDS, deteriorating cities, drugs, crime and love. Her character development was superb. Right away you connect with and feel for Ava, you admire her sister Joyce, you respect the Eddie, and you despise Gerry the minister's wife. A wonderfully funny, sad, complex and sometimes gritty story that leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous !!! Seems more like fact than fiction","review":"Pearl Cleage is one of the best authors I've seen in a while. She keeps you on the edge as she shows you the life of Ava & the town of Idlewood. I stayed up until 2 am & read by the moonlight because I couldn't get enough of this book. Pearl, your work is definitely a \\"pearl\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"Every once in awhile do I read a book that grabs me from the first page and I am sad to see it end. This is one of those books. I love it! A zillion thanks to the author for writing it and I look forward to more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great title, great story.","review":"I read this novel in just a few days. It was humorous and serious, entertaining and and heartbeaking all at the same time. Ava Johnson, the protagonist, has just returned home to Idlewood after ten years of living the wild life in Atlanta. Although she plans to stay only the summer with her sister, Joyce, numerous events in both their lives sway her decision and she chooses instead to remain in her home town. Full of life and spunk, Ava is a delightful person to get to know and her sister, Joyce, the sort of woman we all wish we could be, passionate and courageous as well. If ever we are to become better as a human race, it will be because of people like these two sisters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope-filled, I cared about the characters","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Started it last night and finished this evening. Ava Johnson, HIV positive, comes home on a pit stop and becomes involved in her sister's life of helping young black women -- most teenage mothers. Uplifting, hopeful. Anyone who suggests this book is a waste of time or predictable is wrong! Yes, there are hints here and there of what is to come but the author's style and perspective makes you want to continue until the very end. Fortunately, the HIV positive diagnosis does not overwhelm the story. Rather, it makes you feel more alive and aware that we cannot waste our time on this earth. The characters, Ava and Eddie, give testimony to the fact that people can grow, learn and change through difficult situations -- HIV, Viet Nam. Joyce's character shows that there can be life after losing a wonderful partner. Absolutely worth every minute of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated - what was Oprah thinking?","review":"Contrived plot, inconsistencies in the story, predictable and sappy ending. Expected the quality of Quindlen and Lamb, the other Oprah Book Club entries I have read, and I was sorely disappointed. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and Ridiculous!","review":"What could have been a swift smack of reality turned out to be a disappointing waste of words. The story is far-fetched and the characters are laughable. Oprah, I love you girl, but I almost feel insulted by the inclusion of this book on your list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Oprah thinking???","review":"This book was awful! I've not met many books that I didn't enjoy, but this book was loaded cliches. This author took deep subject matter (Having HIV) and turned it into garbage.....I got to a point in the book where the main character said something along the lines of \\"...and we sang the tunes we'd been practicing for a lifetime, oh yea, oh yea, oh baby yea yea yea. The saddest part of this book for me was that I paid retail. i want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what could have been compelling..","review":"What starts out as a streetwise aspect to an interseting situation gets steadily more shallow and cliched as the story develops. The characters seem stereotyped and predictable, and not deep enough to care about. PLease, please if you're going to write about real tough issues that impact our lives, give us some real tough characters to deal with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"this could happen to anybody","review":"I just finished reading \\"What looks like crazy...\\" which I had just gotten my hands on some hours ago! It is the kind of book you read in one go, so indulge yourself one evening, slow down & read it from cover to cover. I didn't give this book a 5 star rating because that would mean I rate it as one of the best books I've ever read, which isn't true. But it's one of those books that are uplifting, although realistic, well written, although not the best literature you can imagine, & all in all, it's a story that is taken out of everyday life (even the happy ending!). If you haven't read a good, fast paced novel for a while, try this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful reading, kind of a choppy ending.","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. I read it while exercising and it completely absorbed me enough to make me want to get back on the treadmill every day. I laughed, I cried, it's true!! The style is intriguing and comfortable. I was thoroughly in love with Eva and Joyce and Eddie (especially Eddie), and, of course, Imani. Even if the romance was kind of predictable, it was written with such passion and honesty that I loved every minute of it. The cast of characters was rounded off with some great villians. I hated to see it end, and I hated the way it did end. I wanted the author to carry me through the rest of these people's lives. What happened to them? She needed to finish the story or give us some more. I really hated to leave them."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're looking for an entertaining easy read, this is it!","review":"I read this novel in one sitting and thought it was great. Cleage used some throught provoking comments throughout the book. Eddie was a wonderful 'gentle'man. I was surprised at how disturbed I was about the fact that Eddie was prepared to murder again even after his new\\"Buddhist\\"lifestyle. I would have preferred to see Cleage have Eddie choose a more peaceful solution to the problem of Frank and Tyrone.I loved the last paragraph!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is a story of hope in what appears to be a hopeless world. There is something which all of us are called to do so as to make this world a better place. Joyce took the challenge and at the end of the day, though it wasn't easy,she managed to save so many lives. It is not what we are that matters but rather who we are: a difference illustrated by the differences between Joyce and Rev. and Mrs Anderson.Thank you Pearl for this gift to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Start Turns to Cliche","review":"After getting off to a wonderful start, with compelling characters and a light, fun tone, this book fails to develop. As she runs out of energy, Cleage falls back on weak cliches and ends her story unsatisfyingly. Worth reading only if there's nothing else around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I kept reading this book hoping something about would redeem it, but except for the snappy language, it had nothing to recommend it. Ada could have been sympathetic, but she was so blase about being HIV positive that it worked against her. And Eddie, my goodness, who can really believe him as a character? From devil to saint? Really, I don't believe it. Sorry, but I really felt let down by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big let down","review":"What Looks Like Crazy has a lot of potential to be a must read but Cleage skipped all over the issues instead of bringing forth the deep concept of living with HIV, loving with HIV, drugs and other urban dilemmas, she just touched the surface and just abandoned the issues. This book was written on a juvenile basis and it just ended. I was highly disappointed. I pushed myself to finish this book and was glad when I finally did."},{"rating":"2","title":"topic very interesting","review":"This book was basically a filler for me. I was waiting for another book to come in the mail and this one came first. I was impressed. I have never really touched on the topic of HIV and i think this opened my eyes and created a real person in my mind and their feelings. Ending is predictable but i felt good about it. Days after finishing I kept thinking about the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"is that it?","review":"This story started out strong but was incredibly predictable. I kept reading because I thought it would get better. It didn't. What bugged me the most was that Eddie was ready to kill the teenage hoodlum for throwing a bottle thru the window - yikes!!! The teenager was completely unredeemable to him, which was totally weird since Eddie did much worse in his lifetime (that's putting it mildly), and he seemed redeemed. In fact, he had become a saint of sorts. And what about crazy church lady's motives? That part of the story was weak and just did not make much sense.I wanted Ava to continue doing hair - that was much more interesting than her ridiculously perfect romance. I gave it two stars because I did chuckle a few times, and some of the story was original and interesting. Sorry, Oprah, this was a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"a collosal disappointment","review":"i was so disappointed when i read WHAT LOOKS LIKE CRAZY ON AN ORDINARY DAY. the title and first few pages intrigued me. the language flowed so smoothly and the premise was so unusual that i thought i would surly enjoy this book. and yet, after reading 50 pages, i put the book down and left it there; finally, dust mites became far more intimate with this book than i. i basically didn't care about the people, the situations, nothing. this work had so much POTENTIAL, but the characters seemed contrived and the plot line strained. i have only tossed aside three books due to lack of interest or poor writing. this, sadly, was one. still, the author's interesting voice saved this review from receiving only one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of retarded name is that? huh?","review":"This book, bieng a member of Oprah's Book Club, is only suitable for starting fires. I would not read it if you paid me. Oprah should go away and never come back. So there. (Feel free to sent all kinds of nasty hate mail. I like it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A less than enjoyable read with little redeeming value","review":"Oprah needs to take her fingers out of publishing and find some other industry to invade. Her judgement of books is poor, at best. This book is processed sugar. Avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"REQUIRES PATIENCE","review":"GOOD BOOK BUT IT REQUIRES PATIENCE. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T APPRECIATE THIS BOOK BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE IT TAKES TO GET INTO THE FLOW OF THE STORY LINE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure garbage. Depressing. I found very little humor.","review":"When is Oprah going to recommend an uplifting story? Sorry. This book was boring, sad and empty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Look In The Mirror","review":"I couldn't help noticing that one reviewer commented \\"What unnevered me about some of the reviews is the bad grammar . . .\\" and went on to say \\"the amount of people who wrote in . . .\\" Grammatically correct verbiage is, \\"the number of people\\". Amount infers weight; number infers an actual count."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope there's a sequel!","review":"An absolutely excellent read. The characters come into your heart and home. Great writing abilities making this \\"can't put it down til your done\\" reading material. Thank-you, Ms. Cleage, for sharing your characters and their story. I recommend a Part II. This is truly a well told piece that deals with so well with the harsh issues in today's society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!!!","review":"This book was great. I could not put it down. It gives people hope. Hope to the people with HIV, they can see that life is not over it can just begin and get better. I finished the book in 2 days because it was just sooo good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. It goes through the trials and tribulations of big city problems coming to a small town. Being from the area that the story takes place made the book even more realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sensitive story, fast-paced reading.","review":"I started this book and couldn't put it down. The humor throughout the book was intriguing despite the medical condition of the subject. Would recommend for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was expected something different","review":"It was very life like, the scenarios seemed very really, wish it could have been longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally outstanding!!","review":"This book is a must read! Each character was someone I'm sure most people can identify someone they know with. I read the book in one day and my husband in two. Pearl I can't wait for the next one! Thanks Oprah!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I felt the character development was shallow and the real issues were breezed over. The sewing circus solutions seemed unrealistic and like they weren't dealing with the real issues at hand. I felt like I was reading someone's political views on teen pregnancy, abuse and HIV.....but that they weren't really \\"dealt\\" with in the novel to the extent I thought they could have been. My only favorite part was Ada's developing love story with Eddie...which was the ONLY reason I finished the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Increadible...Touching and Funny","review":"This book was wonderful! Ada is very real. Disillusioned, yet hopeful, humorous yet sad, her conflicting nature is intriging. I loved this book and look forward to reading more from the author. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging","review":"Thank you Ms. Cleage and Oprah! I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book from start to finish. I don't think its a literary masterpiece but it was definitely worth every moment of it. After reading it I felt enriched having met the characters . Even though it was a work of fiction its positive messages have stayed me ever since. So much so that while in the bookstore the other day I was encouraging complete strangers to buy copies. Its messages were so moving that I wanted to share them with as many people as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-too quick, but MOST enjoyable read","review":"Unlike the masses, I did not pick up this book because Oprah said so... a co-worker was reading it, and could not stop raving. After finishing the book, I now know what the rave was about. I became totally caught up in life in Idlewild and with Ava's journey. Soon I found myself reading and laughing out loud (on a crowded NYC subway, no less). I have yet to pick up another novel, for fear of being disappointed. I look forward to more works from Ms. Cleage, her voice and humor are a welcome addition to my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down plays lots of serious issues, but also a good read","review":"The serious issues in this book are downplayed, but I found it a good read anyway. Besides I love happy endings and was badly needing a happy ending in my lfie at this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening experience!","review":"I really enjoyed this book! It certainly opened my eyes to the realities of the world. This is a great book for discussion in book groups or to just read on your own. Great job Cleage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK WAS GOOD...","review":"I read WHAT LOOKS LIKE CRAZY ON AN ORDINARY DAY and I reallyliked this book. I really liked the fact that even though Ava wasHIV+, she still found the love of her life in Eddie. The only part of the book that I didn't really like was when the Good Reverend's wife tried her best to stop Ava and Joyce from organizing the teen program for girls; especially when her husband was accused of \\"messing with\\" young teen boys. All-in-all, I really liked this book. I'm a sucker for a romance novel and I was extremely happy to see Ava and Eddie form a relationship. I can honestly say that I am now an official full-fledged Pearl Cleage fan!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and flat","review":"An amiable enough book, but it seemed flat, and most of the crises were entirely predictable. The three main characters were too good to be true, and the bad guys were ALL bad. Interesting that all were black, i.e., for once the enemy was not the white man. Empowerment a strong and inspiring theme. All in all, though, this seems to be written by number."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Looks Like Crazy is Insanely Good","review":"I have to say, that I was a bit weary of reading this book at first. It was in Oprah's book club, and I didn't want some book that had a cult following with just middle aged women. I am young and wanted a book that I could not only enjoy, but also relate to. And this book surely helped me to do both. I loved this book, but I love Cleage even more. The way she writes is so similar to the way my girlfriends and I think/talk. The read was so easy...almost too easy! I had to put it down because I didn't want to finish it!I definitely recommend this book to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"Initially I found this book hard to get into, but I eventually became engrossed in Ava's evolvement. Yes Eddie is somewhat unreal, like another reviewer has commented on but I still found their love story refreshing, beautiful and positive. I had a lot of issues with the seemingly ineffective, backward sheriff department and social services. I thought a better surprise ending would have been Ava getting shot by the Reverend's wife which I thought the story was leading into. All in all a good read with a unique perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectations","review":"After choosing this book because of the reviews, I was surprised when reading it. The characters though somewhat interesting were failed by choppy plotting and ill conceived situations as well as suffering from dull prose and dialogue. To top it off, this author seems to have spent little or no time in Michigan - did she think no one would notice when she moved her make believe town from one side of the state to the other - where was her editor????Very disapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish it were possible to read it back to front","review":"I liked this book a lot...not at first... but toward the middle... I found myself crying over the events in the book. I don't cry over a book but I got very emotional and lost it a few times... I think everyone should take a minute to read it... it really doesn't take that long."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Informative Read","review":"What Looks like Crazy was a good read. It really opens your eyes to the issues that one must deal with while living with HIV. It's not preachy, but yet sends across a message about many other things such as love, abuse, alcoholism, drugs, and violence. Ava is the main character who is HIV positive, and she is the narrator of the story. You can't help but empathize with this character. Joyce, her older sister, is just as enjoyable. The love and support between these two sisters is astounding. Their relationship epitomizes how sisters should stick together. What I really liked about this story is that the author leaves the message that love is always possible, not matter what the circumstances are. This is my first read by Pearl Cleage, and I plan to read the sequel, I Wish I Had a Red Dress, which tells the story of Joyce."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not get through it!","review":"This book was not stimulating in any way. I am an avid reader and this is only the second book in my 28 years of life that I could not finish. Don't waste your money or your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Got To Be Kidding","review":"391 reviews and this book averages 4 stars??? Give me a break. The story is flat, predictable, and full of cliches. The way in which the 3 main characters are written just doesn't seem real, and that is why I found it hard to care about what happens to them. So, with only 50 pages left to the end, I put it down. Don't waste your money because this book is highly over-rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, raw, and honest. An excellent book.","review":"Cleage wastes no time in letting the reader know right away who the character is and what the reader is seemingly in for. However, the true theme of the story is revealed once Ava begins to discover herself hidden inside the fears that she won't confess and the home she once left in pursuit of a real life for herself.The story has plenty of unexpected twists and brutal reality, although at times it seems somewhat contrived, particularly near the end. However, the author did a fantastic job presenting us with woman who faces, with grim determination, her inevitable demise and yet runs from happiness because her own fear is greater than the awful disease she carries. What results is a woman who finds out that the truly brave are the ones who cannot see tomorrow but step to meet it anyway.I very much enjoyed this book, and I look forward to more from Pearl Cleage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Cleage writes intelligently, with earthiness and grace. Highly recommended! SweetBabe1@worldnet.att.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant diversion on a Saturday Afternoon.","review":"I couldn't decide what to think after I finished this book initially. At times it was sad, and at other times uplifting. I wanted to pity the heroine, but she really didn't need my pity. Would that we all could find such love and understanding..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book lacked substance.","review":"This was light reading in every respects. The story line was good but the book went no where. The reader needs more! Oprah's book selections have got to get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! a page turner that arouses every emotion possible.","review":"The author grabs your attention from page one and doesn't let you go until you've cried , laughed, said a few amens and finally, praise mother/father god. The subject matter is real. The characters are alive and not too well in many urban and not so urban environments. Pearl Cleage has touched on so many of the subjects we, black folks don't like to talk about. I loved her honesty, courage and humor. This book made me do some soul searching. Her hairdresser insights were right on target as far as I am concerned. This was an amazing first novel. I hope Ms. Cleage decides to right more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, by Far the Absolute Best Book Ever Written","review":"I have never enjoyed reading a book this much. My mother, grandmother and I all read it and it reaches out to all people and all generations. I've read it three times and it's still wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I have read in a while","review":"I have read a lot of books lately, but I must say that this was one of the most entertaining in a long time. The plot combined a balance of happy feel-good themes with things as gravely serious as dealing with HIV. The humor throughout the book kept me smiling until the last page. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Characters","review":"Although this book was a pretty easy read, I was impressed that the characters seemed so real. The subject of HIV is one most people do not want to even broach. I enjoyed the love story between two unlikely characters. However, I was most impressed that Pearl Cleage choice Idlwild, Michigan as the setting of this story of devastation, love, and hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest, thought provoking look at HIV","review":"This book gives one the feel of finding someones diary and secretly reading each page. Thoughts, feelings, and ideas are expressed candidly and as such, beckons the reader to want to know more about this character. This is an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real-\\"It Could Probably happen to me\\" Stuff. You Go Pearl!","review":"Pearle Cleage wrote this for the love that is needed in this day and age. Putting it in true context that black men want to, and do love black women. Family is important and it needs to be celebrated. Thank you so much Pearl for this novel giving a rounded look at the lives of black america. Not a one sided blindfolded look."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's just not enough there...","review":"to appreciate the characters in this book. I was told there would be moments in this book where I would \\"laugh out loud.\\" That didn't happen. Fortunately, the book was short but unfortunately, it may have been better if the characters had been developed better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted more after I finished reading the last page.","review":"I am very familar with Pearl Cleage writings, this is one lady that writes from examples of life experiences. After reading this book I didn't want to image that I could have been Ada living through this horrific situation. Honestly speaking Ms. Cleage did a wonderful job of expressing a black man and black woman having a beautiful relationship, over coming insercurities and keeping the lines of communications flowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Despite the occasional pithy vernacular, I found the writing of this book to be stilted and ungraceful. The author spells out every thought, every emotion -- as though the reader has no imagination! Perhaps this is because Ms. Cleage is primarily a playwright, and therefore cannot rely on actors to explain the characters' sentiments. There is nothing subtle about this book. Predictable characters, cliche ending. I was disappointed, and happy to see it come to an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read!","review":"I really liked this one! I would have given it more stars but it fell off toward the end, leaving too many ends untied. Earlier in the novel, the reader was led to believe that the Good Reverend was abusing his grandson but that issue was never fully addressed. Ava experienced her first AIDS-related symptom- and then what happened?? What happened with Imani? Did Aretha get the scholarship? I enjoyed the story but I felt that Ava's character could have been fleshed out a bit more- i knew her story but i never felt like I truly knew HER and what made her do the things she did. I know Pearl's work and I think its fantastic. This was good, too. I just think it could have been a little better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad book, but....","review":"I wasn't impressed with this book at all. I read the book after reading positive reviews here, but I was pretty disappointed. I don't know, maybe I was looking a little more depth to the story. I finished the book and was left wondering \\"That's it?\\" The story is about a woman w/HIV, so I thought it'd be an \\"issue book w/a msg\\", but the storyline was very simple. Not boring or bad, just simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"compelling realism that pulls heart strings & funny bones","review":"this lady doesn't write stories, she has you so drawn in that you feel as though you are living the life of the characters, like you know them personally, like you can feel their heart beat. This story was a charmer of a most delicate matter. God must have had his orchestral hand resting on the shoulder of this most creative author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Void of substance and throughly unrealistic","review":"I will give the author the benefit of the doubt, because making the switch from playwright to fiction author is very difficult, however, Every thing about this story was totally unrealistic. One would assume that to choose a subject like AIDS, one must have something to say, or some kind of commentary to make. She made none. Ava was as passive about her disease as if she had the flu. Some aspects of the story had over explination, while most didn't have nearly enough. Her concepts did not flow in one seemless motion, they were broken and sporatic. I had met Eddie in a hundred other books before this one. It was cliche, predictable and a chore to read. The characters were underdeveloped. This is a much longer story that the author made it. With some pratice however, she just might make a significant literary contribution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story to lift up your soul!","review":"I found Pearl Cleage's novel romanticly predictable yet so nourishing to the soul. Each page lifted my spirits even in the mist of heartache. I was captivated by Ava's transformation,learning to live each moment and learning to love herself through her relationship with those who loved her, then seeing her live that love by how she gave to others. My favorite symbol is Aretha's haircut! Wouldn't it be wonderful if the world followed the way of Idlewild?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, serious and unexpected.","review":"I found this book very entertaining. I loved her writing style she shocked you right off the bat with the language. I found myself cheering on the good guys and glad to see the preachers wife put in her place. Things aren't always as they appear. And I loved Eddie!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY REALISTIC, A MUST READ............","review":"This short novel was by far one of he best books I have ever read! It shows us,the reader,the reality of today's youth and the hardships that they face.I highly recommend this book to everyone !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy as a Fox!","review":"I liked this book. I usually don't buy thin books because I have found that character and storyline development is usually woefully sacrificed. Not so the case here. This one really draws you into the story. I found myself nodding my head and even laughing out loud at some of Ava's sharp and witty remarks. I don't know if I'd call it a must read, but it's pretty damn close. There are a lot of heavy topics and situations in this book, however, it is balanced with quite a bit of humor and optimism. Get it, read it, you'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soporific","review":"It was hard for me to get into the story because it never really went anywhere. I was unable to feel empathy for the characters because it never got to the point where I actually cared about them. They were faceless blurs on a page with bad histories that never were quite redeemed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another depressing Oprah pick","review":"Because I like Oprah, I keep trying her \\"picks,\\" and, invariably (so far, hope springs eternal) I end up feeling I've been had by hype. The characters in this book seem disengaged from their own problems. It's as if the author threw in a \\"readimix\\" of contemporary issues to get our attention, then copped out on developing the characters' relationships with those issues. The book's too short; the author doesn't finish telling her story. (What happened to the good old days of long, luxuriant reads?) Maybe my problem is I'm not black, fat, or abused. But, surely Oprah must realize not EVERYONE in her audience IS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I really enjoyed this. It was about overcoming the rotten people, things, and situations in life. It's about living your life to the fullest however long or short and loving unconditionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sub-culturally sobering, yet entertainigly educational!","review":"I must admit although I did not read the book word for word, I did listen to the audio tape, nonstop. Pearl Cleage reads the story herself with such a pleasant reading voice, that you feel as though her storytelling is like she were right there in the room with you. Waiting to Exhale & Terry McMillan fans should seriously consider discovering a higher plane through Pearl Cleage's writing talents if they haven't already. She doesn't leave much for you to unpuzzle, she tells her story smoothly, fat-free, and unsweetened. What Looks like Crazy on an Ordinary Day: made me feel like starting on my own personal anthology of the perks and perils of variated segments of my life. Thank you Pearl Cleage, you've just earned a fan for life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"This was my book club's pick for November. If you are interested in a nice love story with a message about society...this is the one for you. It brings out another side of the HIV/AIDS story as well as provides a focus on what really matters in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed, Cried, Loved it!","review":"This is a wonderful book. The author covers very serious subjects in a manner that anyone can relate to and needs to relate to in todays world. I had a hard time putting this book down! The main character has a wonderful sense of where she was and where she is going even though I didn't think this until the end. I found this book to be enlighting, entertaining and just a very enjoyable look at subjects that can be hard to look at. I remember as I read this thinking to myself \\"I never thought of it that way\\" or \\"that sums it up quite correctly\\". I also found that as I read this I could relate as a woman to her struggles and views on all subjects that are covered in this book. For one who is looking for a book to entertain you and make you feel like you have accomplished something I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensitive subject, honest writing","review":"This book discusses a very sensitive subject, AIDS, from a humerous and honest point of view and kept me laughing and crying along with the characters. I felt these people were friends of mine and really spoke their mind, rather than edited thoughts.This black family reunited in a difficult time pulls through, together."},{"rating":"2","title":"ultra cool book","review":"HIV positive Ava Johnson decides to pay a visit to her sister and the town she grew up in before she heads to San Francisco to start life afresh and anonymous. However, things don't go according to plan, and she soon discovers that it's better to come home late, than not at all.The book is never \\"woe is me, 'cos I've got HIV\\" it's smarter than that. There's plenty of characters to like, a few to make you angry and a few to make you cry. All in all, a great book that keeps you thinking about Ava way after the book is finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book opens your eyes in an enlightening way.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It shows how our chosen paths can lead to change. Pearl writes how the spirit of the characters survived through the crossroads that they pass through. Hope, family, and friendships ultimately prevail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double standard when writing about race","review":"As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it. If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is An Inspiration To Women Everywhere","review":"This book is an inspiration to women everywhere. It is a no frills cinderella story about Oprah Winfrey's life. It begins in her early childhood where her mother struggles with taking on the role of mother when she is no more then a child herself.The author takes you through Oprah's difficult childhood, where she is abandoned by both mother and father. You can't help but smile at the toughness of this character and how she learns to rise above her difficult circumstances.I recommend this book for anyone who likes a feel good story that is not sugar coated."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's All the Excitement About???","review":"Both the performances and the technical quality of the recording are good with one glaring exception for the latter. The horns are somewhat muffeled and the cymbals are practically non-existant. The high end just isn't there. Very disappointing. I'm not surprised, though, given that it's a Telarc, the most over rated record label out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD is Defective","review":"After it plays the first three tracks, I get an error message and none of the next four tracks will play. If the cost of returning this were less, I would do so. As it is, I will just bite the bullet and throw out the CD. Such a shame... such terrific music."},{"rating":"2","title":"best pan","review":"Great pan for roasting veggies. Can roast lots of them without crowding for fabulous browning, even at high temps. Absolutely no warping. Really easy to clean. Worth the money. I work in a housewares store which sells the reversible griddle from this company.

It is not long before the crew encounters a powerful race of machines known as the Borg. The Enterprise is nearly destroyed but Q intervenes in the nick of time. However the lesson is plainly obvious:there are some things in outer space humanity is not prepared for,but Picard knows the Borg will return. This is one of the better episodes of the second season and serves as a prequel to season three's THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS.This episode has everything:Action, humor,drama and serious discussion on the human condition.I heartily recommend that everyone interested in good science fiction buy this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Night at the Opera","review":"It might not be the \\"best whodunnit ever written\\", it is not even the best one in this series either, but it is a good mistery, nice and easy to read, with a very funny & enjoyable \\"grand finale\\" that reminds us of the Marx Brothers at \\"A Night at the Opera\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"So & so...","review":"If you expect something as good as the \\"In Concert\\" productions such as CHESS or LES MISERABLES, you'd better think it twice. Voices are wonderful; yet, the production is average, Mr. Michael York's comments throughout the whole concert on the events that are supposed to happen on stage (but you don't see) are quite disappointing. The point is that you don't have the whole production: it's a sort of sypnopsis of the play which include some of the best songs but, in general, it lacks the splendour and magnificence of previous \\"in concert\\" productions. In other words, it looks to me as something rather poor. Not really impressive, really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but remember, it's a concert","review":"This concert reminded me of the Tenth Anniversary Concert of Les Miserables. The actors are amazing, but it isn't the complete musical. That being said, it still moved me to tears a couple of times because of the superb way the actors (James Barbour in particular) play their roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Barbour Shines as Sydney Carton","review":"This costumed concert performance is an excellent demonstration of the music and plot of the popular Broadway show \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\". It must have been a wonderful show to see during it's run.The book and score are good, and the cast is great. Every actor is spot-on, and their beautiful voices are top notch. There is something exceptional about the show's lead, James Barbour. Whenever he enters a scene you forget you're watching a show and get caught up in the story. And then he sings. It is not exaggeration to opine that there have been few such magnificent voices.The story, by Dickens, rings gloriously through this production. And the end of the show -- very faithful to the source material -- is as powerful as the end of the book. (If you know the book, you understand what high praise that is.) It's rapturous."},{"rating":"1","title":"just a boring dude talking about the making of the musical","review":"i thought it was the actual musical, but i guess im just dumb. it has some clips of the musical and stuff but thats not what i was expecting"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book, very well written","review":"I found the writing to be first rate.

But all of the Magnum's are great, even more so now that the Wahabi have turned me into a blood-thirsty Hawk. Why don't they make shows like Magnum P.I. anymore! So You Think You Can Dance, American Idol; if it weren't for the Ultimate Fighter I'd bust my t.v. And Bravo; please! But back to the point at hand: the butler on that great Magnum P.I. episode was Roscoe Lee Browne! Yeah, I knew you'd remember!

The portrayal of the time period and racism in the South is spot on. After changing grade levels and moving to literature, I now use this as a better viewing choice after reading \\"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\\". There are parallel story lines, and the setting is the comparable. I am thankful that I remembered this as a Hallmark Movie called \\"A Father for Charlie\\" back in the day. It is a great teaching tool and well worth the classroom time it takes to view."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD High Lonesome","review":"I looked for this movie for a long time.

There's something wrong with this picture when a kid has to stand up for what's right, because not a single grown adult will. The boy Charlie probably wouldn't have changed though, had Walter \\"Gossett\\" not gone out of his way to be nice to him, unlike his drunk worthless father. All the actors are very believable with their rolls and Joseph Mazzello gives a heartwrenching performance as usual. Actually I watched this film after seeing \\"The Cure,\\" \\"another movie starring Mazzello about prejudisim,\\" because he's such an excellent and emotional actor. I hadn't really payed attention to the credits before watching \\"High Lonesome\\" and the whole entire time I thought the father was Patrick Swayze.

Over the course of a week, Megan tries to get time alone with Matt to tell him her news. Unfortunately, two annoying house guests, a sister having a nervous breakdown, and babysitting a \\"pink tyrant\\" of a niece leave little time for the couple. Will they keep the baby or won't they?

However, this book is bona fide chick lit, pure and simple, and chick lit is NOT the place to tackle the whole abortion issue. I felt like I was reading some sort of bi-polar adventure where everyone's interactions are funny and escapist, but the real plot of the story is dark, anxious, and offensive.

After discovering \\"Grammar in Use,\\" I was finally relieved of the agony of bad books.\\"Grammar in Use\\" (intermediate) can be used with all levels of students, less those just beginning the study of English. It's concise and easily understood to the point that many students can use it on their own.

After a climatic stampede and some expected declarations of love, Samantha and her cowboy live happily ever after.While it's pretty ordinary fare for a young adult romance, this novel has some interesting insight into the Civil War, though brief. It's also a fun adventure of cattle driving and there is of course the precursory romance. While it is rather unbelievable that a teenage girl could convince a group of cowboys that she's a he and the cowboy lifestyle is a great deal cleaned up from what it actually was, this book is still good for teenage girls looking for something with adventure and romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice, good read","review":"Samantha Jane and her family are living on debt.

This group breathes new life into these songs, by \\"jazzin\\" up some of the arrangements. In addition to the brass, guitar, keyboards, bass, and drums are added to some of the tracks, which makes these arrangements even more believable. The highlight of this album is Mass, because Rolf Smedvig and crew are more suited to classical stuff.I picked this up because of the players on the album, and the arrangements were surprisingly good!

Unfortunately, the power light goes off too so you can't tell if it's still running, then it takes a few seconds to come back on when you try to access the drive.

Family aren't concerned with genres here, they're too busy breaking through them to notice! \\"Drowned In Wine\\" crosses back and forth beween folk and hard rock, \\"Love Is a Sleeper\\" is augmented by intense guitar licks, and \\"The Cat and The Rat\\" is pure rockabilly boogie. The title song is the nastiest, heaviest nine-minute piece of music ever committed to tape. Roger Chapman and Charlie Whitney came up with unortohdox arrangemnets for their songs, and drummer Rob Townsend anchors them wonderfully!

However, I feel I was mislead or had higher expectations. The box advertised 9ft x 9 ft. Once blown up the jumping area only measured 5 ft 6 inches. I measured every which was to find out where the 9 ft by 9ft came from. The only way I got even over an 8 ft measurement was when the castle was laid completely flat on the ground. Also, the side walls are pretty low. There was just enough room inside the castle for my 2 kids, who each weigh less than 45 pounds. I can't imagine 3 kids in the castle and noone getting hurt.I am glad many people enjoyed this product, but I am returning mine. I would recommend splurging for bounce houses that cost $50 - $75 more and getting a larger jump space. Lastly, the side of the castle only has a 5 ft. wall that easily collapses when jumped upon.

This time the store said they would check the contents before bringing over a new motor. When the 3rd motor was delivered it looked \\"beat up\\" but was intact and did work. The gentleman who searched for the replacement and made the delivery said there were several more boxes with damaged motors in them.

If you enjoy his shorter works, you'll be thrilled by this, his only foray into longer concert music. Even it's not that long for a concerto, but it's almost twenty minutes of pure Anderson brilliance---even the second, supposedly andante, movement is lively and fun.It's just too bad that Anderson himself did not record his concerto during his lifetime, since a comparison of his recordings of his shorter works to recordings done with other conductors leaves little doubt that his own vision of the concerto would have been even more dazzling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murs makes Living Legends proud!","review":"Murs is back with his forever pounding sound.

Adam told me and others that he was related to Harrison Ford, and I saw no mention of this in the book. Could this be one reason for the gag order? Just Curious."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Absolutely awful. The author begins with a treatise justifying true crime writing in such a defensive posture that the reader wonders just what happened to this guy, whose previous books, while not top notch, were adequate for the genre.He then relates in extra-excruciating detail his attempts to gain access to records he should know are not available to the public. Then he denigrates all of the uncooperative officials who were just doing their job by following the letter of the law.There follows an incredibly incomplete description of the principals. The only person to get a break is the defendant. If I had seen the words \\"brain damage\\" supposedly caused by a period of unconsciousness caused by a routine auto accident one more time, I would have screamed out loud, and at length.Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.....","review":"Right off the bat you learn that this book is going to be incomplete and boring, due to the fact that the case has not yet gone to trial and a judge placed a gag order on all information and legal documents relating to this case. The author spends a lot of time making assumptions about the crimes as he has no access to any of the official documents and spends an inordinate amount of time trying to make a case for brain damage of the perpetrator due to an accident he sustained prior to the murders. It would have been a good book if he had waited until the case was dispensed and actually had some information to share."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing true crime novel!","review":"I am an absolute fan of the true crime genre, but this book takes the cake as the worst true crime book that I have read. The bulk of this book is spent criticizing (implicity and explicitly) the police and government - NOT for failing to stop a serial murderer, but for failing to give the author documents that he felt he was entitled to. Moreover, the sympathetic justifications for Wayne Ford's atrocities was a bit too much to bear.A true journalist would not let his own views taint the story that he is trying to tell. I don't think that I would rush to read another book by Carlton Smith anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $6.99!","review":"As with most of the other reviewers, I cannot believe that I paid for this book. The entire book blames the police, prosecutors and anyone else for the crimes of this man. He is not a criminal...he is mentally ill, as is anyone else in the book who does drugs, shoplifts, etc. It is a diatrabe against the death penalty also. When reading a true crime book, I do NOT want to be subject to the views of the author...just the facts, thank you. Rest assured I will never waste any money on another book by Carlton Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This was one of the worse true crime books I have read. Normally I do not feel the need to review books but in this case I am compelled because the book is based on nothingness. It repeatedly tells the reader that everything is under a gag order or deleted so there really is no story here.... just pages and pages of disclaimers and citations to motions that have had all the \\"meat\\" deleted. Kinda makes you go, huh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for converting theory to SPSS mechanics","review":"I've found this book extremely helpful in understanding how to set up the kinds of analysis in SPSS that I want to conduct. I have the theoretical understanding to design the experiment and know what analyses need to be conducted (and could do it by hand if I had to), but this books helps me understand how to efficiently analyze my data within the program itself.

Further, the sources she cites are, in my opinion, not the best ones she could be using. I would venture a guess that she didn't know anything about snake keeping prior to writing this book. Other info in the book is downright wrong such as when she says that probing a snake (to determine sex) is \\"not always conclusive\\"; in fact this is the only conclusive way to sex a snake. In general, I found that the book skipped around on subjects too much and seems to be written more for younger readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful and humorous for the inexperinced snake enthusiast","review":"I thought that this was a pretty good book. It was informative with a bit of humor at the same time. The way that the book was written speaks to the average layperson, not the know-it-all herpetologist, unlike other snake books. I thought that it was a little cheesy to include stuff about lizards because the book is 99 percent snake. It was a good read and I'd suggest it to the general public to clear up common snake misconceptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"good info in easy to read format","review":"This book was very easy to read with lots of good, fun and interesting facts/tidbits etc. Very laid back style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent movie -- Horrid english dubbing","review":"The voice actors who dubbed this obviously didn't know what the characters were saying, they just made up stuff on the fly.

Habitat for Humanity is with us today because the founder had a chance encounter with Clarence Jordan. Clarence Jordan was a one man ensemble: he walked Jesus, talked Jesus, lived Jesus, and wrote Jesus. Clarence Jordan integrated a farm in Georgia in the 1940's and lived to write about it. This book is not the farm experience, but this book comes out of Jordan's attempt to live the Sermon on the Mount on that farm. Before any other American public figure of the 20th Century, Jordan should be declared a Saint! Read this book and believe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sermon on the Mount","review":"Clarence Jordan did an outstanding job of dealing with this timeless message. He emphasizes the graphic teaching style of Jesus in a way that causes the material to snap into clear focus. For example, we learn that the word 'hraca' (Mt. 5.22) is not some obscure form of derision (RSV note), but rather the sound of a man preparing to spit! That's graphic, and it makes the teaching understandable. Dr. Jordan's approach to the scripture makes obvious what other commentators have obscured.In short, this is an outstanding book that is worth exploring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rascal and Susie show children how to make moral decisions.","review":"I like this children's book because it uses fantasy (which appeals to a child's imagination) to bring up very real issues. The book is very readable. Each chapter is a different episode in Rascal's life, and can easily be read as a bedtime story-one chapter each night. Or a child with basic reading skills can sit down and read the book alone. If you are looking for a book that will keep the interest of a child you care for, and will teach morality in a Biblical and fun way, this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Look no more: This is it.","review":"Star Tracks is an absolute must. Wonderfully performed by the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra, it brings out the guts from all the music in movies we've heard countless times. To all people who has an musical ear: you'll notice this particular album has the perfect tempo and the right choice of instrument tracks and volumes. I've looked elsewhere with complilation albums such as John Williams' Greatest Hits or the Star Wars soundtrack (which they were performed by other symphonies such as London, Skywalker or Boston Pops); they just don't match the brillance of the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra. In addition, since this symphony is not conducted by John Williams (Erich Kunzel takes the helm here), this permits to perform Alexander Courage's Star Trek TV series from the 60s and it is a rare gem. Beleive me: it's a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All-time Greatest Movie Scores on 1 CD","review":"I agree with 'a music fan'. This is a must have for a complete John Williams greatest hits list.

It's not the set, but just the way it is with LCDs and non-HDTV channels. The sound is not so great, but when I want to watch a game, I plug in other speakers. I think for the money, this set is excellent.One warning though. If you have a problem with it, good luck getting service with Samsung. I have a DVD recorder which died after installing the latest firmware to fix a problem with choppy video. I've called several times, but I keep getting the \\"we're experiencing an unusual volume of calls\\" message (yeah sure). I've emailed service twice, and have yet to get a response.

I specifically bought this set because of the other reviews I have read about its ability to show non-HD channels in great quality. It didn't disappoint. My friend owns a 46\\" Sharp Aquos and I can honestly say I didn't like the way the regular channels came out on it.

I bought this TV brand new from Amazon on January 10th 2007. I was very amazed since it was my first LCD TV. At first it worked very nicely, although I had some problems searching for signals for the DVD and the VCR. After two months owning this TV the picture went black, only sound and no picture. I called SAMSUNG and took it to repair. After 2 months, they told me that the LCD PANEL was burned and the PCB main was not working. I live in Caracas, Venezuela and since I bought it in the USA, the warranty is useless. I just lost the money invested.

After litterally reading all of the reviews I decided to take a chance. Turns out it was the best thing I ever bought online. I ordered late Saturday and received it Thursday. The picture w/ my newly bought Samsung upconverting 5-disc changer w/ SRS is great. SD programming isn't bad either. I'm planning to get HD programming, but still trying to find the best deal.

I view these marks as a sign of the low quality of the case. (see one of the other reviews for a similar comment)I just bought the Panasonic pro-curve 8092.

Unfortunately, their quality is proportional to their cost. I got the masks to filter out the dust of scoopable cat litter. The masks filter out some dust but, even after adjustment and trying multiple positions for the mask & head strap, they do not fit snugly to my face and so allow dust through spaces between my face and the mask. I've also noticed that, even when the mask is fitted more snugly than usual to my face, the litter dust comes through the mask to the point where it's visible around my nose after I take off the mask. The mask does filter out some dust. My asthma hasn't been as bad with the masks as without. However, the masks allow enough dust through that I'm still smelling and tasting it while scooping the litter.

The outside was crispy and delicious and the meat couldn't have been more tender. Just tonight I tried my hand at baked potatoes after reading in the instruction manual that you can make them in the unit. 4 potatoes at 1 1:2, it's as though they were cooked on the barbecue wrapped in tin foil. Absolutely amazing. The unit itself is relatively easy to clean. I found that the spit required some soaking before the food remnants loosened from it but that's no big deal.

Those songs fit in with the songs from their debut album. Everything after song 2 is a big disappointment & Im sure has alienated alot of their growing fanbase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Amazon.com recommended I would like this CD, so I went and bought it.

Taproot seems to have taken Layne Staley's(RIP) mission to continue it and succeed in bringing a haunting mix of energy and harmony.Standout tracks are \\"Art\\", \\"Like\\" and \\"Sumtimes\\" but all other tracks are great too.

I figured they would go soft and break away from the nu-metal trend as everybody else was doing and take a Deftones approach to their music. Well I'm not really sure what they did but I really didn't like their sophmore effort, still they created a unique sound and if you like punk/alternative style music then this is for you but if your into more of a heavier sound it's not worth buying, \\"dreams\\" in my opinion is the only other song worth listening to if you really liked the first album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very sad dissapointment","review":"Taproot was my favorite band for quite some time after their release of Gift. Gift is one of my favorite albumns of all time. For years I was waiting for Taproot to come out with a new albumn. My expectations were set pretty high when I bought Welcome. I was horrified to find out that Taproot had gone soft. They were much better before they were so well-known, back when Gift was around. Welcome is completely pop.. it's horrible. If you don't own any Taproot albumns, I highly recommend that you get Gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda ...","review":"The only fabulous song on this CD is the single which is Poem. The rest of the songs are mediocre and boring. Some of the other songs are good.

I adore this cd. Too bad the follow up was so blah, because they were onto something here..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen Again !!!","review":"I completely disagree with those that don't like this CD. I didn't like it at first and thought it was way too mellow for my taste, but after listening to it a few more times, I really love it. These are extremely good musicians, and that most definitely includes the singer. It doesn't hurt that the lyrics are well worth listening to as well. I'm glad I paid no attention to the negative reviews posted here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid CD, better then Gift","review":"First, this CD is not any softer then their first CD Gift. The main difference is when they do play soft, they do it for an entire song rather then just for part of it. Another improvement over Gift is the fact that all the songs don't sound the same on Welcome. Taproot as definitely matured in their sound, but retained their edge and still have one of the best singers in rock music today. I agree with a previous review that stated that Taproot sounds more \\"together\\" in this record. Some of the transitions were strange, and just didn't flow well. Fortunately, no such problems exist here. Just solid hard rock tunes that any rock fan should enjoy. If you are a fan of older Taproot stuff, or really like the stuff you may have heard from them on the radio, I would certainly recommend adding Welcome to your CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic - Huge Thumbs Up!!","review":"This record is a nice progression from 'Gift'. If you are a true lover of metal at it's heaviest with a mixture of melodic harmonies and gut-wrenching roars, this is the album for you. The vocal work is outstanding, along with the intricate and interesting musicianship dispalyed by the rest of the band. I am well impressed with this record, already being a big fan of the band. Remember people, change is good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh..","review":"What happened!?!? Gift WAS a lot better... and as a reviewer said they are kind of following in Nonpoint's footsteps..nowhere even close to their old heavyness--instead, that heaviness has been replaced by annoying harmonizing in almost every single song and simply put a lack of quality. Even in their hit song \\"Poem\\" it's easy to see that they've lost a lot of what made them an awesome band. For now, everyone who hasn't heard Gift, check out \\"Again & Again\\" and \\"I\\". Sorry Taproot...loved your guys's old stuff, but I'm not diggin the whole getting softer thing. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Bedtime Music","review":"I used to be such a sick fan of taproot, but then came welcome. Basically I have found that the CD sounds like a softer sounding Tool which is HORRIBLE. Taproot's first CD was aggressive, innovative, and perfect front to back. This CD has one great song, POEM and everyone knew that from the single. The rest of the album is SO soft, stephen decided to scream about once every 3 songs, what happened. I seriously wanted to cry the first time I ran through this album, I wanted to throw up. I waited about 2 years for this disc and its so bad that I am not even anticipating their next release. THE SINGLE WORST FOLLOW UP ALBUM I have ever heard. Go back to your roots guys. People are going to go to the concert and have to wave CANDLES in the air instead of banging their head and moshing to death, seriously though. The songs are that weak. See for yourself but do not waste your money. Out"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I wouldnt even rate this a one but I have to give it something. I was very disappointed with this cd.

I am sad to say however that their style changed on \\"welcome\\". unlike many fans, this album does not make me dislike them or anything of that sort because they really do have a lot of talent. however, \\"gift\\" is a much better albulm and i sincerely wish they would have made something a little more similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just give Taproot a chance","review":"I have been a Taproot fan for a long time. In fact, some people in my school call me \\"Taproot\\" and only know of Taproot through the apparel of them I wear. Because of Welcome, Taproot's newest CD, I will continue to be a Taproot fan and wear my TR clothing with a sense of pride. When I first got the album I only liked tracks one and two, I thought the rest were pretty bad. Then I listened to the rest of it a few more times, and just like Gift something just popped and I started loving it. Track 9 is one of the coolest songs around and every other song minus Trk 3 are awsome as well. Who ever said that it is a lot like KoRn's Untouchables is 100% right. It is definatly something different then what you are used to, but give it a chance and you'll end up loving it like me, unless you don't like Taproot, then you shouldn't buy this of course.

I ignored the \\"Explicit\\" warning, which for me, probably meant more intense lyrics. What a letdown this album was. I ended up selling it at Half Price Books less than a year later and not because I was broke, either...there are only two songs that stand out. \\"Poem\\" and \\"When\\" are the two I chose to download on iTunes, meaning the rest of the album lacked musical punch; did not have any catchy melodies; and was certainly difficult to listen to for any length of time. At least Cinderella wowed the American stage with one great album (\\"Night Songs\\") and a follow-up single; Taproot will end up being just another one-hit wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, Taproot never disappoints","review":"Taproot is currently one of my fav bands and have been since there 1st release, Gift- was amazing, however it took me a few listens like most new bands to get use to, then it just clicks, and you are like \\"WOW, that's good stuff\\" upon my 1st listen to welcome i was disappointed cuz it sounded a lot of softer and just different compared to gift. then it clicked and i realized that greatness this albumn possess as well. mine, poem, everything, myself, breathe, dreams, and time are my favs....but i like it all, more i listen to it the more i think Welcome is better then gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I really do like this cd, regardless of what anyones says.

Taproot has evolved, becoming more melodic and not quite as hard. Don't get me wrong, I was slightly disappointed when I picked this CD up and I wondered where the old Taproot went. But then I started getting hooked on the riffs and vocals of this CD, which can only be called a masterpiece. Reminds me a lot of some of Alice in Chains ground-breaking albums. If you're a Taproot fan, this album will grow on you, but if you aren't open-minded, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Cd","review":"This CD shows just how much Taproot has grown since their last album. I love their Gift CD, I listen to it at least once a week if not more, and this Welcome is a more ornate and sophisticated sequal to gift.

I loved gift, especially again and again, smile, and comeback, and whats really cool is that on one of the tracks on this cd, they mix in a little 3 second blurb of the chorus from again and again. very creative cd, i love mike's heaviness on guitar, (i believe he tunes down to A...jesus thats low) the bass is incredible, drums are on point, and the vocals just blow me away. i find myself walkin around school singing these songs. they arent poppy, but this record is a little bit more \\"radio friendly\\" than gift. buy this cd if you love to bang your head!"},{"rating":"1","title":"well.....","review":"Well, personally, im the kind of guy that hears a couple songs and buys the cd's(cheap though).

Some songs, like fault, did catch my attention. but nothing too special. overall, a below average cd, so if your thinking of getting it, get a used one or just download Poem."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did they do????","review":"Taprrot were one of the biggest hopes in new/alternative metal. they were heavy and creative. now they want to sound like alice in chains or creed. nothing special, just boring and bad is this. 2 stars for the good songs POEM, LIKE and DREAMS."},{"rating":"1","title":"heard it all before","review":"The operative word here is \\"derivative.\\" Their name is appropriate because they certainly \\"tap\\" the \\"roots\\" of bands that went before them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reasons Why","review":"i'd like to start out saying that i knew this cd was supposed to sound different from gift. mission accomplished.however, they took on a second mission that was really just a part of the first one and it failed miserably. they tried to completely recreate themselves. i am listening to this cd now, trying to get into it, and much like the new mudvayne, it's just not working.i was thinking this would be a truly outstanding cd because, just one month before, i caught them in minneapolis and all the new stuff was absolutely amazing and i was moshing with the rest of them. i guess the songs all gain something in the live translation...thus, i was disappointed by the album. how can one that sounds so perfect live sound like it does on this album? i'm disappointed, but hoping for a return to form from this talented quartet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"When some guy in here said \\"TOOL, beware!\\" it honestly made me laugh out loud.

Taproot doesn't even sound like the same band. They seem to have lost their unique heavy sound that made you want to get up and JUMP! There is only one song on this cd that has that old taproot sound (poem) and that's about it. There are a few catchy songs, but not many. The cd is real slow paced...First of all, the cd isn't heavy... The drumming that was so impressive on \\"gift\\" is now gone, the super-tight guitar riffs are gone, and to add to the huge disapointment are the vocals. The vocals on \\"gift\\" were nothing less than amazing. What happened!!! The singer hardly even screams on this cd, and when he does scream they sound very distant.\\"Welcome\\" is a very forgetable release. I find it to be a chore trying to get through the entire cd in a single listening. If you're a hardcore Taproot fan you will understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I have been a fan of Taproot since I heard their first single \\"Again and Again.\\" I picked up their first cd, \\"Gift,\\" on the first day it came out and I loved it. They have such a unique style. After seeing them play live a few times, I was anxiously awaiting the day that they would release a new album. Again, I bought this cd on the first day it came out, but I was extremely disappointed this time. I was hoping for some great hard rock melodies, but instead got mediocre, soft, boring melodies. I tried as hard as I could to like the cd, I even kept it in my cd rotation for a week or two, but finally gave up...extremely disappointed. The songs still sound okay live, but I just can't listen to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great second album","review":"Although their first album rocked hard, with loud crunchy riffs and songs anyone could relate to in some way or another, their second album shows the band maturing.

I bought it to get a general idea of Corb's work, not because it fascinated me, but, as an architecture graduate, because I thought I should. This book opened Corb's work to me.It gives a chronological view of the man's life and work. It features great photos and drawings of his most important works, and some of his less well known ones too. The writing is done so well, giving an insight into Corb's theories and explaining how and why each project came about.I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in architecture who wants to know a bit more about the history of 20th century design, and the impact that Le Corbusier had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"This toy is just awful.

It is as good as I expected it to be, from what I had heard. I see that the tone of the Steve Martin film was very similar to the original version. The actresses in the latter were obviously chosen to resemble those in the television series. Bob Hoskins has \\"Got That Certain Something\\" that nobody could imitate, lower keyed but just as fanatical and delusional as Martin.

I'm a fan of the period music which forms the soundtrack, so perhaps that prejudices me, but I think that, even if you don't know much about hot dance music of the '30's, you'll find yourself loving it very soon. The concept of the series is quirky, but it doesn't take long to find yourself mesmerized by the stunningly drawn characters, the dark plot line, the amazing production values and.....the music.

We believed that this would be the only recording of that piece that we would listen to. Now that this piece is on CD (courtesy of Moscow Studio Archives) I'm very glad that I can hear a better sound for this. This is an ultimate (and under-appreciated) performance that holds true to the composer's intended atmospheres. To me, no other conductor comes close to Svetlanov (especially Carlo Maria Guilini; he takes it way too slow) and no other orchestra can bring out such passion and power. The only other orchestra that comes close is the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (with Yuri Temirkanov).Along with \\"Songs & Dances of Death,\\" \\"The Capture of Kars,\\" and a selection from \\"Khovanshchina,\\" this should be a great buy for all Mussorgsky fans.

The Lansinoh logo at the top of the bag seems to be melted to the other side of the bag, and when I pull it apart (which is hard to do) it stretches the plastic in that area. It seems like the printing process for the logo had too much heat or something. Could just be one batch with this problem. A couple have actually torn as I was pulling them open.

Only problem was that I had to cover the shipping over and back and if I wanted to make sure it actually got there, needed to also pay for insurance and tracking.

The best way to get rid of the plastic taste is to boil water and pour it into the tank and flush it out through the spout. After I did a gallon of hot water, the taste went away. The tank is small so after you dispense 2 cups of cold water, the fan comes on. I'm sure in the summer you will run out of cold water quickly if you have several people using it.

Could not put a tank on top as the water would just drain out of the dispenser. This was about a month after amazon's return window had expired. Was told by amazon rep that i had to contact the manufacturer. Manufacturor will replace it, but I have to pay to return AND recieve a new one.

Never could get the taste gone. Plugged the unit in and 10 minutes later heard a little sizzle and a popping noise and then the smell of burnt wires. Customer service was horrid. Was told I would have to ship back to manufacturer. Finally gave up and threw the unit away.

Before you use this for the first time you will need to rince out the inside of the dispenser with a water/baking soda mixture, otherwise you'll end up with your drinking water tasting awful. It does take a while for the dispenser to cool the water, but all in all I recommend this for those that will use it for 2-4 people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product, Horrible Plastic Taste","review":"This little cooler looks nice, but it is made very cheaply. The knobs feel like they are going to break off in your hand. More importantly, I tried for months and months to get the initial plastic taste out and it has not diminished at all. The taste is so strong and overwhelming, it made me sick to my stomach after just drinking one cup. I tried boiling water, vinegar, lemon juice, and just plain using it for months. The plastic taste and small has not changed at all. Replaced it this weekend with another brand, and first cup out of the new cooler had no plastic taste at all! Terrible purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes a while to get cold again after use.","review":"The first one of these I bought was defective - I would never shut off the cooling cycle and the \\"cold\\" light would never come on.

We figured a new one would last us another few years, so we placed the order.After flushing the system to remove the plastic taste, I plugged in the unit and within 10 seconds, I heard a \\"POP\\" and the smell of burning wires. The unit now does not work. If it did, I would not use it as it could very well be a fire hazard. Imagine if this thing melted down while we were away from the home. The legacy of cheap Chinese products is still alive and well.By the way, no water bottle came with this unit, even though one is pictured on the box. Caveat Emptor.

To see Emma Frost as a teenager was great. This one the other hand is just stupid.Emma finds a guy whose in trouble with the boston mob, and they get kidnapped and blah, blah, blah.This story did not need 6 issues. Its too long and way stretched out, By issue 3, i was begging for it to end. Its just keeps going on and on and on.Not only that, this series was supposed to show emma's life in her early years, volume one did a great job but volume two, who cares, i felt like the plot was just so unimportant. By the end, you will see the writer (Karl Bollers) wanted to show how Emma got her money to start her new life. But he did not need 6 issues! I feel like he needed to stretch this story arc out so it would fit nice in the tpb. I hope volume 3 does as good as a job as volume 1 and not his boring mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad!","review":"I hardly ever write a negative review, but I suggest you avoid this product.On the plus side, it is a good price for a water dispenser.

No big deal you think -- but you'd be surprised how annoying this becomes by your 10th cup!2. The cold doesn't get that cold.

Haier offered to replace for $15 or let me take it to a repair center. I took it to the center in the intrest of helping local business and costing Haier as much as possible for a faulty product. Other then that, my only complaint is the difficulty in puting a bottle on it without getting water everywhere. (it has a small opening on top that water splashes out of) The seal went out again 2 weeks after getting it back from the repair center.

I felt that the book did not do justice to the subject covered and I ended up returning the book and purchased another book on the subject. I am not trying to be overly critical of the book. I was very enticed by the title and cover, but the way the inside of the book was set up was not near to the quality dedicated to the cover.

First of all, the comments of the first reviewer are absolutely dead wrong. Having read the Chinese propaganda, and really lived the Chinese propaganda, this is not it. Rather, it is one of the only pieces of scholarship about Tibet in recent history that doesn't fall victim to the Western agenda of portraying Tibet as sympathetically as possible. This is a complex issue, and both sides have done their best to skewer public opinion in their favor; however, to accuse these men of simply being mouthpieces of the Communist party is doing a great disservice to what is truly a breath of fresh air. For a good look at propaganda, go to a Beastie Boys concert. I applaud the editors for keeping politics out of their writing. I highly recommend this text to anyone curious about the real situation in Tibet."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is pro-Chinese propaganda","review":"At first I was not aware of the author's point of view.

The high points for me were the discussion of obligations and liabilities in low-visibility navigation, and finding that some subtle language in the regs is meaningful (i.e., \\"vessel\\" and \\"vessel under power\\" are legally significant distinctions, not just rhetorical variants in the text).

I like step that has a mix of high & low intensity aerobics, plus some strength building moves. Her basic routine is ok, but in my opinion she just ruins it by trying to get too frilly & fancy. So many twirls & spins. That doesn't do anything except make you dizzy. I found myself creating my own steps as I went along. For example, while she would do figure 8's, pivots, and circles...I would do squats, lunges, or knee raises. I also found some of her moves to be too fast paced & switched around too much which is hard on the knee joints. It was pretty repetitive too, so I found it a bit boring.

Mr. McHenry is no Clancy. Far from it. The characters were paper cut-outs, the dialogue stiff, and the action forced. Action scenes switched from hotel room to hotel room at the speed of light. A few times I lost track of which hotel they were fighting in. The only comparison to a Clancy novel I can see is that the authors have a 'c' and a 'y' in their names. Can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Code Name: Antidote","review":"It is apparent that Mr. McHenry knows Naval and shipboard procedures. He goes to great lengths to let the reader know that he is up on procedures to the point of tedium. The first half of the book was boring and repetitive.

She hardly gives this thing a second look. I pretended to be excited by it. I even pretended I was eating it so she'd want it but it was a no go. I then tried the never faulty peanut butter trick--I put a thin layer of peanut butter on it thinking once she'd get started she'd love it and not want to stop.

Corwin, edited by Richard Loss, which I recommend. This is a summary of the opinions in landmark court cases, with an emphasis on those that Corwin disagreed with and considered unconstitutional. Nothing about this book is authored by Corwin, and, based on his actual writings, one must conclude that he would not have approved of his name being attached to it. This is a rather crude attempt to legitimize the many ways that the Constitution has been and is being violated.

Anyone wanting to read and/or understand Genji should definitely read Tyler's translation.I can't tell from this page if Dr. Puette has updated his book to include Tyler's translation, if so I'd certainly repurchase it and likely raise my rating to five stars; I only have the original 1983 edition.

The book gives very simple examples, not much help or hints or \\"way of eliminating the answere.\\" They just say \\"which one sounds wrong.\\" ALso, the pactice test do not align with the actual SAT, it's easier (in the book). Also the practice test just comes with an answer key, and they expect YOU to figure out the answeres, if you want the explination, you'll have to buy \\"the official SAT online Course\\" which cost $60 or $80 dollars (the online course also sucks).

Unfortunately, it is not a great resource for the SAT I essay. First, they promote several misconceptions about their own test (ie all examples are weighted equally which Adam Robinson has shown to be false). Second, the high-scoring essays included as examples have very little in common with each other. Because of this it is difficult to glean a formula for writing a high-scoring essay (and there is a formula as discovered by Dr. Les Perelman of MIT). So I cannot highly recommend this book for SAT essay preparation.

The only problem is that it gives no explanations for the answers.There are explanations on the sample questions only, but there are none on the practice tests(there are eight practice tests). It is so frustrating, especially in the math section, don't just tell me the answer is \\"B\\", explain to me WHY it is \\"B\\" and HOW to solve the problem.

While this book is awesome for practice tests, it is not the book to buy for strategies. Which the book includes some strategies, CollegeBoard is not going to release a book that tells you tricks to solve the problems they test you on.

Good thing Mr. Perry used none in \\"Shadows of the Empire\\". I really do like the Aliens and Predators(who dosen't like little crawly things that burst out of people?). Mr. Perry and his daughter did a good job creating a language for the Predators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"This book depicts the Predators as a barbaric and simple minded race.The Predators are supposed to be a superior technologically advanced race, and their only primitive aspect is hunting for thrill, and even that they do with superior weaponry.This book is also sexist, in part maybe because Steve allowed his wife to write part of the book. The Predator women are bigger, stronger and smarter than the males, according to this book.Then why not send the women out on the hunt?! It goes against all of the Predator films and mythos.SPOILER ALERTThe aliens were way too easy to kill and amounted to little more than fodder. The queen alien was also very easily dispatched.As a kid, I loved the original Steve Perry books, especially Nightmare Hive, but I wonder if I was just young, because this book did a disservice to both Predators and Aliens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I have never been a fan of the AvP movies due to the fact they are never made with respect but rather to make quick bucks by feeding the audience mindless action with no story line. I do however love the series and this has to be one of my favorite books. Without giving too much away, the basic overview of this novel takes place in the future where humans are traveling to different planets in the universe to settle down. While in this planet, without being aware of what is going on, humans get trapped in middle of an event where the predators plant alien eggs on a planet and then hunt them. The great thing about this novel is that the authors take the reader through a journey where we are given a chance to discover the Predators also known as Yuatja, and how they are actually a cultural and intelligent race rather than what the movies portraying them as savage hunters. This is an amazing read and I truly believe everyone who is a fan of the series should read this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aliens vs Predators.....What more do you want?","review":"The best sci-fi movie takeoff book EVER written. An absolute must-read, if you are a fan of either Predator or Aliens. The sheer ease of carnage that the Predators inflict on Aliens, who fight back nicely themselves, is worth the price of this book. When the heck are they gonna make a movie???"},{"rating":"2","title":"...just wow","review":"there is enough action in this book to make u want to jump out a window...BUT DONT...IT WILL HURT! now, first of all, i find many books just plain [bad] like....endersgame,dune, etc which are adored by many ppl but yet...this book captured me with all its gore, action,and surprisingly curses...its a true sci fi book. Now, the most interesting thing about this book is the way the perry family wrote it. It is made in a way that it shows the view of the predators and humans...so it captures the angle of battles and intense moments in different ways. the plot is actually interesting...yet i heard nothin good bout the second one but heh. now, u might think this book is just some [bad] knock off but its not...read it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"predator galore","review":"If you like reading about the predators more so than the aliens, then this is your book. Not to put it off for the die hard alien fans but there is little to do with them in comparison to the predators in the story. I love this book i read it over just two days. I could not wait for the next part or the next action sequence or the next surprise. This is one of the best ideas in a book i have ever read and the way the story comes to life is very believable. Overall, one of the best books i have ever read and thats without exaggeration.

And, you guessed it, the humans get trapped in the middle.The pack of Predators are full of students. They are learning how to hunt the Aliens. Their teachers, who gets wounded, befriends a woman and they hunt the Aliens together.Aliens vs Predator: Prey is based on the Dark Horse graphic novels.It's a very short book, but it brings back the memories.This one was just for fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for those bad days","review":"I fell in love with Alien Versus Predator when my best friend had brought over the first movie and since then I've collected most every Predator and Alien comic, book, and movie available. This one takes the cake however, next to Deadliest of the Species. Alliances between the two races almost always turn out to be spectacular, just as long as both have a sense of honor and respect for each other. The fighting, the surprise twists, and the pride of a warrior are what attracted me to the Predators in the first place and this book DOES NOT let me down! I would recommend this book to any Alien Versus Predator fan or even those who may have only seen the movie. It is fairly easy to follow along with. The ending will have you begging for another great team-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding book.","review":"I am a big fan of the Alien and Predator movies, so when I found out there were books, I immediately looked into it. I bought this book about a month ago and read it in about a week. It was outstanding. Other books mainly focus on just the people's point of view, but this book gets really in depth with the yautja (Predators) and you learn alot more about them. This book is filled with action, adventure, suspence, and a whole lot of alien slaughter! So I really suggest you read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best damn books I have read!","review":"A.V.P. is one of my more favorite series to read.

He and the amazing Uniit Carrayo (Sp?) lyrically soar about the typical jam band or hippie band fare. They are more internationally-minded than to be lumped into the jam band mess. I definitely dig them, and older CDs like this are probably the best. The newest album is so forgettable that I already forget it's name, it's OK but doesn't seem as raw and pure as earlier recordings. As the band progressed they became toooooo mellow and tooooo smooth. I am getting worried that they are heading in an \\"adult contemporary\\" direction that is the curse of any cool band. Plus, even though they found a great replacement for Uniit on the new album, I think she added something extra to the band.

The 1712 Overture alone is worth the price of admission. The use of the motif from 'I Ain't Got No Home' is inspired and the skewering of 'Day Tripper' reduces me to helpless giggles every time.Einstein on the Fritz is a tonic to anyone sick of the pretentious meanderings of Philip Glass, Taverner et al. And Cappricio La Poucelle de New Orleans (engineered by Burt Bach, a living direct decendant of JS Bach) is frighteningly intense, as well as hysterical. These musicians are also terrific - the pieces wouldn't work at all otherwise.

A must-have for the serious Greek culture student."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Functionalist analysis of Greek religion.","review":"Basically, this book attempt to present Greek religion as it (supposedly) transits from a mythological explanation of the world, with the gods as concrete personifications of abstract notions, towards a rational religion where abstract attributes and social morals and philosophical ethics supersede mythology. Such an approach does little to explain the enormous resilience shown by Greek mythology until today, yet the account is enormously informative and gives much food for alternative thinking on the subject.Recommended as a handbook for the advanced student on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered, didnt work, sent back, received replacement, didnt work, sent back!!!","review":"I thought this microwave was a bargain.

I rated it two stars because its not really the type of movie i'd normally like to watch, I'm more into comedy and chick flicks.

I think it relates well to Beowulf because it is pretty much the same story line, only with a few differances like they don't fight grendel instead they fight these creatures. The creatures are wierd. I suggest if you read Beowulf in class you should watch the movie as somthing to relate in class. Overall its a good movie to go with the poem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Movie","review":"The movie trailer appears to portray a lot of action sequence. However, the movie turned out to be very boring and most of the scenes are in a dark setting, making it hard to capture all the \\"limited\\" action sequences. The story is very simple and based on a \\"Grendel\\" monster myth. I enjoyed the Star Trek Voyager version more. Definitely: DO NOT BUY or even rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother with the edited version","review":"I don't know about the full-length, but this version was a terrible excuse for a movie. The idea was good, but the plotline was dissapointingly simple and the characters badly underdeveloped. Nor was it very realisitc. The movie fails to build up an emotional rage against the anatgonists, who are also simply created with depth. The fact that the directors copied real artifacts and ancient dwellings found in France and the Middle East shows their lack of originality. After two excuses for battles, the movie ends abruptly. It could have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Discrete Surround","review":"The only redeeming value this dvd has is the sound. Otherwise, don't buy it.

Truthfully I dont think that there was a good midevil movie to come along in between the two movies. This film has it all, great acting by Banderas, and his viking crew, the cast is greatly chosen, as well as the behind the camera cast. McTiernan is an excellent director who has yet to make a bad film. He has proved himself on all types of terrains, this just asserts him even more, in the forrest or the thick woods (The Medecine Man and Predator). This film has great action sequences one after another. The begenning is a bit slow, but that just leads up to the characterization. The sets are masterfully built, and the cinematography is great! This film goes highly recomended to midevil lovers, Banderas lovers, action lovers, and McTiernan lovers.

It's pretty much non-stop action from the word \\"jump.\\" There are some scenes that really need some additional stuff (which is where an extended cut would really be great), but they don't hinder my enjoyment of it. I know this flick isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, there's a lot of blood; and the people that I've come across fall into two camps: those familiar with \\"Beowulf,\\" and those who aren't. For the most part, those (who I've come across) who've understood that, seem to have enjoyed it a little bit more. And maybe, now, with there being new \\"Beowulf\\" movies coming out, left, right and center, maybe this flick will get the appreciation (the the super-duper cut) it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice adaptation of 'Eaters of the Dead'","review":"Far be it from me to quibble about the bookEaters of the Deadbeing better than its movie adaptation. However, I could easily have lived with a longer cut of this 'Beowulf epic'. Nevertheless, inspite of the evident & drastic culling of scenes, 'The 13th Warrior' remains a movie-goer's treat. Antonio Banderas continues to amaze me with his flair for subtle comedy. The rest of the cast too play their viking parts to near perfection. The action sequences and 'battle scenes' are down-to-the-earth raw (no CGI magic!), intelligently done, and immensely enjoyable. My recurring complaint being that the movie was about 30 minutes too short ...Turn on your home-theater, kickback, relax, and enjoy the visuals for sheer entertainment value."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 13th Warrior Rocks the Mike!","review":"If you want to see a somewhat authentic snapshot of viking life, then see this movie! One of the best parts, I think, is that although Antonio Banderas, as much as I like him, isn't the star of the movie... that part belongs to the Norse king. Banderas' character is simply the narrator in this epic legend of the battle hardened Norsemen against the creepy and mysterious Eaters of the Dead. My favourite part of the movie is when the Norsemen are making fun of the Arab's horse from the saddles of their huge Clydesdales saying: \\"Only an Arab would bring a dog to war!\\" and then they spend the next few scenes actually barking at the horse, who is an Arabian charger. Then the small horse totally blows them away with it's speed and agility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting adaptation","review":"I love this movie. I teach mythology to high schoolers and, after reading Beowulf, we discuss the way the original Epic has been adapted. I have my students compare the way the magical elements have been brought into the realm of possibility and this serves to help explain how myths often develop from real events. This, I believe, fits with Crichton's original intention, as stated in the afterword to Eaters of the Dead, which was to prove that the story of Beowulf is exciting. Besides, the music is fantastic and I never have any trouble watching Antonio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warrior Spirit","review":"This movie can show you more about the warrior spirit than any of the phony martial arts films out there. The scene near the end where the norsemen -- and their arab \\"brother\\" -- step up one by one to stand in front of the charging enemy gives new meaning to the phrase \\"stand up guy.\\" Let's hope that the studio releases a \\"director's cut\\" with some of the edited material included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but too short.","review":"I have just received & viewed my copy of this movie (DVD widescreen) I while I must agree with the 'professional' reviewer that too much was edited out, in reading some of the other reviews it seems that they missed that this movie is based on Michael Chrichton's book \\"Eaters Of The Dead\\", which is based on Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan's memoirs, i.e., it's based on a real story! Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan was (is?) a historical figure and while the movie may have simularities to other stories so does any other movie with the possible exception of \\"Being John Malkovich\\".The cinematography is great and the soundtrack phenomenal! It's just that in trying to get the time down and make it more of an action movie, they edited too much of the story out making it seem jerky in places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great Fun","review":"I went to see this movie in the theatres expecting very little. After all, I have never been a fan of Antonio Banderas and I can't stand Michael Crighton.I was very pleased to discover, however, that the movie was interesting, had a basic, but solid plot and was better acted than I could have hoped. It definitely has a Beowulf feel to it and the cinematography, sound quality and mood music really made for a complete movie experience.The battle scenes were impressive as were all of the sets and costumes, though I do agree that there were some anacronisms with regard to armor and weaponry, as stated in a previous review.I don't think it was supposed to be a classic movie, just great fun.

He learns to respect the differences he encounters, and even to practice them in order to survive his adventures. Yes there could have been more, more character development, etc, but what is here - is enough of a taste to truly enjoy this film and feel its impact.

It has the camraderie of warriors, a love interest, a town in peril, and a bunch of Norse rowdies against insurmountable odds... However, the movie seemed to leave quit a few loose ends hanging out. For one, a love interest is introduced between Ibn, and a woman from the small village, but what happens beyond the interest is never revealed. Also, the son of the town's leader is introduced as an antagonist to the Norse group, but about halfway through the movie, he seems to just *disappear*...

The story is told from the perspective of a Muslim poet who was banished from the royal court due to a jealousy. He is sent as a diplomat to serve as ambassador with the people to the far north, in an effort to keep him as far away as possible.The northern lands are the lands of the Vikings. If you have ever read \\"Beowulf,\\" then much of this will ring a bell. A group of heroes are asked to come help a village who is tormented by demons. After the bones have been cast, 13 warriors must sail to the rescue. The 13th must not be a Viking, so the Muslim ambassador, played by Banderas, joins the mission. We will see him grow to become man as he joins in the adventure.Seeing the poet learn about the Viking culture is a lesson for us also. Their learning about him was just as enjoyable. The action from the fighting or the mystery of their foe is well worth the time spent to watch the movie.I would recommend watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was fine, and the movie is finer","review":"I must admit that I am an avid fan of the writings of Michael Crichton.

Along with Clive Owen's King Arther, hollywood epics just do not come close. BUY THIS AND BE THRILLED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beowulf","review":"This movie, based on Eaters of the Dead by Michael Crichton, is an interesting adaptation of the story of Beowulf. For English lit buffs who enjoy the classical tale of a fearless warrior who battles demon spawn, this movie is an interesting experiment. While it is not true to all aspects of the tale of Beowulf, the way some of the elements of the story are adapted for a more \\"scientific\\" explanation of things is intruiging. For those who have read Cricton's book, this movie is pretty true to the book. I am rarely as impressed with a movie as I am with its literary counterpart, but this is a movie that is as good as its book. For viewers who don't care about Beowulf or Eaters of the Dead, this is a very cool movie anyway. There is plenty of suspense, blood, and fighting. It is a good adventure movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not historically accurate","review":"Ibn Fadlan (the 13th warrior) was not an Arab; He is a Persian working for Arab caliphate.Arab caliphates were completely depended on Persians to rule and manage their huge empire.This book is made based on a book by Michael Crichton called \\"Eaters of the dead\\", Which is based on real chronicles of a Persian working for Abbasid Caliphates as a royal accountant (Divandar)?The story is seriously dramatized to fit Hollywood needs. The real chronicles are available in a library in Iran. The real story is somewhat different from Michael Crichton's version.Overall it's very exciting and interesting, Well worth watching and reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 13th Warrior","review":"The 13th Warrior was an excellent movie.

Certainly worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic with lost footage","review":"The reason many are complaining about the missing sequences is that there really are some elements of lost footage. From what I have read in the past, there was a large amount of shot film that was lost or destroyed before printing. The editing that was done was just to make a workable film out of what was left. This was a great tragedy, but it is still a great film regardless. The book \\"Eaters of the Dead\\" fills in the few gaps made by the film, and is quite an interesting read on its own.This movie is well made, with quality acting, an excellent story, and a powerful musical score. I watch it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD...","review":"AS a fan of action, epic and medieval movies, of course I'd rent on the spot a movie directed by McTiernan, with Banderas as the main star and based on a Crichton's book.

There were some good fight sequences but not enough to carry this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"the cover is attractive","review":"Poor acting,Antonio diappointing,plot a little thin on the ground.The packaging was nice.I feel I deserve a reward for wathcing this film"},{"rating":"1","title":"Woeful!","review":"I can't believe all of the positive reviews for this film, it's absolutely awful! How can this be considered to be an epic? Making this film any longer wouldn't have helped because as it stands it was a struggle to sit through.

Ben Hur is an epic, this is just an expensive waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"As a Banderas fan, I looked forward to this movie.

The acting is completely unbelievable, the plot is mediocre at best, and the battle scenes are just bloody, with no real point. The stereotypes about Islam got really old, so did the preachiness about how one forms \\"brotherhood\\" in battle. I've heard this is based on \\"Beowulf\\" (which, frankly, isn't that great, either), and if it is, that's too bad, because the filmakers missed the point completely. Don't waste your time; I'm sorry I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible Viking Tale","review":"The trailers for \\"13th Warrior\\" looked pretty exciting. But, this film about a poet forced to become a warrior (Antonio Banderas), is a waste of talent.The incoherent story makes almost no sense (apparantly there were editing problems) -- things happen way too fast and are never explained. This is the biggest flaw of many about this film.For other . . . customers who are planning to see this film, don't. This movie is a rip-off of Akira Kurosawa's \\"Seven Samurai\\". The battle scenes in \\"13th Warrior\\" (and even some of the characters) are stolen from that great samurai masterpiece.Avoid this unfocused piece of rubbish and see \\"Seven Samurai\\", because that is an amazing film with a coherent story and better effort put into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tremendous Potential, Terrible Result","review":"The 13th Warrior is one of the most disappointing films I've seen. There was obviously a lot of potential for a good movie and the failure of come close to that potential forces me to give The 13th Warrior a low rating.The much-maligned failure to resolve the subplots is a big key. It gave the film a jerky feel, kept characters from developing, and generally left me feeling let down at the end of the film.It's too bad, there was potential for a good movie to live up to Crichton's story, but it failed miserably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a fair chance","review":"I think that too many people have not given this film a fair chance. I'd heard all about the problems involved in making the film. I knew who the principles were (Crichton, Banderas, McTiernan). I wasn't expecting Shakespeare and I didn't get Shakespeare. What I did get was nearly two hours of a decent, entertaining, hack and slash adventure story and I was happy with that.I think because it takes place in the Middle Ages and has lots of sabre-rattling people compare this film to Braveheart. C'mon folks, Braveheart was a one of a kind, sweeping, romantic epic. Hollywood rarely makes those anymore. 13th Warrior is a genre piece, an action movie. Hollywood makes dozens of those a year. And as action flicks go this is a pretty good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of boring","review":"There's a lot of action, some violence with gruesome scenes, and a lame sub-plot romance involving Antonio and a viking woman.

I would have wanted to have some extras on the DVD disc... like a commentary or deleted scenes... it would be perfect that way ++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action/adventure","review":"I went into this movie expecting not to like it, yet i was pleasantly surprised. this movie is not an epic by a long shot, though it does at times try hard. the action is overall good and the film work not bad. but for me it was the characters that make this film worth watching. the way they interact and what they believe in and why they do things was well portrayed. it is not your typical fantasy/adventure film and for that alone it is worth giving a watch. there are some plot elements that are left hanging which is a little disappointing and a couple of big ones. but overall i enjoyed watching it and i can't ask much more from a film than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just don't expect the wrong things...","review":"You'd have to be in the right mood for this movie: it's definitely not something for everyone. Having read \\"Eaters of the Dead\\" helps but it's not necessary. It's mainly true to the book, except for the sexual descriptions. (Apparently, showing hundreds of decapitations is perfectly ok, but showing one scantily dressed woman isn't.) Sure there aren't loads of three-dimensional characters, but remember that the whole story is told from only one man's point of view. This could be seen as just another Guy Movie; fighting and blood and gore and lots of it, but it's also a traditional heroic story. Very well-acted and thought out. Also: it's not often a movie makes me go buy the soundtrack the next day, but this one did. Jerry Goldsmith's musical score is truly inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad, Some Good Gore","review":"Not a bad movie but one you wonder why they bothered to make. Antonio Banderas plays the title role. Lots of good gore, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is easily worth the $15 or so that they are asking for it. The characters are very well written and grab hold of you from the get go. You feel a certain loss when certain ones die and are happy that others lived by the end.I have watched this movie more than a dozen times and still find myself excited as the battles begin, and wishing that it could be longer just so that I could spend more time with the characters. It is certainly worth a watch, but I loved I enjoy having it on hand so that I can watch it whenever I want... and that tends to be about once a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antonio Banderas-great character as ususal","review":"I have enjoyed most of Antonio's movies. This one will hold your interest and keep you wondering what will happen next.If you do not like blood and a little gore, you may not want to see this.I thought it was put together very well and he plays his character very well as ususal. He is just great!!I enjoy actioni adventure and am glad I purchased it.Oh, one of my must's in a movie is they do not use Jesus Christ or God Damn as curse words in this. I will never buy a movie or keep a movie that does!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"The movie was really good. I liked all of the blood a gore. the movie was very touching and the story line was very good. I was surprised that he monsters where men that wanted to bee bears. Teh 13 Wrriror was very different to see. This movie reminded me of the story beowolf. The whole thing of the men sailing to a different country to rid them of the monsters that they feared all so much.I liked the movie. The End."},{"rating":"1","title":"13th Warrior DVD","review":"If it weren't for the conspicuously missing plot in this film - I would have really enjoyed it. All the gore, action and good hearted testosterone just couldn't save it for me. I think Banderas gives a great performance and every Viking plays out their roles fittingly - but it felt I was wandering aimlessly from one battle to another.The DVD transfer is excellent, and the sound quality is great too, but the disc offers no extras, and certainly doesn't pump life into such a disappointing film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is it so bad?","review":"This film had such potential. Based on a Michael Criton book and directed by a gifted director, John McTiernan. But for some reason it was truly one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I work in a Video Store! The movie's character's didn't grow or change, the plot was almost humorous and the acting was horrible. It seems as though this film started out as a 3 hour epic and was scaled down to 2 hours of nonsense. I don't recommend this film to my customers and I don't recommend it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD was fake","review":"I purchased DVD back in November and I just gave the gift this past weekend.

I am a person who likes adventure movies and if you are like me then you will love this movie; especially if you like Brave Heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"POINTLESS AND DULL","review":"Maybe I didn't watch the same movie, but I found THE 13TH WARRIOR incredibly pointless and dull. While filmed sumptuously and with a decent amount of action scenes, there was little substance in the plotting or in the limp characterizations. Who were these \\"eaters of the dead?\\" All of a sudden the Vikings are speaking English, obviously for the benefit of its audience since translator Omar Sharif wasn't going to be around to translate. Michael Crichton is a gifted writer, but I don't consider this one of his shining moments. Antonio Banderas wears much too much eye make up in the first part of the film and the gifted Diane Venora is wasted in what amounts to nothing more than a cameo role. Listless and lumbering, I don't recommend this one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"13th isn't your lucky number","review":"I could go on and on for 3 paragraphes about how bad this movie is but you probably won't believe me . I was warned too but didn't believe it either , wandering what could go worng with Antonyo ( Desperados ) Banderas , big production , sword fights and fantasy story so I rented this movie - I guess I deserved it ."},{"rating":"1","title":"An epic disaster.","review":"I've enjoyed quite a bit of Michael Crichton's novel to film adaptations, such as Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Sphere, Disclosure, and Congo (the last film on a very campy level). The 13th Warrior, of all the ones I've seen, is his only truly bad adaptation. It's weak on all levels, even on action. When it should be exhilarating, The 13th Warrior looks incompetent. When it should be bold and stirring, the film is muddled and boring.As a matter of fact, I have yet to understand how so many people could even like this movie. The acting is fairly bad, the plot is a pointless rendition of The Road Warrior, the battle scenes are filmed in almost complete darkness or slow motion, and the film offers nothing substantial in way of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie does a disservice to the legacy of the Northmen","review":"The 13th Warrior although fairly entertaining, does a major diluting to the rich and brutal pagan culture of the Vikings, much as the movie version of Whitefang wimped out on the true brutal version of Jack London's novel. Despite their small numbers and the fact that the Viking era only lasted approximatly 200 years; the Norsemen were the most feared and fearless warriors in history- this was mainly due to their bleak and apocalyptic religion (Odinism). This movie paints a cartoonish existence out of these great men from the far North. To best get a feel for the mentality of the ancient Scandinavians, listen to and learn the modern culture of Nordic Black Metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harmless Warrior","review":"What a tremendously disappointing movie...I admit I wasn\`t expecting much anyway, still I thought it would be better than this mess. What could have been a compelling and epic story about vikings ends up wasted with random fight sequences and the lack of a visible plot. Antonio Banderas tries, even if he hasn\`t a proper character to play. In fact, this movie hasn\`t real characters at all, just cardboard, one-dimensional charicatures. A shame, since director John McTiernan (\\"Die Hard\\") could certainly do better than this empty and uninteresting waste of celluloid. This is a pseudo-movie, since it seems that the story never really begins, making for a useless cinematic experience.A good one to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"where was the fast forward button when I needed it?","review":"I thought the movie would be worth watching simply because Antonio is in it--I was wrong. I kept watching because I thought \\"this has to get better.\\" I was disappointed on that account. Several of the co-stars are wonderful--bringing humor into a dark, corny movie. But I too often found myself rolling my eyes mumbling \\"yeah, right.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting. Alas - I may not find milder word.","review":"No understanding of midieval times at all. Lots of holes in the story. Dull charactres. Awful acting.I feel very disappointed by rate received by this movie. It seems, one rusty sword is equal to success in our times.Few good episodes (like ship approaching the beach in the fog) are not enough to justify wasted time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't cut it","review":"The best historical movies are those in which the aura of the era is captured. See Braveheart, Gladiator, the Name of the Rose... All these movies show the dirt, grime, shadows, corruption, that one expects those times to have had.In this movie, it all just seemed fake: the props, the lighting, the acting, the music, etc. All this, combined with an extremely weak plot, is why this movie just gets one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cromagnons on horseback","review":"Although I enjoyed the cinematography, with the inlets of British Columbia standing in for Norse fiords, it bothered me that the mysterious flesh-eaters creeping into the village on foggy nights later turned out to be hordes of heavy cavalry. Neolithic cave-dwellers on horseback? I don't think so. It's almost as if the writers decided halfway through the story that it just wasn't going to work without epic battle scenes, and wrote them in even though they are not at all in keeping with the sinister, other-worldly threat that summons the 13 warriors northward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storyline was weak","review":"The movie lacks a strong storyline and I thought it wandered without focus. I did think that some of the characters were interesting but since their adversaries were not developed the sense of accomplishment by the protagonists was not truely appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scenary is only thing going for it...","review":"Definetly not worth buying, maybe a rent if nothing else is available. There was no character development at all. Disappointment in plot. If you want middle age swashbuckling, I would stick to Conan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make your own Decision","review":"Bascially, when it comes to movies people should really watch them and decide for themselves as to if they like something or not. But for all those interested I'll give my 2 cents worth. I had no ideal what this movie was going to be about when I rented it, the only thing that I knew was that the sexy Antonio Banderas was going to be in it. So having no expectations for the movie and wanting to see Antonio is a big influence on why I enjoyed the movie as much as I did.It started off very interesting with 12, big, strong, norsmen warriors volunteering to help a kingdom in need and a reluctant Antonio becoming the 13th member of their party. So they head out on their mission and start to encounter some pretty unbelieaveable, and frightening things about their enemy. The way all of this was handeled in the directing, writting, and dialogue was very intriguing and it kept me in my chair waiting to see what was going to happen next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept; Poor execution","review":"First of all, the plot is definately interesting. I also did like some of the battle scenes and the art direction.There are a lot of things missing in the movie however. The characters were not fleshed out enough and they appear more to be like cartoon characters. Also there were some plot threads that were left unexplained (Like why did the Bear monsters dissapear after the first intial battle).Given the amount of talent that was used in the making of this picture, this is a huge dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"13th Warrior","review":"Great action movie, excellent performances by all and in particular Antonio Banderas. When are the critics going to give Banderas due credit. He is a classic trained actor, of immense talent. He combines a natural athletic ability, with passion and commitment to all the roles he plays. His potrayal of the Arab was convincing and exciting. The Vikings were just awesome. Beautifully filmed with an amazing music score. If you enjoy this movie, go see Play It to the Bone, now playing. Again the critics were wrong. Maybe its an American thing. Can a great actor from another country join the great melting pot of America and have a fair chance. This man will win an Oscar, you can bet on it in the not too distant future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting mix of history & mythology","review":"While obviously another light swords and headbanging action flick, I found the use of a sound historical basis for what is almost pure fantasy to be a very interesting mix. It gives one an insight into how myths of heroes may begin in fact. It is almost like the story is being told by one of the first witnesses to the battle and is embellishing the roles of the heroes. While not for the younger crowd, I would defineitely recommend this film to anyone interested in both hisory and fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Accessory","review":"I have owned a DeWalt DW618 router with the fixed base for a couple of years now, and I am huge fan (see my review of the router for more on that). When I started looking for a more powerful plunge router to replace my old 1.75hp Ryobi I decided it made more sense to buy this base and use my existing 2.25 DeWalt router motor as my plunge router. This base is very well machined - the fit and finish are excellent. The plunge mechanism operates very smoothly with just the right amount of resistance. The handles are extremely comfortable, and the dust collection design works well too. Basically I have found no serious shortcomings in this product. My only beef is that it is a pain to find the right parts to hook up my Fein Turbo II vac to the dust collection tube/port. But in fairness to DeWalt that is due more to the odd size of the Fein vac hose than to this router base.Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy if you don't already have a CD","review":"I purchased this to add to my collection of Halloween music.

The Guitar riffs are amazing, as well as the drum patterns and the bass sounds phenomenal. This is probably the best produced death metal cd you're going to get nowawadays. Ben Falgoust's vocals are more mid ranged, and Sammy's aren't as high as they were on previous releases, so it's easier to listen too. My Favorites off this so far are \\"Alchemy of a black sun cult\\" and \\"In the Narrow confines of defilement\\", because it's got a killer riff in the end of the song. There really isn't a lot to say about this disc other than it's a great death metal release that's going to do a lot for a new direction in the genre. Let's hope this pushes Goatwhore to the forefront, I'm giving this a 4.5"},{"rating":"2","title":"See them live.","review":"A Haunting Curse is a very solid Goatwhore release. Vocals are less harsh, production more crisp, and it's plain to see that the band has gravitated toward a more aggressive and direct death metal sound, rather than the inverted goat raping blitzkrieg of their past albums. None are \\"black metal\\" in the traditional 1994 \\"let's wear corpse paint and stab members of other bands\\" sense, in spite of the lyrical content and art which may suggest otherwise. You'll find no graveyards and dead angels here, but if you like your metal with less cheese and more testosterone, this is the Goatwhore album for you.Goatwhore sound okay on record, but they're incredible to behold in a live setting. Ben Falgoust is one of the most charismatic frontmen in the history of live metal, despite the fact that he wears the same outfit (including gauntlets) to every gig."},{"rating":"1","title":"haunting curse goatwhore","review":"I listened to each cut from this CD and goatwhore went Full out from start to finish.

Computer assisted voice change in a video game program and musical rendition that resulted from just picking up the instruments and pounding them straight to hell. And back.

Dornier Do 335, Kyushu J7W Shinden, Mitsubishi J8M Shusui, Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka \\"Baka\\", AIDC fighter, etc... Famous planes from Albatros D.II, Lockheed SR-71A to F-22 Raptor.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful time-travel,a real tear jerker","review":"I found this book quite by chance and couldn't believe how lucky i'd been when I read it. Nicholas is a man to die for. You will adore him. The tears were running down my face when Lauren found out Nicholas had died, especially as she had warned him what would happen if he didn't take care. Lauren finds her way back to her own time. She is heavily pregnant with Nick's child and collapses at her grandparents home. After she has the baby she finds that her contribution in the past has changed time in the present. Discovering Nick is still alive she rushes back to him through the cave that bought her there. The first person she runs into is the Laird Ferguson who tells her Nick has been demented with grief and has been hanging around the forest waiting for something or someone. Ferguson tries to kidnap her but Nick gets to her and the baby before he does.This is a wonderful story. If you can get a copy of this book, get it, you won't be disapointed by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEI","review":"Both of these 30 minute +/- video's are worth the price.

It makes it so difficult to get into a grove. This is a such a compelling subject but, Holland's narrative never takes off. There is plenty of background information about ancient Greek culture and Persian history. However, Holland falls short when trying to draw conclusions about impact and ramifications. The synopsis of the book misleads you into thinking that the book will provide insight into how this ancient history impacts us today, but it doesn't. It's straight up history. It's interesting history if you can stand the stuffy writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read","review":"The study of the rise of the Persians before they invaded Greece illuminates the overall history as never before. The Persians were certainly not ones to be trifled with. But the author's ability to put you there, that night, on the beaches, next to the ships, awaiting for dawn and the inevitable battle against overwhelming forces, your city burnt to the ground, your family dispersed and in hiding, and yet meeting the enemy singing your paens! History at it's finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best opus","review":"Holland's latest opus fails to meet the bar set by Barry Strauss (Battle of Salamis) when it comes to writing about this ancient encounter.

Instead it is a rather dry mixture of high school history (lots of names and politics, often somewhat confusing) with a narrative that never really becomes compelling.The beginning is a dry mini-history of the Persian Empire, then of Sparta, then of Athens. It finally picks up momentum about half way through when the actual wars start. Even then,though, the narrative continues to get bogged down and never really becomes a good story; with few exceptions it feels like you are reading some student's term paper. If you are not in love with history to start with, this book will certainly not turn you on to the subject.On the other hand, the story itself is so fascinating it almost compensates for the weaknesses of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbarians?!!!","review":"Throughout the book, the author glorifies the greeks, and refers to Persians as barbarians.

I ran out of glue so used a little Gorilla Glue in the construction. Be advised if you abuse the supplied wheels at all they will bend. I had to roll the completed cabinet with a full load of Home Theater equipment from the carpet onto the hardwood floor. I wasn't careful and ended up bending two of the four wheels. That was a pain and ended up replacing all four with more robust wheels. I found the supplied back fabric and attached it with blue tape which helped to block the light from the back.

I ordered four more wheels that cost me another $50. I don't understand why techcraft would supply the rack with such cheap casters.

I didn't want to put the backing on the unit to make it easier to add and remove components from the back, but the unit is completely unstable otherwise. This wasn't a deal-breaker for me because I can load my components through the front, but it may be for others. I had a caster and bottom shelf damaged by movers recently and I ordered replacement parts from Techcraft's website.

Then I got my Home theater installed, the technician put all the equipment in the racks, as soon as we tried moving the rack back to the wall, 2 wheels broke and came off. I called amazon and they were willing to replace or refund the order, but that would mean that I would have to take all the equipment out and call the technician again to re-install everything.

I guess its the same old problem that plagues corporate America today. Profits before customer. They didn't make enough profit (boo hoo) on the first 4 seasons, so tough luck customer, this is what you get. Take it or leave it.

But I've notice she like her female charactor to have little or no control over the event in their lives. In DSM I felt like throwing this book across the room when ever Paige had a confrontation with anyone in her life. She always back down and did thing their way.

Paige, her principal character, has to cope with being a \\"designated mother\\" after one of her friends died as well as being involved with the leadership of a coven assembly (group of witches). The plot moves along well from cover to cover. It was my first in the series and will not be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like Paige Winterbourne","review":"Paige Winterbourne stumbles her way through this book, assailed on all sides by people who hate her for no good reason. (Most of them, the reader suspects, hate her because she's rude to them. Paige claims repeatedly that she wants to help people, but she Does Have Her Pride, and she Does Not Hesitate To Tell People Off.) The sole exception is Lucas, who remains polite and helpful despite Paige's insults and abuse, until about two-thirds of the way through the book, when she relents and they have sex.Is this how a heroine is supposed to see the world?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked, big time","review":"I always read the reviews before buying authors I am not familiar with. I bought the first two books in this series even though there were people who had problems with it. Most of the reviews seemed positive. I ended up liking both books a lot. The characters were interesting, the plot lines involving and the writing good.I got to this one, and....it was awful. She had switched characters but that was no excuse for making the characters uninteresting and one dimensional. She'd introduce a character that seemed mildly interesting and then just make them do strange things. The villain, a half demon woman, especially seemed to do strange things. I found the idea of the cabals interesting, but not enough to make up a total lack of interesting plot. After two good books, I wonder what went wrong with this one?So I'm not sure about subsequent books. Do I take a chance or not? And I obviously can't trust the reviews any more since this book had very positive ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Book","review":"I love Kelley Armstrong's werewolf books. Bitten and Stolen really captured me to the point where I read them both in one sitting. Dimestore Magic was not one of those reads. The heroine, Paige, was REALLY annoying. She doesn't have a backbone or any commen sense. She really lacks the edge and strength that Elena (heroine from Bitten and Stolen) has in abundance. The other characters didn't really impress me that much either. That being said, the book is not terrible. It is just not up to par with Kelley Armstrong's other books. If you haven't read her other books I recommend starting with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read","review":"I just finished reading this book, and I think it is fantastic! Right away, I ordered the first, second (I didn't know this was the third book in the series), fourth, and fifth books in the series. I am super excited to read them all.The plot line was great, and the main character was very realistic, as were the minor characters. I would definitely recommend this book to all my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring.","review":"This is my first time read from this author. I kept waiting for the adult version to come through. I think this is more on the scale of a teen witch novel. I am use to reading books by Kim Harrison, Carrie Vaughn, Patricia Briggs, Kim Harrison.

Dime Store Magic, exactly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of 2.13.61 publications","review":"This book contains a great array of mixed emotions,feelings and thoughts. It contains extracts from the various authors at Henry Rollins' publishing company, 2.13.61.

These artists include, The great Hubert Shelby, JNR. Jefferey Lee Pierce, Ian Shoales, Bill Shields, Iggy Pop, Henry Miller, Don Bajema, the late Joe Cole and \\"Suicides\\" frontman Alan Vega, plus many more. This is a great book for anyone wanting a \\"sneek peak\\" at some of the greatest writing that we may see in this day and age. These guys are raw and intense. This book is intense.

I called and was told it was a defect and would do a warranty exchange. I was under the impression they would send it out but when I called, I was told I was supposed to send in $14.95 for shipping or I could give them a charge card and they would charge it again to ship out a new one and credit when I returned it. The new unit I received has had problems with the digital timer displaying the timer but rather than to have a short so rat her than do the return thing again I just used a manual timer. It baked a bit more evenly and was fast but still needed to rotate pans.

Kunzel and the Cincinatti Pops oompah-oompah exactly the same way throughout the work. Even in the Bacarolle!But the recording quality is truly awful. It sounds like the bass drum was placed 20 feet IN FRONT of the orchestra. In fact, on some tracks one can hardly hear the orchestra over the drum. This gets really irritating after a while.Every other version I've heard is far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cord to play music through your Wave Sound System","review":"I used to use a simple RCA cord to play music to my Wave music player by BOSE, which did work but the sound often felt muffled. I was thinking of the more pricey Ipod attachment which is priced at $99 butI got this cord and it does the job very well. A lot of reviews have complained about the length of the cord but it can either be left in the original factory fold or if you need to increase the length tie it up with the tie provided. The sound quality is an improvement and it helps if you have the songs in the highest bit rate possible. Set it up is simple. What I have noticed about this product that it somehow sucks more power out of the Ipod classic and this is because make sure that you pause the song or the podcast that you were playing not doing so will cause the Ipod to drain all your power.This product is an improvement in sound quality and is priced reasonably."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap is what you asked for","review":"for the amount of money spent, its prbably worth it. but thats assuming you dont care about sound quality, i made the mistake of buying it, but it was cheap and gt the job done. just not as i wanted it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned","review":"Similar to another review, which I figured was just a fluke, it did not work with my iPod Touch 3G in 3 different outlets (2 cars and one stereo).

The cable itself is very flexible, however this may be it's downfall, it lasted just under a year before it died completely.

So do not buy if you are using a 2nd gen itouch as it will not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cable if you don't need to power your Ipod","review":"I did quite a bit of research before deciding on this cable. The sound quality via this connection to the Aux in on my Chevy Impala is the best that it can get. I recommend this to anyone looking for good sound, but who doesn't need to power the device at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great with IPod Nano and '08 GTI","review":"This cable works just as advertised; a line level mp3 input. That is much better than using the headphone jack. Note: This product does NOT allow you control to the Ipod through the stereo, nor does it charge the Ipod. But it does not claim to and nothing at this price will. The only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars is that I just got it and can't comment on longevity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"But, a warning: it will not work with the iPhone 3G at all.I didn't down-rate this because I originally bought this with the intention of having line-out from the iPod Photo 80GB, which does indeed work.

It looks clean.It is compatible with iPod Nano 6th Gen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great solution to technical difficuties","review":"I bought this cable because the headphone Jack on my iPod broke. I didn't want to take it to a repairman who may not know what to do, and I didn't want to replace it so soon. So I looked for any cheap alternative, and I came across this. I saw iPod dock connector to 3.5mm jack, and I thought that I could do something with that. So I run the 3.5mm jack into a female-to-female into headphones, and it works perfectly. The only downside is that it doesn't respond to the volume on your iPod, but a necessary sacrifice, and the preset volume is perfect. Not to loud and not to soft. Perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to My Cooper","review":"This adapter plays my iPod so much clearer than the FM transmitter. I only wish I could control the power of my iPod as well.

Is compatible with my 5G iPod with video. I was previously using a Belkin transmitter that came from the Apple store - cost about $70 and worked well. Downside of using the transmitter is while traveling I'd have to change the station several times due to static. With the auxiliary cable I have clear sound at all times, plus I've noticed improved sound quality/louder volume. Downside to this cable is that it doesn't charge the iPod, as many others have said, but that makes sense considering that it doesn't plug into the power outlet..."},{"rating":"2","title":"works perfect for my new 09 jetta S California Edition","review":"I ordered this for my new car, arrived in 5 days with Free Supersave shipping.

Turn up the volume if you think the sound is not loud enough"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great in my Jetta","review":"This cable works really well. I had a few concerns prior to purchasing. I was worried that 1) it would not be the correct type of cable I needed to fit my VW Jetta, and 2) I thought 4 feet may be too long. I was wrong on both accounts. The cable fits my 4th generation IPod Nano to my Jetta perfectly. The volume works great and the sound is very clear. Also 4 feet is perfect - any shorter would have been too short to get the cord across the glove compartment and into my center console.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because, like others have mentioned, it would be nice if it also charged the IPod. It hasn't been a big problem though, because the IPod battery is pretty good.I'd recommend this product to anyone who is tired of burning CDs with music from their IPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with iPhone 3Gs","review":"Hooking up AV stuff and making it work is something I do for fun and I could not get the iPhone 3Gs to play through the car stereo with this cable.

However my IPOD NANO version 5 did not recognize it and continued to play music over the internal speaker instead of sending through the cord to my car's auxiliary input. I went to Best Buy and bought a cable that works with a NANO version 5 and everything worked perfectly so it was definitely this cable that caused the problem. Nothing in the advertising indicates a need to be version specific but at Best Buy all the docking items listed what versions they were compatible with.

But who could blame them."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT Don't waste your money!","review":"The other reviewers have it right - the marvelous talent of Andrea Bocelli is being ruined by his handlers. This CD is boring, boring, boring. For some reason, Bocelli in English is just not as compelling....he sounds like a high-school kid reciting phoenetically from a cheat-sheet.And Catherine McPhee? Give me a break! If I want to listen to the over-marketed screaming of a talent-show runner-up, I'd tune in to the lowbrow American Idol. When I buy Bocelli, I expect to hear Bocelli. If he insists on a duet, at least choose someone of his caliber.I'm glad this was a gift, so I didn't waste any money on it. I'll be \\"re-gifting\\" it. Andrea, you've disappointed legions of fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring tenor turned pop singer","review":"almost every song he sang sounded the same. deadbeat, robotic and boring. just like a high school student memorized a whole textbook and recited it carefully with eyes closed. no passion, no depth, no feeling at all.it's not about how high you can reach, you need different feelings and emotions to interpret, convey, extend, relay and distinguish the meanings of every song, not just by memorizing and singing them out carefully with no passion, no emotion, no nothing.i've studied every one of bocelli's arias and his pop songs but simply failed to be moved or touched in the least way. all of his stuff are just skin-deep with a 2 bits face value."},{"rating":"1","title":"sick","review":"My Kindle was stolen and the sick person who stole it ordered this book. I guess he would qualify as one of the most evil people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you know how to fact check?","review":"Only buy this book for someone if you want them to have a lot of the wrong information. In his introduction the author made slight sense, but it fell apart when I started reading about his first \\"evil\\" person and I noticed some information that was wrong (30 seconds with google and 2 ivy league college resources), I confirmed it. If you want to present new or different information, please do... but don't forget proof or at least a reason for the conflicting facts. Lastly, it is extremely difficult to apply today's ideals on the ancient world, or even the world 200 years ago. I feel that this is the author's biggest mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"While the stories are interesting and chock full of facts, it is poorly written.

Yes it is disturbing to read what people are capable of but still very fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"If you read any of the authors other books, he tends to repeat much of the same material.I also wonder if the author isn't a history buff cuz some of those chapters focus more on politics and war than the true crimes of the subject. I thought those sections were best left out. I didnt want a history lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sugar","review":"I ordered this hoping for a stereo version of classic big band hits. It is stereo, but it's that and a lot more. Big bands did not include a string section, for one thing. The extra orchestration ruined the music. It's guilding the lilly.If you want to hear great big band music recorded by one of the masters and his peers in stereo, buy The Benny Goodman Story.This over-produced schmaltz is a bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Old & New","review":"Imagine that great ol' big band classics recorded with nearly-original scores, but with the highest recording technology of today--no hiss and pop. That's what you'll hear on this fantastic recording. Some of the greatest contemporary musicians gather together to remake one hit after another. It's one top musician in team with another, but I was carried away by the clarinet artistry of Eddie Daniel whether he's doing his Artie Shaw imitation, or even the blackstick god, Bennie Goodman. They mix original scores with contemporary interludes and segues, doing justice to both. Really, it is a parade of hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game hard to control on pc","review":"We have the pc version and the PS2 version. Graphics on the pc are flawless but character is so much harder to control using default mouse and keyboard setup. I also tried using my Microsoft steering wheel and my joystick and its still hard to control.On the PS2 the graphics are less but the console game controller is so much eaier to to work with.Other then that the game is great, if you liked the Two Towers, you wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Hard Even on \\"Easy Level\\".","review":"I brought this for my 31 yr old son for the Holidays.

I thought I would never get that far. (Yes, I have spent a great deal of time playing games that are this difficult, but better designed). After you get the the 2nd level, what if you want to start a new game? The only way I could do it was to go to the Windows Task Manager and kill the process. After that, I had to restart the game and watch the video intro again. I know they are proud of the graphics (yes, I liked the movie), but...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Buy this game if you are looking to buy a new video card anyway and you enjoy continual frustration. It did take a while to get the hang of the commands, and the route with Frodo and Gandalf are alright, but I have tried and failed to defeat the King of the Dead so many times that I finally just quit. I play these games to relax and this just doesn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda silly","review":"Return of the crap is more like it.

We have this game and I have finished it, and the end is cool, there are secret codes like Infinite Missiles, Perfect Mode, Unvulnerable and more. (You have to finish the game to get them!!!!!)This is the best PC game I have ever come across, plus the most fun. Also, there are 5 or 6 other secrets at the end of the game, and an extra level.Plus, quick movie clips from the movie and the charaters actually look like the actors!!Get this game! It is DEFINITELY WORTH IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! The game is great! Got it for Christmas and have not put it away yet!Great Graphics, sound and Gameplay. Cutscenes are amazing! (You can skip them after watching them once by pressing ENTER.)The controls are weird, but you can configure them to your liking.Nine characters: The old trio, Gandalf, Sam and Frodo, and three secret characters.Thirteen levels plus other secret levels.WARNING: The game is VERY DIFFICULT!!! You will be fustraited. This game ranks among the most difficult games I have ever played in all the years of my life. But the more difficult something is, the longer it lasts you, and the more fun it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful!","review":"Very disappointing! If you buy this game make sure you read other reviews and go to the official website first! No where on the box description of requirements does it state that you need one of two specific video cards in your computer! It does say you need a 3D card with 32 MB - But it should also say on the box that you need one of two specific chipsets for your video card! It did not say that on the box I bought! Now I have a game that I cannot play! Trust me if you do not have a NVIDIA GeForce2 GTS or greater or ATI Radeon 7500 or greater chipset - it will not play! I have tried everything! In Amazon's requirements it does mention it but I did not come here first! I will next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK But not Great","review":"The game is ok if you like hack and slash, with little to no character development and no chance to create your own character. The clips are ok, but the movie was better. Go see the movie, if that's what you want, but don't get the game just for the clips. The DVD will be out soon enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a great game","review":"this games is cool a lot of say this game is no good because the levels are to hard that is because they have a ps2 or a consal and you can get cheat codes with the consal and there hard to find on pc the levels are chaleging but fun this game has very good graphis so if you want a chaleging game and you like lord or the rings this is the game for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"REQUIRES 32MB AGP Graphics Card!","review":"I know others have mentioned it, but I spent about an hour before leaving work looking for system requirements. They weren't listed on the official site, Amazon, and any other major electronics retail outlets sites. So I figured my recently purchased laptop would be sufficient. Shelled out my bucks, got the game, started loading it and saw the Video Card requirements. Nothing in the install mentioned it or tested for it. The install took 45+ min (2 discs!). Only when you try to start the game does it check your video card and fail. Wouldn't even start! So I can't review it. I can't even play it!I've played the Two Towers game on Playstation2 and this was supposed to be better. I was hoping to play it on my PC, but I guess I'll wait. (Sigh!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game Sucks.","review":"I played the game for the PC. I disliked it. It was really repetitive and boring. I wasn't having fun at all. I decided to uninstall it. It deleted everything in the folder in which it was installed. This included 3 GB of valuable files that had taken me a long time to acquire. Not only did the game suck, but the uninstall program sucked even more! I know that's hard to believe, but believe me. Don't get this game, but if its too late for that, don't install it because if you ever take the program down, it will bring others along. If its installed already, you're stuck with it forever, unless you want to lose valuable programs as well. Nice going EA Games."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money.... stupid EA games","review":"Spent 40 dollars on this game. Get it home, wait a HALF AN HOUR for it to install itself... only to get an error message. Even though on the back of the box, it said you should have a 32 MB graphics card, which I have, it turns out my card isn't good enough, and the jerks at EA games want me to shell out a hundred bucks for a new one. Would have been nice if they warned me BEFORE I spent all the time and money on it. To be fair, there were some types of cards listed below the 32 meg requirement, but I figured they were just examples, and the 32 meg was what mattered. STUPID EA GAMES! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE! EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE A PRETTY DESCENT COMPUTER, THERE IS A GOOD POSSABILITY THIS TRASH WON'T WORK! thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Game has average graphics (I've seen better though), but that's about it.

When it wouldn't run, I asked my boyfriend, who is a computer expert, what the problem was, and he said it was that I didn't have the right video card. I ended up buying a new video card, and since then the game runs perfectly. Challenging game, even on easy level, but fun. However, cutscenes are tedious after the first time or two. Also, the game is much easier to play with a gamepad than with keyboard and mouse. Buy it if you are a LOTR fan, but first make sure your computer meets the requirements, especially the video card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Game","review":"This game is pure action. No puzzles but some strategy. Action in third person and many characters: Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf, Sam, Frodo and other hidden characters.The line mission will be growing in parallel, according your selected character.Be careful with system requirements, my PC is middle size: 512M RAM, 20 Gb hard disk, Athlon 1.3GHz CPU, clone computer and a ATI 7500.

It was one of my two favorites. My first favorite was Samantha and the Cowboy. I really like the ones by Heath the best. But I did think that this one could have used a bit more action. I mean whenever the charactors got together they didnt really do a whole lot and lets face it! we are teen girls who are looking for a true, passonate romance not a little peck on the cheek! But I still really enjoyed this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not great","review":"I agree with the other reviewer that gave it two stars.

My 7 and 5 year old were able to work the game, so it doesn't seem too difficult. It was lots of fun and one of the better sports game I've seen for Gamecube in a long time.

Hopefully Santa will deliver this on time!!Update: the review above was written when the game was not available to the public. Obviously, it is now and we own a copy.

I'd say get it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strikers SUCKS","review":"This game is NOT worth $20. It's barely worth $5! I can't believe that I got stiffed $50 when it came out! The controls are mediocre, and you can't even use the goalie (you have to trust the dumb CPU, which misses a lot) You can only switch characters to the one (on defense) who is closest to the ball, and (on offense) who has the ball, so you can't use even the simplest real soccer play. For example, you can't use a give-and-go because the CPU won't move around the defender. Also, the total lack of penalties makes it ridiculous. I know someone who gets an advantage by giving the ball to the defense, then slamming the player with the ball into the ground and making off with the ball. The out-of-bounds area is replaced by, of all things, an impenetrable, high-voltage, electric fence. in short, a god-awful game, a first for Mario, and I don't recommend buying it for more than $10. OH MY GOD, THEY'VE MADE ANOTHER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mario gets Striked","review":"So far since I've been playing this game (Super Mario Strikers), it makes no sense.

If someone touches the fence they scream a terrible scream that you don't want to hear and when they are electricuted you see their bones and organs EEEWWW!!!

Both MALICK cd's ( the other one with AMYL JUSTIN ) are excellent listening and will grow on you with every listen. I have 1000 or so cd's and both of MALICK's cd's still get regular airplay.

I've split signals between my DVD recorder with a QAM tuner and to a Broadcast-on-demand cable box. I've even used two splitters in series in order to get more connections.

Not only at the hammy, \\"hello, lovelies...\\" pose on the cover but at the years the collection spans. These are widely (and rightfully) considered Bowies worst years and the songs he cranked out are proof of it. I suppose this collection sort of has to exist but it is unfortunate. This album should be purchased only if you are a) an avid collector, b) a soulless bore of a human being (in which case I hear Phil Collins has a few records out), or c) looking for a good white elephant gift for the office party.I feel that I should mention that I am a huge Bowie fan. I own every studio album he has put out - yes, even the bad ones. I should also mention that Bowie himself has said many times that he was creatively bankrupt in the 80s.

But the worst sin was including Rosemary Clooney's absolutely embarrassing renditions of two pop standards, with her age-ravaged voice of poor quality, lack of breath control and total inability to sustain any note. The treble boy's voice was not so attractive to my ears as to the others who wrote reviews.

I enjoyed this book, but it definitely has its weaknesses. It moves around very fast in a fragmented way. On one hand I enjoyed something that moved so fast but on the other hand it lacked continuity because of the way it moves ahead. It read like an editor may have chopped out some major transition parts.And somehow you don't feel for the characters that others books have the ability to make you feel. But the book has such wisdom in it that I had to give it 5 stars.It is more realistic that a lot of books in this genre, and so it is a LITTLE depressing. More so than any of the other similar books like this I have read. I agree with the reviewer who gave it a low review because of this, but for me the good far outweighs the bad and I still think it deserves 5 stars.

I liked her a lot better after her apparent personality transplant halfway through, but I never felt any affection for her.

Seren was goodness, strength, kindness and innocent sexiness. Kerrigan was gorgeous, evil, mean, strong, funny and forgiveable. Yes, I said Forgiveable. Half way through the book I could not see how Kinley McGregor/Sherrilyn Kenyon would make the King of the Demon World Redeemable. She did it. Excellently! The sub-characters, i.e.: Agravian, Blaise, Garafyn, Gawain were great and totally interesting to the point where you cannot wait for their books.

Still I trudged through and made myself finish even when the story is thrown into the future where there is an RV, Star Trek conventions, and then I couldn't wait until the end.I really like Kinley's other books and just couldn't believe that she actually wrote this book.

Of all my trumpet CDs, this is my favorite, for that matter out of all my CDs it is my favorite. Definately Recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"If you have never seen Doc live, this would be a good substitute! This CD covers a good range of music without feeling like a \\"bits and pieces\\" album. I still have my trumpet, and if it was possible, I would have worn out many copies of this CD since its release way back when."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doc at his best!!","review":"Of course, we all knew and loved Doc Severerinsen as the top shelf band leader fronting the top-shelf Tonight Show Band when Johnny was at the helm. But this collection shows Doc as he really is.....not \\"just\\" a top lead trumpet man, but indeed, a top trumpet player. He appproaches ALL music with a seriousness and respect that only a true musician can bring to a composition, no matter WHAT the genre. All great instrumentalists will tell you that the goal is to sound as much like the human voice as possible. As Doc approaches the Puccini suite, you understand what they mean. His technique is beyond category, able to deliver nuance and expression as any instrumentalist (and vocalist!) would ever hope to. This is a must for any music lover, and for any student of the trumpet.....time to go to school! And bring a lunch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic tour de force","review":"I have been a fan of Doc's for decades, but the reason I am recommending this album is the sound. It is an incredible recording. Combine the searing sonics with the astonishing energy of Doc and you get an album that will literally blow you away. Provided you have a good enough sound system. Otherwise, it's still a nice album."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET THIS CD, GET LIFTED","review":"This CD is simply amazing. I have been to two of JL shows and this DVD does capture the element and energy of this electrifying artist and band. If you missed his show, cop this CD, get some wine and prepare to take off! Each song is performed with such energy and sensuality. He even gives you a sneak peak of Again, a song that will be on his sophmore album. I wish he had debuted Feak Out also. That's my only beef with the DVD. This CD further cements John as what he really is...a LEGEND!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome LIVE Talent = a must buy DVD","review":"I saw John Legend In Ireland a few months ago and wow what a talent. This man can definately put on a show and i cant wait to get this dvd.....His voice, his talent on the keys and his band are amazing.

I cannot believe that it took the authors years to write this crap. Don't get me wrong, it is entertaining enough and reads quickly but nowhere near as good as the other books in the wonderful series. It is far too short and cursory in many of its aspects. It is a big let-down. I guess the authors figured that those who liked the series will read the book no matter how badly it is written. I was dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"TGI over","review":"Robert Heinlein in the classic Citizen of the Galaxy wrote describing a bad play:\\"The first Krausa had been a saint with a heart of steel.

As the play ends they jump off into space, to spread culture and wealth through the Galaxy.\\"This reference jumped into my mind in reading this book. I had to see what the conclusion of the series was, but was sadly disappointed. All the good guys, and their remarkable wives, are saints. In five years the world progresses from post-roman empire technology to American civil war/ WWI. Link, the evil machine, seems to have had its programing stop with Douglas Haig.Based on the first couple of books, they could have done better. Can't help but think the book was the product of opinion polls and focus groups of ten year olds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite up to par","review":"This book ends the Belisarius Saga, but just a little too tritely in my opinion. Lots of action, but too many flashback episodes, as if the authors had run out of things to say. Overall, I liked it and have loved the series. These two are the masters of alternate reality fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait!","review":"This long delayed conclusion to the series was well worth waiting for - the authors did a magnificent job of making a strongly foreshadowed conclusion both dramatic and satisfying, while providing some plot twists that were enjoyable without seeming strained.I very much hope that the entire series will be published in a two or three volume hardcover edition, similar to the 'General' series - I would happily purchase such a set, to consolidate my current collection of paperbacks, download (from the Baen Free Library) and this most recent hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not worth waiting years for","review":"I was a little angry it took so long for the last book in the series to come out. But closure was worth something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Western with plenty of parental advice","review":"Cahill is a somewhat different Western than most of John Wayne's film. Cahill tries to tackle a pretty serious topic - what happens when a father is not involved in raising his boys. Pretty heavy stuff for a Western. In this case - the film does a decent job pulling it off. Because of his neglect, or perhaps inspired by it, Cahill's sons participate in a bank robbery. The Duke spends the rest of the movie trying to find the culprits.There are some good action scenes in the film, and George Kennedy is excellent as the main bad guy. If you like John Wayne movies with a somewhat serious theme, then you will enjoy this one. It reminds a little bit of the Cowboys."},{"rating":"2","title":"cahill us marshall","review":"good movie with john wayne. a western with a little different twist to the conventional western. wayne is estranged from his sons who of course get into trouble involved in a robbery. good cast"},{"rating":"2","title":"Results of Dad not being home, neglect of family life...","review":"I liked this story, and the way that it was acted out by John Wayne. A \\"Duke Turkey\\" it isn't, as it shows the all-too-familiar results of what happens when Dad isn't around to take care of the children - a sad case of fatherhood today. John Wayne Plays a U.S. Marshall who's out after the bad guys...but ends up with a surprise when his two sons turn out to have helped out in a murder/robbery. Somehow (we aren't told how), Cahill knows his young sons are in cahoots with George Kennedy's bad guys, and they end up l;eading him right to the criminals and culprits, which ends in a wild shoot-out. It also shows that a father's teachings, despite his absence, can be the deciding factor in children's lives, as Cahill's two sons actually do the right thing in the end.Good Drama! Excellent storyline, though rather dark, and does have violence, but an all-around GOOD John Wayne movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great classic","review":"was a great John Wayne classic is one of the most action pistol slinging John Wayne movies ive ever had the pleaser of watching"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull in the Saddle","review":"A tired John Wayne vehicle from the 1970s, with the Duke going through the motions in a typical Western melodrama. Director Andrew V. McLaglen shows little enthusiasm for the preachy script while underusing a fine array of character actors. The opening scene falls painfully flat in its attempt to emulate Clint Eastwood's \\"Dirty Harry.\\" Sorry to say, but \\"Cahill\\" looks like a made-for-TV movie that somehow acquired a major box-office star."},{"rating":"2","title":"The critics are too harsh","review":"So the Duke is getting a little long in the tooth. His inimitable style, tough-talkin', swaggerin' self is as true here as his more famous films. After all, it IS John Wayne.In this plot, J. D. Cahill, a widower and federal marshall has neglected the upbringing of his boys - one surmises because of his duty to his country and the wild, uncivilized territory. But in a youthful, rebellious spirit, his boys throw their lot in with some real outlaws. And it spells trouble. Big trouble. The kind of trouble that only Cahill - U.S. Marshall - can fix.The movie is fun and entertaining. A couple of hours spent lost in a time when the west was young and the nation herself was immature and rebellious."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Wayne","review":"For people who have never watched fairly clean movies then John Waynes will be a pleasure to watch.

In Cahill you see the style and character of the man as you would expect him to be off camera as well as in the role of a U.S. Marshall.

It was weird! I don't think anyone would respond so favorably to learning that the people they thought were their parents are not. She just got over it too quickly.Still, I'm enjoying this series and have moved on to the third book, \\"The Sacrifice.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad yet sweet","review":"While reading I knew that there was going to be a twist in the story.

Although her opinion matters, she is not the best judge for the following reasons. Given that the book portrays the baby in some potentially dangerous situations and implies that \\"baby angels\\" will guard the child, I think that this book paints an inaccurate picture for young children. When children slip away from their parents, there is no guarantee that baby angels will save them from cars or other hazards. Also, immediately following the second reading of this book, my child climbed out of her crib (then 20 months old), just like the child in the book.

The title character may be a \\"stupid boy\\", but he is smarter than some previous reviewers. He knows he is limited.The boy must have been brought up by a television set. He has arrived in late adolescence profoundly ignorant, but conscious and ashamed of it. He tries to acquire an identity from the maternal woman with whom he lives, and from the men whom he charges for sex. As he proceeds, he becomes more ambivalent about his gay identity.The gentle apposition of conflicting emotions, the poignant, not prurient use of nudity, the sweet acting, the loving insights of the filmmakers into the character, establish this film as a penetrating and sympathetic work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I really enjoy most gay-themed independent films, and this is up there with the best.

They did for the 2 times she used it, then the flimsy inflatable material which is attached to a cheap metal rod tore straight across. A metal rod runs THROUGH a sleeve in the upper and lower end of this float to attach it to the pontoons. The material is thin and the stress points go right across the seams in the plastic/rubber sleeves. Even if my sister weighed 95 lbs. I bet this thing would have torn in a month or less. And, I would like to add, she did not \\"flop\\" on it or jump on it; just sat down and it tore.

As the oven is used, the thermostat distorts. Temperature is lower and lower and lower, actually changing a bit during extended use. The oven, used twice a week for one hour each time, now heats to 300 degrees when set to 350 degrees - and temperature drops if the oven is used longer. This seems entirely due to use of a cheap thermostat unit that gradually distorts during use and that never returns to original shape. Thus the unit will require a good oven thermometer to compensate and monitoring at all times - an intolerable situation. do NOT buy this oven.While the physical design is superb, the thermostat's gradual cumulative inaccuracy makes this unit undependable for most purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well-could be built better","review":"This cooks good but the metal cabinet is too thin.The appliance gets extremely hot to the touch and can cause serios burns to kids or pets.Must stay w/and supervise the whole time!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Size and Bakes Beautifully","review":"I recently bought this to use only for baking.

Who knows? Anyway it is an LP's worth CD of guitar super heroics, organing, and fierce drumming. Also, if you have the need for speed this is the CD that you should listen to to fully develop speed aspects.

The book begins with a scientist finding a zombie dog. Then the two do an abundance of scientific experiments on the dog, only to suddenly assume (with no proof) that special people can raise the dead. They then set out to find them. Then, with little warning we're years later and there's been a tremendous change to our society. We have no idea how it happened; all we know is that it did. Then towards the end, just as suddenly, it changes again. It's almost as if he put three different stories ideas together without doing the work to make them flow together. The book left me unsatisfied and confused (and missing my $15).If I could suggest something to the author, it would be to work another couple of years on this book and make it the great novel it should've been."},{"rating":"2","title":"The voice that never ages","review":"When I was a youngster, folk music was \\"fashionable\\" and easily found. Not so easy was the kind of music that someone isolated from other cultures could hope to appreciate. Theodore Bikel is one of the amazingly talented souls who was able to bridge that gap, come into our lives and whisper the truth that no matter how different we are, there is a commonality and a way to reach out. His voice is beautiful ... robust or loving or gentle ... a tool he uses to reach the heart. I find it difficult after all these years to label him, for anything he sets himself to is extraordinary.

Alex Rodriguez is an operative in the top-secret SDDU, a counterterrorism squad jam-packed with men to drool over. He's been assigned to protect Nicola Barrington, the feisty daughter of a US Senator, whether she likes it or not. And she doesn't. She's spent years trying to get away from the suffocation of unwanted protection, but when an attempt on her life comes uncomfortably close to success, she has no choice but to allow Alex into her life.I don't know how Marton does it, but somehow, she manages to keep up a gripping, rollicking pace with the adventure story, while still somehow building a luscious romance between her two protagonists. Excellent.

Now a new spin brings basic vocabulary to another language. Latin, often thought to be the \\"dead\\" language, is brought alive with something other than the so called \\"dead guys.\\" Here the reader can have a basis in the book, and verse, beforehand and see it and Latin anew in this translation. The translators do a marvelous job of mimicing the rhythm and meter of Seuss's charming tale. And with the Seuss drawings intact the connection between the text in Latin and the story is there to help you along. It makes Latin accessible and that's not a small feat. Read it aloud and you feel so very intelligent. Try this book - it's fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latin for learners","review":"Very pleased with the Cat in the Hat in Latin.

I always liked the language because the stories in it (mostly Roman history) are good -- but it helps having something newer around written in it to relate to (I also loved finding 'Winnie Ille Pu' when I was learning Latin) -- this Cat in the Hat has a whole new take on Latin in rhyming poetry and it's just easy to 'get' when you know the original. I also ordered him 'Harry Potter' in Latin (Dominus et Domina Dursley!) -- I think knowing the plot and having some interest made the verbs easier to grasp and you start just leaping into it faster. Cat in the Hat has a good glossary of English word translations in the back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive yet easy to access","review":"Definitive XSLT and XPath covers XSLT in great detail, but without losing the reader.

But with a frying pan, I made eggs like twice a year - it just wasn't worth it! Eggs with the eggwave do not come out perfectly every times, but pretty close. Eggs are 95% perfect 95% of the time, if that makes sense. And clean-up is a breeze. (Put in dishwasher) The yolk separator works great too. The eggs end up muffin shaped and fall right out of the eggwave onto your plate - to me, they taste fine - i just gobble them down, no salt, no pepper - like i said, this isn't for anyone who wants a fancy or delicate tasting egg, but for the rest of us, it sure beats clean-up!

In fact, you would think it was just a sequel, another chapter,from that other film. The cast is nearly as impressive: Steve McQueen, Robert Wagner, even the gawky, future Phantom Of The Opera and Shirley Anne Field. Adapted from the John Hersey novel, this is authentic to the details. On-location footage in England, stock air-to-air combat realism, interior footage make this real in every way. Every war had its off-beat hero, probably every platoon, a guy who takes every death-defying mission, even to spare some greenhorn, yet does his glorious best. The camaraderie, class elitism on base is accurate to the letter. Custer had it coming, and he went anyway. This is the way it was, catch a ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"War Lover","review":"Simply stated, this is more than just another McQueen movie. The War Lover offer dynamics that are frequently missing in so-called war/action movies.

Thanks Sam."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great idea, but incomplete","review":"Erich Kunzel plays the Bond themes? What a great idea! In addition, there are a few more selections in the same vein, like the cops-n-robbers TV medley, music from The Untouchables, Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop, etc.Sometimes, you want to listen to the 007 music in instrumental only, and Kunzel and the Cincinatti Pops do a good job with the arrangements. But where are the rest of the songs? Missing are three of my all-time favorites, You Only Live Twice, Diamonds Are Forever, and Moonraker. I think the album would be better with 'more Bond, less other.' We certainly don't need TWO selections from Dick Tracy. And the theme from Darkman is stylistically quite similar to Dick Tracy; nothing is gained by playing both. Don't get me wrong; I like Danny Elfman (check out his \\"Beetlejuice\\" theme on Kunzel's 'Great Fantasy Adventure Album').

We had to have a tech come out, climb the pole to turn our uplink back on, and provide a new splitter.This one was \\"putting noise back into the line\\", and their policy is to have guys drive up and down the street, unhook any connections that are affecting the network, and then let the situation sort itself out.The tech noted that all of my cables were fine, it was just the splitter.

Even the solved problems at the end of each chapter are extremely helpful for explaining the basic concepts. My only criticism is that all problems sets to work out on your own are solved directly below each problem.

Finally, the first in the series is here.For many years because of this series, William Powell and Myrna Loy were America's sweetheart couple. They seem so natural on screen as a married couple that it's hard to believe they're acting.William Powell is the debonair and charming alcoholic detective Nick Charles. Myrna Loy is Nora, the rich society deb he's married to. The general plot is that while he would like to give up detecting, Nora finds his sleuthing to be exciting and won't let him give it up entirely. Their famous dog Asta helps and hinders them throughout each film.Many young performers like Jimmy Stewart and Cesar Romero have bit parts in these films that are fun to see today.I'm looking forward to the rest of The Thin Man series becoming available on DVD. Hurry!! Hurray!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm gonna put 'em in a room...","review":"A wonderful mix of chemistry, a bit of mystery, dialog that truly \\"pops\\", along with great source material make this picture a tremendous load of fun and laughs. Spawned numerous sequels (in true sequel fashion: keep what audiences talked about, loose the rest) that don't compare to the original. If you're looking for an enjoyable picture with witty dialog and rapid fire comedy (both spoken and physical) this is just the shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jump-start for detective thrillers!","review":"The detective thriller had a highly successful jump-start for paying audiences with this witty comedy/mystery that introduced the world to the team of Nick and Nora Charles. William Powell and Myrna Loy would be paired together in many more films together (including the many Thin Man sequels), but they were never better than when they played the detective duo, a society couple with a nosy dog who decide to get to the bottom of a murder case when Maureen O'Sullivan asks them to help out her suspect father by convincing them that she is the really guilty one. The Charleses get involved for the fun of it, and you yourself will have a great time watching them do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powell and Loy made the perfect screen couple.","review":"Every time I see this movie, I am bowled over by the charm and deftness of William Powell and Myrna Loy, who deserve far more attention than they get from today's movie buffs. Tracy and Hepburn pale in comparison with Powell and Loy (don't even get me started on Julia Roberts and Richard Gere!). This is a movie to watch and delight in over and over, the solution of the mystery being by far the least interesting part of it! (One should note that Loy--with the help or hindrance, however you care to interpret it, of Asta the Fox Terrier--makes what is probably the most spectacular comic entrance in the history of the movies.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick and Nora outside the studio......","review":"As an aside, I read a funny little story about how well William Powell and Myrna Loy got along in real life. Somewhere about 1937 or 1938 a magazine ran a nationwide poll to determine the most popular actor and actress in Hollywood. The response to the poll was huge, with Clark Gable and Myrna Loy winding up being the winners.William Powell finished 4th in the actor's category, and wasn't about to take this lying down. He sent Myrna a long, florist box filled with sour grapes. The attached card read \\"Congratulations, from William the Fourth\\".Gotta love it....... ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Encourages alcoholism.","review":"William Powell and Myrna Loy, the actors playing the husband and wife, are likeable with some playful banter.However, William Powell plays a detective who is an alcoholic, stumbling around, always with a drink in hand, but miraculously sobers up at key moments. I did not like the film's promotion of alcoholism.The respected businessman has a mistress, and his mistress is sleeping around with a couple of other guys. I did not like this theme either.The businessman regularly goes out of town, and does not tell anyone where he is going or for how long. Thus, the script-writer too conveniently sets this guy up for easy murder.The idea of husband and wife detectives is a good one, and the actors were likeable, but I was disappointed in the script, and have thrown this DVD away."},{"rating":"2","title":"He didn't come anywhere near my tabloids.","review":"Simply one of the greatest mystery movies ever. William Powell and Myrna Loy make a great team in the film. The cinematography is wonderful, even for the time. The lighting is so well done...You could probably get better facts about the movie from reviews by Ebert or others here. Here are my opinions on the DVD:The image is top-notch. There is some scars such as scratches and lines, but that's it. The grain is faint, as if this DVD was mastered off an interpositive made off the original nitrate negative. The picture is razor sharp for its vintage, too. The sound is always clear so you can hear all the witty dialogue. Not a lot for extras, but you do get 6 trailers, one for each Thin Man film. All in pretty good quality.This is a must own, especially for amazon.com's low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOXED SET PLEASE! WITH \\"ASTA EXTRAS\\"!","review":"A great movie with a great DVD presentation, BUT it's only the first of the series. WE NEED THEM ALL.Let's all lobby Warners for a complete DVD Boxed Set, with great extras. Did all of you THIN MAN fans out there know, for instance, that there is a terrific behind-the-scenes short subject (produced at the time of the original films, and now shown from time to time on Turner Classic Movies) that profiles the canine actor who so endearingly played Nick and Nora's talented terrier Asta?!

Van Dyke's filming of Dashiell Hammett's saucy detective novel features the first inspired teaming of William Powell and Myrna Loy, note-perfect as high-living detective couple Nick and Nora Charles.

Nick Charles: Yes, it's putting me way behind in my drinking.","review":"It is not easy to make a good comedy or a good mystery but to combine two genres together and make Comedy / Crime / Mystery as sparkling, funny, elegant and dynamic as 93 minutes long \\"The Thin Man\\" (1934) directed by W.S. Van Dyke is incredibly marvelous. The film owes a lot of its charm to the great working chemistry between two main characters, the husband and wife sleuths, Nora and Nick Charles, a rich and adventurous woman and her ex-detective husband. Nick is not too interested in going back to work on the case because \\"it's putting him way behind in his drinking\\" but Nora sees it as an exiting adventure. They solve a murder case (actually, three murders case) somewhere between couple of drinks during the never-ending party at their house.Bill Powell and Myrna Loy deserve Oscar for the Best On-Screen Couple of the Year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny who-dun-it","review":"Still funny after all these years.

The only problem I had with it was that the case had been altered with a one and a half inch cut on the back of the case through the bar code/proof of purchase area. It's not a big deal, but there was no indication in the description that the case would be in this condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic","review":"Not too much to add to other reviews. This is a very fun movie: the banter between Powell and Loy makes the film. The mystery itself didn't draw me in too much, but I didn't mind because the characters are great to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schism","review":"This film details the story of a man who is struggling with the effects of Alzheimer's disease. Neil, the main character of this story, is hospitalized after breaking his hip. He heals, but is not allowed to leave the hospital. He makes a number of friends, but begins thinking that there is a conspiracy against him. This is not true as it is a product of his Alzheimer's disease, yet it is disturbing for him nonetheless. He begins to lose his memory and hear voices that are not really there. This film gives us a view of Alzheimer's through the eyes of someone who is actually experiencing it. The construction of the movie is successful in allowing us to feel like we are going through this struggle with Neil. It is a truly eye-opening film that everyone should see in order to understand the workings of the brain.

Aksyonov speaks from too haughty a perch for my taste, as I've never been able to personally relate any experiences in this novel with those of my own personal life; which, in my own literary assessment, should be the goal of almost any enjoyable literature. But perhaps I'll give The Burn another chance, but for now (after traversing through Gravity's Rainbow, Death on the Installment Plan, etc...) I may have become rather irritated with such a sloppy telling of a story, which, after all, should be the base point of the damn thing. Aksyonov, doing ZERO research, stinks of literary connection. And that kills, absolute and total."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof that Russians are as oversexed as we are...","review":"\\"The Burn\\" attempts to be an encompassing, surreal novel about life in Russia during the 60s and 70s, but instead, the book has a confusing narrative that muddles who is speaking. Characters that are one dimensional and are interested only in sex. Aksenov includes at least 10 graphic depictions of sex in this 528 page overblown novel. It earned 2 stars instead of one because parts were quite amusing, and told the truth, and I do give him credit for that, but I cannot give him more than that, because I did not enjoy reading this massive novel at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Kid-Oriented as I'd Hoped","review":"The authors suggest banning the use of the words \\"Yuk\\" and \\"Do I Have to Eat This?\\" I couldn't agree more, and I would start by banning recipes like Salmon Asparagus Roulade, Shrimp and Fish Mornay, Tuna Souffles, and Asparagus Crepes from a kids cookbook.

I also enjoyed the parts in the begining when the main character was describing her training on \\"the island\\".Raven or \\"my American\\" (the love interest) had no appeal and he had alot of ridiculous things to say.I love fantasy and I really was looking forward to reading this book.

After closing the book and gaining some distance, one begins to see how simple and predictable is the story line. But while steeped in the fragrant brew of the narrative as it progresses... Ahhh! it is so easy to be captivated. Very original style and point of view. Deliciously original premise! Somewhat flat plot and even flatter resolution. In my opinion, the style in this case outweighs the substance. And what a style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth reading","review":"The book flows very well. The realism of lives revealed to Tilo is chilling. I was specially dumb sturk by the story of Lalita. The cause of battered women, especially Indian is usually lost in honor and societal pressures. It is very difficult for members of an individualistic culture to understand the societal demands placed on a Indian woman. With her really great manner of writting, Ms. Divakaruni is able to present the case in simple terms.Even though the book flows very well, I think the ending of the book did not do justice to the rest of book. It was the sort of anticlimax I was not expecting and was not prepared for. The reason for Raven to come after Tilo was not strong enough. Reason for Tilo's intense desire for Raven still needed work.On the whole, however, the book is worth reading. I will never walk into an Indian grocery store and look at the woman behind the counter the same way agai"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated, over-hyped, amateurish and disappointing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the author's previous book (a collection of short stories called \\"Arranged Marriage\\") but this foray into magical realism left me cold. I was totally unimpressed by the plot, the main characters, and the writing style in general. There were a few bright spots, but the book just never came together.Magical realism is a powerful tool demanding a deft touch; unfortunately, \\"Mistress of Spices\\" was just plain clunky. It's a shame, because it probably could have been saved by a good editor and some thoughtful rewriting. I hope the author's next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated & sappy","review":"Though this book has some lovely passages & absorbing tableaus, much of it reads like a made-for-TV movie especially for those of us who have cut our teeth on Allende, Marquez & Robbins.Short stories may be a more appropriate form for this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book vs. the Movie","review":"Happened to watch the movie before reading the book....wish it wasn't that way.. the book says to the movie - \\"meh\\" ..

I have long had a passion for Indian authors, so any Indian book I read reminds me of freshly baked Naan and Salman Rushdie.I adore both, and generally love Indian Literature, especially the most exotic varieties. In that sense, 'Mistress of Spices' does not disappoint. I found a interest in spices slowly seeping into my body, and although the spice powers presented in this book are fictious, I have began to incorporate more into my cooking.At it's best, this book was an exotic, simple and swift read, full of love and and spices, and it worst it was a tad contrived. I think that 'Mistress of Spices' is well worth the time and effort, and I look forward to reading 'Arranged Marriages'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great \\"spiritual journeying\\" book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel by Chitra Divakaruni.

I also feel it is the best novel by an Indo-American writer that I have read. Mystic, realistic, lyrical, poetic are some adjectives that come to my mind.

At the conclusion, the reader would ask- what was the point? what was the story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"prose sweet and spicy as poetry","review":"Divakaruni's prose is as sweet and spicy, as teasing and searing as poetry. Open to almost any page and there is a passage there where the words just seem to dance on your tongue. Oh, to be able to write like this!Behind the obvious story of a woman inhabiting creaky bones and old dry skin, who has magical powers to heal, is an allegory: Of the heavy, sometimes cultural, shackles on women and how the ones with strong enough passions overcome them. In this case, it is forbidden love.I might have given this a five if I had not read another book by the author:The Palace of Illusions: A Novel. To me, even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush and descriptive -- captivating","review":"A beautifully told story that easily draws in the reader.

I very much look forward to reading more by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni."},{"rating":"1","title":"marketing exoticism","review":"The fact that this book was originally sold along with a packet of 'exotic' spices should alert the reader to the at times ridiculous brand of pseudo-eastern mysticism therein.

The graphics are great, the descriptions are clear and the strengthening exercices are useful. The book is organized around six groups of muscles, separated by colors. It could have been interesting to regroup some muscles inside each sections (like in \\"Muscles of the shoulder and upper arm\\": Movers of the shoulder, Movers of the humerus...).The Atlas of Musculo-Skeletal Anatomy by Chris Jarmey and Amanda Williams is a good addition to this book (or a better choice?).And for those who want to get the best out of anatomy you may want to check this book \\"The Anatomy of Movement\\" by Blandine Calais-Germain.It is really really an awsome book to learn muscular/skeletonMr. Jarmey wrote also a book on shiatsu, \\"Shiatsu: The complete guide\\" that I recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Novice Anatomy Reference","review":"In my teacher training program I have found that most people have a difficult time understanding basic human anatomy. Add in the complicated origin and insertion points of a muscle or muscle group and they tend to have a slight breakdown.

The Holy Spirit is God: all-knowing, all-powerful. Brother Hinn has taught us how to tap into that power so we can be used of God for His purposes. We have to let go of our inhibitions and let God have His will and way in us. Then the Holy Spirit can truly fill us (on a daily basis) and use us for the furtherence of the Kingdom. We just have to get out of God's way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it! And I'm a christian too!","review":"This was the worst christian book I've ever read. Pastor Hinn simply tries to appeal to his readers emotions rather than their intellect. His descriptions of the Holy Spirit are maudlin and sententious. He tries to sell the Holy Spirit to his reader like a used car salesman and he describes the Holy Spirit like a little boy describing his favorite Teddy Bear. It was sappy and shallow, I quit half way through. Nothing solid to grow on.If this book has closened your walk to God then good on ya. But as a hungry-minded, intellectual follower of Christ, this book has nothing to offer. This book will not boost your faith.

This is not a good way to introduce your new \\"look\\" much less give us hardcore fans this half-baked story. There are too many deathlands fans and ex-fans clamoring to make this series end it seems, but I know there are too many talented writers out there that can keep this series alive and vibrant, and take it to its rightful next level. It even seems that the cover artist Michael Herring also hated the story because this cover was boring and not as well drawn as his others.

If you're watching that then you are not watching the same movie.

Do not watch the dubbed version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's wrong underneath....","review":"After all the great reviews I'd read -- including a particularly persuasive rave in \\"The New Yorker\\" -- I was primed to see this horror-comedy about a pollution-bred monster running wild in a Korean sewer system.But despite its smooth look and admirable camerawork, \\"The Host\\" is surprisingly uneffective. Aside from the moster's brisk initial attack, the action isn't exciting and the comedy isn't especially funny. In fact, large sections of this film are just boring.I'll take an anti-hero any day of the week, but the family here is so hapless and sad they quickly become maddening.It's great to see a thriller with ambitions beyond the typical PG-13 slasher flicks, or the hard R-rated torture chamber endurance matches, but \\"The Host\\" has a long way to go before it's in a league with \\"Jaws\\" or \\"Alien\\" as some have suggested.Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mix which is... too mixed","review":"Hmmm... I REALLY wanted to love this movie. I had read great reviews and the creature effects were done by New Zealand's very own Weta Workshop (its good to be a kiwi)...But I didn't really enjoy it. The director was obviously trying to do something different by mixing different genres however all it achieved was confusing the viewer. I found myself not knowing how to watch the movie - it was a monster movie.. with no tension, it was a comedy.. which wasn't really funny, it was a drama... where you didn't care about the characters...Overall it tried to be too many things and didn't achieve any of them.Good effects, but disjointed and ultimately disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Been Duped!!","review":"I really don't know what is going on with the reviews for this movie, but this movie is NOT GOOD! The only reason I gave it two stars is because when the monster is on screen, the scenes are actually pretty good. Unfortunately that doesn't happen enough. I am not sure if the movie loses something in the English dubbed version, but there was some dialogue that didn't even make sense. And what is up with the dad grabbing his junk in the middle of the gym floor after grieving the possible death of his daughter? Say what? There are many good reviews on the box of this movie, but I have a feeling that they were taken out of context. Here are the real reviews. \\"On par with Jaws...If Jaws were a cheesy, overacted Korean movie with major plot holes.\\" \\"This is not...One of the greatest monster movies ever made.\\" Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This movie scared and cracked me up.

HOST seems interminable and its stop/start rhythm irritates and bores quickly. When it eventually lumbers to a climax, instead of getting our pulses racing, the director decides to go for a molasses-slow elegiac sequence presumably critiquing industrial society and man's alienated place in it. One family tragedy was enough, I would of thought, and this second nose-dive into the maudlin is writing a cheque the audience just can't cash.Appropriately, this is a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, In Any Language","review":"I gave up on this picture long before the final credits rolled.

It was horrible. The \\"MONSTER\\" looked like a plastic toy. The \\"PLOT\\" was pretty simple and plodding (as well as predictable). I guess I could take one of my rubber toys, magnify it a couple of times and make a movie myself to much acclaim.By the way, why was this piece of junk called \\"The Host\\"? Why wasn't it just called \\"The Fish\\" or something that made sense. What really got me was that a review on the cover of the DVD compared it favorably to Jaws. What a lie!! Thank goodness that I borrowed it for free from my local library - if I had paid a penny, it would have been war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but this film would stink on ice.","review":"From the opening lab sequence, to the two fishermen in the Han River, on to the final scene, I just kept waiting for something to happen. Never did. Based upon the reviews comparing 'The Host' to 'Jaws' (a true classic), I was expecting something grand. Could it be that the critics watched a different movie? Or perhaps they simply took the producer's word for what was on the disc? In any event, I am more than a little bit disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"how do you say \\"really sucks\\" in Korean?","review":"This was a total waste of two hours. The only reason I watched the whole thing was to see if anyone else died in this horrible sorry excuse for a horror flick. Another reviewer mentioned that this was supposed to be a satirical spoof of other stupid monster movies. I think not. Its just really bad. The acting was so over the top and/or amateurish that I had to laugh. Laughing my arse off at times. Then I got angry because it portrayed Koreans as a bunch of melodramatic buffoons. This was beyond campy and cheesy.

To be fair, it is not as bad as say 'Plan 9 from outer space', but just barely. If you can get by the poorly translated dialogue and bad acting, you might like the special effects.

Its very low budget with bad acting and anti-American sentiment. I dont understand why this movie got any good reviews. During the movie, when they're searching for this creature, that looks like a Giant Northern Pike. The family is the one who happens to find it almost every time.

The important thing is this has a solid story and a heart. Hollywood should definitely take some notes here. I think back to the soulless Hollywood Godzilla remake I have yet to set through once completely. The Host isn't trapped in the typical all flash no substance we usually get shoved down our throats here. The Host special fx are solid and the movie kicks in quickly and does not let go until the climax. The creature has a unique style and movement all its own.

The plot revolves around one family whose daughter was kidnapped by the beast and its their journey of trying to get her back. What makes this movie great is that you don't get cheated when it comes to the monster scenes, you see the whole thing instead of some blurry or partial body parts. This is easily my favorite giant monster horror flick, it has solid acting, amazing animation and it finally gives a giant monster movie justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"Maybe something was lost in translation or in the culture difference but I've spent a couple years in Korea.

Furthermore, I definitely recommend this film. It was alternately terrifying, ridiculous, hilarious and tragic - a monster-flick that really defied genre. You'll be much happier with the korean DTS soundtrack and subtitles. If you absolutely NEED and english soundtrack, just wait for hollywood to ruin the film with a bad remake instead of doing it yourself by using a wooden dubbed soundtrack. It's just a matter of time ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great video quality, crapy movie","review":"The only thing that this movie had going for it was the fact that it was great for actual video quality. The Content however was CRAP; the film is of Korean origin and is dubbed in English with some very bad voiceovers! The \\"monster\\" was introduced way to early in the movie leaving suspense out of the movie entirely for that aspect.

Instead of the usual casual depiction of mass killing and destruction, we see the psychological impact of such an attack for those close to one victim. The political editorializing is almost cliche, and some of the humorous moments forced, but otherwise this is an affecting film.Dan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome looking asian horror/comedy...","review":"This is a really good Korean film, and looks absolutely stunning in HD. The special effects are really well done and the acting is pretty good (just remember to switch to the original language, the dub sucks). There is a bit of humor, but then it also gets serious at times, some horror, a few action scenes, a bit of everything really. Admittedly, its not for everyone. If you are expecting this to be 'the ring' or have never seen an Asian film, then you may be disappointed. Otherwise this is a really good movie.For the record, I had absolutely no problems with this disc on the Xbox360 HD DVD drive. Don't let the haters scare you from getting this movie. They do this on every movie (just to mess up the ratings). I bet they don't even own an HD DVD player. You can check the reviews on the SD version for a more balanced perspective.

If you want a good spoof laugh, this is your movie... The dialog (Korean to English translation) is very funny - completely at home in a comedy (which I don't think this movie was meant to be). Story line is so so, acting is pretty good, creature is pretty good too (sort of a big fish with legs that can run pretty fast). I didn't realise I'd purchased this movie by mistake while buying a few other sci-fi titles. I put off watching this until I'd watched all the others as I don't generally like horror type movies (don't like the taste of adrenalin) - it was funny, but I'll probably try to offload it to ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak sloppy comedy","review":"Looking at the cover of this DVD I had thought it would really be a Gothic movie about monsters... But that was a very big disappointment! A bunch of Asian actors that were trying to be funny and along the way attempting to be some kind of US actors.The story was full of big holes and it just didn't add up. I couldn't bring myself to watch it to the end.I am not saying here that Koreans can't make good movies, because if you watch for example \\"Oldboy\\", there you'll know the difference.This movie could have had good potential to be a good story, but the producer and director blew it all up by inserting very dum and childish lines and annoying actors that think that lying on the ground and yell cry like a baby is funny...??Don't waste your money on this one.

It was not scary. There was almost no suspense. And ... I did not think it was funny either."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stinker!","review":"I watched this movie thinking it was a monster movie filled with horror and fright, but I spent most of the movie rolling my eyes and apologizing to everyone in the room watching it with me. I had read great reviews about this film and had very high expectations that it was a great movie, but it's a stupid movie, the forced voice-over made the movie into this stupid campy film that leaves the viewer embarrassed that they watched it.

His ramblings move from topic to topic in apparent random order as if they are a stream of consciousness of someone with attention deficit disorder.Too bad Amazon does not allow a rating lower than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely one of the worst books I've ever read","review":"They should retitle the book \\"A Big Pack of Infuriating and Manipulting Lies\\" This book has nothing to do with God or Angels or Divine Teachings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely bizarre incoherency from a guy who claims . . .","review":". . . to be the Angel of North America. The one to whom God told the secrets of how to live in harmony so that humanity is not plunged into another Dark Ages.Read it for a laugh, and then shed some tears for a man who is 1) hopelessly insane, 2) So evil that he will say or do anything to earn money off people's fears, 3) simply odd and not quite coherent.The author is the Angel's wife, and she was written down what the Angel says to her. One wonders at the honesty of this couple, but of course, I cannot say anything against, them, either. Certainly a fair amount of this book is good theology - be nice, do good, be concerned for your soul, marry with the attitude that marriage is lifetime commitment, and a few others. But it's just plain odd, and very, very creative (in a bad way) at times with theology."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to begin.","review":"Paradise Lost can be a very difficult poem to read.

We also love gospel music, and the tracks listed are some of our favorites. Having said that, we were very disappointed with the mixing on this disk. The orchestra is too 'pushed back' and the vocals are too 'up front'. The end result is neither realistic, nor enjoyable in our estimation.

Especially since Giant Steps is one of the most difficult tunes to improvise over. I guess Mr. Howe agrees because instead of soloing over the original chord changes, the solo is based around essentially one chord! How embarrassing for Mr. Howe and what a lame tribute to Coltrane. If you can't play this beautiful and complex piece of music,, don't dumb it down so you can play your tired rock licks. It gives guitar players a bad name."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guitar Supreme","review":"I have been into McLaughlin, Weather Report, Larry Coryell etc since the 70's. I was a little leary of this CD however I found a used copy in Ann Arbor and decided to check it out.This is an excellent CD, the first tune is played by Eric Johnson and his solo is awesome, Jeff Richman who arranged the music is featured on the second track and his playing is very exciting. It took a few listens but I think every tune on this disc is worthwhile. Mike Stern does a gorgeous take on My Favorite Things from the Sound of Music...a tune Coltrane was fanmous for and Larry Coryell takes out on the last track with a very cool solo that goes from rock to jazz and back again. Definately worthwhile listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment...","review":"A bunch of great guitarists dealing with John Coltrane's complex harmonies. Quite every jazz player considers Coltrane as one of the most rappresentative and influential musician in the world; I love all the musicians playing in this album, they all have the harmony knowledge to play on the intricate Coltrane's chord changes, BUT...it seems they never listened to his songs, to his sounds, to the magic athmosphere he was able to create on his albums. That dreamy sensation is the main thing lacking here in my opinion. Playing in a Coltrane tribute is NOT ONLY playing over Coltrane chords! Here it's like some good guitar players practising...where's the Tribute??Besides, in Giant Steps (soloist: Greh Howe) why mix a kind of Hendrix's Foxy Lady in the main theme???I would have expected something more, considering skill of such guitarsits.Maybe a too commercial project?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not nearly good as prey","review":"I find myself disagreeing with a lot of reviewers here.

At least HP still shows the Preds as somewhat honorable and respectable, unlike war. Just my two cents, but here's my input. I like and recommend the whole trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go read 'AvP: War'","review":"This book is mediocre, at best.

And as far as Mr. Bischoff's comment concerning liking ALIEN Resurrection and liking this book - I don't think so. I just saw Resurrection today, and while the ending leaves something (okay, a lot!) to be desired, it's totally different (and not to mention better) than this book! My advice? Avoid.

Boy was this book a let down! I re-read prey before reading this, and I was disappointed to see how the main character was changed beyond recognition. Might as well given her a new identity, cause she aint the same! The book was extremly slow (not as bad as star wars:children of the jedi though!) and was VERY inconsistant... the predators might have had rubber chickens, cause they sucked hard in this book...

Dark Horse doesn't usually make mistakes as becomes so obvious in these 2 & 3 novels. So, read \\"War\\" after \\"Prey\\"and then, and ONLY then, read \\"Hunter's Planet.

It is good has good action and overall I think gets unfair reviews by people who nit pick and read a book with the objective of expecting it to be the way they want it and not the way it is written if you can enjoy the series and read the book neutrally you will enjoy it.

The problems I had were: A few times I felt his prose turned a little purple, especially with some of the internal ramblings of Grace; I wondered about Henry's motives in how he related to Martin at the end of the story; and I stumbled over Martin's reaction to the news that his mother killed his father. I didn't find enough background, or motive, or psychological basis for his extreme behavior. But the main character, Grace, was well-wrought enough to carry the story as a whole, and it is clear that Mr. Ridgway is a perceptive and sensitive writer. I will definitely keep my eye out for his next work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Irish Crime and Punishment","review":"From the dark atmosphere of the novel, to the murder and eventual redemption of the murderer, this has to be the Irish equivalent of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. Of course there are no real plot-point comparisons, but Grace, the main character, might possibly have been able to get away with the murder of her husband, just as Raskolnikov could have gotten away with the murder of the old pawn-broker woman. But both characters provide their own punishment, both give themselves up to authorities, and both characters redeem themselves of their acts. Ridgway, however, provides us with a likeable and sympathetic character in Grace, and a very believable family dynamic in the way she relates to her gay son. This was a surprisingly mature treatment of a complex plot, seamlessly presented, with equally in-depth character portrayals. --Ronald L. Donaghe, author of Common Sons"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating memoir","review":"I recommend this book to everyone--women who fear marriage, women who are eager to marry, happily married women, unhappily married women, men of all sorts.

But now that Switched-On Boxed is out, I'm no longer trying to find a substitute for the original, and SOB2K stands up well in its own right. No, I don't agree with all of Carlos' new orchestration. The loss of a big fat bass sound on \\"Air on a G String\\" is particularly unfortunate, and some of the bell-like tones (especially in the Toccatta & Fugue) are downright annoying. But these are minor problems that don't ruin the recording as a whole. Simply put, SOB2K is to FM & PCM synthesis what SOB was to modular synthesis. That the sounds are similar to what you'll find on cheap mass-produced keyboards is more a testament to the ubiquity of the technology than a criticism of Carlos' programming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first.","review":"Too bad the first is no longer in print.

I found that his musical \\"packaging\\" really got in the way of the music. The music so well composed was trampled in a busy frenzy of emotions.

I have not heard any previous swiched on Bach, and if this is the style of interpretation of the Music then I will certainly give them a miss. The mathematical precision of the work with the relationship between tones is lost in many sections and the whole seems to have gained a discordant note that is not appropriate to Bach and his craftings.

I can now mix up my own bun and microwave it for 90 secs, then toast it for a minute or two and I have the most enjoyable gluten free bun I have ever had. I so look forward to having this bun, that it really surprises me. It is ok without toasting, but for me, the toasting made it really delicious.

He conceived of the book as a collection, not of history or a chronology, but of the best photos ever printed in Life Magazine. Every one chosen is a stunning photograph taken by the best photographers in the world.If you lived during the Life Magazine era, tears will come to your eyes as you relive moments pictured in The Best of Life.

I cannot recommend this recording highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic metal meets power cheese","review":"Aside from power/prog acts like DREAM THEATER and SYMPHONY X, and genre forebears IRON MAIDEN, I am not a huge fan of power metal. The music's generally exciting and intensely melodic, which I like, but it's all generally too 'happy' - all major chords and triumphant, soaring, overwrought vocals. In fact, it's the vocals which have kept me away from many bands that I'd otherwise like, which is which this German power metal is such a nice find. The singer/bandleader sounds like a slightly more aggressive Bruce Dickinson, and the music, surprisingly, sounds more like a modern version of classic JUDAS PRIEST, DIO or early QUEENSRYCHE than the neo-classical speed metal coming from the other German and Italian acts. Some songs do veer sharply into happyland, but the rest is cool enough that I can deal. All that said, this is one of the stupidest band names in existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edguy : \\"Rocket Ride\\"","review":"I really enjoyed this. I've been a fan of Edguy since listening to \\"Theatre Of Salvation\\" years ago, and they haven't changed much since then. The same straight forward Power Metal sound and approach is still here on \\"Rocket Ride\\", the only thing that has changed is the overproduced sound...I think releases like \\"Mandrake\\" / \\"Hellfire Club\\" were both very good, but there was something about them both that just screamed \\"overproduced\\", almost like Edguy was trying too hard.I don't think that's the case here with \\"Rocket Ride\\", it has a more natural feel to it in terms of Edguy doing what they do. The songs are well organized and fit together very well throughout this release. This is pure Power Metal, and I highly recommend this to anyone who like Metal. It's not Edguys's greatest effort{\\"Theatre Of Salvation\\"}, but I do like it more than \\"Hellfire Club\\"...."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE EDGUY WE KNOW :( :( :(","review":"I can say that i am pretty disappointed with the new album, this is not the edguy we know, this is not metal, this is not what we re used to and we LOVE what we were used to !!!

It's a little pricey, but worth having on your bookshelf, especially if you can pick up a copy secondhand."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eclectic Christmas Collection","review":"Boston's Empire Brass' Christmas Album THE WORLD SINGS is an interesting mix of Christmas music. Listeners certainly will find Empire's polished and powerful sound in many of the tracks. While the group is a classically trained brass quintet, there are tracks that include contemporary musicians as well as a vocalist Laurie Monahan. The album includes many Christmas standards such as \\"Joy to the World,\\" \\"Angels We Have Heard On High\\" and the like. Less familiar carols are included such as \\"Pat-a-pan\\" and \\"Still, Still, Still.\\" A personal favorite is the group's unique rendition of the \\"Arabian Dance\\" from THE NUTCRACKER. People desiring a traditional brass quintet album will probably be better off looking at the Philadelphia Brass Ensembles A FESTIVAL OF CAROLS IN BRASS (a must have for all lovers of brass music), but listeners who enjoy creative sound rooted in classical music but open to contemporary music will certainly enjoy this wonderful collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Disappointing","review":"The Empire Brass is one of the premier brass quintets in the world, but you will not hear this on this Christmas album. Almost every single track has some kind of electronic backbeat or guitars, which frankly, is quite annoying, and the arrangments (though many might call them \\"original\\") are very poor. If you like \\"ecelectic\\" you might like this, but if you are in any shape or form a brass aficionado you will play this once and then it will begin to collect dust on your CD rack. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Keeper","review":"This recording is not for anyone who prefers traditional Christmas music done in the way the composers intended. Empire Brass and friends have taken serious liberties on every track. Most disappointing was the sinuous Arabian Dance shattered by dynamics that produce cringes rather than sighs of pleasure. If you like jazz riffs, drum solos, and electric guitar sounds, then by all means explore this unusual recording. Otherwise, you might be better advised to spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humbug","review":"A disagreeable disc that highlights the Empire Brass' less desirable features.

Each card has a poem, mythology, meaning and a ritual/meditation to connect with each Goddess and set one on a path to wholeness in life.

I found this book confusing and dull. It lacked detail and points of interest. It seemed to drag on and just when you thought the end was near the author would introduce something else. Part of the reason I didn't enjoy the book is I don't believe in witch craft and the author didn't do anything to convince me otherwise.This was a good thinking book. It made me think about gossip and the effects it has on people and how hard it would be to have been accused of being a witch with out evidence.This is a book I would recommend to people who enjoy suspense ,mystery and historical fiction. It was not easy reading so I would recommend it for people grades 7-12. I prefer a book with more action and real life experiences that I can relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was very...confusing...","review":"Warning:Do not read this if you have a tendency to become depressed.Beyond the Burning Time proves to be a deathly novel. The author, instead of explaining things in normal form, used such murderous words to describe everything. There are still some parts of the book that disturb me to this day. It was even revolting at times. But hey, witch trials are great! Mary, on the other hand, was a different story. She wasn't explained in a deathly manner. She wasn't explained at all. She had not one feeling that I could see. Once in a while the author would throw in some wanna-be poetic comment that she probably thought would discribe Mary, but it only resulted in being cheap, and totally irrelevant to the whole novel, since it was so far from being poetic. Anyway, the only thing I have to say is that from what I read, the author tried too hard to be...something...and ended up very murderous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and stupid","review":"I thought this book was the stupidest book I have ever read in my whole life.

One more thing that I liked about Beyond the Burning Time was the supernatural sense of Kathryn Lasky's writing. The only thing that I didn't like was that the book ended to fast, even thought the ending was good. I couldn't put the book down.

Drawing the audience in and keeping them interested is a major challenge. Enter the Chicago Symphony and Georg Solti. Their combined sense of drama and structure make the first movement appear to fly by, and before you know it, you're hooked.

However, these are adequately covered in newsgroups & web sites.The cheese fondue recipes are very good & simple. They usually don't call for expensive ingredients and do suggest many dipping foods. There are color pictures on every page. The sauces for Tempura are weak. While tasty, the variety is slim -- you'll use diff. sauces for seafood vs. beef vs. chicken.Additionally, there are yummy looking dessert fondue recipes 'tho I have not tried those yet.Overall, very good book for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy, not too informative","review":"This book does have alot of different dips, but not much info on how to have a fondue \\"party\\".

In addition to being one of the only Star Wars books I have read that is actually poorly written, it essentially destroyed all the character development that had been gaining over the past several books, most especially in \\"Traitor\\". The most horrible example of this is Jacen Solo, who is reverted back to the whiny, self-absorbed fool he was at the beginning of the series with no explanation. This book marks the beginning of New Jedi Order's death throes, and, with a little help from the disappointing \\"Unifying Force\\", tarnishes what could have otherwise been an amazing book series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"On...the Author admits to never reading ANY of the previous books except for Traitor and a Star Wars who's who book.It comes in loud and clear while reading the book. Please don't write another Star Wars book if you don't care enough to be consistant. I'm definatly reading part of the next book at the store before buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally some hope!","review":"I just finished Destiny's Way, and all I can say is \\"WOW\\"!! The book does finally offer a lot of explanations that have not been explained before, such as the true origin and goals of Vergere. The Republic finally is able to turn the tide and have some hope of winning the war, and the book even gives some small shadings of what the next chapter in the Star Wars universe may entail. My only disappointment is in the final battle of the book, the Warmaster has a confrontation that could have been better, and should have been with somebody else other than who it was. All in all, though, a very good read and highly recommended to any other Star Wars fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"So far I have very much enjoyed the NJO. I usually cannot wait until the next book comes out. However, with Destiny's Way I was very disappointed. I actually did not even finish the book. After about sixty pages I just skimmed the rest of the book and saved a lot of time. No surprises, no real important additions to the story line, just very bad characterizations. Do not buy the book. I would not even buy it as a paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS is bad?","review":"i know that this is more of an adult book, but i decided to read it anyway.guess what! i liked it!has great cover art, too.and you adults say this book is BAD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Destinys way","review":"I think the Destiny's way was very well writen book. The author related ideas in the book with impecable efficiency and in a clear way that anyone could relate to.Although this book wasn't as action packed as \\"Star By Star\\" it still had a massive battle scene that took up 1/5 of the book. You also found that the book developed the characters more than some of the other books and you also got the impression that the tides of war were changing in the new republics' favour.Destiny's way also developed the Yuuzhan Vong more than the others did and got higher up in the chain of command."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome addition","review":"I have been reading the NJO series since the first book, and a fan of the Star Wars novels before that. The series, as one would and should expect, has had its ups and downs, both in plot as well as writing, but Destiny's way is a welcome addition to the saga. Some points of the book are a bit hokey, but not in too bad a way. The return of Akbar fills a void that seemed to exist in the leadership roles, and the election of the new Chief of State ties some political loose ends together. After the character development in Traitor, this is a great way to refocus the war in the books. The \\"turning point\\" of the series in more ways then one, the book leaves you wanting the next chapter in the series. Next to Star by Star, the most important book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tides of war are turning fast","review":"Destiny's Way is an exciting addition to the New Jedi Order series. Finally, the tides of war has turned and there are hopes in every front of the war. The conversation between Vergere and Luke Skywalker is probably the most profounding discussion about the force in all starwars books."},{"rating":"2","title":"the new jedi order book series = the best of the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this book series seriously is amazing from the very begining to the very end the new jedi order book series = the best of the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Rating The Praxis","review":"Walter Jon Williams is one of the best sf writers, and his latest novel (first in a series) The Praxis is currently available only from Amazon UK as it's not yet published in the States. Great galaxy-spanning story, with overtones of Foundation and The Lensman Series. I finished this late at night on a cross country flight, and I was almost having heart palpitations when the Naxids were preparing to board Martinez' ship! Williams always has great female characters, and Carolyn Sula is one of his best. If you're an sf fan go to Amazon UK and pick this one up -- you'll have a year head start on the chumps this side of the pond!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written until the rushed ending","review":"Through the first 400 pages I couldn't put this book down. The story line moved along well. At that point I felt it was one of the better NJO books. But it was as if the author reached page 400 and said \\"I have to finish this book in less than 50 pages!\\" The final dual between Jaina and Warmaster Tsavong Lah was very weak. He has been such a huge part of the story arc, yet his death was treated like and afterthought. Also, the death of Vergere seemed a bit anti-climactic. I just felt that the final 40+ pages could have been expanded to 100 and more detail given into the final thoughts of Tsavong Lah and Vergere as they met their ends. Well written until the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Wait!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Pacing was great and all the major players from the earlier books in the series were present. Having said that, I know that there will be fans who are upset with the fact that the writer breaks new ground with some of the characters.If you are looking for a turning point in the series....well the book is a must read. There is a passing of the baton of sorts as tne young Jedi blossom into full Jedi Knights. If you are fan of the series you will not be disappointed. If you are dedicated fan of the series, you may or may not like the way the primary characters (Jaina, Kyp, Jacen etc.) have changed but this is a story on a grand scale and character development in some cases took a back seat to describing the turning point in the war between the New Republic and the Vong.I recommend the book and the stage it sets for the final chapters in this saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speed Bump","review":"It's unfortunate that this book is part of the largely excellent NJO series, because I can't tell you to skip it! Sure the basic story is good, but that's prescripted to fit into the timelines/plotlines of the series as a whole. Once Williams got to it, the life seems sucked out. The book isn't worthless, it's just nowhere near as engaging and interesting as some of the other books in the series.Most people seem to be criticizing Jacen's characterization - I was personally absolutely appalled by Mara. She seemed very flighty and ditzy compared to the Mara I know and love. Although she doesn't get a lot of \\"page\\" time in Remnant (Book 15), her treatment was more true to form.My advice: get this one out of the way so you can get on with the good stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Destiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 14)","review":"Consistency seems to be a major issue in this series. When we last left Jacen he had become a sort of super Jedi whom we expected to do great and marvelous things. Instead he becomes almost a side note in this book and appears to have become a wimp again. Furthermore, one of the characters that had great potential is squandered and killed (you will have to read it I an not going to spoil that) needlessly. Please have these authors read the series before committing to actually writing on it. Maybe then, be more pleasing to the fans. A good read none the less but it had the potential to have been a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"Jacket is way bulkier and less form-fitting than it looks in the photo.

They had obviously listened to Steeleye Span and Pentangle a bit, given their choice of material.

The mystery itself is quite complicated, but it basically surrounds the murder of Nora's cousin's husband, although his murder is only the first. The mystery is fun to follow (and not easy to figure out, although my hunch proved right). But the terrific dialogue and rapport between Powell and Loy matches the mystery, and even their dog, Asta, has some hilarious scenes as well. The supporting cast of Elissa Landi, James Stewart, and many familiar character actors are also good. I can't compare this to the other Thin Man movies, having not scene all of them, but I'm sure this must be one of the best and fans of mysteries and this great film team will definitely want to catch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moronic Magic","review":"William Powell and Myrna Loy had a rapport that transcended the script in the many movies they made together.

Also, a lot of the movement abilities that Mario and Luigi had in \\"Superstar Saga\\" are gone. that means that the special bro attacks that were based off them have also disappeared. the game now relies on special items rather than power moves to produce the customary \\"super\\" attacks. While there is nothing particularly wrong with this, I preferred the old battle methods. That being said all the things I mentioned are when you're comparing the game to its predecessor. I'm still giving it four stars due to the fact that this game is very good on its own. \\"Superstar Saga\\" was incredible while this game is merely great.

The stories are very fragmented-I often had to recap-over wordy and Al Kharrats poetic musings just seem to futher fog things up.Only 145 pages long, this is a labourious read. The translation probably suits the purist ethos, but surely a translators job is to make the work accessable to its intended readers.As it is, only scraps of its potential beauty come accross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"We purchased this for our 7 year old for Christmas.

We purchased the toy for our 8 yr old son who is fairly rough with his toys. He has played with this castle for hours on end, and it has not once fallen apart. I am very confused by the reports that it falls apart very quickly. We have not experienced any such thing. The castle has moving parts, doors, windows, etc. and it is fun to get in the floor and play with my son. He has other Playmobil sets, but this is by far the most exciting and fun castle. I'm glad we made the purchase. If you're concerned about it falling apart, at least from our experience there is no need to worry.

The author uses simple, rather concrete examples that allow one to see how fuzzy logic systems work. With the shareware given here it also shows that such systems don't take a lot to construct or work with. As one reviewer says the book doesn't have much on the mathematical theory behind fuzzy logic systems, but the author meants such as a practical approach. And the mathematical theory definitely works as much too much to explain in a work like this. Additionally, the main advantage of using fuzzy systems works as that you don't have to use so much math and bury everything in equations and cryptic symbols. This sort of example makes it easier to see this and work with it.The knowledge builder shows some ideas as to how one can generate if-then rules in a simple fashion. The decision maker makes the program practically. And the fuzzy cognitive map shows you how fuzzy logic systems can apply to scientific modeling easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak on Theory","review":"If you're interested in an overview of the subject of fuzzy logic this book may be adequate for your need.

The Cincinnati Pops Orchestra are as wonderful as ever, and the 20-bit digital sound system makes for unequalled sound quality. A pleasing highlight for me, is the wonderful \\"Moonglow\\" which starts off track 5. The jazz trio of piano, bass and drums eventually is joined by the orchestra for the theme from \\"Picnic\\". Then we have the beautiful waltz from \\"Around the world in eighty days\\". With the wonderful accordion solo, you can imagine being on a merry-go-round.

I was scared too, because there was always a gib possibility that they's screw up. Well, they did. Part 2 was just a huge wast of time and one of the biggest disappointments ever. Part three is an improvement. I fell for the concept (FDTD meets Western) and really wanted to love it. I ended up not hating it ... which is not much of a compliment. The story is pretty close to the original's and the cast does an OK job, but there are no surprises. The creators try too hard to match the original's coolness and forget to make an interesting movie. Watch it once out of curiosity but be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"a remake of the original, but cheaper, uglier, less funny.....","review":"Imagine a remake of the original, but cheaper, uglier, less funny, less dramatic, with less action, poorer special effects, and no-name actors. Here you go.This is described as a western re-imagining of the great Tarantino flick, and plus, Michael Parks is top-billed (love him). QT is an executive producer to boot. But my god. Just so boring, unoriginal, ugly, unfunny, not exciting. I give it as much as 5 out of 10 because the western-themed intro to the story (about 30-40min) was promising if clunky; however once the plot moved to an old-west version of the demon bar with dancing vampires, it was all downhill.Only for those who have never seen the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the beginning, just another vampire movie.","review":"From dusk till dawn part 1 was such a good movie it had it all. To come back with one of the worst sequels ever made part 2, then have the guts to make another film is alot to do. I wouldn't have bought this if I knew what was on this. The film shouldn't even list special features because there is only one deleted scene that doesn't even make sense. The story is so stupid, this is not how it began this doesn't tell you anything about how the movie started. They are the same thing the vampires were allready there when the people entered the bar. It's just like from Dusk Till Dawn 1 except with different characters. The only thing the movie is showing you is the other people the vampires killed. If you like gore and vampires, you could get this but it's not worth it, get part 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than part 2","review":"I don't know why people are praising this film. They must be mad because they bought the movie and didn't get their money's worth. And now they want to trick people into buying it. (I couldn't think of a better reason.. so sue me.) There is no action in the movie involving vampires until the last thirty minutes of the movie. The best part though is the DVD's one deleted scene. That alone is better than the whole movie. I wonder why they didn't keep it in the movie? There is a big shoot out in the movie but I've seen better. If you like 70s & 80s westerns..... not the great ones like Young Guns, I mean corny westerns like Bananza (okay, maybe a little better than that) then you might enjoy this movie.

It starts out as a pretty straightforward western, winding up as the expected bat-$#!t, vampires vs. desperadoes throw-down! Although things get ridiculous near the end, there's enough fangy fun to save this one from disaster. Michael Parks (KILL BILL) is especially good as writer, Ambrose Bierce.

Depending on which corner you are using and which way you are blowing the air, the cord could end up sticking out horizontally. There are two little pieces of plastic with adhesive backing that are supposed to hold the cord against the wall but the adhesive isn't very good. I used white wire staples. A square frame fan would allow a larger fan that would move the same amount of air with less noise if you didn't mind the aesthetics.

It has that sort of honesty that is curiously absent from a lot of children's books - but this is not your ordinary children's book. We read it at bedtime to prep our 3 year old for his oncoming baby sister.It was pretty amazing because the boy in the photos looks eerily similar to our son. He loved the book, and selected it from his stack most nights.What was great was that we were able to reference the book at times when we experienced something similar to the book, and he was able to get through any rough spots by grabbing the book and getting excited about some difficult time he was having that happened in the book. I liked it, too, and didn't feel at all like it was a monotonous or boring read like many children's books.We still read it occasionally, too, even though our daughter is already 1.I recommend to any family preparing their child for a new baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Whippet Resource!","review":"This book is witty as well as informative.

This one hour documentary is filled with magnificent old photos and fabulous film of Seabiscuit as he races and even when he first comes to the Howard barn. Commentary by Pollard's daughter and others is terrific, and DVD extras include a 5-minute interview with documentary director Stephen Ives and a photo gallery of ten champion horses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turned me on to horse racing","review":"At the time I first received this DVD, I had not only no interest in horse racing, but probably a negative view of the sport. This film changed all that and turned me into a huge fan who follows several tracks around the world, without even betting.This is a first class production, with outstanding commentary by Seabiscuit expert Lauren Hillenbrand as well as contemporaries of the Biscuit. The connection between Seabiscuit and his jockey, Red Pollard is brought to light on many levels, and makes this story all the more inspirational.A must have and a great gift for almost anyone, not just horse lovers and sports fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader Rabbit recommended","review":"Highly recommended for preschool age.

The design is fine, the commands are confusing though and the headphones are less than satisfactory. The main problem with the device is when it reaches the end of playlist, or it bumps into an unknown format file, it shows ERROR message on the display and you can continue playing songs only if you turn it off - and back on - it does not recognize other buttons. This error sign is very worrying considering that this is a flash drive and is meant to have other file formats other than .wma and .mp3.

The acting in the film is very good even 50 cent gave a 3 star performance. I won't spoil the ending but I found it a lot more realistic to life than most films.

Good grief. Since when is a musical ever realistic?? Especially one that is geared to kids. Hello??!! It's not supposed to be realistic! If you expect realism, go elsewhere. But if you want to have some fun with a great message not-so-subtly woven in, then watch this movie. Kids love it (mine do along with anyone else I've talked to), and the message is just terrific ~ it's okay to be yourself with all kinds of wild likes, dislikes, hobbies, etc., no matter what anyone else thinks. I love it! I can't even begin to say how much better this is than \\"Grease,\\" the high school musical of my day where the heroine had to give in and become a slut to get what she wanted and be \\"happy.\\" Relax with your kids, go get some popcorn, and have some fun with the Wildcats kids from \\"Highschool Musical.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my goodness","review":"Ok, great appeal for my 8 year old.

It's not awful, don't get me wrong, but I just didn't care for the tracks he chose to include.In general the cd is fairly fragmented; he'll butt a slowish song up against a more hard hitting one and the overall effect is you're constantly waiting for him to get to the point and he just never does.If you're a fan of his stuff, then this cd is probably one of his better ones, and if you like a more harsh, more sparse type of trance, give this a try as well. Otherwise, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Digweed can do better and definately plays better","review":"I have had the opportunity to hear him play with and with out Sasha and he plays much better than this mediocre compilation.

The second disc has it's mix of hard trance which reaches peak time alittle too early with PVD's \\"Words\\" (For Love), the declining climax is even worst with rather dull ending tracks.The cd mixs isnt that great, but i am willing to give Digger another shot on \\"Global Underground: Hongkong\\" .

Sometimes I would have to go into my iPhone's bluetooth settings to get it to reconnect--one of the things that most annoys me about devices like this and why I despised and disposed of my Jawbone. But the most annoying thing about it is the lag between the time you hit the button on the side and the time you either pick up or end a call. What's with that? It has zilch noise cancellation--if you want someone to hear every breeze in your environment amplified to hurricane-force, wear one of these things. It didn't cost much, but it isn't worth much.

It only takes ~2 seconds to turn the unit on.The unit currently is locked up and will only flash a blue light every 6 seconds. Holding the call button for any length of time will do nothing except make a tone when the button is first pressed.Plantronics tech support is completely clueless. Their response to this complaint was to tell me to charge the unit and then pair it with the phone by holding the call button for 6 seconds.

It is convenient to use, comes with three charging options that are also very convenient (including a usb cable that fits into a port on phone car charger), and so far seems to hold a charge for a long enough time even when in use. The unit would probably even stay put in my ear without the over-ear attachement, but I found that as I spoke and moved my jaw it was better to have the loop on. The different-sized attachments for the soft gel piece that actually goes into your ear is perfect for my hard-to-fit ears. The only negatives I've found are that the microphone seems to catch more wind noise than I had hoped, and sometimes it seemed to randomly cut out but there were other possible reasons for that problem. I would defnitely recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gel Buds Design Flaw","review":"Don't even think about buying this product; there is a huge design flaw that severely outshadows any of the positives. The gel ear buds do not stay on the headset. To put them on and take them off, you put the bud in the \\"neutral\\" position then push it on and then twist it to the right or left, depending upon which ear you prefer. The problem is that the bud keeps rotating back to neutral and then falls right off. I complained to the Plantronics company and they told me where I could purchase replacement parts! I told them I wasn't paying for replacement parts for a product that was very poorly designed in the first place. This headset has been returned but I just wanted to warn everone who had read the excellent reviews about the product to not even consider this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Before I purchased this product, I had already purchased three other headsets but none of them worked good (prices were higher). Until I went on line and checked CNET and they recommended this product, so I went ahead and purchased it. It is really a good product. The price is right.

The sound is loud, clear and the signal is more stable. The only complaint that I have about the 510 (and it applies to the 655 as well) is that when I receive an incoming call and if the headset is not already on, it does not always automatically pick up the call.I would not recommend the 655."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bluetooth I've Owned So Far.","review":"This is my third Bluetooth earpiece, and by far the best I have owned. All the charging options are pretty neat, and the design of the product itself is sleek. There is definately room for improvement, but that goes for all bluetooth earpieces. Overall, best in class, and worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Signal and battery life","review":"Not happy with this unit, do not recommend it. Unit does not work if you hold your phone in your right hand while headset is in left ear. Very poor reception; needed to place cell phone in left shirt pocket during calls. Very short battery life, perhaps 45 minutes.Bought Jabra at same time, still using it and quite happy with signal quality, battery life, and overall functionality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bluetooth headset I've used so far","review":"The Plantronics Discovery 655 is the best of the three bluetooth headsets I've used so far.Likes:- it's comfortable. I soon forget it's in my ear, and I do not even need the overear support;- it's versatile. I can charge it through USB, adapter plug, or with the AAA battery adapter;- it's usable. The vibrating protector case is a nice touch.- the sound quality is great, even better than some of the code earphones I've used.Dislikes:- there is an delay in answering. I do not know if this is a configuration issue (I'm using it with a blackberry), but there is a two second pause before the headset will answer. Still trying to figure this one out. If not for this, I'd give it five stars.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, but","review":"Pros- Its VERY small and light, can't even tell its onCons- I own a Treo 650 and the headset crackled a LOT, if I held the phone face down, with phone on a table it worked ok, but on belt or even on other side of my body from ear, not good- Could never get the USB charger to work, plus you need this special little nub to attach to the \\"cradle\\" of the headset to charge with USB, vs plugging it into the wall, this little nub VERY easy to lose, why they couldn't make the wall charger and the USB plug use the same attachment I dont know- I bought this thing, and WAITED a long time, because it came with a case/protectice cradle, well it turns out that the case does not protect the key component, the rubbery nub that goes into your ear, I wanted something I could place in my pocket withouth having to worry about breakage, no help there"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Buy Ever","review":"Product came without shipping slip, no protective packaging. .Bluetooth was placed in a plastic bag, slipped in an envelope and mailed. Quality is very poor. Crackling, buzzing muffled sounds very annoying and diapointing to recieve something you are expecting to use all the time to not being able to use it. I would not recomend this vendor to anyone. Description stated very clearly that it would be packaged in retai packaged and pictured with extra items. This came with bluetooth only and charge cord; no instruction or any other accessories with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great, but...","review":"It worked perfectly with my old phone. However, it is considered out of date for the iPhone 4, iPad 2, and my current Windows 7 laptop. All of the three will recognize it, but all also complain that it is no longer supported. It was great back when I got it in 2010 for 15 bucks but now it would be a waste of money.Otherwise, it does sit in the ear well and the quality is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Ear Fit","review":"The device has fairly good reception, but poor ear support. It doesn't stay in. The connecting ear support clip doesn't stay put and the ear covers wer too big."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This unit had adequate sound quality, and the storage/charger mechanism seemed like a good idea, but it died within a couple months of purchase. Stay away and spend a bit more on a Jabra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for a few people","review":"I bought this headset based on positive reviews posted here. For me, it is one of the worst headsets I have ever owned. It comes with three ear tips, none of which fit my ears well at all. Because leaving it in my ear was chancy at best, I used the provided over-ear clip. It's a total disaster. The clip mounts over the post used to hold the ear tip. Any pressure applied to the headset, such as removing it from an ear, often results in the clip forcing the ear tip free. It is no fun trying to retrieve the components in an automobile or anywhere else.Avoid this badly engineered product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I stopped using this headset","review":"I purchased this because the reviews werepretty good on this...I don't know if it does this only to me, but it's very noisyand I can hear a lot of static.Other person in a call has difficulties hearing me most of time.I only like the design of this product(so 2 stars)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headset","review":"I realy like this head set it was a replacement for my Motorola H700the sound quality is very good comparing with many other brandsthe attached accessories is amzingthe weight is very good and you can feel comfortable while wearing itthe battery is not much long but maybe because I'm a heavy user i can use it for arround 4 hours of talking time which I think fair enough for many usersany way as a total feed back I recommend this Headset"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine for me","review":"After reading most of the reviews of every popular headset, I had low expectations. But this does everything I need. It stays in my ear without needing the behind-the-ear clip (although I think this would be necessary if you were running/exercising - me, I take a break from the phone). The sound quality is fine both incoming and outgoing - the only issue I had was calling from an airport where the background noise was really high - my caller said I kept cutting out, although the conversation was fine from my end.This is my first bluetooth headset so I don't know if it is a \\"5\\", but really it is an easy 4.5 for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plantronics slipped with this one","review":"What a wonderful headset this could have been - lightweight, unobtrusive - if only the sound quality had been consistent and up to the quality standards I have come to expect from Plantronics over the years. I have a Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth headset, and it's fantastic. But this one was scratchy and often dropped out; we had to return it, and based on other reviews, decided not to get a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied !","review":"I am very unsatisfied with this purchase. The problem is related to its battery. When I charged it first time (lasts 3.5 hours ) it was enough to work for one day without talk instead 270 hours. And the time of battery life after each next charging steadily decreased. And to day (after 2 weeks of using this headset) it was discharged in 4 hours. Horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work out of the box.","review":"The Plantronics 655 Bluetooth Headset did not work out of the box. Now I get to go through warranty to exchange it. Consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAD","review":"Product arrived promptly, but this item arrived DEAD. Unable to charge, pair, or use at all. So far the shipper is willing to refund the cost. May just be this one DEAD, I do not know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its good for now","review":"The ear piece always pops off when I put the ear hook on. I had to send the first one back because it wouldn't turn off. I have the replacement, and still have the ear hook issue, and it doesn't stay in my ear without it. I'll be buying another bluetooth, but this will do for the time between ordering."},{"rating":"1","title":"No one could hear me","review":"I was very excited to get this - it paired with my Verizon phone easily, it was incredibly comfortable in my ear, and I could hear everyone more clearly than I ever could on corded ear pieces. The problem is that no one could hear me. I sounded like I was talking from a wind tunnel every time. I'm unfortunately returning it tonight. I'm still high on bluetooth technology, but now I'll have to try a different model."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this item...","review":"But it's performance really disappointed me. I have 3 Plantronic DSP 500 headsets, for different computers, that I LOVE. This product is nothing like those. Granted, they serve different purposes, but still. If I have my phone clipped at my waist on the right, and wear this headset in my left ear, I lose my connection. I'm a big guy, but hell, I'm not THAT big. The ONLY time I seem to keep a connection to it is when I clip my phone (LG VX8300) on my Truck's driver-side sun-visor & wear the headset. Even then it sporadically drops the connection. We're talking less than 2 feet here. I've had this thing for about 3 weeks now, but I think I'm going to have to take the loss & return it. Maybe I got a bad unit, who knows. I really did want to like this thing. It does look nice. I'll give them that. But I need a little more than that unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bluetooth rating","review":"The Plantronics bluetooth works well, has good sound quality and is very comfortable to wear. The battery charger and USB cable for charging are great, especially for business travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly horrible","review":"This is the worst bluetooth earpiece I've ever owned. It doesn't stay in your ear unless you use the loop, and the loop is poorly designed. It is anchored to the headset by the ear-piece, with a very loose fitting snapping mechanism. So every time you take this off and put it in your pocket or case, the ear piece and loop fall off. I am already looking for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blutooth-Plantronics Discovery","review":"Disappointed with the quality of this device. Although price was good, it really doesn't matter if people on the other end of the phone call complain of background noise, static, etc. Would not reccommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Was very disappointed with this product. I paid a good price for this and it worked no better than one I paid much less for. Basically it picked up too much background noise and people on the other end could not hear me well. I've gone back the \\"wired\\" headset that came with my blackberry and this works best, just a bit of a pain around the set belt of the car...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound quality and functionality - Little uncomfortable though...","review":"Great headset, just not the most comfortable due to the inside the ear design."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy, should have decided differently","review":"When I received the bluetooth, everything was ok. A few days later it began to act a bit weird. I have problems trying to connect my phone and the earpiece together, the sound is distorted at times, the earpiece will not come on to become discoverable, and it has knocked out the sound for my speakers on my phone, I had to do a master reset. I probably will purchase another brand next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible.","review":"I bought this thing after reading a few glowing reviews...why is it horrible? Everyone I talk to says they can't understand me through the noise while driving...I drive a quiet car, and still....another thing...when you're more than 5 feet from this thing, you're out of range. Waste of money, too bad I threw all the packaging away, I'd get a refund.MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PRODUCT...you're hereby warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very frustrating and time consuming","review":"When I originally obtained the headset it took a while to enable. After enabling it worked fine on my end for several weeks. During this time I did get feedback that connection sound was like I was talking from a hole in the ground. Then I experienced the device enabled but not working. I have messed with it several times and can't get it to function at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this soap","review":"hi my name is sabah and i am from morocco i wos verry happy to faind this soap in the usa its the best soap ever i been using this soap fore a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soap","review":"Have been using this soap for about a month now. It is great. Lasts so much longer than other soaps and smells very very fresh. It is my new favorite soap of the year. It is at Target for about $4 for 3 bars and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dream Team","review":"The Triple and Double can hardly be said to be the crowning achievements of Beethoven's and Brahms' concerto output, but this team makes as good a case for them as anybody. All three soloists have made extensive recordings of the solo concerto repertoire, but here, they show that they can be team players, too. The pianist in the Triple or the violinist in the Double might feel slighted that he/she does not get enough of the limelight compared to his/her partners, but there is never an attempt by any of these three men to steal each other's thunder; they all have a great deal of respect for one another's musicianship.This is one of ten CDs that I own in EMI's \\"Great Recordings of the Century\\" series, and I have not been disappointed by a single one of them. This CD in particular lives up to the designation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Richter's Opinion","review":"I just thought I would point out that Sviatoslav Richter, the pianist in this recording of the triple concerto, thought that this was an absolutely awful recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas, the major item is a terrifble flop and disowned by the performer.","review":"When big names made a big blunder in recording - that is Beethoven's Triple Concerto under the baton of the legendary conductor Herbert von Karajan, and the three great Russian instrumentalists.For the Beethoven, you might as well have one recorded in four separate sessions, and amalgamated technically afterwards. That's how computer piano playings sound these days in some 'cheap' restaurants.Enough said - S. Richter 'disowned' this recording afterwards.If one but have ears, you would hear how disinterested the playing by the three soloists were, and how far away from real musicality work this is!If they reduce the price sufficiently, there may still remain a reason to get this JUST for the Brahms Double Concerto, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't care what you think...Worst Triple EVER","review":"...I'll just say that no matter how big names are, this triple concerto sucks.I abhor it (although I'm a big fan of Karajan, Oistrakh, Richter and Rostropovich INDIVIDUALLY)...The whole team screwed up big time on these sessions from the sonics to the interpretations. Just compare this triple to Fricsay's spectacular version on DG...it's like light versus darkness.******5 stars for the best stereo Brahms Double!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply bad.","review":"There is a good reason why this recording can be had new for seven dollars and change while the Bruno Walter reissue costs sixty bucks. This Triple is just plain awful. Neither Corigliano, Rose nor Hendl have one tenth the stature of the giants on this recording but guess what? They know how to play together. And HvK? He has no clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A General Guide To Online Learning With Little Specific Information","review":"\\"Peterson's Guide to Online Learning\\" is a brief, general guide to the concepts associated with online learning and Internet-only degree programs. The book is now several years old, and in an environment that changes so swiftly, always make sure you verify the currency of the information presented. The information is of a very general nature and is of nearly no help to anyone with any previous exposure to online education. It is not a resource book of different schools and programs, but is a guide for the novice addressing various subjects with chapters such as \\"How Teachers Teach Online\\" and \\"How You Interact Online.\\" It's pretty basic stuff.I can't recommend this book in general, with one caveat: if you are interested in online education and have absolutely no understanding of the processes involved, this might be a useful first book for you.
