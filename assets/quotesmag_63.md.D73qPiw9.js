I do, but it ain't for everybody. If you like it perked, you can't do better than this model. Timeless styling, and stainless steel (not that aluminum junk). Works flawlessly, goes right into the dishwasher. My only gripe is that it does not come with operating instructions.

It makes good, hot coffee - perfect for morning wake-up and filling your thermos. The wide bottom provides a large surface area to bring the pot to a quicker boil, and the synthetic handle can be bare-handed (unlike those stupid metal handled 'camping gear' coffee pots that require an oven mitt just to pour your coffee). I'm with the crowd that prefers the flavor of perked coffee over that of drip coffee, and I like the fact that you're not pouring your coffee through a chemical laced paper filter (percolators typically use a permanent metal basket filter). My one caveat is the inside lip at the bottom, which, as another reviewer noted, makes thoroughly cleaning difficult, but it's not a big deal given that you do BOIL the contents every time you make coffee (and it's far easier to clean than the reservoirs of drip coffee makers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Camping Coffee Maker","review":"I bought this coffee maker for a camping trip. There were alot of coffee drinkers that came up. Instant coffee didnt seem like a good option so I thought the old fashion coffee maker would be the best solution.

I really like how sturdy this one is compared to my Coleman, which had very flimsy internal parts that quickly bent out of shape and made the pot unusable after a while. This percolator has no such problems with its parts. My only complaints are that I do detect a slight metallic taste to my coffee, and because the rim of the pot curves in, it's hard to get all the water out of the pot during washing. I do think that part of this is just me and that I need to get a better quality of coffee (I've been using Dunkin Donuts). Other than that, I am really pleased with this percolator so far and don't regret my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome. Makes great coffee","review":"We just got a new Keureg.

When I first bought it I took the advice posted by others and replaced the plastic top with a glass top from the web site below. The glass top is great and has never leaked. I get tons of compliments on my coffee which admittedly takes more time to make than with a drip maker. The taste is well worth the wait!Buy the glass top and you shouldn't have a problem (I ordered two to have an extra- now I can use the spare on the new pot!) I don't bother trying to get the grounds out first when pouring- just leave 'em in and turn the heat down to low to keep remaining coffee warm but not perking anymore.

I was pretty much expecting something made with very thin easy to ding and break metal but this is pretty thick stuff. I work metal a lot and this is really well made. The only negative would be that plastic perk top but I've ordered a glass replacement. A few have complained about losing the spring but that is easy to remedy. Just \\"SLIGHTLY\\" pinch the bottom coil smaller with pliers so that the spring holds itself on by friction to the boiler tube and problem solved. This little gem will be perfect for that occasional electric outage and/or a camping item.

Built to last","review":"I purchased this percolator (and an electric version by Presto) after searching high and low for a decent cup of homemade coffee. I tried the fancy french press and was not impressed. Drip machines produced the same boring cup and the Keurig would get the coffee hot enough (and cost a fortune in pods). I finally came across this Farberware stove top percolator. The coffee is delicious and the unit in nice and heavy. Definitely built to last. The only down side is the pot must be watched. Once the water boils you need to turn down the heat then time the percolation. I bought an electric percolator for the days when I don't have the time to hang out by the stove and love it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be taken off the market.","review":"It makes decent coffee, but the functionality of this paticular perc. is dangerous. You are supposed to remove the lid and take out the grounds basket prior to pour. It would be a little easier if the top from which you grab onto wasnt stripped from its steel lid. So you have to hold it a certain way and apply pressure at a certain angle so what little of the threads you have left can grab onto something to take the lid off. Then..... grab onto the grounds basket, with a pot holder mind you, we're dealing with hot steamy coffee here, lift and let drain a little and set into sink. I have had burns and hot grounds spills and frustrations just cleaning this thing. While looking for a different perc, I ran into a picture of this thing and had to right a review, my first, to warn people. I have had great experience with the 4 cup screw base perc. Im going to check out the 9 cup size and its reviews. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Design Cheap Material","review":"No problems with the plastic cap like some people seem to have a problem with, but it's very poorly designed. Normal pot of water takes 4 or 5 minutes to boil, but with this water takes 25 minutes on an open flame to get hot enough to perk. Also, instead of putting a ridge to hold the filter at the proper level they decided to use a cheaply made loose spring (which got lost easily) which rests on, guess what, a ridge on the stem that couldn't have served the same damn purpose to just hold the filter level if they had bothered to put it high enough. I won't ever buy anything from this company again (I've had a ton of coffee makers including high-end). Farberware is a bad company that uses the cheapest materials they can possibly get away with. What a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Truth in Advertising","review":"This is advertised with having a GLASS top which is a lie. The top knob is made of PLASTIC. Why does this concern me - heated up plastic leeches into the water. AND, this is advertised as holding 8 cups. Well when I measured cups of water - six cups of water hit the 8 cup mark. So in addition to lying about the glass top, they also lie about this being an 8-cup coffee maker.

It should have been made of glass like the old quality percolatos like Revere. If you buy this, be prepared to shell out for a glass top, which is available and should be on all new percolators.

But when she used it for the first time after washing it she realized the bottom of the pot was made from aluminum. Because when she dried it with a white towel, black tarnish came off onto the towel.She asked me why I would give her a aluminum pot that would cause her to get Alzheimer's disease. Ugh! How was I to know a stainless steel pot would have an aluminum bottom? Boy, it was an embarassing moment to say in the least.I must say the basic construction and look of the pot is great. But if you don't like to use aluminum pots, then I guess you won't like this coffee pot. It's a shame because I really did like it. I will be returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of cheap plastic lid cap","review":"The knob on the lid is just a cheap piece of plastic.

I am not a heavy coffee drinker so I do not make coffee everyday. It does make very tasteful coffee but the so called glass top is not glass but rather plastic. Now the stupid thing has melted on one side and you cannot lift the top without the dome lifting out and it is very easy to get burned on the hot liquid if it splashes on you.

I noticed the first time we used it that the plastic handle was loose. I bought a camp screwdriver to tighten it. Unfortunately, the handle came completely off the second time we used it. It looked like it was glued on. Don't think that glueing a plastic handle to metal constitutes durable construction. I don't recommend this product, or any with a plastic handle. Returned this and am looking for a better made metal handled percolator to replace this joke of a coffee pot with. Totally lame to lose the handle on our trip. Don't buy this cheaply made product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farberware 50124 Classic Yosemite Stainless Steel Percolator","review":"I didn't have it long and the clear bubble top broke when washing.

The handle is also only attached at one point, and I doubt it will last. I sent mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Percolator kit?","review":"I rarely review products, but I felt compelled to make an exception with this percolator, The reviews of this product that I read seemed to be good and reasonable over all except for the plastic, (easily replaceable with glass), top. I ordered it. I didn't realize I was getting a coffee pot kit. When it arrived the handle wasn't attached. There weren't even any holes drilled for the screw. This could have worked out OK If I wanted to be different and, say... mount the handle on the side. Then I put the lid on the pot and couldn't get it back off with any amount of force. I stopped short of snapping the plastic top off. I had to pry it off with a screwdriver. Needless to say I'm sending it back for a refund. P. S.

By the time I got the email the item was already shipped. Of course when it arrived it also has a plastic top. Why don't they just change their description? Who knows. The percolator works great, looks great, but if you are trying to get rid of plastic in the kitchen be forewarned - the knob on top is plastic, not glass. On the upside, I was able to get a glass knob at my local mom and pop hardware store for 2.00. A much better deal than ordering it from an independent seller on Amazon and paying through the nose for shipping. The small glass top from Fitz-all fits the pot perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic coffee!!","review":"Can't believe how much better the coffee is from this maker than from a drip maker.

The stainless is not as heavy, and it has a plastic top from which to see the \\"perks.\\" That said, though, I am very happy with this purchase. It makes a considerable amount of coffee -- enough for me to pack a thermos and for me and my husband to have two to three mugs of coffee together before work. The coffee is delicious!

My main reason for buying this product was to get away from plastic and the uncertainty of BPA. Next, the construction is awful. There's a recession in the interior bottom as well as a lip on the interior top. Both make it very difficult to clean oil residues completely or to rinse and drain completely.

My mother had one when I was small, but changed to the new\\"drip\\" model that everyone else seems to use. Boy what a difference a percolater makes, in making a fantastic cup of coffee! If you truly like coffee, then this is the right percolator for you. It is made so very well (Farberware) both inside and out. You will not even have to use any filters, because the filter basket is so well made, that the coffee stays where it belongs, in the basket, not in the pot. I have had the very best drip coffeemakers available and nothing came even close to this percolator. It only takes about 10 minutes to make the most delicious coffee you will ever taste, it is worth the wait!!!

Patrick Gallagher recommended it to me, and I am grateful to him for this.Weil's lectures are full of witticisms, that perhaps only he could pull off. e.g. Weil claims that Analytic Number Theory is not Number Theory, and says that Hadamard was certainly not a Number Theorist (he knew him well).

It's supposed to be a spoof of Plautine comedy, and the physical humor is more effective on a smaller, more intimate scale than in this lavish production. The unchanging stage setting of the three house entrances (of Lycus, Senex, Erroneus) is essential for a lot of the humorous chase- and-hiding scenes, and the film ruins that aspect by taking us inside the houses and around the city. The soundtrack is fine with the big numbers (\\"Comedy Tonight,\\" \\"Everybody Ought to Have a Maid,\\" \\"Lovely\\"), but the filler music is dull.

However, mostly it was a disappointment. The script was uneven, and much of the humor was either sexist or a bit raunchy in nature, which may be somewhat true to the Roman view of women, but it became tiresome after a while. My husband and son found it overdone, as well.That said, there were some really funny bits in it and many of the actors did a wonderful job. Buster Keaton was brilliant, as usual. Even in his older years and with a lesser role, he managed to milk the most from it.

Oh, did I forget the vestal virgin who really isn't a virgin? Oh, wait. Did I forget the young hero out to collect a cup of mare's sweat as a love potion?

His facial expressions punctuate his every word (you've GOT to see The Producers). Every big comedian from early comedy is in this film. Phil Silvers reprises his usual shady character role, and this was Buster Keaton's final performance. Other than his silents, this was his best as the father searching for his lost family, all recognizable by the rings they were gifted at birth. Now, who would put a gaggle of geese on a ring as a family crest? Only Keaton. There is a refined Stoogesesque quality about the \`G' rated orgy scene, as well as the search for a cup of mare sweat, and the whole film is performed with dignified lunacy.

Reading this book not only helped me to understand what life would be like if I chose to pursue a career in biology but it also talked about the details of a life that are hard to learn from the outside: the world-view, the ethical code, the experience of the daily life of a biologist. One of the best things I learned from this book is that for a person interested in biology there are many options, including being a devoted amateur. I still don't know what the future holds for me. This book was only one piece of the puzzle but it is an important piece and the lessons I learned go beyond biology."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book should be read by every college biology major!","review":"Janovy presents an enjoyable, readable overview of how one becomes a biologist.

I know it's so 80's and the production quality makes it look like a senior project (that's senior in high school, not college). But kids just go nuts for it, I don't know why. I think it's the guy's voice, plus I think the songs are relatable for a toddler. It's just perfect for that age. It was my brother-in-law's favorite VHS as a kid (he's now 17) and all the kids my mother-in-law watched loved it as well. When my daughter was a baby my MIL pulled it out and had her watch it. I was like whatever, she'll never like this, but she loved it so much I ended up buying my in-laws the DVD for their house to replace the old VHS. Now I'm looking for a CD of the songs to play in the car because my daughter is always requesting them and my singing voice is not the greatest!

It sat on a shelf until I finally gave in on videos when my son was 19 months. He absolutely loves it and will watch no other video. The video is engaging for a toddler--very low budget but of real kids running around doing stuff--and the songs range from entertaining to instructive. I only have one criticism. There is a song on the video about needing a blanket as a security object. If the blanket is taken away for washing, the child might be \\"lonely\\", \\"scared\\", \\"get angry\\" or \\"cry\\". The song does nothing but model insecurity for children who don't presently feel it and reinforce it for those who do. I was horrified when my son ran to get a blanket from his room while watching this song. He hasn't done that since but I could see this being a big influence on kids. The song should go. Otherwise it keeps my son out of my hair for a half an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be crazy, because I HATED it","review":"I thought the production quality was horrible and the songs were boring. i don't \\"get it\\" and neiter does my 18month old.

My son loved it (addicted to it, even)! But I absolutely could not stand it. For one thing, it has a lot of kids in it, but not many babies--so, why is it called Baby Songs? I especially despised the song with the alien in the tub. I finally sold it at a garage sale to some other poor, unsuspecting mother. At least with the DVD, you can skip the really bad songs. The good ones seem to be at the end. My favorite is \\"So Big.\\" But I recommend buying the Baby Einstein series instead. The music is better, and my son loves them just as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Songs","review":"I started to play this video when my son was 3mths old. I thought it was corny at first. But by the time he was 6mths he was bouncing in his chair, kicking his feet to the beat. I swear he is singing along with the all the songs. We don't have a dog and He keeps saying doggie. Which is from the song \\"Baby's Good Doggie\\". You will find yourself singing the songs to your baby all the time. My husbund does too!

This is actually so bad it's upsetting!","review":"To start with...this is the first DVD I have played for my child that he did not take to immediately. Any new DVD show he stops everything he's doing and goes up to the tv to watch it. Usually takes a few times of watching something for him to finally get a little tired of it. He has never ever decided to crawl away the moment a new DVD show came on but he did with this. I had to take him over to the tv so he could see it was a new show and he had zero interest! Totally shocking! Turns out lucky me though cause this dvd and the music are horrific! Unbearable to listen to and that's putting it mildly. OMG! Just so incredibly bad I cannot even describe. You people are nuts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby songs original","review":"All 3 of my kids have enjoyed this video.I first bought the VHS version in 1997 for my son. He and his brother loved it.

They absolutely loved to bop along when they were younger, and soon started to sing along. The lyrics are cute and fun, and the accompanying stories on the live action video were eye catching. This was a must in our VCR whenever the boys were cranky. I have a newborn, and can't wait to see if he finds it as compelling as his older brothers. It's a must have, and I've given it as gifts to all my friends with new babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps kids interested that's for sure!","review":"My son loved this video and watched it over and over. It kind of drove us crazy at times because we couldn't get the songs out of our heads. I think overall the video is pretty good but they could have left the puppet out from the last song. Those kind of puppets scare kids so why would they put that in a kid's video called \\"Baby Songs\\". Now we have a granddaughter who is hooked on the video. Even though she still watches her Elmo and Barney tapes, she has moved on to Baby Songs. No one dare walk in front of her when she's watching this one. I think the tunes are very catchy and after a decade we're singing these songs in our heads again!

She's old enough to sing along with the songs, little sound bytes from \\"Today I took my diapers off\\" accompany us everywhere.

She has that rare ability to keep both the suspense and the romance building to the very end. I changed my mind about who the villain was at several points in the story, which kept me reading long into the night. Editor Jessie Rhoades, a woman with a mysterious past who is determined to remain independent and self-sufficient, is a perfect counterpoint to freelance reporter Clay Christopher, still grieving over his inability to save his wife's life and equally determined to keep Jessie safe. It's clear that the author is intimately acquainted with the newspaper business and its potential to create heroes and villains. Lamb's writing is crisp, colorful and intelligent, well worth the hardcover price. This reviewer is anxiously awaiting her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"caught in the act","review":"It is a truly wonderful read that makes you want to keep reading this suspenseful novel to the very end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Joyce Lamb!","review":"I really like Joyce Lamb's books and have read several of them.

Then the end of the story came and it was pretty pitiful for an ending.

I was bothered by much of the plot; there were what I considered gratuitous killings-too many and not always necessary or predictable in the plot. The antagonist was under-developed as a character; the reader should have had more of a repulsion for her.

This one seemed to fill the bill. It's a good looking watch with classic lines. The design is simple but elegant and not too flashy. In fact, it is quite understated compared to many watches I've seen. One thing though, the watch is somewhat small. I had to double check to see if I hadn't received the woman's version by mistake. Compared to a Kenneth Cole tank watch I own, it's half as thick and maybe two-thirds the size. I was afraid it wouldn't look right as I have large hands and wrists. But after trying it on, it actually looks pretty good. It is certainly unobtrusive. On the negative side, the date window is tiny. It's difficult for my fifty year old eyes to read. I haven't owned it long enough to judge it's durability, but based on appearances and Bulova's reputation, it should hold up well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bulova Classic","review":"This watch is classy,accurate,and by no means a sissy watch,it is very tough despite it beung a smaller watch.if you do not mind a smaller watch you will love it,if you prefer larger heavier watches then do not buy it.most people will not be able to read the date window.Bulova makes an excellent watch and this one will be around for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"For dress or business","review":"Perfect with suit or \\"black tie\\".

Phone, cable TV, and internet use, all require their own access point. Most drill bits won't reach. This gadget does a beautiful job. It's solid steel and feels heavy. The allen wrench does a good job of holding the bit solidly, too.One small problem; the head of the extension is about 5\\\\8 of an inch in diameter, and the two small set screws will typically project another 1\\\\16 of an inch, or so. This sets a limit on how small a hole you can make with a full reach. Still, I consider this extension a must-have in a drill kit. Very solidly made, should last forever.

Right from the beginning of the story with the stormy weather in this coastal town you just want to curl up with the book somewhere with a good cup of coffee and turn the phone off so you won't be interrupted.

Gauche pushes Link who pushes Kuroda Jubie who pushes back and some where in there, among the Indians and others Cristina just gets pushed around.I always think of this movie when I am watching \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" (1941); the conversation between Sam Spade and Kasper Gutman where Sam insists that he can not be influence by the threat of death. If they killed him then they would not get the bird. Kasper says it takes a fine balance and not to push too hard, as there is no telling what a man may do in the heat of the moment and forget where his interests lie.Well this film has a lot of heated moments and a lot of funny moments when the different cultures clash.

The graphics however are good and the control easy to use but the game lacks any serious tone or theme, does not have that many functions (3 guns, 5 types of grenades, some updates for guns earned by tokens after you complete a level and 4 or 5 orders you can give to your team mates [max of two only team mates!]). It plays more like some Arcade game as you move about the levels. It is a serious step back in the wrong direction for the SWAT series. I would recommend renting this before you choose to buy it. It is only just okay but the gameplay value is not there and it misses suspense completely. YAWN.Go buy SWAT 3 instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like what I expected","review":"If you're a fan of the Sierra computer series Swat then you're in for a surprise this game is really quite different from the Swat series.I was hoping this would be a take off from Swat 3 but it took a different twist. It's more like a shooter and I really didn't rely on by squad to much, rather I just had then open doors for me and when I was low on health I made them parade in front of me. One thing I didn't like about the game is the script, they had wierd lines were they were trying to act tough. It just didn't fit.One nice feture to the game is the gun upgrade, through out the course of the game you get points to use towards you upgrading your guns.This game could have been much better, oh well maybe next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, i got it because its 4 player","review":"I got the because because i have a multitap and play 4 player, although i havent tried it with the multi tap yet, the game story it pretty fun"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Highly Informative Book","review":"This is one of the few optimistic books to come out on our social activists) challenging of the global economy.

The strength of Seeds of Fire which begins with the Battle of Seattle is in the wealth of illustrations offered and of course the timeliness.

Most of them sound exactly the same as the originals just a bit more produced. How lazy is this band???? Also as I said they aren't that talented. They make catchy music which grabs people attention but look at the actual musicianship....it sucks. This cd should only draw in fans that are about 10 years old.

They are NOT non-stick so a cooking spray has to be used. The little tab handles on the cups are hard to hold with a pot holder which is necessary since they are so hot.

Beyond that, the cups are hard (and somewhat dangerous) to remove once the eggs are done. Their handles are hot, and they're too small to grip well with a pot holder.

They're pretty much on the money. The cup frame is very thin and flimsy. The cups are small, but at least they're a bit deeper than most other poachers. And it's those cups where this really fails. All the metal is non-stick, but the parts that NEED to be non-stick, the cups, are plastic. If you don't oil them, you will NOT be able to get the eggs out in one piece. Another problem is that the cups don't transfer heat very well. The tops of the eggs will cook firm (from the steam captured by the lid) but the bottom of the eggs are still liquid. My old all-metal poacher cooked eggs just the way I like them in 3 min, 30 secs. After 6 minutes, the bottom of the eggs were still liquid, which I had to sop up off the place with a paper towel.

What took 4 1/2 minutes in my old poacher (to medium) takes at least 8 minutes in the Farberware due to the thick plastic cups which are apparently a poor conductor of heat. By then the eggs have accumulated significant condensed water on top of the cup and the egg is generally poorer quality. I contacted Farberware. They asked for a model number and indicated they would replace it. The poacher had no model number on the unit anywhere.

Consequently, the eggs take a long time to cook (more than 6 minutes), and, because the plastic cups are non-heat-conducting, the eggs cook from the top down, leaving the white jiggly while the yolks get hard. To add insult to injury, the eggs stick to the cups even with the use of butter or cooking spray. I ended up going to e-Bay and finding a Mirro egg steamer from the 1950s, like my mother used.

There are not openings in the back for your external commections. I am constantly loading Geocaches into mine so everytime I have to take the case all the way off to connect it. I also have to take it off to plug it into my car, and at night this is helpfull do to the back light staying on when it is externaly powered. I would not recomend this if you use your external ports. However if you do not I realy like the look and feel of this case, just wish they would have left port holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin case review","review":"Protective case does protect, but does not enable you to have it protected and in your car holder or atv holder at the same time. Also does not provide a hole for plugging in the separate car charger. The cover is durable but when buttons are pushed it tends to be much harder than it should be. If the velcro closure on the bottom is put too tight, then the rocker or enter buttons on the garmin get stuck down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid feel, pretty good product","review":"The Garmin case does exactly what it's supposed to. One flaw is the plastic window can get scratched easily. It would appear that one needs to put a scratch protector over the protector.Also, due to the very tight fit, when using the rocker button it's very difficult to go \\"left\\" with the rocker. The plastic is sitting right on the rocker and I have to practically press the \\"FIND\\" button to go left.However, the fit is perfect, I can shove some paper between the unit and the cover, and it doesn't interfere with the clip-on feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine Idea, but not needed for a rugged unit like the 60 Series","review":"In my opinion, the 60 series is already a waterproof, rugged unit. The lack of feel for the controls and ports doesn't seem to make sense to me for the little bit of added protection. I use mine mounted on a dirtbike for keeping tack of where I'm at up in the forest. I've taken many falls and the unit, unprotected, keeps on chugging. If I fell directly where screen met rock point, I'm sure the screen would crack, but I'm not so sure this case would help protect under that limited circumstance anyway. If I was overly concerned about scratches on the screen, just get a screen protector.Just my 0.02."},{"rating":"2","title":"GPS case","review":"OK protection but not really needed.

Half of the buttons are covered up when the GPS is put in it, and the GPS antenna is in the way of the flap to close the case. I also assumed that this case could be attached to my belt. I doubt that I will ever use this product without major modifications, and I would advise anyone to not purchase this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrying Case","review":"This carrying case does what it is supposed to - protect the expensive electronic device inside it while allowing full functionality. I am very pleased that I can easily press all of the buttons through the case. The only drawback to this item is that there is no access to the back data port and power port. This is a minor inconvenience, but maybe the next generation case could have a flap on the back for access, as I use both of these ports regularly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"Protects the Garmin's 60 screen from scratches, but interferes with the button operations a little. Worth the hassle to protect the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, with some minor flaws","review":"Purchased this to protect my Garmin 60CSx and it works great. A snug fit and it is a nice second skin to an already rugged device.I do have to make notice to some minor flaws. It is a little difficult to get the cover off for USB and battery access. I have also noticed that the stitching around the lanyard and belt clip knob is beginning to come loose. These are the areas that always get caught up when you have to take off the case to access the USB or battery compartments.I went the extra step for protection and bought an Invisible Shield for the screen. In order to hook the GPS unit up to my bike I have to remove it from the Garmin case. I was wishing that Garmin would develop a carrier that would hold with the case still on the unit.For the price you can't beat it. Any stitching problems I'll fix up myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Protective GPS Case for GPSMap 60C / 60CS","review":"I bought this case for my Garmin GPSMAP 60 CSX and it fits perfect! Some reviewers indicated a problem with pressing the buttons on the face of the 60 CSX, due to the see-thru cover over the buttons, however, I haven't found this to be a problem. The case is black and well made in typical Garmin fashion. It will definitely protect my $400 GPS, from scratches and falls. This is a \\"must have\\" for the Garmin 60 CSX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost GPS with this terrible cover","review":"Clipped the GPS to my webbing using the clip/screw (with loctite), and the screw backed out-- lost GPS. Anything that is not a pouch with permanent straps to put on a belt is going to loose your GPS.This thing is a terrible piece of engineering, but Garmin probably likes it because they loose and sell more units this way.Do yourself a favor-- do NOT use this case. You will loose you GPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neoprene case for Garmin 60CSx","review":"Not worth buying. The stitching began to come out almost immediately, and after a week it was unraveling in two places.

You may need to squeeze the plastic to read it.

Very stylish and improves look of Garmin GPS. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product terrible design","review":"This product is actually useful, but the serious design flaws render this productivity tool less useful then you would have believed, when you purchased it.The serious flaws are;- There is no holder for the pen, the one supplied is an external attachment and is totally useless. This means that if you forget, misplace or lose your pen, the Notepad will be rendered useless.- The USB port is totally a design flaw. The USB port socket is deep inside the slot in the front, and only the cable supplied by the product vendor fits in. No other standard USB cable can be used, I have tried atleast 10.So in short, a great product with a crappy design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bait and switch - you just have to know the terms","review":"I'm sorry you were surprised.The description on the Internet and here at Amazon clearly states that it uses European standard A5 paper. \\"..any ordinary paper or notepad up to 5.9 x 8.3 can be used\\"There are more than 111,000 results on Google for \\"a5 writing pad\\"Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Digipad or any reseller.

The characters are flat and if it wasn't for stereotypes they would have any development at all. This is paperback porn filled with \\"oooo baby you're so strong\\" etc. I couldn't bring myself to care for any of the characters good or bad and barely finished the book. The idea that the female villian was secretely pleased with the violent rough handling during sex and \\"couldn't get enough\\" was not only off-putting, it was sad. S&M has it's place I suppose but don't categorize it under \\"Romance\\". If you are looking for HOT,HARD sex scenes this series is for you (\\"Erotic\\" is putting it mildly). If you are looking for romance, adventure and a riveting story - save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 stars...it wasn't magic for me.","review":"I have to agree with the last several reviewers. This could have been a very good book. There was a grood premise, great good guys who were sexy, creepy bad guys, a decent setting...but it just lacked something undefinable. You end up thinking, \\"Why did I waste my time with this?\\" It was fresh at the beginning and just stalled some where in the middle & became lost in itself. By the ending you just don't really care about the characters anymore.This book has set itself up to start a series but it lacks the spark to carry it through. Maybe if they go back to the drawing board & edit the next one critically I'll pick it up. Otherwise I wouldn't waste the money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it zero stars I would","review":"The book started out good but shortly fizzled. The sex scenes were too much and were probably put in cause the author needed to add pages to the book. The heroine had no depth to her at all; and the hero---well let's just say DUD!!!!! The author ended the book indicating that there would be a sequel, but the way it's written I say who cares!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"I bought this book after reading the other positive reviews and wow- was this a huge disappointment. The storyline is boring, writing is mediocre, and generally found the interruptions in the plot to add gratuitous sex scenes that were not in the least bit moving nor pleasant, quite annoying. Didn't even finish the book. Lousy all the way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I got over halfway thru this book before I gave up on it. Instead of getting better it gets worse. I have to wonder why other authors gave this book such glowing reviews. The writing style is alright but the story is very weak. The world is coming to an end...friends and family are captured, tortured and killed. So what do our heros do? They have sex, a lot. There is nothing of substance here. If you want to read about magic read Jim Butcher or Kim Harrison. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing coupled with poorer erotica","review":"If you are like me, always on the look out for new paranormal erotica - pass on this dreadful book. The writing is flat and uninspired, old ideas saturated with vegan-wicca descriptions that left me shaking my head.

The characters were poorly developed and not particularly likeable. It would have been a much better story if the characters were more personable. I can't say the sex scenes were all that riveting either. All in all, a very disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one took some effort","review":"There came a point I almost sat it down and left it. The sex scenes were written well enough and not too numerous, HOWEVER, I grow tired of heroines who repeatly do stupid things in the name of \\"feminine independence\\". Too many of the fight scenes seemed contrive and Dark Wolf's character was as thin as the paper he was written on. Hell, I liked the demon, Junga, better than most of the witches. Oh--and the battle with the Dark Side--Please! That got real old, real fast. I hope McCray's other works are better. You want good sex woven into decent plots, go for a little Keri Arthur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish the book.","review":"I purchased this book on the positive reviews from the author and others.....I usually love the paranormal romance....but was not ready for the overly sexual nicknames of human body parts in the non-romantic scenes.

I would never recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"Fortunately my local library had this book in, and I am so very glad that I didn't order it! The author starts out with a potentially good plot. However, the book soon boils down to brief and sometimes senseless action spacing out the ever-more vulgar sex scenes. If you enjoy L.K. Hamilton's newer books, then this may be right up your alley. For my money, Kelley Armstrong and Patricia Briggs have far more talent and imagination when it comes to supernatural romance stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I've read books in this genre by many different authors, but I was so disappointed by this book that I threw this one in the trash where it belonged. \\"Forbiden Magic\\" was way too cliche and I'd classify it as more of a badly-written erotica instead of a paranormal romance. The plot was jerky, the heroine lacked depth, and the storyline was way too predictable. Spend your money on a good Rachel Caine novel or something by LKH or even Kim Harrison instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I'd like this","review":"I've read some of McCray's older Ellora's Cave books, and they were good. They weren't deep. They didn't take themselves so seriously or try to be anything more than what they were. They were squirm-in-your-seat erotic, written for women, and that was what was good about them. This book just didn't do it for me. It felt like McCray was trying too hard to write a serious book. It was dry. It was slow. Meh."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's sad....","review":"I work in a book store and tell people not to buy this book. I warn them. It was the first romance I ever did let alone paranormal, which I am notseasoned in no thanks to Ms. McCray. I wanted to go to her signing cause she lives here in the area near me in Arizona. Glad I didn't cause I would have to tell her. Please stop. Crude probably...but as a future writer...and a seasoned reader, it's an example of what not to do...I also don't recommend Elloras cave. Yes erotic romance but crappy erotic romance. These writers are horrific at times. Some of us have read alot in these genres and these are books we do not reccomend at all.

I loved this book. Extremely exciting, interesting and captivating. Not for the faint of Heart. The Author is not afraid to go there! The Heroinne Silver was strong and a real bad-A Chick that retains her femininity. The Hero-Hawk was gorgeous, dark, strong and sensitive. I like that in a man. The sister's book is out now also.

The charactors are one-dimensional and the paranormal stuff seems to have been added in because it sells well. There were lots of hot sex scenes, but they intruded rather than adding to the story - again, they seemed to have been added because that is what someone thinks will sell well. The book was too long, yet managed to leave all kinds of loose ends. I assume there will be sequals, but I don't really care about any of the charactors enough to want to read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"barely adequate...","review":"The willing suspension of disbelief eluded me completely with this book.This seems to be an exercise in something (but what?)and it's not working."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was rooting for the bad guys!","review":"All the big authors who said great things about this book must of only read the sex parts because this book is really bad. I was rooting for the bad guys to have more sex. This book was like a bad porno movie. Fast forward over the dialogue and get to the good stuff. I only bought this used because I bought number two and realized I should read number one first. Big mistake. The villians are great. They plot and plan and have some banter. The male heros need to take the witches to their dimension, and stay here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version horrible","review":"I am not writing this review in regards to content (because I did not finish it) but about the kindle version. I couldn't actually finish the book because the kindle version was too difficult to read.

As soon as I finished it (I am of the I-paid-for-this-book-and-I-WILL-finish-it school of readers), I pitched it across the room in disgust. The characters were one dimensional and unengaging (I truly didn't care, at the end of the book, whether the hero and heroine remained together), the schools of magic, though well thought out, actually managed to be boring and the \\"erotic scenes\\", though trying to be cutting edge and titillating (i.e., lots of \\"naughty\\" words and the inclusion of a demon \\"warrioress\\" in human form with a penchant for poorly written D/s) seemed formulaic. If you must read this book, buy it used or borrow it from a friend or library. Better yet, I'll give you my copy. I certainly won't be selling it at the used book shop or on half.com as I do most of my books; given the quality, I couldn't live with my conscience if I made someone else PAY to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - Disappointing execution","review":"I was truly looking forward to this book. The cover (ala Kim Harrison) and the description, urban fantasy and romance within a framework of Irish mythology, were intriguing.What a disappointment. My daughters and I all read this book and the best description we could come up with is repetative. The plot only moves forward because the main characters have lapses of judgement and I tired of the constant references to the bulging musculature of the hero; I won't even get into the muffins and cookies. There are more adjectives available and more interesting things to describe.

Of course, he thinks it should be called a Neptune lamp, because Saturn is yellow with a big ring and Neptune is blue with a small ring. (I checked photos of the planets; he's right!) He loves the cool blue glow and swirling red, green, and blue streaks.

The handles stick out 2 inches each, so the length of the griddle with the handles is 22 inches.Anyway, I gave it a 4 because I've used it about 10 times now and managed to get a small nick in the teflon--I'd prefer if it was a bit tougher.

Since we had it, we still gave it a try to see if maybe it was one of those warnings that was somehow exaggerated. Turns out it wasn't! The coating on the bottom of the griddle began to separate from the griddle and became attached to the cooktop. I don't think we did any permanent damage -- but we'll never use it on the cooktop again. We still need a double griddle for our cooktop.

At least on one of the selection positions (I am only using #1 & #2), only one speaker of the pair is predictably engaged unless the switch is repeatedly cycled on and off. If left on, within days, the switch becomes inactive on the same speaker and the cycling has to be repeated to get it to engage. This may be a unique issue with this particular switch of the four, but I suspect it is common because of how sloppy the switch action is across all four switches. Also, the on/off symbol is virtually unseen regardelss of switch position.

Several of the songs are a bit too wordy and very much About Something (steel mills, historical events, nostalgia for golden days gone by, etc.) There are a few tracks on here where they lighten up a bit, though, notably on the excellent heart song, \\"Perfect Fool,\\" and on a trio of fine instrumentals, but the gabbier numbers do creak and groan a little around the edges.

I'm not sure if Diesel are trying to increase the longevity of the battery...or whether the lack of brightness is supposed to be part of the 'look' of this watch, but it just doesn't work.Apart from the dimly lit numbers, the band feels a bit funny.

It looks nice and the design is different, but the negative aspects simply are too much at this point. First, the book they sent with the watch does not contain instructions for this particular model. Therefore, you spend hours trying to figure out how to set the time, which is not easy. There is a big problem with actually seeing anything on the screen, you basically have to push the light button to make sense of the numbers, if you don't, it looks so pale that it is very hard to see.

I followed the recipe for tartlet shells that came with the pan, didn't use any cooking spray, and they FELL RIGHT OUT when done! They were also nicely crunchy and sturdy. The next time I bake them, I'll prick them a little better with a fork and chill longer so they won't shrink so much when baking, but otherwise they were perfect. The recipe makes 12, so you won't have to freeze any leftover dough.I brushed the bottoms and sides of the shells with a little melted semisweet chocolate so they wouldn't soak up the filling, let that chill, and then filled with lemon curd and topped with a splooge of whipped cream.

They have a very unconventional band and sound, with multiple keyboards, hand drums, violins, and the traditional bass and guitar section. The songs are creative and a lot of attention has obviously been paid on lyrical craftsmanship. Most of the songs are very intelligent and cover a range of punk-feeling topics, from dissatisfaction with the current socio-political realities, analysis of failed friendships, to angst and bitterness with consumerism and the 'me, me, me' culture. It's not all down, though, and you may find an upbeat love song hidden in the mix. =)The music itself is often very pleasant, sometimes in stark contrast to the lyrics laid down on top of them.

The soundtrack as well as the quality of the low budget production gave it that super VHS feel. Now having said that, I did find the film enjoyable even if the twist (if you can call it that) was so obvious.A gang of art thieves hold up in a warehouse awaiting the fence who will arrive in the morning. They also have an unplanned person (Meisha Johnson) with them who they have to tie up. The rat infested warehouse, we are told, was once used to make porno films. The number 32369 appears written on the wall and is the movie's other mystery.

Although they all have different authors the photography is exceptional. The book concentrates on four areas and the villages that make up each area.

First they had to postulate an alien race _and_ an unknown disease just to set up a situation that would throw the lead characters together.Having set up a relationship, they basically ended with series without resolving it, and used the mythical disease as a metaphor for something else.Lots of series need a \\"hook\\" to bring the main characters together; but I want a story to move on from there. This seemed stuck in the early stages until it abruptly ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning performances from Berenger and Winger","review":"This is an incredibly memorable film about white supremicists that explores racism in it's most extreme form. Debra Winger is an undercover agent who infiltrates a community of seemingly innocent hard working farmers but as the film progresses the hatred and evil lurking beneath the surface becomes more and more evident. Shocking at times and realistically written and acted, this is a thought provoking and disturbing movie that deserves more attention than it has received. Not one you will soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded my Expectations","review":"Great movie with 2 very good actors; Tom Behringer and Debra Winger. Debra Winger plays an undercover FBI agent and her job is to check out Behringer suspected of KKK involvement. Winger gets romantically involved with Behringer and at first goes into denial that he is in fact involved in KKK activity but soon finds out that he is. A good watch and I give this movie 5 stars. Definitely worth the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"You really want to know what will happen next","review":"This is a really good movie.

He even remains somewhat likable while doing dreadful things and often acts like an ass...a sign of acting well done. He's no Marlon Brando, but he's good. I wish the sex scene had been...sexier.The scene where he finds out she is with the FBI...the look on his face...how sad he clearly is...YIKES. Good stuff.

And I have to agree with Acute Observer in finding this not realistic or believable in many aspects. As flawed as our government is I highly doubt that the FBI would allow a club that hunts young black men to continue on while they look for more evidence. And I found it impossible to believe that Debra Winger's character could continue to love Berenger after discovering that he was a racist murderer. This film is a guilty pleasure- albeit a wierd one.

This book is one thing and one thing only; DUMB. The plot is so stupid I can't even beging describing it. Every conclusion and decision made by the characters comes out of pure illogic thinking, which is always the correct guess. This becomes so annoying you start wondering wether the author actually thought for even a minute about how the plot should develop before starting to write. The twists and turns throughout the book are so absurd it's not even a plot.Oh yeah, the fact that one of the characters is a rapist which is no big deal for the other character which is otherwise described as a fully normal person makes you wonder what kind of person this Suzuki is.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Read In A While","review":"Please, if you like the movies RINGU or THE RING, read this book. It gives a more descriptive and in-depth story about things that weren't entierly explained in the film.

For me the standout tracks would have to be Nothing Left 2, featuring the beautiful voice of Alison Goldblatt, and Know Where To Run. The only part of the album which gets on my nerves a little is I Don't Know You People - to me the womans voice at the beginning becomes a little grating. However, if you are an Orbital fan you can't be without this CD, it's right up there with their best. Even if you haven't heard much of their previous work but you are a fan of dance music you should treat yourself to a copy. Along with Surrender by the Chemical Brothers I'd say The Middle of Nowhere is the album of the year so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, still really good","review":"First off, I want to say that In-Sides, Snivilstation, and basically all of what I've heard of their earlier work is better.But, aside from that, this is still a really cool album. One thing about it is that it's not intelligent like their previous works. The whole cd is just not as interesting to listen to, and as a result I avoid thinking about the music itself. Instead, this cd is much better appreciated as \\"Background\\" or \\"mood\\" music. It's sort of like sophisticated trance, in that it's very rythmic and such, but also not totally lacking in substance.All in all, the album is enjoyable. At first I didn't listen to it much, but I'm still listening to it, so it's high on my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Orbital? :(","review":"In Sides.. it was one of my favourite albums for a loooong time.

Very-very sad.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying cheesy sounds.","review":"I dunno. I was expecting something soothing, trippy, but what I heard was reminiscent of cheesy 70s \\"space age\\" sounds.

I ended up burning most of this album. It's just so bloody good. If you're used to the monotony of four-to-the-floor house/techno then you'll need this to keep your senses alive. The music spins off in all directions, with often slow build ups to the most wonderful synth compositions. Just listen to sample 6...lush as you like!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Orbital CD's ever!","review":"The Middle of Nowhere is by far one of the greatest CD's I own.

Very Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for an electronica fan","review":"This is a long awaited album for many fans of Electronica.

It's just good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Middle of Nowhere ... right at the top!","review":"The Hartnoll brothers consistently come up with legendary albums, but they have really outdone themselves this time.

Did they get a different CD or something?..........this is amazing! This is the best way to follow up In sides, in fact I sort of consider it to be the sequel. Think about it. In sides ended with \\"somewhere OUT there\\", and Middle Of Nowhere begins with \\"way OUT\\". Maybe I'm stretching, but it really seems like a continuation of themes. It also has dark moments and brilliantly uplifting moments like In Sides. A smashing good album...if I do say so......and I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Middle of Nowhere \\"Is where your mind will be...\\"","review":"A must for any Orbital fan and for critics opposed to electronica, do yourself a favor and OPEN YOUR MIND to the Middle of Nowhere!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotically Funkdafied","review":"This CD isn't as good as their earlier stuff. It took a few listens to really appreciate it, but once I did...well let's just say it stays in my discman. The first song \\"Way Out\\" and the fifth one \\"Otono\\" absolutely rock. Just like their other stuff, this album really takes you on a fantastic mind journey. Their music is always an inspiring experience. I could have done without the last song \\"Style\\" however. This is a very good dance album, which is a break from their more serious stlye of mixing. The sounds and samples are brilliant of course. I love the fact that they are called Orbital because in my mind I can actually see each layer of sound revolve/rotate around the other. They (Orbital)slice and dice perfectly, and will remain my favorite electro band forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"what's next?","review":"The middle of nowhere is an album for very clever people. Orbital performance is really amazing.

Similar to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, the movie winds up speaking for more than just the cultures presented. Better than the Greek Wedding movie, this presents two sides of the cultural divide, and provides a wider range of emotional challenge. Denzel Washington and Sarita Choudhury are outstanding in the leads, and the supporting cast puts in a very strong strong.Without spoiling, the ending of the movie was weak.

Just as the citizens of this Texas town rallied around the victim's and their families in search of justice, I hope they come together again to ensure that Springsteen returns to the only place he belongs...prison!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a poorly written and very poorly developed narrative about a horrifying case. Mitchell left out (perhaps didn't have access to?) a lot of information that I think was crucial--such as why the police focused on these suspects, what convinced the parents of the murdered girls that they were guilty, and what if any forensic evidence the police did/do have. Too much of the book was wasted on court transcripts that didn't seem particularly interesting or relevant. I appreciate Mitchell's stated desire to let readers make up their own minds about the suspects' guilt, but there simply is not enough information here for that to be possible. For anyone interested in a thoughtful, well-written and -researched account of justice gone awry, I highly recommend Mara Leveritt'sDevil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emerald-Another Local","review":"I desperately wanted this to be the definitive view on the Yogurt Shop Murders, but was disappointed. I wanted to come away feeling strongly for the convicted's guilt or innocence. A large portion of the middle of the book is taken up with chapters on other crimes being committed in Austin. Why? There was no mention of DNA evidence (was there any? any fingerprints on doors? Why was semen mentioned from a boyfriend, but nothing about any perpetrators?) All you have is the confessions which appear to be coerced.As the parent of a child who worked in a competing yogurt shop at the time of the crime, and who had a child who was friends with a sibling of one of the original accused, it didn't really answer most of my questions. I really wanted to be assured the right people were convicted. Very frustrating.

I even began eating veggies (a little olive oil 10 minutes covered in foil, 5 minutes more and the veggies like squash are excellent). We have had it for over a year and it has never warped. Cleaning the meat off is hard, but soak it for awhile and use a soft brush and it is not as hard as other reviewers say.

I tried it at first with non-stick cooking spray. The spray stayed on the pan and does not come off. Then the non-stick coating bubbled up and is coming off in my food. It also warped really bad because it is aluminum on the inside. DO NOT BUY! Invest in a cast iron griddle instead so you will not have these issues!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't set on stove","review":"The stated measurement of the griddle are accurate. But the angled drain troughs don't allow the griddle to sit down on the stove rack. So one side sits high and causes liquid to fall to one side of grill and it slides all over the top of the stove when your trying to turn food. It cooks the food fine once it stops rolling but its impossible to keep stable on the stove top. My stove is only 2 years old so it should fit on top. I wasted my money and I won't be using it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"1) As others here have said, it's barely non-stick.2) It has a lip on the edge that prevents either side from making direct contact on a flat surface. I have a glass top range so I feel like it would heat faster and more evenly if it could actually make contact with the burner surface.3) Cleaning: the grooves on the grill side are deep, wide (with thin bars that contact the food), and straight up and down. This makes it extremely difficult to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible griddle","review":"The aluminum is so thin it gets scorching hot spots right over the burner while the rest of the griddle remains at a considerably lower temp, making it possible to fry eggs that are burned on one edge and runny on the other.

Luckily, they have a good return policy, because after one use, it's heading back there! I used it to make grilled chicken breasts, asparagus and portobello mushrooms. The food came out great and didn't stick, and had a nice grilled flavor. Then I tried to clean it -- to no avail. I tried everything I know -- soaking it, boiling water and vinegar in it, baking soda, elbow grease -- nothing worked. I only had it on medium heat, so I don't think that was the problem. I'm going to take it back and get a cast iron one."},{"rating":"1","title":"eveything sticks and it is teflon so you cannot clean it","review":"This product looks really good, but it is terrible to use: it is supposed to be non-stick but *everything* sticks to it! I used the lowest heat settings on my stove and had to peel my french toast off it. It wasn't exactly burned -- it was just stuck to the pan. I tried to finish cooking the rest of the french toast and that stuck too. Once I was done cooking, the stuff stuck to the pan was burned and would not come off. I spent about 30 minutes cooking over 3 days and 3 hours cleaning. It is teflon so you can't use anything abrasive to clean it. I returned this and feel much better.

I have tried using oil and cooking spray, but nothing keeps the food from sticking. I got it for Christmas and will return it immediately. It's also impossible to clean.

Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It does the job, but don't overheat it","review":"I bought this product to use as an indoor grill on my gas square stovetop. The grill fits perfectly over two burners and accomodates a lot of food. I called the company because it was so difficult to clean. They told me first, not to overhead the pan and use it on medium heat and second to clean with a soft scrubber sponge or top rack dishwasher. They also sent me a new pan because the first one I ended up destroying the non-stick coating. With this new one I have been coating the pan with a thin layer of oil before cooking and only heating to medium and it is ok. With chicken you really have to oil the pan and don't turn the chicken over too quickly or else it will stick and then it is very hard to clean. It makes great grill marks and the food does come out as if it was on an outdoor grill. I just don't like the cleaning end of it and if you don't like that either then this product is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for simple grilling","review":"I use this grill often for making burgers, pancakes, and patties.You can only grill about 4 things at a time.

Too many times have I forgotten to spray on the necessary copious amounts of Pam anti-stick to watch the first half of breakfast (eggs, pancakes, etc) glued down to a pot holder melting 600 degree surface frantically scraping off the food ashes in attempt to save the last half. Just tonight, I was amazed that fatty, juicy burgers stuck to the grill surface after two coats of the anti-stick spray.If you want to get a gift that looks nice and you know will never be used, get this.

Problem is, it's no longer flat and developed waves like the ocean blue in just a couple of uses. in other words it's now totally warped! ... this was a disappointment, however, it was fun while it lasted... about 2 weeks!

It also turned brown and dicolored by the 2nd use. I returned product figuring it was defect in coating but next one did exact same. I would say pass on this product. Go for the lodge cast iron grill sold on amazon.

Suzanne Pleshette is the cute American tourist on the bus who falls for the dashing tour guide, played by Ian McShane. He has a girl in every port and happily adds the naive Suzanne to his list.The tour group is made up of some great character actors (especially Norman Fell and Reva Rose) who take too many pictures, talk too much, steal everything from the hotels, and generally make Americans look sily.

Few authors have the imagination that she brings to her stories and fewer still have the skill to translate their vision into such vivid and unforgettable characters and prose. Kennedy delivers it all. In Beneath the Thirteen Moons, Kennedy ventures into a new world (literally) and tells a story of a society in crisis that needs to grow and change. In the midst of the turmoil, Kennedy weaves a touching, wonderful love story. Her setting is lush and beautiful and her people are the kind you want to cheer for. You won't be walking in her Regency world, but she will take you someplace exciting and fresh! If you like reading the same old thing over and over, perhaps this author isn't for you. If you like new and interesting stories, I highly recommend BENEATH THE THIRTEEN MOONS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pleased","review":"I liked this fantasy world the author created.

I was looking for a luggage strap that would tighten down--perhaps with a ratcheting action. I thought that this luggage strap would do the trick. I was wrong. This strap refuses to tighten down past a certain point--usually with 1 inch of play or more--more than conventional luggage straps. Once you have it tightened, it does not stay tight--a good yank will cause it to loosen. On my first trip with this strap, it loosened to the point of almost falling off.

The front is mostly empty (black) with a small design in the upper left with a single-color (white) skull and crossbones and a small \\"Surrender the Booty\\".While a pirate shirt is fun for a day on the boat, a normal pirate shirt is somewhat immature for an adult to be wearing.

To this day, I have never heard Les lay a groove that could ever compare to a Larry Graham, James Jamerson, Verdine White, Jaco Pastorius, Ron Carter, or Paul McCartney groove. THESE PLAYERS are a GREAT bass players. Furthermore, Les cannot sing to save his life. To call him a singer is like calling Puff Daddy a singer.

A summary follows each chapter that rephrases main topics for easy comprehension. There is also a CD-ROM enclosed that contains stock charting data and a program.

It works well with my pastry recipes from former wheat-flour-eating days. The crust is light and fragile, with very little grittiness (less than any other product I have tried thus far.) Other family members not on a gluten-free diet happily eat items made with this Pie Crust mix and have requested the pies and lemon squares for family gatherings. One suggestion for those wishing to make a two-crust pie: roll the top crust between two sheets of wax paper, peel off the top layer of wax paper, then carefully invert onto the pie and peel off the other sheet of wax paper so the crust doesn't break apart during handling. Pieces that do break off will re-attach with your fingers. Thanks for offering this superior product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to use","review":"I'm not thrilled with the recipe for making this crust -- I think of a \\"mix\\" as something I need to add only a few ingredients to, but this requires as many extra ingredients as making crust from scratch, and demands a lot of fat.

I've tried Whole Foods frozen crusts, and also made my own from scratch, both of which were so tough they couldn't be cut with a knife! I've also made crusts from gluten-free cookie crumbs which were actually very good. But for a rolled-out crust, this one so far is the very best. I did find that it required some patching, and after it was baked it tended to fall to pieces when cut. However, in my opinion that is much better than a tough crust, and is the sign of its tender, flakiness. I made mine with all butter because I did not have the butter-flavored shortening. The flavor was outstanding, and acutally tasted like a wheat crust. Kudos to Gluten-free pantry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a great pumpkin pie crust!","review":"While very crumbly and hard to work with, it did make an excellent pumpkin pie crust! I also made the bottom of an apple pie with it and topped it with a crumb topping. It would have been very difficult to get a top crust to look pretty. I found it extremely difficult to get it into the pie pan without it breaking into pieces, but in the end after patching it a bit, it turned out delicious! When they say chill, I think they should say freeze for about 10-20 minutes and that will make it slightly easier to handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really long list of ingredients to replace flour, lard, and water BUT delicious","review":"My husband missed pies so much that I was excited to find this product and except for the fact the dough is a lot tougher to handle (it has to be super cold to have a chance of rolling out) it actually is pretty darn good.The only thing that baffles me is that you need the mix, vinegar, butter flavored crisco, butter, eggs, plus a couple more I can't remember offhand to imitate what I used to make with flour, lard, salt, and water.BUT this is still the best substitute out there and I will continue to use it until I find a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pasty pastry","review":"I followed the directions precisely but the end result was the same as using other pre-made GF crusts using a GF flour blend, palm shortening, ice water, salt. The crust looks and feels flaky, but when the fork hits your mouth, it dissolves into a grainy, pasty mush you either need to spit out or drink a glass of milk to get down.I don't know what needs to be added to give it the elasticity and ability to hold together, but whatever it is, this mix doesn't have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serve the Flower Kings","review":"Among the bands that spearheaded the progressive rock revival of the late nineties, The Flower Kings well be the most faithful to it's musical philosophy. Unlike the mellow, almost pop-like musings of Spock's Beard, or the heavy metal bombast of Dream Theater, The Flower King's music is complex, rich with sonic texture, and thoroughly progressive.The first time I spun Stardust We Are in my cd player, I was captivated by the complex time signatures, the layers of sound, and the outstanding musicianship of the band members. Despite the seemingly large amount of material on this 2 disc set, there's plenty to enjoy and very little to overlook on this album. Standout tracks include \\"Just This Once,\\" with it's pounding intro, the melodic \\"Church of Your Heart,\\" and the title track, a grand epic and my personal favorite. But why pick favorites? From the first notes of \\"In the Eyes of the World,\\" the music will grab you and run, and - I promise - you'll live the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promising","review":"This is my first Flower Kings album... as a classical prog-head exploring the state of the art today, I can say that I'm pretty impressed with them. Nice production, nice musicianship without noodling, an unusual (but talented) vocalist, lovely vocal harmonies, some very catchy songs.I hesitate to compare them to anyone, but if I had to, maybe 90125-era Yes with Steve Howe as guitarist?I'm giving the album 4 stars because there's room for it (and the band) to grow on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply stated \\"masterpiece\\"","review":"Look folks its quite simple. Flower kings are the best working prog band on the entire face of the earth. They deserve to be known worldwide. I dropped out of the whole prog scene in the mid nineties and just through pure chance I came upon this band and it changed everything. They are the absolute perfect balance of musicianship and melody. The vocals are magnificent and Roine's guitar playing is i think unmatched. He is the best prog guitarist EVER!

It's a neat history describing Porsche's racing heritage.But it offers so little advice on driving, the book feels like a waste for someone who wants to learn performance driving.It's not a driving manual: there's little theory, and sometimes the anectdotes lead nowhere: they don't provide a lesson!And it's not a Porsche manual, in that the author offers very little advice on setting up the kinds of Porsches that entry-level drivers race today.I think you're better off with Bob Bondurant's book, or one of the similar titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"This book is simply not worth the money. I fully agree with the reviewers who said this book is good for stories ... but useless for teaching you how to drive fast. The practical tips are very few and far between. To be honest, most enthusiasts can give you more useful pointers over a pint of beer than you can get reading this book.If you want to drive fast: practice in your own car (safely) and get yourself some hands-on teaching. If you want to sit yourself on a couch and hypnotize yourself into thinking you can drive faster, read this book.The reason I give 2 stars instead of one is because the stories ARE pretty entertaining.

The first 3 seasons were definitely some of the best. With season 4 I feel the show was getting ready to hit it's real stride. For one thing, you can't compare the first 3 season to the last 7 because the first 3 seasons were more on the wacky side like the movie. The next seven just went on to define and explore the characters more. It also let us know that war had all kinds of people in it. The change of characters allowed for a change of format. If all stayed the same there would have been no way that it would have lasted 10 years. The changes allowed for fresh and more realistic story lines. All it did was give the writers an opportunity to do what the show was meant to do, and that was to show what war was like and to have a lot of fun doing it. It stayed very funny throughout but then invented the first true dramedy. Can't wait to see the next DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great season of MASH","review":"Season 4 of MASH is great!

From then on, I was hooked.Don't get me wrong, though. I liked the first three seasons of MASH, but it was the characters of BJ and Col. Potter that helped win me over along with Radar, Hawkeye, and Klinger.

So anyway starting with the 4th season I found that after each episode I felt more often depressed, than I did really good.But I guess that's the price we must pay, to be enlighted by the socialist elite, about moral and ethical quandaries,and lest we forget, the manifold horrors of war.Need I say it once more?

When the time is up, you simply pull the plug and drain the extract through a filter into the decanter which comes with the system.

We use organic coffee beans, and leave it in the maker for 24 hrs,which makes it higher in caffeine and richer, but not bitter in any way.It comes out just right if the beans are ground coarse,but not the coarsest. (I highly recommend the commercial grinder at your health food store or local coffee house that sells fresh beans.Do NOT use robusto coffee beans, you will not like it, use the Arabica.Starbucks uses a good deal of robusto, and for our taste, it is just too bitter)Follow the directions,you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toddy","review":"It's very convenient to brew coffee with Toddy.

If you think you're interested, use a make shift set up to make and taste the coffee (there are many web sites that tell you how) before you buy the CT. Maybe I like the acid and bitterness because this yielded a poor tasting brew - just like instant (no kidding). I tried two different coffees (both high end) with no better results for my palate. Using 12 ounces of Eight O'Clock coffee in the correct grind, we got 5 1/4 cups of syrup. Using the ratio of 1/3 syrup and 2/3 water this is about 15 cups (9 ounces, not a mug) of coffee. The coffee was $6.99 for 12 ounces. If it was outstanding I wouldn't hesitate . . . BUT.We just bought our second Nespresso espresso machine and it is glorious. It is $.55 a cup and (you must buy their capsules) worth every penny not to mention 5 star company service. Not surprising I am drinking much less coffee.

I was expecting a smooth yet bold cup of coffee. What I got was the most bland boring coffee on earth. No matter how many ways you manipulate the quantities(sometimes I used a load of beans) it always turns out disappointing. Proponents of this method say they hate the taste of burnt beans. The best solution is to makes sure you don't buy burnt beans then. A decent brand of columbian or comparable arabica in a french press blows this method away every time.

I admit it.I love great coffee, no matter the form. I've been known to roast my own, and will drive long distances to visit the shops that I like. I'll also go to great lengths to brew my own cup just right. Of course, I'm also eager to try something new.That said, this was a colossal waste of time and money. It brews weak coffee for the amount of coffee it consumes, and it doesn't even taste as good as properly prepared drip or espresso. Two pots in and I want both my money and my beans back. I'm averaging 2 cups of coffee out of 12 ounces of beans, and even then it's not very tasty nor very caffeinated.If you want great coffee, get a steel mocha pot and make some stovetop espresso. Or, get a really good drip and use a steel or gold filter. Either way, buy whole beans roasted no more than a week prior and grind just before you make coffee.There are ways to make amazing cups of coffee. This isn't one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as promised but is that a good thing?","review":"The toddy works as stated and yes it does brew a mild less acidic coffee. However it was too mild for my taste, the coffee had flavor, but I found I missed the acidity.

However, I make cold brew coffee every week and I can tell you that there's no need for a special product.All you need is a jar, a paper coffee filter, and something like a funnel, strainer, or small colander to support the filter. Mix 1/2 pound of ground coffee in 2 cups of water and store in the jar for 12 hours, then pour the slurry through the coffee filter into another jar and you have your cold-brew coffee! Everything goes into the dishwasher, and the filter gets thrown away, so there isn't really a mess to clean up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unnecessary","review":"To cold brew coffee just put a cup of ground coffee in a jar and put in the fridge. In 30 hours or so all the grounds will be at the bottom of the jar. Just pour off what you need to make a cup and store the rest back in the fridge, grounds and all. It is good for a week.

After having Toddy exclusively for the last couple of months, I brewed a pot of regular coffee the other day and it tasted terrible to me. Here's the only problem--I ALWAYS brew less coffee than it says to (the directions say to brew a pound of coffee with 9 cups of water, and I always brew 12 oz of coffee with 6 3/4 cups of water). When I do the whole pound of coffee, the container is practically overflowing and the filter keeps getting blocked when I try to drain it. When I do 12 oz of coffee, it works perfectly. So, even though getting used to the brewing process is a little tricky, the coffee it makes is awesome--SO smooth tasting--and it makes great iced mochas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers as expected","review":"Other reviewers have described the system and how to make the perfect toddy. The quality is acceptable in this combination of plastic and thin glass. Price is commensurate. It makes the product as expected. A bit work intensive, more coffee grinds used than hot drip process.

While it is not the most attractive looking tool in my kitchen - it works perfectly. I have bought coffee makers that have cost 10 times the money and don't make half the cup of coffee.

While searching on the net for low acid coffee, found out about the Toddy system. Decided to try it out as the price was very reasonable. Wow! Smoothest coffee ever, and that is using regular Eight O'Clock brand coffee. I could not believe the flavor, smell and, again, the smoothness.I am using less creamer because the flavor of the coffee is so good. I have to admit I was skeptical of \\"just letting coffee grounds sit in water for 12 hours\\" actually making coffee but it does.One thing. The concentrate it makes is very strong. The instructions say to use 1/4 coffee to 3/4 water and believe me that is still a hearty cup of coffee.I highly recommend this for coffee lovers suffering from acid stomach problems and anyone that loves rich flavorful coffee. I'm a convert to cold brewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee!","review":"The Toddy makes excellent iced coffee. The only drawback is that it takes a pound of coffee to make 6 cups of concentrate, which if you like strong coffee like we do, will only make about seven to eight 16 ounce cups of iced coffees.

It's a little flimsy feeling, but the results are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Bad","review":"I bought a toddy maker in hopes of saving money on fancy beverages, and reducing the acid that tears up my stomach. Here are some random thoughts and suggestions:1. Although 9 cups of water are used, I only get 4+ cups of finished product. I adjusted to coarseness of the grind in hopes of getting more. Didn't work. However, if the grind is too fine the whole contraption gets constipated!2. I let it sit longer than the required 12 hours. I figured that having a fairly coarse grind might balance things out. Didn't seem to cause any harm.3. Keeps longer than what the booklet says...unless you consume it in record amounts like my family.4. Grind the coffee and use it right away. Also, try different beans. I didn't care for French roast.5. My blueberry bushes were very happy to get the leftover grounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold brewed coffee lacks a lot of complex flavors","review":"The system itself has good intentions and isn't overly cheap, but it is certainly not going to make the complex cup of coffee that a french press or Chemex will.I have never had a problem with the acidity of coffee, and when I tried cold-brewed, it was the bland taste that lacked all the complex flavor notes that drove me away. Maybe for iced coffee - maybe - but not for the add-hot-water-to-concentrate crowd that has cropped up. You are short-changing the complex flavors that only hot water can extract."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes!","review":"The low acidity of cold-brewed coffee reveals a wealth of other flavors that were previously overwhelmed by acid harshness. Cheap beans will be less harsh than before,(they will still be less than ideal), while good beans can almost taste like chocolate, and even the strongest coffee is so mellow that those who are used to using cream and sugar may no longer need to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This thing is made of very poor quality glass and plastic and is a messy way to cold brew coffee.

So I bought it and attempted several of the methods offered here and the in the manual - using different mixing methods, amount of grounds and time before filtering, in attempting to produce excellent coffee. It never lived up to the hype. Not once did I manage anything close to the quality of coffee that I had hoped. The coffee was generally weak and tasted a bit off. I admit that I like my coffee strong but even the attempt in which I used two cups of Sumatra grounds and left it sitting for 20 hours was weak. Which brings up my last criticism, the Toddy system uses a lot more grounds than I use with my french press. Expensive weak tasting coffee is not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"toddy cold pressed coffee maker","review":"It works great, but I think it is a little expensive for just flimsy plastic and glass"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a waste of money; just buy a french press","review":"I love iced coffee but this is an over-priced piece of garbage. This \\"system\\" probably costs Toddy 89 cents to manufacture in Vietnam. The glass is not tolerant of hot or cold & they could not even make the effort to attach the handle to the plastic container. This will make your kitchen look like you are still living in the Peace Corps with the shoddy design & materials. The french press that I already had was more functional and looks and feels way better. I wish that I would not have tried out this \\"system\\".Also, Toddy clearly designed this with the idea of printing more money by selling more overpriced & unnecessary stoppers and filters. The stopper is annoying & makes it difficult to empty the container without getting coffee all over the place.Please save yourself the disappointment & just buy a french press and another glass jar to keep your coffee in-you will be way happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Iced Coffee, but used a ton of coffee to produce","review":"I bought this product after reading an article about the Toddy was the best way to produce iced coffee. I placed a 12 oz. bag of $10 coffee in the hopper, and added the recommended amount of water. I had to wait 24 hours for it to fully drip through. Then I added the concentrated coffee to water per the directions.

Based on Googling the question, hot brewed coffee yields approximately 40 cups per pound. Thus, it is exactly twice as expensive to use the toddy as to make hot coffee and cool it. To me that's too much of a premium.Also, the time/energy required brewing Toddy coffee versus traditional coffee is at least 2 to 1. Here again, it's just not worth it.Finally, the cleanup is a pain.While I appreciate the product I'm returning mine"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...delicious coffee","review":"Generally I find coffee to be extremely disappointing...even the fancy gourmet shops like Blue Bottle or Stumptown here on the west coast. This is because while it smells delicious, it tastes bitter, so unless I mix milk and sugar in, I don't want to drink it. I read a few articles on this and a friend recommended it, so I bought one, figuring I'd use it for iced drinks in the summer only worst case. Just brewed up my first batch overnight.

I use a 12-oz can of coffee to 7 cups of water, and have had no trouble with overflowing grounds or not draining well. I even made it without the filter by accident, and that's how I do it all the time now--the flavor seems a little more complex this way (after the coffee drips into the jug, I pour it thru a gold coffee filter--you could use a sieve-into another container to eliminate the grounds, then back into the Toddy jug for refrigerator storage)I tried a few different coffees, and now I use a dark roast (Sumatra from Trader Joe's is cheap and tasty).

First, even though it states that it is 16\\"x20\\", the visible \\"window\\" is actually 1/4\\" bigger in both directions, which means if you have a 16\\" x 20\\" picture/poster, there is a 1/4\\" of VISIBLE cardboard backing in each direction. Second, there is only one nail/screw hole in each direction, which means if your picture is landscape, you have a 20\\"-wide picture hanging only by the center point (tilts too easily). There should be one in each corner. Finally, it arrived with a very small hairline crack in the glass.

I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Item Well Worth Purchasing","review":"I had looked for a monopod and saw the Sima but didn't care for the white color, and the reviews were a turnoff. I felt perhaps if I spent more money, I'd find a better one. Well, I did find a better one, and at $12.95, it was under a dollar more than the Sima, WITH THE SHIPPING INCLUDED! Additionally, it was matte black and had great reviews.I just got it and am delighted. It is relatively sturdy, nice quality, not cheesy or junky. Even the case is nice. It is not flimsy rayon that frays, but ballistic nylon. This is a great item for someone trying to get started in photography and get some essentials together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, It Worked Great for 5 Months...","review":"I bought this to use with my Canon Rebel XTi. I immediately loved it since it added just a little bit more stability to my photos, which increased their quality, especially for macro and long distance shots. Then five months after I started using it, the metal screw that attaches to the camera broke off with my camera attached while I was walking with the camera and monopod supported on my shoulder. I luckily had the camera strap in my fingers, so I caught my camera before it hit the ground. Now this monopod is going into the trash. I'm definitely going to replace it soon though since my overall experience was positive and I found it to be a very useful tool. I just would like a longer-lasting product. Maybe it's a good idea to invest a little more money for one that is more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after some light use","review":"This is a cheap piece of equipment and should be trusted only as that.Used it for more than a year but only a 3 or 4 occasions. I'm happy I was only putting the camera in when it broke. As some have reviewed the screw at the top is glue to the base. What is surprising is that the glue didn't give up but the screw itself broke. Bought an Fotopro Carbon Fiber one now and the difference is clear.

No problems as I did not like it (The case) anyway. My wife can sew and made a nicer more functional one with a handy pocket on it for for me. The Monopod itself is good, slightly better than my expectations. Easy and quick to use. The unit is Constructed good, but I can see the base getting worn out in a couple of years if I use it heavily. That being said for less than 20 bucks this was a great deal. would have given 5 stars if not for the broken zipper on the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice fore the price","review":"This device is well made and a good value for the price.

I had to wade a stream and climb a mountain and didn't want to carry a tripod. When I hiked up the mountain I used the monopod as a walking stick. It worked great, both as a walking stick and to study my camera with a 500mm lens. I highly recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Camera accessory","review":"This was the best item I ever bought for my camera. I do a lot of walking with my camera, and thought I would use it as a walking stick, which I do, but the best part of this monopod is what I never thought would happen. My pictures are NEVER fuzzy! I can take low light photos and have they come out clear. I paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera. The three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths. The carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched."},{"rating":"2","title":"a sturdy companion","review":"A steady hand relieves the necessity of one of these creatures, but who is it that couldn't use a little help sometimes?

I am a heavy user, and I am sure the levers wouldn't last a month. I ended up returning the monopod. As it is, the monopod is good enough for occasional use by the amateur photographer with a light camera. However, if the manufacturer improves the build quality of the lock levers, this could be a great monopod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its OK","review":"The bag is useless. After about 2 months the clamps are wearing out, and one broke. Not it will not hold the camera without sinking. The lanyard is also useless, it broke also. Now all I have is a useless monopod that will not hold my camera, with a useless bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same As The OSN 450","review":"I have the same monopod in the OSN brand (OSN 450) and it has proven itself durable and affordable. I am 6ft tall and this monopod extends just above a useful height for me. So I guess I should give it a 2-star rating and suggest a monopod that costs 2 to 3x as much but really isn't as tall as the one I'm reviewing and it too won't support my 40 pound full size VHS camcorder that I bought back in the 80's, which is way better than any of these tiny little 2 pound HD cameras on the market today. Sorry, I had to throw that bit of sarcasm in there....The only thing that I see that could be improved is the top plate that also holds the hand strap. It is made of plastic and I can see the part that holds the strap possibly breaking after a while since I found myself applying considerable weight on it during use.The OSN 450 is sold by Wally World for $15, so you can go check it out in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Product","review":"For the money it's a great monopod. It's strong, lightweight, and extends as tall as a 6 footer will ever need. It also works pretty well as a treking pole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mono Pod Great","review":"Sure, this isn't a pro mono pod and it doesn't have a mobile head but for the money it's great. Easily holds my Olympus E1 with 50-200mm lens. Great as a walking stick as well. Stores tight and light.Highly recommend this product. I may just get a back up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opteka MP100 -- EXCELLENT Product - EXCELLENT Price","review":"See the Title -- it says it all.HOWEVER, next time I'd get one with (or separately buy) a small ball-head for added functionality.Just my thoughts - your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost ruined my 300mm f2.8","review":"This monopod worked well. It was a cheap buy and I was happy, because I thought all monopods do the same thing. Until I put it on my Canon EF 300mm f2.8. I couldn't get it off! I had to saw through this cheap monopod to get to the threads and wrench it out. If you're looking for a light stick to walk with or to beat someone over the head with, this would be a good buy. But if you want to be able to get this out of your 5000 dollar lens without cutting it in half, forget it. Don't make the same mistake I did, go buy a better monopod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!","review":"I know you are thinking about it...don't do it. Check the video review posted. Unless you want your camera stuck (I mean cut-the-monopod-off-with-a-hacksaw-stuck)at the worst possible time, spend the extra 20-30 dollars and get a monopod that will last you the rest of your life.

I was surprised at how well built it was and how stable it was considering its price. It holds our D-SLR and 70-300mm lens just fine, and the foam grip makes holding at in the cold (especially at hockey rinks) very comfortable. The quick latches for adjusting hight work quite well and are secure. We've retired the old monopod and have switched to this full time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! All but one thing...","review":"Wow! For the price, you get one hell of a deal.I have not used it a whole lot (as I only received it earlier today) but I will be this upcoming weekend during a family trip to San Diego. This should work A LOT better than a tripod in \\"touristy\\" areas like the San Diego Zoo and Sea World. We'll see. Hopefully it lives up to the hype that these reviews are leading it to be.However, there is one thing that came as a disappointment. The carrying case. It wasn't the actual case that was the problem, it was the zipper. I tried for a half hour to get it down... IT WOULD NOT BUDGE! I'm sure mine was just a faulty zipper that broke somewhere alone the line. I had to cut the monopod out - destroying the case. But honestly, I don't think I'd use the case anyways... I can just carry it around like the man I was born to be :)It also make for a nice baton in case you need to straighten anybody up.If I could, I'd give this product a 9/10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed and bad customer service.","review":"Length:: 2:29 MinsA quick, 2:30 video review of the Opteka MP100 67\\" monopod highlighting it's good qualities and the really bad problems I had with getting it off of the camera as well as my poor experience with Opteka's customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight Use Only","review":"Okay, for the price, what can one expect? I found that with even a modest load that the top plate had a significant amount of play. I would not use this for any camera/lens combo that was more than two or three pounds.As for the previous reviewer who suggested one never needs more than 67\\" of monopod, I beg to differ. It is fair to say that this is a tall monopod, which is why I took a chance on it. But whether it is tall enough depends on how tall you are (I'm 6'5\\") and what kind of surface you're standing on. If the surface slopes away from you (on a hill) or you have to use a step below you for resting the foot of the monopod, 67\\" may not be enough.For a few dollars more, check out the Bogen/Manfrotto line of aluminum monopods. They are not as small or light (and sometimes not as tall), but they are tough and reliable. If you want a monopod for your point and shoot or an SLR with a modest lens (forget that 80-200 f/2.8), then this one might work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not very compact but this is awesome","review":"This is sturdy and folds fairly short.

The term \\"jazz\\" refers to the placement of false or hoax information on the net, which among the elite is considered to be an artform. Keyz, a 16 year old hoping to become a jazz \\"player\\", hacks something he shouldn't and ends up on the run. Lucky for him, he's helped by Tin Lizzy, an experienced player who knows the streets, both cyber and real.My only minor quibbles are that Keyz is underdevloped as a character, and the ending is a little too quick to be satisfying. Tin Lizzy is well-rendered, however, and the descriptions of surfing the net are truly interesting. It's not hard to believe that the future Scott describes may be the way we're headed. For another, different version of the future Internet, I also recommend Shariann Lewitt's \\"Interface Masque\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to its own jazz","review":"The Jazz has lots of well-constructed future paradims, but somehow Scott has not given them enough of a venue to stand on their own. Yes, the web surfing scenes and technology are very cool and well-written, and there is much detail, but the story reasons for the net escapades are so thin that to keep on reading I had to give up on expecting anything from the story. About 50 pages are devoted to Lizzie's plunge into the seamy District, but for what? She needed to use a phone? The book played like a series of vignettes strung together by the tinnest of plots. If you're looking for both a full-imagined future-tech landscape and well-developed characters and story, read William Gibson or Pat Cadigan (if you can find any of hers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa Scott creates another good one!","review":"Once again we have a well conceived universe, with a thrilling story that is written densely.

I baked a few loaves of bread on it at about 450 degrees, probably four or five. Then I baked a couple of pizzas on it (in one session) at 550 and when I went to move it in the oven it was in two pieces, cracked down the middle. Useless. Buy a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the second time through","review":"The first time I used this; I loved it. The pizzas turned out great and everyone in my family had their own individualized pizza made just to their liking. I was preheating it the second time through and when I went to take out the first pizza; it was cracked in half. Maybe I just got a bad stone; but I was really disappointed with the longevity of this item. I will definitely order another stone; because I love the flavor of the pizza after being cooked this way; but I will order it from a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2nd use","review":"I initially really liked this pizza stone. It was my first stone and it helped me make a few delicious pizzas. Unfortunately after the second use it broke in 2 pieces while in the oven at 500 degrees.

My wife made 4 pizzas for dinner and the first couple came out of the oven just great. While the last pizza was being removed from the oven the peel broke causing the pizza to fall on the floor. I don't know what kind of wood it was made out of but I can tell you that it was a piece of crap! I am going to try to glue it back together but my wife doesn't want to use it again and I can't blame her.The stone works great but I am already looking for a bigger stone and another peal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pizza peel not the same size as the Pizza Stone!?","review":"Bought this as a gift for someone and was highly disappointed when it arrived! The pizza peel is WAY too small! Why would you package pizza stone with a peel half the size? Also, the pizza cutter was flimsy and small. Not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It lacks durability.","review":"This pizza stone was a permanant fixture in our oven for about 2 weeks. It turned out some great bread, but it couldn't stand up to a lot and a cast iron pan set on top of it cracked it. On the other hand, it does have a 5 year warranty. And don't expect a perfect baking peel; if you make a lot of bread, you will soon need a replacement. It's thick and kind of sticky, and mine had a respectable crack in it straight out of the box. I'm afraid I can't exactly say how it fares with pizza (I know, I know) but it's not effective at all for bread. However, if you're just buying it to make pizza, for all I know, it may work perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Expensive Pizza I've Ever Eaten","review":"Broke into 3 pieces when I lifted it out of the oven, 2 hours after the first use.The \\"manual\\" that comes with it suggests that corn meal be scattered over the stone before the oven heats.Result: better turn off the smoke detector!In an economy resembling the days when Bialetti was founded, would this be Mussolini's revenge?And why doesn't Amazon allow 0 star reviews?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!","review":"This cracked on my second use- completely down the middle and I did not even have the temperature that high. They will NOT let you return it unless it cracks within 30 days (so hopefully you make a lot of pizza the first month to see if it will last). Unfortunately, the second time I made it was after a month and CRACK down the middle- no returns- so I'm stuck with a broken pizza stone. Definitely go for a higher quality item and a company that will stand behind their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived cracked in half, imagine that","review":"I really wish I would have read the reviews before ordering this product.

I had originally gotten this from a discount store but it was missing everything but the pizza stone. To say they were disappointed was an understatement. So I found this on Amazon and it was great.

He doesn't disappoint on this follow-up, although he does come a bit closer to overplaying his hand lyrically; the balancing act is made more precarious by his embrace of Glen Campbell-derived folk-countrypolitan stylings, as opposed to the bottle-busting, galloping honkytonk of the last album. By slowing the music down, he gives the listener more time to weigh the relative merits of sincerity vs. wit in lyrics like \\"I'm Not Drunk Enough To Say I Love You\\" and \\"The One And Lonely You\\"... Plus, these Misery Boys take their picking and plunking very seriously, and just the sound of that fine pedal steel alone is worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong battery","review":"The battery I ordered was a 1700mah battery.

Because of the multiple layers of guitar, listeners can always expect something new.

Ballet is one of the most difficult art forms to execute to its highest standard and here in this performance everything seems to gell together.There is grace and beauty, sensitive filming and beautiful dancing. The characters are all very believable in their parts and perform superble.I have many other versions of this ballet including a wonderful performance with Nureyev but this equals itin many ways and to a certain extent surpasses it by adding a slant to its production that makes it unique and very beautiful.I have no hesitation in recommending this even if it is the first and only version you purchase"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little toolkit!","review":"This is a great little toolkit for working on laptops, phones, tablets, and other very small electronics.

I am very glad I had, this is probably the most convenient set I've purchased to this day. In the 4 years I've had them, I've only misplaced 1 bit and chipped a small flathead bit from trying to remove a seized micro screw (completely my fault, wrong tool for the job). The flathead bit still hasn't given up though, I'm still able to use it daily as only a small piece is missing. All of my other bits are in terrific condition with only a slight amount of wear, no stripping or dulling on any of them.I've taken apart countless things with this set including hard drives, stereos, car interiors, optical drives, network equipment, keyboards and mice, tons more. This is a perfect set for most jobs I run into."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you need","review":"This precision kit it's all I was looking for, I had to replace the digitizer on my Blackberry storm, needed to repair my Macbook pro and pop open my old JVC camcorder and I was able to do all this with the help of these screwdrivers.

I needed the size 0 screw bit so I got this set.It worked alright for that initial hard drive swap, but the problem is the bits are too long so they don't get a good snug fit into the screw. What ends up happening is the bits end up getting stripped or your screws get stripped.I was also using the small standard bit and the tip twisted about 30 degrees when I was unscrewing something making it completely unusable.I went to use this set last night to take apart a small digital camera in an effort to clean the sensor. I ended up stripping 2 screws and twisting one of the bits in the process.Very cheaply made.

I like that they come with about every bit that a computer manufacturer would use and they all fit nicely back into the small kit.Like I said, I've used the same kit for three years so that attests to its durability.

My use of this set is minimal and general. I've used several different heads and without the slightest problem.For people that actually use precision screwdrivers everyday, I'd recommend one with a steel handle for durability.

The bits are well-suited for the task this type of tool is designed for yet the device is both sturdy and a bit larger than your typical precision screwdriver. This makes the already tedious job of working with small screws a bit less cumbersome as you have more tool to hold on to without sacrificing the ability to manipulate even the tiniest screws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough stuff","review":"Way better quality than I expected, works great for changing clips on my knives and some gun work. Definitely would buy again for family."},{"rating":"2","title":"very convenient","review":"There is a huge variety of bits and they are all magnetical. The case is very durable along with the screwdriver that comes with it. The problem is that the bit tips are very weak and bend REALLY easy. I understand that you should be gentle while using small bits like this, but these tips just hardly have the strength to take out commercial screws and they bend way to easily. They should have coated the tips in something stronger. I probably wouldn't recommend these to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little weak","review":"This set is designed well enough, with the exception of the material used for the bits. The phillips bits are OK, but the straight blade screwdriver bits go helical if you try to put any torque on them. The precision screwdrivers I have used from General have (in general) been much stronger. If you need these for more than casual use, my recommendation is to bite the bullet and pay for a better set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great for iPhone 4 repair.","review":"I have broken my iPhone glass twice.

Very irritating...This past year we used 3 tea light candles for each pot in place of the sterno/gel fuel(we have two pots, one for cheese and chocolate)and it worked beautifully! The consistentcy of the cheese and chocolate was perfect the entire time and I only had to relight them once. I used to have to do it 5-7 times. Tea light candles are sooo much cheaper and we had them lit for 3 hours and they still hadn't burned out. Let me clarify: you have to melt the cheese and chocolate on the stove first and then transfer to fondue pot to keep warm/melted.

(He looks great...but imagine Keith Partridge pretending to \\"stage act\\"...badly).Suprisingly, former teen heartthrob Leif Garrett's performance is the most engaging of the film.

There is nothing here with quite the edge of \\"St Teresa\\" or \\"Crazy Baby\\", but she comes close with \\"Safety in numbers\\", and \\"my love is alive\\". She shows a great diversity in this album. Some selections are sultry and edgy, while some border on Pop/country. If you are a Joan Osborne fan like I am, you must have this CD.

The production is sloppy, her remake of the Dylan song \\"Make You Feel My Love\\" is absolutely laughable.Osborne tries to come off on this CD as a bluesy, rockeresque with a serious side.Actually she comes off as a lady with a nose ring, who has toned down her perm, and is desperately trying to find herself someplace to fit in the music market.\\"Righteous Love\\" is not that fit. Osborne try again, and this time don't wait 5 years, because people will forget about you.The only artist that is allowed to come out with an album every 5+ years is Sade, because we KNOW that when she comes out with an album it will be a piece of art.An absolute and utter flop.

This cd lacks the complexity of Relish. With the exception of the last two tracks, it's hard to tell the songs apart. Granted, anything that she does is amazing, the one true difference between Relish and any other album that has come out is the variety of all of the tracks. She has the ability to spark every emotion, and this album is like a strong dose of ridilin in comparison to her other albums. I am very sad. I hope this isn't going to be the first in a long string of \\"filler\\" albums. I would hate to see the most talented woman since Bonnie Raitt become diluted with popish songs. I wish this could have been a good review."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Big Shock since Sting !!","review":"First time I listened Sting's \\"Nothing Like the Sun\\", I was shocked. His music really reached my (our) heart(s). This Joan Osborne album has really shocked me like Sting's. Although I've not tried her previous \\"Relish\\", I know this lady didn't spend her blank in vain, rather those time matured her talent, I hope. But actually I really think it's silly of Record Company that this wonderful talent has been freezed for years. I went through \\"Poison Apple\\", \\"To Make You Feel My Love\\" and Title Track for thousand times. (I really listened these three pieces in Shinkansen (Rapid Express) from Kobe to Tokyo. I'm sick, too. Her voice, lyric, too good.) But as for me, I don't like Raga (India Music) influenced \\"If I was your man\\"(, though opening track is good). Anyway this disc is well worth buying even only for those 3 tracks. (By the way, I came to know her in Chieftain's album \\"Tears of Stone\\".)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This album is a perfect example of an artist with no professional direction. In other words, the artist is in charge of his/her own destiny and thinks what they put out is a good product. I like Joan a lot, but this album does not do her or her talent justice. Get a new management team..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Righteous","review":"Usually when a new album comes out from a favorite artist, you're excited. Finally five years after \\"Relish\\" out comes \\"Righteous Love\\" It surprised me initially how low key this release was. Why didn't they play anything from it on the radio, after how well \\"One of us\\" did on the charts. I quickly realized why after popping \\"Rightous Love\\" into my stereo. The first few tracks are okay, with a different sound from her previous album. Unfortunately the album goes down from there. The edgy, bluesy sound I liked so much on \\"Relish\\" and her \\"Early Recordings\\" is gone, whether filtered out or just a change in her singing, I don't know, but the result is disappointing and so so singing at best. She butchers through Dylan's love ballad \\"To Make you Feel My Love\\", which is probably the most unforgiveable part of this album. Its a shame but \\"Righteous Love\\" suffers the second album curse, DOA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Wait","review":"Righteous Love rocks! More mature, stylistically unified and very different from Relish, there are several potential BIG HITS here. Standouts so far: \\"Running Out Of Time\\", \\"Safety In Numbers\\", \\"Love Is Alive\\", \\"Baby Love\\" and \\"If I Was Your Man\\". Eastern, Country and Classic Rock elements (among other influences) weave their way throughout this CD. I ran out first thing this morning (12 Sept--first day of release) and paid top dollar for it and am not disappointed. If you like Joan, or just good solid Rock in general, you will enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant forgotten album","review":"This album got barely any press when it was released and did not yield any hit singles. But, five years later, it sounds amazing...\\"Righteous Love,\\" \\"Safety In Numbers,\\" \\"To Make You Feel My Love,\\" \\"Baby Love,\\" all the songs on this CD shine, and I can honestly say it's one of the best CDs of the '00s. Trully timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"joan's beautiful voice is too frequently buried in the arrangements, and the songwriting is disappointing. dylan's ability to write beautiful lyrics as evidenced on the final track of the cd reveals how pedestrian the previous songs' lyrics are. somehow i kept thinking joan was trying too hard to be the rebirth of janis joplin and not giving us the original artist she can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album that's easy to love.","review":"Joan Osborne possesses a strong, luxurious, soulful voice...and we've never heard it express as efectively as it does on this CD. Joan soars on her version of Gary Wright's \\"Love Is Alive,\\" and in many ways, her version surpasses the original. (Sorry, Gary). The in-your-face title song shamelessly (and loudly) sings the praises of unconditional love, which is refreshingly strong, partly because it is coming from a powerful rock singer like Joan, and not from a run-of-the-mill Celien Dion wannabe. The CD is edgy and loud most of the way through, and it slows down at the very end to give us a few gorgeous ballads, most notably Joan's exquisite reading of Bob Dylan's \\"Make You Feel My Love.\\" Through and through, this is an extraordinary CD...no gimmicks...just great music from a stellar vocalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"good golly, this album rocks!","review":"Joan Osborne is my queen. Righteous Love is a rocking delight that fills me with energy. I don't understand why Joan isn't more worshipped; her voice and singing are awesome. She does a retro-funked-up version of \\"Love Is Alive\\" that is so sexy. She does an Indian-influenced \\"If I Was Your Man\\" that displays a flawless and versatile range. She does all out blues rock on \\"Hurricane\\" that can be matched by few others. Glad I found this CD - it's full of great beats & cool lyrics. If you're a fan of rocking alterna-chicks, give Joan a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong and Vulnerable CD","review":"I love this CD! It captures the whole spectrum of thoughts and feelings involved in relationships with other people (romantic and otherwise) and is entirely fun to listen to. One minute she'll be singing \\"I've never been so sure of love\\" and then a few songs later she'll sing \\"I recall the moment when you ruined me for other men.\\" Lyrically, it runs the gamut.Musically, this song is very polished--which to me was actually a bit of a disappointment. Relish was much more raw and different from other stuff that was out there. But with Righteous Love, although it is a really really great CD, sounds very professional; and to me, that is where it loses some of its appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is worth every penny","review":"Fans of Joan Osborne have waited a long five years for this release, and Righteous Love proves to be every bit worth the wait.In a word, this album is FABULOUS, but don't expect a repeat of 1995's Relish. Although some of the arrangements remain true to Osborne's previous release, these tracks venture into new territory, including funky grooves and retro keyboards. It all comes together beautifully though, in a collection of soulful, hard rocking tunes that are sure to stand the test of time.The only weakness worth mentioning is a cover of Gary Wright's 1975 hit \\"Love Is Alive,\\" a poor choice that would have been better replaced with Osborne's far superior original material. Some may enjoy the nostalgia of this number, but it didn't work for me. However, this is only a minor blemish on an otherwise flawless canvas.The sweetest thing about this album is that it improves with every listening. Buy it today, play it loud, and enjoy for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth the wait!","review":"Joan is a great talent in an industry overrun with mediocre artists. Her voice and the evident emotion behind her voice in her songs is amazing. This album is not quite as bluesy as some of her earlier work, but nonetheless, it's fantastic! Highlights include Baby Love, Righteous Love and Hurricane.

After looking for a long time for a CD version of the wonderful EMI stereo Karajan Tchaikovsky ballet suites, I found this CD release claiming to be the real 1959 stereo recordings. But, as Mr. Ashby points out, this release is not the real thing, but the already issued older mono recordings. While I do think a great many of Karajan's best recordings were his earlier mono EMI productions (such as the Cosi fan Tutte), in this case, I think the stereo ballet recordings are far superior to the earlier versions.I wrote to EMI about the problem, but apparently they don't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight from the shoulder !","review":"Mr. Davidson's style is direct and uncomplicated, possibly the result of of submitting reports for many years. The only addition to his 'report' style since his retirement is the injection of welcome humor. From the perspective of one who was (briefly) in the same field of endeavor it is obvious that Mr. Davidson knows the subject, did what he said, and doesn't shrink from rowing against the tide by identifying judges with questionable motives, lawyers who should be sentenced with their clients, some informants who can be more honorable than our system of justice, and bureaucrats more concerned about being criticized than they are with getting the job done as well as their agents in the field.

It threatened to be funny a couple times but never quite got there. The best part actually was during the final credits, when they spoof that miracle new house TV show and build a new bar for the Del Fuegos. That was funny.No complaints on the technical side, the PQ and AQ are perfectly acceptable blu-ray quality, but who cares if the movie is this bad?I got this one free with my PS3 - and even that is paying too much. Seriously, not a good movie.

At least it had a plot, but we hardly even chuckled at any of the so-called humor, which was of the junior-high boy's locker room variety at best. That type of humor, combined with language and male nudity, should have given the movie an R rating, not a PG-13. Thankfully, we only wasted $4 renting it and not $12-18 at the movie theatre. Don't waste your time with this one.

There is a impressive collection of talent, but I was bored through the whole thing. Anything that could have been funny was in the trailers. The funniest part of the whole movie for me was the singer at the Madrid Chili Festival. All the jokes were hackneyed. This cast should have been SNL castoffs, not actors of the caliber of Travolta, Allen, Lawrence or Macy. It should have been beneath the supporting cast as well. This movie was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Roadtrip Flick!","review":"This is a fun movie about four everyday guys, known collectively as the \\"Wild Hogs\\", who decide to add a little adventure to their lives by taking a cross-country motorcycle road trip which turns out to be a little more adventure than they had originally considered when they cross paths with the notorious Del Fuegos gang.The production opens nicely and moves along with a steady rhythm that kept me interested throughout the film. Humorously engaging with plenty of fun gags and cool special effects and a fun story too! A good \\"buddies\\" film to sit down to, \\"Wild Hogs\\" delivers.I thought the cast did an excellent job.

It was difficult to put the wheels on, the bears on it don't really keep her occupied for more than 5 minutes and it doesn't roll very well (we have carpet inside) but I took her outside for more play time and it didn't roll well out their either. The wheels don't go side to side, only back and forth, so it takes a lot of effort for them to turn. It is also not very good for taller babies, from day one I've had it on the highest setting and even that seems almost too low for her (she's 27 inches tall).

The other thing, it was set on the tallest setting and it was still too short for her (she's tall and skinny). We ended up spending more money for the Kolcraft.

The holes in the front were to big to securely snap in and slide down and STAY down, the straps would come back out as she was moving up and down. It would have been 5stars if it was made better.

Vidal tackles Big Physics, but gets immediately lazy and is unable and/or unwilling to flesh out the math and the scientific concepts. So we're left with a hodge-podge of famous characters, past presidents mostly, who behave arbitrarily and a plot that turns arbitrarily. What's the point? I don't know - \\"life's a silly game\\" maybe? This could have been an excellent book to give to your teenage son (if for no other reason than that it shows a kid doing something other than staring dumbly at his computer) but the graphic sex is probably something most parents wouldn't feel comfortable passing on to their \\"impressionable\\" offspring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gore Vidal and Time Travel -- It Doesn't Work","review":"I'm a fan of Gore Vidal's -- he has great wit and an understanding of history that can make stories from the past come alive. What better way to make the past and the present come alive than through a time travel science fiction book right? WRONGUnfortunately I have this habit of finishing almost every book I start reading. I finished this one and it was painful. Right of the bat, I was a little put off by the cover. The Harlequin Romance style artwork can give you the idea that the book will contain torrid erotic passages in the midst of the stuffy museum. Instead you get very tepid action that includes a high school age boy. The story surrounding that is even worse and unlike Vidal's other work, very hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can paperback fiction get any worse?","review":"I bought this book on tape to pass the time on a road trip.

Also, it has none of the sharp corners find in Global that digs into your hand after long sections of slicing.The extra think blade also makes it more stable then all others.The deep blad allowed a gentler taper of the blade which makes it easier to make deep cuts and slices then the henkle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wusthof no classic","review":"When spending money on a good quality chef knife, quality is expected. Loose fitting handle that rattles for $200.00 is not quality. I returned it and got another one to have the second knife with a rattling loose rivot in the handle. I'll stick with the henkle pro-s and my MAC's. Save your time and energy with this knife. Looks good feels good but the handle blew the deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solar charge for my 12 volt battery","review":"The solar panel arrived in good condition and worked just fine as soon as I connected the wires. I set it up on a work bench to test it out and it has worked very well. The rested battery had 12.46 volts showing and began to rise right away. I have not been able to do a sunny day test because it has been overcast and raining everyday. If there is decent light out the solar panel can do it's thing and that is just what I want. I will have to wait to give a better sunny day report, but for now all is well. Sorry for the lack of sunny day detail. I plan to use the charger on my travel trailer to keep the battery up. I did try plugging in a power inverter to see if it would work with one attached to the battery while charging and it worked as well.Satisfied with the purchase.Would I recommend it: yesCon: the delivery time was a bit long I thought, compared to other purchases - but Amazon has spoiled me with other quick deliveries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch","review":"It's a quality watch with some nice features. Here are a few things I found out after I received it. The \\"regular\\" second hand only moves when using the stopwatch. The real second hand is the little one by the 9. The alarm setting/usage is a little more complex then I would like as I probably won't have the manual with me when I want to use it. It's a little larger diameter and thicker then I would have hoped for (but I don't have very large wrists)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating narrative","review":"This book is a memoir of Mr. Brady's year long experience as a lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps during Korean War. Like many Americans of my generation, I have limited knowledge of this conflict and \\"Coldest War\\" helped to shed some light on what went on and what the fighting was like. More importantly, the author talks about the people he met and the everyday experiences they had while living in Korea.Mr. Brady has an interesting combination of elitism for being a Marine Corp officer and humility. He admits to being a regular guy trying to survive extrodinary circumstances. Without trying to do so, Brady has written an interesting guide on leadership. I'd recommend this book to history buffs as well as anyone who manages a group of people. Both will learn something valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"story fair for professional writer","review":"while it is true that Mr. Brady was a Marine and in the Korean War, his writing 45+ years later leaves doubts about it. For example the word Marine is alwaysa used as as proper noun, yet in none of his books does he do this. Secondly, Marines don't wear FATIGUES, they wear UTILITIES. They wear trousers, not pants. Finally, the rank Gunnery Sgt. did not exist during Korea, that rank came out in around '59 or so. The gunny of Korea was a Tech Sdt. for a good book on Korea, read COLDER THAN HELL by Owens, or THE LAST PARRALEL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight into a forgotten war","review":"This book offers valuable insight into a war that almost all Americans have forgotten. It offers a firsthand account about what Korea was like for the men in the trenches. James Bradley does an excellent job putting into words what he experienced in Korea. The harsh bighting cold and the constant pressure not to lose any of the men under his command show the reader what the war was really like. My grandfather served in Korea and his memories are very much the same as Mr. Bradley's are. This book will give you a greater appreciation of Korean War veterans! A must read for anyone interested in military history."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Book reads like a novel and does not seem to capture the real experience of combat. There are events which may be historically acurate but does not seem to capture the true essence of the combat experience. Most of his memories seem to be romanticized rather than demonstrating the horror of war."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fair read, with problems...","review":"This book was just ok. What bothers me is that Brady gives intricate details of his life during the war, but that was almost 40 YEARS before the book was written. How could anyone remember the mundane details of life 40 years prior? It just strikes me as unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew?","review":"Who thought that the man who brings us the underwhelming In Step interviews every Sunday could write such a fascinating autobiography?Don't get me wrong, I enjoy his work for Parade -- it's a guilty pleasure! But his tale of life in Korea, during the forgotten war is an excellent read.The Coldest War doesn't bore you to death with military minutiae and ancronyms -- James Brady was a reservist, not a career Marine. The author doesn't get bogged down in terminology, so the book flows easily.The narrative is superb -- the reader (at least this one) feels as if he or she is in the trench shivering with Brady on his first ambush.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Personal Account","review":"Mr. Brady does an outstanding job of telling his personal experiences, feelings, and thoughts during his sevice in the Korean War as a junior infantry officer. His service period covered the \\"static\\" fighting that took place during the bulk of the war following entry of the Chinese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Writing about an Otherwise Mean Subject","review":"James Brady's memoir is perhaps the best written history of the Korean War from a solo combatant's perspective. True, this is a story from one voice, foresaking input from others and largely devoid of big-picture strategic discussions. The focus is almost entirely on Brady's year in-country. It is a verbal scrapbook of one soldier's experience, helped mightily in its presentation by Brady's gift with words. This is a ground-level view of the static, trench warfare that bogged the Korean conflict from late 1951 onward. The reader gets candid, personal recollections of a young marine lieutenant-- not just the gritty reality of combat, but of the miserable living conditions of living half underground in bitter cold. Read this veritable novel in one weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to Big Bill","review":"I found this to be a really effective and economical intro to the works of Big Bill Broonzy.

Would prefer they were not Teflon, but otherwise they are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Cooling Rack","review":"This is a great cooling rack for bakers or cooks. Its non-stick coating saves your baked goods from loosing their bottoms and clean up is a breeze (you don't spend lots of time scraping batter or grease out of the grid). The large size can accommodate breads or doughs or lots of cookies or muffins. The grid design also stops your baked goods from sagging through the bottom. I've also used it as a hot plate (but distribute the weight on the rack). It has a 15 year warranty on defects too. NOTE: it may be too big for some people's kitchens (measure your counter space first or be happy using it on the kitchen table). Overall, if you need a good cooling rack, definately spend your money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Made in USA instead made in CHINA","review":"Item not made in USA but instead made in China.

Their ideas are fantastic. Great add-on to the movie, with a stellar cast of WONDERFUL people, including Mr. Anderson, Michael Shanks, Chris Judge and Amanda Tapping.

Uncut and in its originally shot, 35mm aspect ratio. This is an excellent sci-fi series; probably about the best on TV. The pilot episode is actually better than the original theatrical movie that inspired it. The episodes on this disc set up the series nicely. If you're an SG-1 fan this disc is a must.

Besides, I have a friend in Japan who does not have cable TV, and haven't been able to watch the series on TV. I would love to buy another one for her, and introduce her to the world of STARGATE SG-1. I'm sure she would love it too! We the abroad fans love the series too. Make this VHS available again please.

Anyway, sheep-people (except those of you who think for yourselves and don't allow their lives and opinions be shaped by the mass media and these so-called \\"authority figures\\" of the western world), ya gotta love this season premiere. It's got it all. Alien cultures, advanced weaponry, oppressive snakes, dry-cool wit (mostly on the part of one of my favorite actors, Richard Dean Anderson, way better than emotionless Kurt Russell), astro-physics (Carter), treason (Teal\`c), a look into the Hollywood air force, and, of course, uncensored nudity. Mmm, yum."},{"rating":"2","title":"This video cost me!","review":"I missed it when it was first shown on Sky, and I couldn't wait for it to be repeated, so I rented it from the video store (at 2.99 a day) and kept it for a week, when I finally remembered to stop watching it and take it back before the shop closed.Two daays later I rented it out again.The acting is fun, though predictable at times (Sam Carter's response to Kawalksi's put downs, and you could always ell the Daniel was going to be assigned to SG-1), but the good moments, like Jack's face when Sam mentions McGuyver (Richard Dean Andersoon played McGuyver in the series), and Jack's offhand comments, not to mention the great action, wonderful FX, and stirring music, far outweigh the occasional bit of predictability.Basically...I recommend this video. A lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relive the beginning of the series","review":"Outstanding episodes. These lay the background for the Showtime series which follows after the original movie. I thoroughly enjoy the series. The humor brought to the subject by Richard Dean Anderson and played upon by the other major cast members make it more than just another science fiction adventure.

I for one, would buy them all.I highly recommend these three shows (on one disk)if you liked McGiver and the movie Stargate. It really gets you involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"real let-down","review":"Save your money and miss this one. It's a big disappointment.

But this disc just sounds phoned in. Greg Tortel displays none of the vocal range that he has displayed in the past. There is little guitar. Just synthesizer and recorded drum tracks.

However, once the coffee was in the upper chamber, it simply stayed there.

It's also fun to watch. The quality of the brew is a big plus for me.Cons: A less breakable version would be a big improvement. I gave 5 stars, but I thought about giving 4 because of this. I would pay extra for a version made of heavier glass or pyrex. It's not as convenient as an electric pot, although it's faster than a plug-in if you use a gas stove (more btus).

The only reason I don\`t give it a 5 star rating is the size and the fact that it can\`t be pre-programmed.This is our weekend coffee pot. It\`s only my husband and myself, but it takes 2 pots to satisfy our morning coffee requirements. We use a programmable coffee maker for week/work days which allows us to wake-up to fresh coffee, but we definatey sacrifice quality/taste for that convenience.Our all time favorite coffee maker was an 8 cup, stainless steel vacuum pot made by Cory, but that is no longer available. This pot is a close second. I just wish it had a larger capacity. If it did , it would be our one and only coffee pot.Highly recommend!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too delicate and too much work","review":"I have had vacuum brewed coffee in restaurants and loved it. It was fun to watch and delicious, however, the bodum vacuum model is so delicate and so much work that I have decided to stick with the french press. The bodum spirit burner that came with the set took an hour to force the water into the upper chamber. Also the filter clogged and overbrewed the coffee. This coffeemaker requires constant supervision and carefully ground coffee (not too fine, not too coarse). Overall I would not recommend it, particularly if you plan to use the spirit burner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not seal correctly","review":"I purchased this maker from another site but it is the same one about a week ago. From the beginning it did not operate properly for a vacuum maker. The grommet (rubber?) between the two halves does not seal as it should. I tried different techniques .. dry it real well, heat it up, cool it off etc.. It does make coffee and it does taste good. But I do not relish having to stand over it and make sure the vacuum seal stays tight by pressing down on the top unit. The normal pot will suck the coffee down quickly from the top as soon as you remove it from the heat; however, this one does not!!!! Eventually and very slowly it will draw the coffee down. It did do as I describe only once. I have ordered another grommet from the Bodum site (shipping etc. ) ... if this does not resolve the problem then I will purchase a different one. The original site I purchased it from does not follow up with complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only way. . .","review":"The Bodum Santos Stovetop is the ONLY way to make good coffee.

The design is not efficient. The coffee flavor was okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent coffee, easily made","review":"Makes great coffee. I have an electric kettle, and I normally use that to bring the water to boiling before pouring it into the bottom container, but that's only because the electric kettle boils water quickly.

However, this is a matter of taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee Yes / Stovetop Maybe","review":"I had a siphon-coffee pot years ago, the kind with the glass rod. It and percolators went by the way as drip coffee makers became the trend. When I read about the new fad of siphon coffee, I was as interested out of nostalgia as much as anything. After ordering the Bodum Santos Stovetop Glass Vacuum Coffee Maker, I experimented and compared, and found that the newer version of the siphon coffee maker makes a superior cup of coffee as compared to my very expensive Krups coffee maker. The spring loaded filter system did a much better job of filtering than the old glass rod types. My only complaint is that the handle is not stovetop safe and has warped from the heat. It will eventually have to be replaced and I'm not sure if that is possible or if I will have to buy another pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The Santos does not equal the Bodum electric vacuum pot. The filter is inadequate and requires only the coarsest of grinds which are often not available in store grinders and never in the home grinders. The handle is flimsy and makes it tricky to remove the pot from the heating element. I heartily suggest purchasing a small electric vacuum Bodum pot instead (if you can find one) or the 12 cup electric Bodum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, inexpensive way to brew great coffee","review":"As some other reviewers have mentioned, it does take a bit more effort to use this coffeemaker than it might with a 'standard' electric drip machine. But that is where the comparisons end. The quality of the coffee this device produces is fabulous.And to the reviewer who was worried about the coffee oils getting into the brewed coffee... that's the whole point! You WANT the oils, as they contain the most concentrated flavor. And the fact that this coffeemaker does not involve paper filters (which can trap/absorb the oils) is a major plus.Because it does take more time/effort to brew, I typically only use it on the weekend when both my wife and I drink coffee; during the week, I use a French press to make a single cup for myself. But for the price, you won't find a better coffeemaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"spend your precious cash elsewhere. this item will languish for 99% of it's life. get a nice french press or stovetop espresso maker instead. looks fancy, coffee is mediocre. not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"USED","review":"I'm not sure how well this coffeemaker works.

I have used every type of coffee maker available in the past but this is my favorite method--the vacuum system produces the fullest flavor, no grounds or residue, and it is the easiest to clean, just two glass containers that can be rinsed out. Since purchasing this absolute gem of a coffee brewer, made in Copenhagen, Denmark, I have turned into more of a coffee lover than ever (don't know what this will do to my health). It tastes just like an expensive cup full from Starbucks at a fraction of the price. It is so much fun to watch the brewing process, seeing the water rush up the glass pipe into the upper container where the coffee grounds lie in anticipation of being covered by boiling water which brings out the full flavor, then the coffee descends to the lower container, and, voila!, ready to drink and thoroughly savor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, but . . .","review":"I've long missed my old Sunbeam electric vacuum pot, and before it a Cory all-glass unit. This brews coffee every bit as good as the old stuff, and is a beauty to watch. But . . .1. The bowl is way too fragile. I was very careful, wiping before heating, etc. But after one month it cracked on my electric stove top. It really needs a diffuser pad underneath it, and Bodum ought to make one available. They are very hard to find these days.2. The filter is so-so. I found a stainless unit at a restaurant supply house, which works fine. It should be more generally available.3. And, where do I find a replacement bowl? I hope Amazon.com helps me find one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Great At First...","review":"I purchased the Stovetop Santos a few months ago. I am VERY disappointed in this product. At about $90, it should have lasted longer.I was using this daily to make coffee. Over this short period of time, it got to where I had to brew the same coffee 2-3 times just to get it to drop back down through the filter.The filter is the problem. It is made of metal on plastic. PLASTIC?!?!? Just heat that up a few times and of course it will stop working right. To top that off, Bodum does not currently sell new filters, and the one listed on their website says \\"coming soon $14.95\\". So IF you had the filter, that's telling me it would cost $14.95 plus tax & shipping EVERY 3 MONTHS, just to use this thing? That's ridiculous! What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't order this pot - they break when you wash them","review":"My husband really wanted this coffee pot so I ordered it for him as a gift. We have always enjoyed Bodum products. Within 3 days of using this set the pot broke while I was cleaning it in the sink. I felt terrible so ordered another set (all replacement pots were back ordered everywhere I looked and the cost of a replacement pot was nearly that of an entire new set). Within 5 days of receiving the new set the funnel broke while my husband was cleaning it.The coffee from this pot is by far the best coffee we have ever had. But we've spent $150 on these sets so far and have nothing to show for it.I called and left a message for Bodum and emailed them as well and have heard nothing from them regarding the quality of this product and my wasted money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brewing coffee is now an artform","review":"Brews a great cup of coffee.

If you can't bother to figure things out, do not buy this. =0) Here's a tip though. Bring the water a good hot boil then put the top part on with the coffe. If you put the top part on too early you will get a weak cup of coffee that soon gets cold. Also don't get scared of letting the water steep in the top part for a good minute or two before turning the flame off.Overall, a very good value especially considering the price of other vacuum coffee makers including their electric [price]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tasting coffee","review":"If you are careful to not grind the beans too finely (or the filter clogs up), this will produce consistently delicious coffee every time, particularly for a medium roast.

I still don't like the idea that an inch of water doesn't even get brewed with the coffee because it has to stay at the bottom to keep the glass from cracking. Not only that, but you are left with 2 delicate glass bowls to clean afterwards, instead of just 1.At the end of the day, I'm much happier with my Bialetti moka pot or just an old fashioned percolator.This product was a HUGE dissapointment after reading all the glowing reviews on here.

But the seal does not work consistently so there are times the water simply flushes through quickly and the coffee is weak. Also the glass density is very poor and too thin. I have broken 2 of the tops because I went to clean out the grinds and the glass cracked. I was gentle but the glass is to fragile. I know from their website they refuse to warrant the glass since they cannot predict how it is used. I am a gentle cleaner and the glass is too fragile. Don't waste your money. I will purchase a different system or simply give up coffee (ok that is not so simple) but I would not spend 79 or 89 dollars or replace at 49 poor quality workmanship."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT BROKE","review":"I have had this product for almost a month now and love it, however....while cleaning out the top globe tonight it broke.

When I emailed the manufacturer, they disclaimed any responsibility and the replacement gaskets are 'out of stock' even to purchase. For the amount this unit costs, I would have expected some level of support - especially when we are only talking about a cheap rubber gasket.I advise any and all against this product and it's manufacturer (Bodum). They do not stand behind their product. You are entirely on your own if any components fail. I bought this product hoping it would be more durable than the Yama (glass cracked) but all I can advise now is to go with the Yama - I never had the gasket fail on that unit and it is half the price of the Bodum."},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful adictional tool for FX traders","review":"Beyond the technical analisys, the FX trader must understand the macro movers of a country exchange rate.

It sets a high standard for expecting mothers - akin to \\"natural birth or fail\\" - which is unhelpful even for those already aiming for a natural childbirth. The judgmental tone, especially in the commentary on the birth stories, is unconstructive and offensive (and this from someone who has successfully given birth naturally). More importantly, the authors practically demonize OBGYNs and modern medical practices by recounting negative events/practices from decades-old hospital birth experiences - many of which are no longer in use. This may be valid historical information, but it serves only to frighten expectant mothers and set up a confrontational rapport between mothers and their OBGYNs.I would instead recommend \\"Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Newborn\\" for an informative but more balanced perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only get one birthing book get this!","review":"This is a brilliant book, it is a great source of information and has a very unbiased view.

They expect c-section rates to go down when I think they have actually gone up. I'd love to see their thoughts on how things are now.

But they also acknowledge that there are times when an epidural is appropriate and if that's what you do and it works for you, then that is a successful birth experience too. Some books I've read from the natural childbirth slant don't even include epidurals in their list of \\"pain management\\" techniques, and will only mention all the negative things about them. This is more well-rounded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Info; Easy to Read","review":"This book has lots of information, is very easy to read and is supported by authors who are medically trained and run a Pediatric practice at the same time as having 8 kids! Excellent resource - a must to read during your last trimester!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best birth book out there!","review":"This book is informative and appropriately detailed. It educates the reader on when interventions are harmful and when they are necessary. It also discusses the various options for birthing (hospitals, birth centers, homebirth, etc.) and what to look for in each when choosing where you birth. After reading this book, I feel much more informed in my birthing decisions and reassured that I have selected a doctor who is respectful of my positions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbiased, factual account of everything that involves birth","review":"Dr. Sears and his wife offer a wealth of unbiased and factual knowledge of \\"anything and everything\\" that a couple may encounter during the course of pregnancy and the birth process. They offer their experiences in childbirth as an introduction as to why they wrote the book. They attempt to explain every possible test and use of technology that may be needed/offered during prenatal care and labor. The entire book is written in an unbiased, risk vs. benefit method. The use of this book alone has psychologically assisted my parents to be to understand that birth is a natural process and it is nothing to fear.I recommend this book to my patients in preconception visits. And highly recommend every pregnant couple to purchase this book no matter what type of delivery they plan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I wanted to know","review":"Great book! It was the first place I went back to when contractions started. The ending covers an array of birth stories that give you a truthful and in depth look at the many possibilities and situations you may find yourself in.The only downside is that the material is a bit dated - but only things like bringing a fist full of quarters to call family from a pay phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"very subjective","review":"My sister gave my wife and I this book. She had a succesful natural birth. However, this book tries to guilt you into natural child birth. The authors are very, very subjective. I agree with other reviewers who said they make you feel like a failure if you do not choose natural childbirth. You cannot make an informed, objective decision on your birth plan by reading this book. Incidentally, my sister is having problems with breastfeeding and feels like a failure. She has read their breastfeeding book. If it is written anything like this book, I can understand why."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SATISFYING READING","review":"I feel that many of the comments are to tell you the author's ideas, I would like to see more ways to feel good about a birth. Please read other books too! This does not give alternatives and that is very important. Not enough productive material included and satisfying to this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAKING TOO MANY JUDGEMENTS OF OTHERS","review":"It is fine to discuss other methods but not to be totally down on all others!! Yes, other ways are effective also and the author does not know everything as indicated. Alernatives are important too and should be discussed in a reasonable manner and not just with a one sided approach. TX reader"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very dissapointed reader!","review":"If you are an open minded parent to be, this book is not for you. Mr. Sears expresses time and time again how his wife had all natural births and how much better that is for the baby. I personally think his wife is just one of the lucky few who go through labor pain free. There are many safe alternatives that will allow you to experience a pain free labor and really enjoy it with your partner. I would not even recommend this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"You won't get a badge for courage...","review":"I loved the Pregnancy Book by these authors so I thought The Birth Book was exactly what I needed to help me understand the process of labor and delivery as a first time mother. However, while most of the information was helpful, I felt like the authors considered you \\"less of a woman\\" if you choose to use medical intervention (i.e. drugs for pain relief) during labor. Yeah, this book is great for the I don't shave my armpits and eat granola everyday crowd, but let's be honest why should I have to suffer the way my great-grandmother sufferred to have a child. I sufferred enough through five years of In Vitro procedures to get pregnant. I understand pain. But this book in my opinion attempts to guilt women into feeling like they should experience the pain to appreciate birth. Silly, really, isn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound advice","review":"I was anticipating that natural childbirth methods would be the only method discussed in this book, but have been pleasantly surprised to learn about different pain relief options during labor and delivery. The authors lay out the pros and cons of medication, fetal monitoring, and other such \\"interventions\\" without making me feel like a bad person for possibly wanting an epidural! They discuss practical birthing positions and exercises that you can do pre-birth to prepare your body for the marathon of birth."},{"rating":"2","title":"After reading this book, third time in labor is a charm","review":"I bought this book when I was pregnant with my third child and determined to have a natural drug-free birth for once. After reading this book I really felt like I had all the tools I needed to take control of my labor and have the labor I really wanted. I gained important coping techniques that I hadn't learned in the prepared childbirth class I took the first time around and I went into labor confident and empowered. Using many of the techniques the Sears' recommended I had a satisfying drug-free labor that left me with a natural high for two weeks following the delivery. I felt great and the added bonus of having spared my child exposure to labor drugs was a wonderful plus. I recommend this book to anyone - whether they want a \\"natural\\" labor or not. This book suggests wonderful techniques to minimize pain throughout labor and gives first time moms a good idea of what to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not be your only guide!","review":"This was the first birthing book I read and frankly it scared me silly about all medical intervention. The book contains lots of useful and interesting information but is very one sided. I think it is important to read other books also that are more open to the potential advantages of medical intervention in birth, otherwise if the doctor or midwife recommends a particular course of action, it will induce fear of potential consequences.I found the authors quite santimonious from time to time and the guilt element comes through loud and clear.In summary, some good information but all from one side of the fence so make sure you read other books too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great info, tries to balance viewpoints","review":"This is one of the better birth books out there. It gives you a good comparison of the different sides to birthing. Coming from a doctor, some of the information is surprising, as I was shocked to read that a doctor would actually advocate a natural childbirth! Most doctors in my experience look at you like you are a lunatic if you say you want a natural experience.Dr. Sears and Martha do a pretty good job at explaining pros and cons and even include info it is pretty obvious they don't support, which tells me they tried to be as unbiased as possible (although I have to say, it is pretty clear what their viewpoint is by the first chapter!).A good general information book for first timers, and good review for those having their seconds+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview of many options","review":"I like this book for an overview of birth options but prefer other ones over it, like Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way by Susan McCutcheon-Rosegg. If you wanted a good overview to help you decide on details of your birth plan, this would be a good one. If you've already decided what you'd like for your baby's birth, go with something more specific to your preferences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date","review":"I was excited to read this book given all the good reviews it received. Unfortunately I was disappointed by it. It definitely has a natural childbirth slant, which would be OK if it accurately discussed other alternatives such as pain medications. I found some of the information regarding pain medications for childbirth was out of date or (hopefully not intentionally) misleading. For example, the book states that women who have an epidural are twice as likely to have either forceps or vacuum extraction. This is just not true. The information regarding Lamaze is also out of date. Keep in mind this book was published in 1994, a lot can change in 13 (+) years! It does have some useful basic information about labor and comfort techniques but overall I found it to be very biased and, like I've already written, just plain out of date. I highly recommend \\"Easy Labor\\" by William Camann and Kathryn Alexander as an unbiased, researched, highly readable, and recently published (2006!) alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Birth Book","review":"I am greatly disappointed by this book. While it does provide a great deal of valuable informaion about all types of birthing styles and options available to birthing mothers, there is a strong tendency of the authors to be quite negative toward the main-stream hospital birth with an OBGYN. It is quite evident that the authors feel that all natural, even home delivery is the best way to go. As an expecting mother, I find this infomation and how it is presented to be condesending and full of guilt/shame for those of us not interested in the \\"all-natural\\" delivery. I feel that a more objective approach would be more helpful. Furthermore, the other books by Sears, MD and Sears, RN are much the same way. If you are even thinking you might breast and bottle feed...don't bother reading their breastfeeding book...you'll just feel guilty and bad if you don't succeed with their way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on birth","review":"This book was fantastic. It had all of the information that I was looking for about the birth of my baby. It answered my questions in a very thoughtful way and laid out all of the alternatives for birth. I chose a hospital birth and this book gave me lots of things to talk about with my doctor to ensure that I got the birth that I wanted. The information in this book made me much better informed about the choices that were available to me and let me make the best decisions for myself and my baby. The Searses are very open about their own birth experiences and make mothers to be feel comfortable with what can be the biggest decisions in their lives. I loved this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless","review":"I found that the book is just NOT suitable for those who have some foundation.

After leaving the Watchtower he began a ministry to JWs that has been operating for quite a few years now. His newsletter was one of the first sources I came across when studying about JWs.In this book, Reed documents the teachings of the Watchtower using quotes and photocopies from their own literature. So it hard for a JW to claim that this book misrepresent their teachings.Each of these subjects have a bearing on the authority of the Watchtower. If the Watchtower is wrong on any one of these then it cannot be \\"God's Channel of Communication\\" as it claims. And Reed does a throughout job of showing that the Watchtower is in fact wrong on subject after subject. And for more Biblical study one these subjects, consult my \\"Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible.\\" It includes three chapters on the Trinity and one on various other Watchtower teachings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Effective Tool","review":"Just look at the negative comments by JWs and their cohorts.

I myself am married to a jehovahs witness and trying to communicate to her about the lords word is almost impossible, due to the fact that she has been brain washed from the time that she was born. The Jehovahs Witnesses are one of the most dangerous cults in the world today. The reason being that they can make the cleaverest lie sound just like the truth. I would give up everything I have for her to be converted to true christianity, and this book has almost made that possible. The hard thing about JW's is that they beleive that if you do not beleive what they beleive then you are an advisary of satan. If they claim to know the bible so well then why do you need another source called the watchtower to make you complete in Gods eyes. Maybe all they need to do is read the last verse of the bible. Thank you Mr. Reed."},{"rating":"2","title":"In this times of false prophets, this is a good book","review":"After I read the book, I changed my point of view of this people. They teach you about the false prophecies, that they are the true religion, but the author show you proofs and the incredible is that when you try to speak with a J.W about it, they don't want to talk to you?

This is actually the reason why I bought it, along with its size (7\\" wrist).So far so good with this watch. It looks a lot better in person than in the photos. The case is polished stainless steel. The bezel has a good, tight, solid movement. Not clanky like one of my seikos. The second hand does not perfectly align with the markers, but I never really cared about that.

Lug width is 20mm.It is so light you forget it is there. Seems to easily attain the +/- 15 seconds / month of accuracy that I think is specified. Second hand hits the index markers quite well, which is fairly common for a Citizen watch. Overall an excellent watch.

I am indeed a Bollywood fan but a very critical one at that. A ten year old child could have done a better job writing the dialogue. And as far as acting goes? It breaks my heart to even go there;I am not likely to contain myself. Do yourselves a huge favor and rent it for the scenic locations.

Each station's text is accompanied by a photo that in some manner reflects the common suffering of mankind - age, loneliness, brokenness .... This is a very simple, poetic, meditative version of the Way of the Cross.

The wooden posts and veneer used are are not cut the same so gaps appear between the base and the walls, the \\"studs\\" and the veneer spacers, and the thin clear plastic \\"Windows\\". The house is nailed together with staples instead of nails and NOT glued.Slats on the roof were loose and collected in the bottom of the plastic wrap. (not boxed). I used Gorilla glue to fix most of the problems and a few screws. While the bird feeder came with a wire cabling to hang it up (the only nice feature), I do not expect this bird feeder to last the length of the summer.Will shop at Walmart for future birdfeeders, instead of Birdscapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journalists guide to the internet","review":"I had to read this book for a communication class.

She is a pretty woman who is not as shy as her voice makes her out.Not only is Ms. Ekuni a charming woman who knows how to say what she thinks succinctly, she is saying very important things. Like, \\"there is not such thing as a normal romance,\\" and \\"falling in love is foolhardy\\". I hope people aren't turned off by the inclusion of gay characters who choose to live normalized married lives, because the fact of the matter is that it happens, and it bothers fewer people that way.Don't expect thrilling action or melodrama in this book. Twinkle Twinkle is about manners, and about how everyone has their psychological mis-balance, like Shoko, the girl; or feels the need to hide something natural to them, like Mutsuki, the boy.Twinkle Twinkle tells it like it is, and then breaks down what has always been a mystery to readers - love."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Banana Yoshimoto, you will also love this author","review":"Kaori Ekuni's first novel got awarded and loved by many readers in Japan.I am so very fortunate to read this novel after I read more than few of Banana Yoshimoto's. Their styles in writing may be different but the way they describe emotions of each character through events and episodes are very similar. The story line itself is interesting and you will fell in love with all three major characters, Musutki, Shoko and Kon.

Why they did that is beyond me and I really wish they wouldn't have done that. They could have made this a two disc set if space was the issue. Having said that it isn't chopped up and you don't know what is missing so maybe it is an okay thing.You can either play the entire thing or just view which Golden Girl you want to know more about.

The Thunderpuss mixes are OK...and that's about it. Being a big fan of their work (even if some accuse it of being formulaic), their style certainly does make for some highly danceable grooves.

Luise chronicles her experience caring for her elderly parents. She alternates with factual chapters about nursing homes, medical care for the elderly and other elder care information.I spent a few years caring for my elderly father so this book really resonated for me. Her honest depiction of the emotional, physical and financial impacts of caring for elderly parents brought me to tears at times. Sibling dynamics add to the stress and Luise talks about these without judgment.At first, I wasn't sure that I liked the factual chapters mixed in with the story, but in the end, it really added to the book.This book is important reading for anyone caring for elderly relatives. We can learn from Luise's experience and also know what to expect with our own relatives. It helps to know there are other people who have gone through the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The plot thickens","review":"This book picks up right where the first left off and continues to build an interesting and suspenseful storyline.

The cherries are not hard and dry but softer and chewy. They have a great flavor. I happen to like sour things but my wife not so much.

Although the setting and story line initially intrigued me, my interest petered-out quickly as I realized the writing was monotonous; the sentence structure rarely varied and the use of dialogue, although a strong point of his writing, was just too much. The repetition of events through multiple conversations left me rather bored and feeling as though I could skim too many pages. I found the plot line forced and lacking originality. The ending was quick and left me feeling like there really wasn't a conclusion. With that, I'm not one to stop short of what I started, especially when it comes to books. I'll steer clear of any of Stander's upcoming novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable murder-mystery","review":"Aaron Stander does an admirable job developing a sympathetic protagonist and supportive characters.

I was wholly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't catch","review":"The story was just interesting enough to keep me reading until the end, but not interesting enough to be a \\"keeper\\" for me.

Characters come and go with no relevance to the story. It is as if the author couldn't figure out what to do next. There was no sign of any planning to the story. He obviously wrote without any outline or purpose.The characters have no personality; are not complete. There are few descriptions of people or places to put you into the story.A good work puts you into the scene, lets you see the people and places in your mind's eye.There is none of that here.A waste of time and $.99"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author has potential, but this is a waste of time.","review":"Price aside, this offering is a waste of time. A lack of focus, people dropping dead, a poorly defined protagonist, too many names and personalities, and little pay-off. What is frustrating is that the author does have writing skills, and conveys comfortable dialogue. Best wishes to the author, but you need to focus your story telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"The plot is ok, but with the authors constant jumping around in the plot makes it's difficult to follow. There is a large number of characters and the characters are not fully outlined so it makes it hard to remember who is who.

For the people who don't like swearing (there is one very brief scene but it fits) and sex scenes, you will be pleased to read this book. If you also like murder mysteries but don't care for the gory details you will also like this book.I can see why some people might not have liked the ending so much. I don't want to give it away but since I know this is a series I am assuming this investigation will come up again so it wasn't a downer for me. I liked the character development and thought it was well done. The story was also very good.I am pretty sure that I know who the murderer is but there is enough going on in the book to keep you guessing. Perhaps I will be surprised.Overall, I enjoyed this book very much & look forward to reading the rest of his books which I have already downloaded and am going to start reading this weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whodunit?","review":"I was really getting into this book anticipating the outcome.

It finally begins to pick about 3/4 of the way through the book and then.....nothing, it just ends.

Not worth the .99 cents I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the book without an ending","review":"A complicated story that you wait for the end to come together, and then it just ends without a conclusion.

There really is no end. I often find that other reviewers can be highly over dramatic in their reviews. So, naturally I thought the people who said this book did not have an ending were just being snarky. Turns out they were right. This book shows potential in the beginning and has some interesting parts in the middle, but then it just dies. There is not even any prelude to the death. It is there and then it is gone. I am lost and for once can't figure out what else there could possibly be to say about this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Waiting for the Ending","review":"No ending to this book.

It was a good idea for a story, but lacks essentials for making it a good read (for me anyway.)There is no character development, you just never really get to feel anything for any of the characters. I kept reading, trudging through the story line that continually jumped from one story to another and then thinly tries to tie them together, so that I could get to the end.

I know it's not the Sony Bluetooth headset, because if I pair them to my phone or Mac I have no issues with breaks of service. Even on busy trains.Another gripe is the battery; it lasts about 6 hours, but is very poor at keeping the charge.

The seat is designed well, for men who leave the seat up, when it is put down, it floats down slowly due to dampening. What I don't care for is the plastic material used in the seat, it should have been a harder material. It can scratch and it would be a nice improvement if they used a better material for the seat. This item easily deserves 5 stars if not for the seat material so I had to give 4 stars but I wouldn't switch brands just for the seat quality because this beat the competition in every other way.

Actually, that shouldn't be taken too disparagingly: by the later records the Clash had significantly broadened their sonic palettes beyond the harder/faster punk aesthetic, and Disk 1 provides a nice overview, without, for example, actually having to sit through \\"Sandinista!\\".Usual anthology quibbles about song selection (where's \\"Guns on the Roof\\"? or \\"I'm So Bored with the U.S.A.\\"?), but the liner notes are amusing, especially the story about Roxy \\"they came, they saw, they split\\" Music.So where's volume 2?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute toy","review":"I don't think you can go wrong with WOW toys.

Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed. The handle holds paint, so I don't need to go up and down a ladder multiple times, but the pad at the end is curved in a way that makes cutting-in very difficult. The curved design actually prevented me from getting a clean, line along the edge of a window, wall or ceiling. I presume the curved pad must be to allow you to hold the pad at different angles because the paint-holding arm is so long it might get in the way. However, the curve just makes it many times more difficult to paint. Also, the head does not pivot, so the long handle ends up getting in the way when trying to position the pad. I reverted back to using a simple $4 trim pad that I dip into the paint. It requires my going up and down a ladder, but it works much better at trim work than the Trim-It."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt work out for us.","review":"Thought this would make cutting in easier but found it to be a pain to use.

In the long run, the rework I had to perform negated any time savings I should have received.The system works by loading paint into the device and delivering the paint to the wall through the trim pad, pressurized by a spring loaded piston that pushes the paint through the pad. The amount of paint delivered is regulated by the trigger mechanism.Unfortunately, the spring is too strong for the device. When the trigger is pushed, even momentarily, too much paint is pushed out the pad, causing drips, run, and globs. Additionally, paint leaked out the back end of the device, making a larger mess.Not a bad idea as a time saver, but the design needs work. This product gets an A for Effort, but an F for Failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divorce Handbook for California: How to dissolve your marrig","review":"I found Judge Stewart's Divorce Handbook for California to be not only incredibly thorough, but also quite easy to understand and free of condescending \\"legalese\\". In fact, there is an extensive glossary of terms that I could quickly refer to if I was at all unsure of a legal concept. This book is superior to the \\"do it yourself\\" variety, because it illustrates a variety of legal options for the reader, including how to hire a competent attorney and yet protect yourself financially. Because divorce is such a complicated and emotional process, it is reassuring to have a clear and comprehensive resource to turn to for info on a variety of legal issues, such as spousal support, division of property, custody, attorneys etc. I enthusiastically recommend this extremely useful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Before You Meet An Attorney ...","review":"...you should get this book.

It gives a very fair and helpful evaluation on when and how to find a lawyer as well as strategies for interviewing a lawyer. Most importantly unlike some other divorce books the author doesn't try to oversell the idea of a do-it-yourself divorce.My biggest complaint about the book is that, it doesn't offer rules or explanation of law (beyond procedure and the most basic outline of rules) that affect property judgements. In all fairness, I have yet to find that information in any book-- I guess that is what keeps lawyers in Business.The bottom line is if you are about to get a divorce, it is definately worth your time and money.

Cindy Sherman's amazing photography has not translated well to the motion picture screen. Ringwald and Tripplehorn turns in high school play calibre performances, and it is painful to watch the great talent of Ms. Kane so devalued in this piece of schlock. Rent more fascinating, subtle, scary and truly hilarious species of this type of film-ones that succeed where Sherman's attempt fails (e.g. Rod Steiger in \\"No Way To Treat A Lady\\" comes to mind-if you are insistent upon slashing in an office setting, good god even rent \\"The Temp\\"-but don't rent this and certainly do not buy it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"GROSS,BORING,AND JUST PLAIN BAD","review":"This movie should have never been made.

Please read on.Only problem I encountered was that when first started it would not sync/flash until I pointed the camera's on-board flash directly at the slave and \\"woke\\" it up with a few flashes.

The light sensor on this flash is right on the front of it, which means it was in optimal position and i switched through each mode after 10 shots each. The ONLY times i got this flash to go off was when i hit the manual flash button on the back, and even then it didnt work all the time.

For example, if you where to want to learn the Reel and you went to O'Conner school of Irish dance, you may start the step with a bounce step step kick and down, wheres if you went to Claddagh to learn the Reel, you may start the step with a one two three step up hop back instead.

All the roads of learning begin in darkness and go out into the light.\\" Hippocrates of GosThis film has the psychological complexity of a Val Lewton production but is a lot more graphic than most of his productions where he just implies violence. He even takes it out on innocent dogs. I feel that some one was pushing Lewton from behind to be more vicious with this film.A young student (Russell Wade) wants to become a doctor like the great Dr. Wolfe 'Toddy' MacFarlane (Henry Daniell.)

I can relate to the author's journey starting with his Christian roots leading him to life on the \\"Red road\\".

The read took me on such a ride that I alternately was forced to pause in contemplation of a few sweetly nuanced sentences; while later flying through others in joyous recognition. The stuggle to find a meaningful place, right relationship with others, and connection to God is one that is universal; yet Mr. Hull has made it so personal that I was comfotable being taken along. I felt I was at his side as he walked that walk. It is a book I will refer to over and over again.

The breadth of experiences that Mr. Hull relates go beyond any mere recounting of a White Man's journey into the world of Lakota spirituality. I found myself continually amazed at the diversity of his story and how he was able to integrate the teachings with wisdom from the East, from the Yucatan, and from a bunch of old drunks. Where Mr. Hull really excelled was in doing this at the same time as presenting such an honoring recounting of the the ways of the elders and repectfully addressing the abuse of traditional ways by \\"wanna be\\" Indians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid work by a solid author...","review":"This is a fine story for middle readers, readers of fantasy, those who like family stories... Janet Taylor Lisle's latest story blends fantasy and reality in this story of coping with death and loss. The characters are wonderfully crafted; Ms. Lisle's use of language is superb, and the story moves along quickly. Readers hardly notice the movement from reality to fantasy and back, as the story progresses from two little girls mourning their mother and missing their father to a story of girls who have a mission...finding the \\"lost flower children\\"...to the little girls who accomplish this mission, getting to know their \\"Great Aunt Minty\\" along the way.

Add to that the pretty well faultless YumYum of Margaret Mitchell and the even handsome-on-record Leonard Osborn. The conducting by Isidore Godfrey is definitive. But this transfer by Naxos is appalling. They make it sound like it was recorded in the 20's. I played the CD's side by side with the vinyl and it's hard to believe they are the same recording. There is a much better tranfser available from Sounds on CD in the UK. Why doesn't Amazon have that one on offer also?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Fidelity, recorded in 1950","review":"Although admirably serving the noble purpose of preserving for posterity the vocal performances of some incredibly famous G&S 'specialists'(eg, Darrell Fancourt), this CD [set] is not for the average G&S fan, among whose ranks I count myself. Unfortunately, the preservation of old recordings is a tough thing, and this version suffers from terrible fidelity overall and in many songs, completely unintelligible lyrics. Many fans know all the lyrics by heart, but hearing them distorted and fuzzy grossly distracts from the experience and certainly won't win over any new fans. I thought I was taking the reasonable and less expensive route with this version, but will have to buy the more recent recording to enjoy Mikado. Do yourself a favor, save up a little longer, and buy the more expensive (recent) recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great performance - terrible mastering","review":"I don't know what Naxos is thinking (or hearing) but yhey are doing a really awful job on their remasterings of the early 50s Gilbert and Sullivan recordings.

All I knew of Indian music at that point was the brilliance of Ravi Shankar and the tinny sound of movie soundtracks.Don't get me wrong, I love Shankar. This is another avenue, and in some ways a more peaceful one, into Indian classic music. Shankar seems (to my poorly trained American ear) more structured, more cosmopolitan; Call of The Valley has a more agrarian feel to it.On a side note, I find it endlessly amusing that the closing track on the cassette, Rag Pahadi, is based on a three-tone motif identical to the cheesy 1950s-American single \\"Baby Face.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Indian music recording I've heard!","review":"I'm married to an Indian and travelled in india numerous times and this is the best, and most accessible to western ears, piece of classical Indian music I've heard.Do yourself a favour and listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh ideas for everyone from beginners to experts!","review":"I have made thousands of cookies in my life.

Although the viewer may wish they were bending over backward, the scenes are flowing (as opposed to some campy movies which break stride to make a joke).I really enjoyed the movie, and I know that I will treasure this one in my collection.How can you lose? Arse kicking, hot chics with lesbian overtones and lotsa leg and skirt action. Teenage boys would love this.The movie is well made, and I recall being very impressed.

It's not the sound of The Band. Despite the textures, you'd get closer to what a protracted halcyon Band might sound like on the 'Largo' project. And a limper quality on the Danko, Anderson, Fjeld effort,'Riding On The Blinds.' There's such a good time feeling in The Gourds, a swelling, toppling good time that feels almost out of control. Is this musical phenomena merely a regional thing? It's nigh impossible to obtain their CDs, including 'Bolsa' over or under the counter in Australia.

I have seen him play live twice and he draws a enormous crowd. His approach to classical guitar is a modern one. On his albums, he transcribes rock, T.V. themes, and folk tunes. His ability to play all instruments on the guitar, with no overdubbing is overwhelming. On his album Classical Demands, Cruz plays his rendition of the old Queen anthem, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". Cruz play the bass, guitar, piano, and voice parts, all at the same time. This is truly awesome. If you have ever heard Mason William's \\"Classical Gas\\", Cruz plays it better than william's w/ Manheim Steamroller. If you have never heard Cruz play, you are missing out.

It makes all public bathrooms the same - even a port-a-potty. It mostly keeps kids from touching the public seat. There are no problems with it folding if you put it at the front of the seat. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is hard for a kid to climb up themselves without knocking it off.

Soon thereafter I tried to use it on two different toilets. With the first, I couldn't get the seat to flatten enough to make it really stable for my daughter. With the second, a newer toilet with an nonstandard bowl, it wouldn't even fit. Problem is, the newer toilet is exactly why I bought the thing --to use at my brother's house.Am going to try something else. This thing really is kind of junky.

It is a bit unsturdy, however, and therefore one might accidentally might come in contact with the toilet seat. Previously, I had posted a review for this potty seat that asked how this product was supposed to stay clean, considering that it touched public toilet seats. Someone replied to my posting and suggested that a paper toilet seat cover or toilet paper can be put under the potty seat to keep the potty seat cleaner.

And looks like it will buckle inward at any moment and leave them stranded in the toilet.We are returning it for a Potette 2 in 1, hopefully we will have better luck there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had high hopes for the portable potty seat, but was disappointed it is NOT user friendly. It took four tries to get my daughter on the seat without the seat shifting or folding in. I now know you have to lift the child high above the seat and gently place her down right on top because it shifts off the toilet. At the same time you have to hold the seat because it wants to fold in on itself (very weak). In fairness I have to say it may have been the shape of the toilet. I was at Target at the time. Who knows?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"this doesnt fit your typical toilet seat.

Easy fold/unfold and is lightweight and portable (I just keep it inside my purse in the plastic bag it came in). I have 3 year old twins and having this item allows me to take one to the sink to wash hands while the 2nd child safely holds the handles and goes 'potty' without me.

Useful and inexpensive - a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly designed","review":"I would not recommend this product. The seat did not fit most toilet seats and kept sliding around. My son was in pain from sitting on the seat and where it folded left dents in his legs when he go off of it.

So we finally gave up and threw it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I love this portable potty seat!!!My arms tired of holding my 2 year old son so he won't fall into public toilets, and after an incident where one automatically flushed under him, I decided to get a portable, foldable potty seat for use while we are out and about.This is the first one I have tried (I studied them carefully, pros and cons)and I LOVE it for what it is. It folds up small, it supports my son well without fear of falling in, it does not pinch him at all (hinges are covered), it fits at the FRONT of the toilet seat, it's a great thing to have on hand. My son likes it because it's an \\"exciting\\" new thing to him. It has greatly reduced his fear of the auto-flush, and we have had no problems with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply horrible","review":"The idea behind this seat is good. Little ones, especially those just learning to use the toilet, need a portable seat so they feel secure on public toilets, or even at Grandma's house. But the design on this seat is not good for little kids. The seat doesn't stay on the toilet securely. Even with me lifting my toddler up onto the seat, it shifts, falls into the toilet (ew!), etc. But the most serious problem with it is that the seat pinches little parts in the hinges. OWW! Also, because of its shifting, once (trying it at home to see if it worked any better), it slid over and REALLY pinched my sons privates inbetween the seat and the regular toilet seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this product because my little girl always wants to use the toilet. We have a regular potty trainer that goes on our toilet at home and thought this would be similar. It is not! It has not fit on ANY public toilet we have tried and slips all over the place. She doesn't want to use it, which leaves me with nothing! I would not purchase this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works on some seats","review":"It is not perfect, but it does the job. Never had a pinching issue like I had read about. fitting on public seats is an issue because most are oblong and this is designed for round seats. Works fine for boys and girls, we keep in a ziploc bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite fit public toilets","review":"Seems like a good idea, but it doesn't quite fit on many public toilet seats.

Great idea, but not quite right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I LOVE this product. I have a little girl and this definitely takes the \\"eeww\\" out of taking her to a public restroom. I've also taken it to the park and it fits on those toilets too.

Incredibly cheap, but that comes at a price :-)The product quality is not the best. The handles are clever and make it easy to pick up. Color is perfect.After a while it starts to stain. Overall good value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent all around seat","review":"This folding seat is good for public and standard residential toilets. Sets up fast, which is good with a toddler who can't hold it for long! Folds to be slightly bigger than a 40 pack of wipes, so it easily fits in a tote or medium purse! Very lightweight. Easily wipes off and as others noted, if you set it on a public toilet all way to front, you'll be all set! IF you are not sure what type of potty seat to buy, get this and you wont have regrets. You can buy another type for home, and still not feel like your broke. It is useful in many ways, such as home use, or even a quick trip to mall, traveling for a long weekend, etc. Easy to keep in car, just grab when you go inside stores, restaurant, etc. I bet those who like to camp could even set it on a strong pail for convenience with a toddler in tent?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for what we needed it for.","review":"My two year old uses a 2 in 1 toilet seat at home so he is accustomed to using a normal sized toilet rather than a \\"potty chair\\". He doesn't like/isn't used to being held on the potty- so he wouldn't go if I was helping him balance. I started looking for something portable,hoping to find something I could throw into my purse or easily carry in a restaurant/store/friend's house and this fit the bill. The only downside is that you have to make sure your child doesn lean too far back. When my son did that, he felt like he was falling in- but now I just remind him to lean forward and he we have not had a problem with it since. I definitely think this is the best choice- especially for our family- for potty training on the go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful for This","review":"I'm thankful I found one of these. It gives me more piece of mind when my toddler is on a public toilet. I put a seat cover on, then I put this seat on top. It folds up really small, and it fits great in your child's travel bag. I have wondered though if it's uncomfortable for her. When she sits on it, it bends in a little, but it works just fine. I also love the handles on the front.I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"fits in your diaper bag!","review":"I bought this seat because I was disgusted at how my 3 year old had to put his hands on the toilet seat to steady himself on public toilets. I am SO HAPPY with this purchase, it fold and fits right in your diaper bag..even a smaller one like a ju-ju-be between! The storage bag it comes with is just a large zip lock style bag so I'm going to be looking into a cloth wet bag to store this in instead so I can wash it when needed :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"This product has yet to fit well on any toilet we've tried it on.

It is made of very flimsy plastic and the design does not fit ANY toilet seat securely. We tried it backward and forward and each time it does not stay on securely and slips around, rendering it completely useless. Worse yet, my daughters, who each weigh less than 30 lbs seemed to be too heavy as placing them on the seat caused the center to droop.This is one of the worst designed child product I have encountered."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"I bought this seat thinking it would be great for us because we travel a lot.

I placed this folding potty against the front of my toilet at home, and it seemed stable. My two-year-old said it was comfortable. Then I noticed a puddle growing in front of the toilet and realized that all the pee was coming out! She was just sitting on it normally. I thought I would just let her finish and then clean her up. Well, she started to move or try to get up or something and fell face first onto the ground!The best way I've found to avoid the dirtiest part of the toilet is to sit my kid on the side of the toilet, facing the toilet paper or (even better) the handicapped bar. I usually just hold her as she sits (for stability), and she's never fallen in. This folding potty thing was more trouble than anything. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"there are better portable potties out there","review":"I found that this potty was easy to unfold, but had gaps between where they pieces connect, making it very easy for a child to get pinched. Also, I put it on my toilet, and put a bit of weight on it, and it bowed easily, so I was very worried about putting my child on it. Especially since I had gone back and read other negative reveiws on it. We ended up getting a regular potty seat and putting it in the car. It fits in the bottom of the stroller, so I always have it with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Potty Seat!","review":"Do not buy this potty seat-it is awful! I take plenty of time to fit the seat properly on the toliet and when I try to put my 2yo daughter on it, it slips around. My daughter is not comfortable on it at all and it pinches her bottom. Every single time I have used this she pees all over herself and the floor also because this seat has to be positioned all the way to the front of the toliet and there is not enough room for her to slide back enough so she has space to potty. Then it slips around and practically falls off the potty when I try to take her off of it. I am going to sell it in my garage sale-it is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible seat - trauma inducing!","review":"We bought this seat to use on a vacation trip, and learned quite quickly that it was entirely unstable and didn't fit ANY of the toilet seats we wanted to use it for - not airport toilets, airplane toilets or even the hotel toilet. It slipped and slid around when we tried to put my son it, inducing screams and general terror of airplane toilets. After trying it on three different toilets on which it did not securely git, we just used the \\"hover\\" technique and accepted that we might get a little wet but our son would feel more stable rather than terrifed. On the occasions when he saw the seat on the rest of the vacation, he told us to PUT IT AWAY, IT WAS NOT GOOD and insisted it be hidden from his sight. I had to agree with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"This seat is actually better than the reviews would suggest. Our son is near the top % of height and about avg on weight % for his age (2yrs). He is able to use this easily and it holds his weight fine. It does look flimsy when he sits on it but it never falls in or breaks. We love it because it sits at the front of the toilet seat so he doesn't end up touching anything gross on the seat with the back of his legs. It folds up pretty small and we're able to keep it in the purse (we keep it in a bag of it's own so it doesn't dirty anything in the bigger bag it is in).Only con is how light weight it is. it is a little flimsy so our son does seem a little uneasy sitting on it sometimes. It does have handles he grabs onto so that keeps him safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"AwEsOme!!","review":"I just received this seat today (8/6/2012) and decided to try it out on our nitely walk around the block. My daughter is potty training so she is wearing underwear not diapers. about 2 blocks from home she announced that\\"Mommy I have to go pee pee\\". So we met a kindly neighbor that let us use her toilet and the seat worked like a charm. I am so happy I brought it with me. My daughter isn't small 37 inches tall and 32 pounds. I read the reviews about collapsing and pinching and took that into consideration when I put it on the toilet by giving it a test push and made sure it was snug in the front of the seat. Again totally happy with the purchase and highly recommend this seat to all potty training Moms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works exactly as I had hoped.","review":"This potty seat works exactly as I had hoped. It isn't frilly (and doesn't need to be), but it allows us freedom to be away from home and for our toddler to use any potty safely.

Her hands naturally stay on the handles, keeping her hands clear of holding onto the public toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not Sturdy Enough for my 27 pounder","review":"I thought this foldable seat was such a good idea, but it just didn't seem stable enough for my little munchkin. It kind of bends a little when she sits on it and it makes her feel insecure. It's unfortunate because now I have to lug around a full sized potty seat (just the top part, not a whole setup). I understand her fears because it really does look like she might \\"fall in\\". Oh well, I tried. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I bought this for my two-year-old son to use in public restrooms. It got the best reviews of the portable potties I was looking at. I have a BOY, so there needs to be some kind of guard or something there or he pees all over the bathroom stall. Not only that, but because of where the handles are located, he can't spread his legs very far apart, so he's really just aiming for the floor. The seams don't pinch and it does hold his weight (28 pounds), but it's not the best solution for a little boy.

I thought this would work similar to the other toddler seats that fit on the inside of the toilet seats.It was tricky to figure out how this was supposed to fit on the seat. I finally figured out it fit on the front of the toilet seat. But there's nothing to block the front and it sits too high off the main toilet seat for a boy to tuck \\"it\\" down far enough. So I had to use a wad of toilet paper in front so my son didn't spray me or his clothes.I would only recommend this if you have a girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"looks like it will work great, but what bag?","review":"this looks like just the product we needed, and my daughter can open and close the seat on her own, and it feels super sturdy, at least for her 27 pounds. The only thing that leaves me wanting is that there is no \\"bag\\" - it was mentioned in the dialog but it came in just a zip lock type bag, and that was slightly torn because it was what the seat was packaged in. I don't really think you can call that a product feature. I was hoping it was a draw string type bag that could be hung in the bathroom stall or something, but for $8 I guess I could be okay with it and just find something to keep it in that can be hung up. Otherwise I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!","review":"We bought this for our son after experiencing some dirty or too large public toilets.My husband tried to use it for the first time yesterday and could not get it to fit the toilet at a restaurant and there was no way he could lift my son on to it without it slipping.I thought I would give it a try today when we were out for breakfast. Typical toilet at Einstein's bagels.I had a hard time getting it to stay, lifted my son up and placed him on the seat. He let out a horrible scream and I lifted him up and threw the seat cover to the floor.He was bleeding.THE PRIMO FOLDING POTTY SEAT CUT HIM ON HIS BEHIND!!!!!!This product does not fit on toilets, the handles are blocking where the legs should go and instead of protecting him, it hurt him.We will just bring disinfecting wipes from now on.DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not best for boys","review":"My son used this several times & wet all over the floor each time. There is no splash guard on it for boys, but it probably works fine for girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Havent found a potty it works on yet!","review":"I had high hopes for this seat. I was very excited to get it. I have attempted to use it at two different restuarants (Olive Garden being one, the other a local place) and it does not fit. I tried it at the top, middle and bottom near the opening. I even tried it with the seat lifted up. I like the idea of it but it does not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as anticipated!","review":"This seat has worked well for us. Its compact and fits in my bag easily. My daughter grabs the little handles in the front instead of touching the toilet which is a big ick factor for me. She is about 25lbs and it holds her easily and she seems very comfortable with it. I would have liked a fitted washable carry case to come with it but I use one of my wet/dry cloth diaper bags and it works okay if not a little big."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as hoped","review":"Love La Mer so bought this CD.

It stays true to Christian origins and lyrics, but keeps a bright, bouncy quality. Some of the songs performed by women are a little too close to the Spears/Simpson breathy and squeaky, but with singers like Jennifer Knapp (who sounds like the Dido/Amy Lee type), and the boy bands mimick NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. Despite that, this Wow year one of the better ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD of this year's top hits!","review":"Good. This cd is just that. It has some great hits of this year.

I beat the mix for 15 minutes, at least. It appeared to have doubled and gotten stiff peaks. I baked it according to directions. It looked beautiful. After it had cooled, I turned it upright and the entire cake had fallen. It was a hideous, heavy mass. My friend said it looked like an atomic bomb! I find it reassuring that other people have rated this cake a 5, but I just can't figure out how to do it.

I did find that I had to beat the cake longer than the box indicated and needed to bake it longer. I mixed my first one using my portable hand mixer which was really too small for this product. Second time I used my new stand mixer with the whip attachment. It more than doubled in volume after beating it about 10 minutes longer than the package suggested and I beat it on high. The cake filled my tube pan to the top and I baked it about 5 minutes longer than package suggested as my first one was a bit underbaked. My husband, who is NOT celiac, loves this cake also. We can't tell the difference between this one and a regular angel food cake mix. I also used 1 teaspoon of GF vanilla and 1 teaspoon of GF almond extract instead of using 2 of vanilla. I like the almond flavoring in angel food cake better, but that is personal preference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi-Altitude Baker","review":"This is a fantastic mix. Easy and fast to make, perfect every time if you follow the directions and remember to use a non-stick tube pan. Wonderful whether iced or plain with strawberries,a true family favorite.

I'll save you some money; take your camera into a supermarket, a compusa, and a walmart and snap away. Then go home and review them. Done and I saved you some cash. The arrogance of these guys.

I loved it. Here, in the US, Saxon are very hard to find. I was overwhelmed with joy when i saw this cd in the heavy metal section of the store called \\"record town\\". I bought the cd, and when I put it on, I knew that it was worth all the 20 dollars I paid for it.

Nothing that is over the top violent or graphic. Just a good old whodunnit with a main character who is sympathethic and yet totally low key. I enjoyed it, perhaps because the writer didn't need to creat any cheap thrills to keep my attention. It was sort of like a Jessica Fletcher except without the old lady, or B actors or cheesy scripts. Ok maybe Murder She Wrote is a bad example. I loved the simplicity of it.

Shortly thereafter, Preston drops dead, in Quint's presence, from a poisoned vitamin pill. Quint decided to continue the hunt for the note-sender, and hopefully, the killer.Diana, of course, is prime suspect because she's the pretty young wife, of a very rich, older man.

The author seems to have a personal bias against the Houston Police Department and is resentful that Court TV did not cover the trial in Michigan the way he thought they should. No information is given about Watts's background to indicate why he might have become the person he did. Way too many pages are devoted to his \\"confessions\\" in Texas; all are given verbatim and all sound the same. I stuck with it until page 324, then gave up.

After Rockpile disintegrated, Bremner released a disappointing solo effort called Bash -- so unnecessary that the LP was never released in the U.S.Now comes \\"A Good Week's Work\\" -- so name because the CD was purportedly recorded in the course of seven days -- which rekindles the Rockpile flame. The record is filled with Rockpile-esque \\"Pure Pop\\", punctuated by Bremner's solos are very reminiscent of his \\"Seconds of Pleasure\\" work.

She is frightend to love him, if she let's her heart believe in him and love him, will he dissapear, as the curse foretells. So she writes away his freedom when she signs her name to a deed and opens his life anew. The supporting characters were unique and interesting and made you want to know more about them.

Yet I really, really enjoyed Kendrick - a twelfth century ghost with a Jag in the garage (who cares if he can't drive it) and a passion for American football. The first two hundred pages of this book are a delight. Genevieve inherits Kendrick's castle and he goes from trying to scare her to death to falling in love with her. I consider myself a grounded, logical person but I had no problem suspending disbelief for this part of the story.Ironically, it's the next hundred pages when a human problem of Genevieve's becomes the obstacle that I wanted to throw the book across the room. Her \\"problem\\" was beyond believing for me.Still, this has some potential as a keeper simply because Kendrick is one of the most enchanting heroes I've encountered in the last year. He kind of makes you want to have a ghost of your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooooooo Predictable!","review":"The premise of this book was so promising...but it's so predictable and formulaic, I found it almost annoying. The book alternates between the unbelievable - ghosts that hire lawyers, wear jeans and watch football - and the contrived. The romance is heavy-handed and drippy. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this stinker","review":"If you like strong men with a thing for airheads, you'll love this book. I hated it. The heroine is a childish nitwit who runs around in footy pajamas and pigtails, and is terrified by the thought of a gorgeous male making love to her. Imagine! Isn't that what women read romance novels for?? The final straw came when the author deprived her audience of the much-much-awaited love scene by (literally) slamming the door in our faces. Kurland CAN write and shows skill with humor. Too bad she picked a preschooler for a heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childishly and poorly written","review":"Childishly and poorly written, artificial characters, primitive story line.

A few minor dents are acceptable but not cans that must be discarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very informative","review":"I thought finally a biography on Kris Kristofferson. It seems that by watching this dvd, you get more questions than answers. The beginning is okay, they talk about the early days but the documentary lacks early day viewing material. Would of been nice to see Kris perform in the late 60's early 70's. Then they talk about a few of his bigger movies like A star is born and Heaven's gate but no mention of his other great movies like Convoy, Welcome home and Songwriter. There's barely any mention of what he was up to during the late 70's and 80's.I just think that more effort could of been put into this project and treat the fans to something decent. We only get some of the story. Hopefully something better will come along someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wealth of Information But Inconsistent","review":"\\"Elvis Aaron Presley: Revelations from the Memphis Mafia\\" is an interesting and ultimately necessary read for any serious Elvis fan. The revelations dished out by three of Elvis' closest confidants are mostly fresh and revealing; any book on Elvis is bound to rehash some of what's been said before.The problem with \\"Elvis Aaron Presley\\" is that the book is very inconsistent. On one page, a member of the Memphis Mafia says Elvis comes from Jewish ancestry, and on another page, a member of the Mafia talks about Elvis' anti-Semitic remarks. And on one page, a member of the Mafia talks about an event that would be the \\"only time\\" it ever happened to Elvis, and yet later in the book, that same member brings up several other instances of the same event.Ultimately, \\"Elvis Aaron Presley\\" is worthwhile to read for the perspective and bits of new information about Rock & Roll's greatest icon, but it must be read critically and in proper context."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friends?","review":"Of course they would have to come up with loads of crap, put it in a book, and sell it.

For years I wondered why no one helped Elvis. It's clearfrom this book that Elvis' own demons drove him to take drugs and stay with it. Thevillains in this book are not the typical ones mentioned in an Elvis book, such asthe Colonel (although he does get a roasting) but rather Vernon and Priscilla, whoare portrayed as cyphers who cared more about the money than making sure Elvis survived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish it was longer","review":"I've read a lot of Elvis books, but I would say this is one of my faves.

If you like industrial music, you will not be disappointed. Actually, if you're more into techno music, I would recommend this CD for you also.

The book gives an unique peek into the dual lives of Maharanis in their zenanas and the high society of Europe. Must read for subcontinental history buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This fascinating book has many points to recommend it.","review":"The authoress describes a Tantra based approach and philosophy of love and sexuality and provides exercises - the Love Keys of the title - for exploring and opening to these states. The book is refreshingly straightforward, so the reader is supported in a clear understanding. The main lesson is to slow down and move away from urgency; \\"ejaculation at 5 seconds or 30 minutes is still premature\\". There is a strong emphasis on becoming conscious of what works for the individual/s over adherence to rules or rigid formulae, and readers are encouraged to explore the Keys in any order that works for them. There is also a very interesting exposition on energetic polarity and magnetism and how it generally differs between men and women. Everyone can benefit from further education in love and sex and The Love Keys makes an excellent guide for the novice and the experienced alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute MUST!!","review":"The best book I've read on the subject.Written in a clear, concise and very refreshing way, it goes straight to the essence of Tantra.

I am just a regular music fan and simply put, Ghymes bases its music on ancient Hungarian melodies, but play them in a more contemporary way (somewhat similar to Marta Sebestyen's Apocrypha).Where their previous albums are more traditional, Rege is sounding a bit new age perhaps and it definitely fits as world music. Track 2'bazsarozsa' is a haunting melody which will stay with you like the memory of your first love. Track 11'csond/silence' is more experimental, kind of avant guardish, but the more you listen to it you realise that this is what silence is, the rhythm of external sounds blending with your racing thoughts. Track 12 carries some latin rhythm. There is only one song sounding traditional in its full sense, incorporating a womens choir.

Ellen has her own demons to conquer from realising her sexuality to performing her duties as a cop on the heels of a serial killer.

The last work \\"Jubilee\\" is my favorite work of Sowerby. \\"Jubilee\\" evokes a spirit of great joyfullness and Americanism at it's best. I find Robert Parris to be a fairly good performer and interpretor of Sowerby's music.

If you are planning on putting them on a hardwood floor, I'd suggest you remove the little protective \\"buttons\\" on the bottom of each leg and buy better quality ones or perhaps felt so you don't scratch your floors. Unfortunately, I did return the stools because the seats are just too small for extended sitting....they'll be at our home bar and we expect a LOT of extended sitting. :-) I wanted something bigger and more comfy.

The emphasis is on the celebrity, not the poetry. These poems may or may not be worth while, but the fact that Caroline Kennedy uses them as a tribute to her mother (however lovely that sentiment) completely diminishes the poetry as poetry. That Jackie cherished these poems misses the point entirely, for then the only reason to read these poems is to come into contact with Jackie's ghost, not the poetry itself.

The relationship between Daniel and Jolie was exactly the same from the first page until about 2 pages from the end of the book. All at once, Daniel says, \\"oh, I guess I do love you.\\" wa la, it's over. There is sex scene after sex scene, but no emotion, no growing feelings, nothing. There are little story lines here and there that add to the story, but the main plot of 2 people coming together and falling in love is EXTREMELY lacking.Not the worst I've ever read but no where close to being good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"I managed to finish it.....","review":"Daniel's Bride had so much potential but it had too many flaws. Jolie keeps forgiving Daniel- I wanted to pinch her every time she allowed Daniel to ignore her or say cruel things to her and then she'd forgive him and they would have supposedly great sex. Come on. Instead of having empathy for Daniel, I found him very shallow. There are stubborn characters and then there are annoying ones.And what about Nan's story...OK, I won't go into that.I honestly don't know how I made it to the end of the book. I guess I was just hoping it would get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"What a waste of a good storyline. The characters had no personality and were plain annoying.

This is too confusing; it's like trying to be a detective while you learn to speak Italian. They use no English, and expect you to understand the words from context. I understood about 60 percent of it, and the rest I repeated like a parrot, while following it up, under my breath, with a frustrated, \\"Whatever that means!\\" I've picked out bits and pieces from the dictionary, etc., but why should I have to hunt them down?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good starting point for basic learning","review":"This is a very worthwhile course for basic communication in Italian. It's not a course designed for short-term needs or for advanced vocabulary and grammer, but it does invite the user to use his/her immagination in learning more than other courses. I think this makes for a more active learning experience rather than having every little detail spoon fed to you. This course teaches to think in a new language instead of going through translations so this might make it difficult if you have zero knowledge of Italian vocabulary, but as it progresses u really do get a feel for how the language works. Even though no English is used, the initial \\"scenes\\" (what is used instead of lessons) are very simply presented and is not difficult at all to follow. Once you go through the course and master the simple vocabulary well enough, you can use these tapes in the car with no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's enough to make you want to give up on the language","review":"Though the book might be factually correct, a good program also needs to hold the readers' interest. The book itself is black and white, the dialogue stale and unmoving, and there is very little opportunity for listener/speaker interaction. I also speak German and French, and the best way I learn is by incorporating four basic points: listening, reading, speaking and culture. The book offers the first two, but is nearly devoid in the last. I can't imagine using the majority of the conversations in real life. I gave up after 6 chapters and bought Learn Italian the Fast and Fun Way with the audio CD.

A greater disappointment than the one I experienced when listening to it is not imaginable...That this music incorporates influences from from the Middle East & Africa is total nonsense.True, some tracks begin with oriental flute melodies, but what follows are generic western rythms, primitive , repetitive, boring melodies ,smelling not of either thought or creativity, to speak nothing of oriental elements. But if you are looking for truly intoxicating music with strong vocals and exotic touch, check DEAD CAN DANCE ( Spirit Chaser or Into the Labirinth), and SORMA (The Mirage of the East).Both these groups are more impressing and individual that a million Agricantuses."},{"rating":"2","title":"World Music Tour","review":"This group, Agricantus, hail from Italy, and is very popular in Europe (I read that a number of their works are critically acclaimed). Their music, produced from a combo of traditional, tribal and modern instruments, embraces notes and hues from their native Italy, north and west Africa and Asia.I find this album extremely enjoyable; the selections are absolutely brilliant.

Their song, Spunta Lu Suli, a traditional Sicilian song, is just gorgeous, so I was keen to hear more. This album bears no resemblance to Spunta Lu Suli, and I am very disappointed.

His DVD is possibly the best music dvd of all time. BUT I was a bit disappointed by this CD as much as it has been hyped. LOWDOWN is fantastic. Exactly what I had hoped for. HARBOR LIGHTS - light, delicate, wonderful. A seven minute SIMONE? Delightful. And I'll even give you WE'RE ALL ALONE as well done but here's the problem - it's too much like the original version and that is why the 4 stars, not 5. Especially true on SIERRA and JUST GO - no new ground broken here. I had really looked forward to a new version of JUST GO. It sounds just like the original. Next time, I vote just Boz and an acoustic guitar...well, maybe Monet, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unplugged Boz is \\"The Best\\"","review":"I've always liked Boz Scaggs pretty well, but \\"Fade Into Light\\" is by far his best compilation of music. If you have a high-end audio system, you will hear what I am talking about. This CD/DVD dual-disc is of superb quality. This is the best version of \\"Lowdown\\" that Boz has ever recorded. I wasn't overly fond of Barry White's \\"Love TKO,\\" but I can't get enough of Boz's version. Just sit-back and enjoy this relaxing, high-quality CD. You'll be glad that you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boz never disappoints","review":"I have not heard the enhanced stero side to this combo CD/DVD, but was so pleasantly surprised to hear Boz re-doing and refining some of his past music. The instrumentation and vocals are just splendid, and he always commands the best session men--Ricky Fataar ( a former Beach Boy, if you can believe it), Hutch, Paich, et al totally support Boz's unbelievable voice and styling on every cut. Not a weak one in the bunch. You dazzle me, Boz. And High Sierra just has to be on anyone's list for best written, performed, and produced cuts.

Jim Pettigrew Jr. includes guidelines for many different positions with music publicity. I used this book for an internship in music publishing and I found this book to be very informative. There is a fairly large section on how to create press kits that was very instrumental for any new musician looking to gain publicity. Pettigrew Jr. makes sure to provide information on all aspects of music publicity, including the importance of the press kit jackets to the process of finding a photographer.

A bit poppier than \\"Resigned\\", but much more straight-ahead, with much of the overproduction of Penn's first two cd's winnowed away. Penn's recent appearance in Philly with Aimee Mann was really good, and if you get a chance to see these two, you won't be disappointed. Highlights are \\"Lucky One,\\" \\"Whole Truth,\\" \\"Trampoline,\\"...it's just a great record. One thing I took away from seeing Penn live,as well as his cd's, is how great a guitarist this guy is. His acoustic playing is exemplary, but what really sets him apart is the ability to play short, biting electric leads that not only are totally unembarrasing, but actually add to the melodic translation of the song. Amazing. If instantly memorable, well written Beatlesque pop songs are your cup of tea, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for the Fifth Star","review":"This is Michael Penn's best recording to date. His literacy and pop sensibility is one of the best today. No comparisons, he is himself. He should be congratulated for being a true independent in music. Aimee Mann is his match.Four stars for deficiencies I won't go into here.I just hope he can find the Good News and get out of the cultural downer where his music tends to go. Although, sometimes his songs just tell it in a way that only a great talent can - Lucky One is both funny and serious at the cusp of the Millennium; High Time is truly mature, time to grow up; and Perfect Candidate is unfortunately too true. He can spot the Ship of Fools.This is a genius still on his way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough","review":"I'm a long-time fan of Michael Penn. I loved March and Free For All, but liked Resigned less than the first two. MP4 continues the sad backslide that Resigned started. While it used to be difficult to pick out songs that I didn't like on his albums, unfortunately the situation is reversed now, and I have a hard time picking any song that stands out on MP4. A lot of these songs seem like weaker imitations of previous songs. For example, \\"High Time\\" seems to shamelessly steal part of its melody from \\"Try\\" on Resigned. MP4 suffers from tens of other little nagging similarities. On top of that, nothing on MP4 really rocks. There is no energy in any of the songs - no strained vocals, no compelling guitar solos, no driving drum beats, and the words just aren't clever enough to make up for the weak music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watered down and bland","review":"Where's the hooks?Michael Penn is a gifted songwriter/musician and this album is the low point of his career.It has an VH1 mediocrity to it.There's two good songs on the album.Thankfully Michael rebounds with his superior 2005 album, \\"Mr. Hollywood Jr., 1947\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Edit !","review":"I enjoy Jance's plotlines.

Poor editing, dull writing, and a lack of insightful analysis combine to eliminate this work from my suggested reading list. If it were not for a commitment of mine to finish every book I begin, then I would have stopped slogging through Clark's book around page twenty. My suffering reached its zenith when I read the subtitle he chose for a section, \\"General Howe Funks Out.\\" This subtitle was only slightly worse than, \\"Washington is liked.\\" With subtitles like these I seriously considered breaking my rule of completing every book I read. Nevertheless, the numerous passages Clark quotes from Washington's papers and diary entries give the book some merit; Washington himself could redeem the worst of books. But, why wade through Harrison's tiresome prose when you could simply read George Washington's diaries and gain all the merit while losing all the dross?"},{"rating":"1","title":"woman seeking a better book on George Washington!","review":"I found this author to be a very cumbersome writer. He delivers a lot of great information, but often in a scattered, non grammatically correct format.

When it is storming outside and all the lights in the bedroom are off while a lone candle is lit and burning across the room, turn this CD on, pull your lover close, breathe deeply and close your eyes: you'll experience the eternal in a timeless moment.It really is that good.Every track moves with a rugged and tender beauty, largely due to Tillman's rustic cello as Wheater's flute dances and soars above it. At times they are like two complementary yet dynamic forces creating the beauty of the song through their (always positive) tension with each other. Hoppe's composing is absolutely fantastic, always giving the necessary bed of orchestration for Tillman and Wheater to dance their dance.If it is true that beauty leads one to contemplate the eternal, then this CD will lead you and your lover to a banquet for the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow with a Native American Flavor","review":"This is a wonderful CD from Hearts of Space. The cello work is reminiscent of David Darling, and the flute work by Tim Wheater is excellent. This is VERY mellow in the HOS tradition, but also melodic and a bit on the melancholy side. I produce a late night radio show in Alaska, and this will fit right in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful Music","review":"Very stirring emotionally, don't be depressed while listening, although it could be very inspirational and moving. Hoppe brings new meaning to 'soul' music.Well written music and performed excellently."},{"rating":"1","title":"too short a sample to evaluate","review":"Sample of recording is too short to evaluate cd for purchasing.

At the mall I can get a good sample of the whole cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful, soothing music.","review":"As a massage therapist, I am always looking for new and different types of music that can bring my clients to that space of rest, relaxation or just escape. This CD really helps to do that. The music evokes a sense of well-being somehow (I don't know how they do it!) and I've listened to it over and over! I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply exquisite","review":"Okay, I'll admit that I just ordered this CD, only having heard it yesterday in it's entirety. My massage therapist chose this as background for our session; her musical taste is every bit as praiseworthy as her professional ability. As the knots of tension were skilfully kneaded loose I became aware of the sheer loveliness produced by combining the artistry of the cello (one of my favorite instruments) with a haunting flute soloist...an unusual combination to my ears, but somehow so perfect. I prefer old jazz, am not much into ambient or 'new age' music, and all flute and cello works I own are strictly classical, yet I knew right then I HAD to have this in my collection. Sinking into the lush yet spare phrasing to unwind at day's end will be like having the actual benefits of another massage between appointments. Relaxing, mind-quieting, soothing, refreshing. It would be great background for yoga, quiet time by yourself, or with your loved one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutting through all thoughts","review":"I thought I heard about everything in New Age, but this is really breathtaking right away from the opening at the dramatic Fifth interval, immediately cutting through all thoughts - calling, begging really, for its (well-deserved) attention.

Maenschen-Helfen, \\"The World of the Huns: Studies in Their History and Culture\\" remains one of the definitive treatments of its topic. Like other classic studies of Roman-empire topics published in the 1970s, such as G. Alföldy's volume on the province of Noricum, it pays proper attention to the growing archaeological data while, at the same time, remaining devoted primarily to the close analysis of the ancient written sources. Studies of this kind are, therefore, invaluable as baselines against which to evaluate more recent works that are more heavily reliant on archaeological material, anthropological theory, and deconstructionist approaches.I was very pleased to be able to acquire this item in near-perfect condition at a very low price. Judging by the long list of offerings that I saw when I ordered my copy, many other copies in similar condition at similar prices are available, if anyone is interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of demonstration, not useful for beginners","review":"The first third of this is a useful intro to the instrument, covering the basics of how to hold the pick and so on. But when it comes to the songs its just a run through at speed, not broken down in a way that helps you learn. If you're an intermediate to advanced and want to see how somebody else plays these song it might be useful, but beginners will just be frustrated by the speed. It takes most people a while to get to that level, and if you're already there you probably don't need the first half of this video that tells you how to hold the instrument, so its really not a good value for the money. Try either the Casey or Cochran videos instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth....from The Truth","review":"Satzine is correct in his review ON THE VHS example, up to a very limited point, which actually makes Satzine completely incorrect.If he had bothered to really review this entire program he would have realized that the booklet, which, I understand, is included with the purchase of the VHS tape and is, also, in the DVD subdirectory \\\\Extras\\\\TAB is all ANY beginner needs to learn the beginning steps to playing mandolin.Like most of Huckabees tapes and DVD's it is quite good at teaching a willing student...even one that feels limited in their abilities.

I like having my DS with me as often as possible, so naturally I carry it around in my purse. But as my game collection grew, I couldn't just keep all my games with me in their normal cases in my purse, and I didn't want a bigger purse. So for a while I was just keeping 3 games with me at a time, which led to me thinking \\"aw man, I wish I had ________ with me right now...\\" But there just wasn't room.So I started looking around at my storage options, and was disappointed until I saw these. It's really the only compact storage solution I found, and they're amazing. I haven't noticed them rattling, so if they do it's minimal. They're pretty solid, protect my games, and most importantly they're small so I can have my games with me at all times, and now switching between any of them isn't a hassle. And my purse is no longer an overcrowded pit of despair. So yayyy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"These cases are fantastic.

In the 19th century -- and even in the first half of the 20th century -- its beauty made it a favorite in Germany and reasonably popular in the U.S. Unfortunately, the old-fashioned romance of its plot has caused Martha to fall out of favor in these unromantic times. But the melodic beauty of Martha is as appealing now as it ever was if you will listen to it without bias. I love this beautiful opera and I think you may too. This version is the only one currently abvailable, to the best of my knowledge. It is a re-release on CDs of a performance from the 1940s (hence the four stars for this five-star opera). But the remastering is quite acceptable -- and the opera is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Energon Perceptor","review":"This set plaes in conparison to the old one.

This hope embraces the pain and loss that he sees daily and allows him to continue to minister effectively. Immersed in classical Catholic mysticism and spirituality since his seminary days, I love his phrase: \\"One must be a contemplative to work in the inner-city.\\" This is a great book about committing to a difficult place for the long haul.

What Ferro does seem to concentrate on is Nicholas's political life--particularly its failures.

It surmises that the Revoution was inevitable due to the actions of the ruling Tsar - WRONG. The Revolution occurred because of Lenin and WWI. In 1913, Russia's economy was fastest growing in Europe. She had liberalized and was coming into the modern world. Lenin's propaganda railed at military losses when in fact she was successful on 3 of the 4 fronts where she was engaged.The section headings, \\"Rule by Rasputin\\", \\"Nicholas rejects the Russians\\", etc says a lot about the historicity of this work.

While Nicholas was certainly ill prepared for his role and was thus unable to be an effective ruler, I certainly believe that he was a good man fulfilling a duty he certainly never wanted according to the teachings he had been brought up on as we'll as his own beliefs regarding absolute monarchies.

NII's greatest failing was not liberalizing in time in WWI but Russia, and the world, did not deserve the incredible evil that replaced him.

Nothing terribly new. One major problem though. Page 27 says that Nicholas didn't want to marry Alexandra, but his parents wanted him to marry her. From Nicholas' own diaries we know this to be untrue. A (somewhat) redeeming quality is that it's the only book (besides the letters of Nicholas and his mother, Marie) that I have been able to find out anything about the Greek/Turkish conflict in.

There was no biographical facts - it's all stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not trust Chapmans Books","review":"I ordered this product from Chapmans Books in Derry, New Hampshire and I did not like it so I was allowed to return it.

It's so difficult for me to find romance novels written about this era (late 1800's) that I enjoy, since I usually prefer a Civil War romance with a southern background (rather than Last Chance, Montana). Maybe it's because I could sometimes see a glimpse of Scarlett O'Hara in Rachel McKenna (once teacher, and now, widow), and of course, the notorious Lane Cassidy (gunslinger) could often resemble a Rhett, but I found myself oddly captivated by their story. Landis describes her story as one of \\"two people who learn to love and trust themselves and each other despite the odds and challenges life throws in their way.\\" I agree, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Captivating","review":"This book has to be one of the best books that I have read in a long time, I absolutely loved it right until the end! It kept me captivated until I finished, I didn't put the book down once. The story was refreshing in a sense that it allowed innocence and trust to make you love the characters. I would recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"overly simplified","review":"While I agree with the doctrine described in this book, I find my intelligence insulted by the \\"updating for modern readers\\" performed by the editor.

No more. You might as well buy a two dollar pair of side cutters that have made in China stamped on them, because these are no different. IRWIN tries to mask their Chinese manufacturing by only stamping \\"Made in China\\" on the packaging instead of the tool. When it comes to tools, if it does not have \\"Made in USA\\" or \\"USA\\" stamped on it, then it was not made in USA. A lot of U.S. brands try to hide their overseas manufacturing by simply omitting the manufacturing stamp. I am not anti China. I think Chinese imports have a place in our economy. However, when I am buying and American brand based on its reputation of quality and I find that they have shipped their manufacturing overseas, that is fraud. The name IRWIN is no longer a symbol of quailty. The next time I need a pair of locking pliers, I will not buy IRWIN Vise-Grips. The brand has no value any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"do they need a review?","review":"Diagonal pliers aka wire cutters. They do their job. I've owned several pairs of these over the years. Irwin's hold up well for a long time even with daily use. Mainly use them for coax cable cutting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad bussiness","review":"I\`m really angry because this Irwin cutter it\`s not that (a cutter) actually it\`s a smasher because it smashes the wires but not cut. I already bought 2 but only 1 works as it should be. The one of my partner works fine but mine doesn\`t. It\`s a shame because I\`ve had Irwin products and I\`ve been satisfied with Irwin trademark but now I don\`t know what happend because I feel very bad with the cutter I bought. So I wouldn\`t recomment buying these cutters Irwin, and if you do it let me tell you that it will be like throwing your money into the garbage can. So this seller is not a serious one, and I don\`t send it back from here in Costa Rica bacause it\`s more expensive and I don\`t want to spend more time and money on it.

Shame on them! This is absolutely the BEST Dvorak symphony recordings I've ever heard (and I listened to several before finding these). Excellent recorded sound, too. You can hear every part of the orchestra very clearly. What you have here is an excellent Czech orchestra (the Czech Phil is one of the best orchestras in the world, in my opinion), guided by a Czech conductor performing music of a Czech composer. My only complaint is the 2nd and 5th symphonies are divided between 2 CDs, so you have to change discs between the 2nd and 3rd movements in those two symponies. But with playing, interpretation, and recording quality as good as this, it's acceptable. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great performance, poor sound","review":"I had high hopes for this CD...Václav Neumann and the Czech Philharmonic performing Dvorak, but the poor audio mastering ruins any enjoyment of this disc.

The whole book sounds like he's tremendously thrilled at the idea of shocking his audience, and even if it were shocking that wouldn't be enough to sustain a novel. And for the love of god, will someone tell him that just because they're called 25 cent words doesn't mean that he's paid 25 cents every time he uses one?

It suffers from a fatal flaw, however. To prevent overcharging of a battery, any battery charger will stop charging after a while. This charger measures overcharging by how long it has been plugged into the wall (8 hours). To plug a new device into the charger, you have to unplug it from the wall to use again. Also, this does not stop the charger from overcharging a battery, only from overcharging it for FOREVER.There is are reasons why the Apple charger is more expensive. Only one of those reasons is that Apple demands a brand premium.

Also VERRY handy when smoking meat! i have a bullet water smoker and I can just leave this probe in the meat and that way I don't have to open the lid which looses valuable heat and adds time to the smoking process.I have also used it for candy and had no problem with it reading the high temperatures. even with hard candies that have to reach 300.

These low price connectors do not connect the metal case of the usb port to the chasis ground which leads to the error message that the unit conected to the usb port is drawing to much current and the usb ports is shutting down. Thus this unit does not work for charging or transfering data. If I can figure out the wiring so easily with an ohm meter, why can't the chinese or whoever makes these?

I'm very satisfied with this ring, and would recommend it to anyone who likes dolphins. Gem Avenue always does a great job :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Appropriate for all 9 year olds","review":"My third grader and I read this together as it was on the school's recommended reading list. I did not feel she was ready to read this book given her current level of maturity. The two children in the book are currently living with their father and his live-in girl friend while their parents undergo a divorce that is not yet finalized. At one point the 6 year old in the story is very confused and upset as he overheard the live-in girl friend talking about her positive pregnancy test. The book also deals with gangs and some street violence. As my third grader read this aloud to me, she had several questions that lead to topics of discussion that I would have like to have held off on for another year or so. I saw this as the beginning of desensitizing my child to moral and ethical delimas of the world we now live-in...if they see it or read it enough it becomes common life and no longer has shock value."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad company","review":"i ordered my mermaid ring for my birthday in July and its now october and no ring. they sent to the address i provided and couldn't find it. all of my other orders have gotten here just fine for the past 6 years.i have repeatedly emailed and even found a phone number online and left voice mails....no response. i think they just want your money to send you crappy silver that you might get.. you might not."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The Hell?","review":"I bought this DVD for my homeschooling son, because it said it was for grades kindergarten through eight.

Waldron appeared on a few Embryo recordings in the early 70s. Mal and Christian did a reunion concert for the release of this CD in December 1999. It's well worth hearing if you're interested in Embryo's mnusic or Mal Walrdon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful listening","review":"It's hard to imagine these songs being sung any finer.

So, while out wandering through Christmas shopping up here in the Land of Judy Garland's birth, (Nobody better mess with Judy's Over the Rainbow. Not nobody! Not no how!) I picked up this CD and popped it in the player. Wow! I am in awe! and then along comes their \\"Over the Rainbow.\\" It was so stunningly beautiful, I had to pull off the road until my tears cleared enough to continue the trek home. Judy herself would be proud.It's all good - all the tracs here are excellent. This CD will become a Christmas favourite! /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond awesome!!!","review":"This is one of the most beautiful Christmas CD's I have ever heard--and I am quite a conniseur of Christmas music. Even the Christmas songs that are not my favorites, like White Christmas, are beautiful. They sing each song with so much richness, with their own unique spin that makes it original, yet recognizable. The orchestration, blending of voices, solos, everything comes together so exquisitely, in such a moving way. On a scale of 1-10, I would give this an album a 20. In a world of violence and darkness, this takes you away from it all, into a world of beauty, peace, and joy. Put on the headphones, close your eyes and be prepared for a real treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas music at its best","review":"Fabulous Christmas music.

Although I know several languages, I couldn't understand many of the words. Because \\"Rejoice,\\" which is haunting and lovely, is new to me, I can't understand the words at all.Liner notes would have solved this problem 100%. Please add lyrics!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"Well, Il Divo is not a divo to me any more. Once they sing solos, their voices' weaknesses are so strident that I must move on to the next song, hoping for something better. But it's not to be found: one sings through his nose, another has a vibrato wider than the Grand Canyon, another slides to pitches... The singing style attached to sacred music such as \\"The Holy Night\\" and \\"The Lord's Prayer\\" is most unfitting.Another disappointment is the choice of literature. I was so looking forward to a truly international selection of Christmas music, carols from the singers' homelands, in their original languages. That's what caught my fancy listening to another recording of theirs--the variety of languages, and particularly the beautiful Castilian Spanish, the only true Spanish! But it's not to be found here. Don't waste your money. Go to the Three Tenors or Andrea Bocelli, in stead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Classical Vocal Music fans","review":"If you enjoy classical vocal music, skip this. I have never heard this group before and I don't know their names or voices. The auspicious aspects are that when singing full voice they produce some nice, pleasant and sometimes even stirring, albeit conventional, harmonies and there is one voice that is clearly more polished, sounding baritonal and full and strong and not requiring a close mike as do the others. The unfortunate aspects are the vocal arrangements are all too similar and the second tenor begins most songs as a solo with a very weak, completely unsupported, monotonous, unattractive, soft, insipid, breathy, crooning, microphone-hugging approach that I find so bad it spoils those songs for me and I cannot listen to them or must fast forward through his solos. When the first tenor adds a solo it is woefully thin but with purer tone and so more acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Il Divo - The Christmas Collection","review":"I loved this holiday CD and bought several copies for friends and family.

My disappointment is most of the songs are in Italian and as an English speaking person, a lot was lost not being able to understand the lyrics of the song.

Il Divo capture you from the first notes of \\"O Holy Night\\" and take you on a wonderful journey of both Christmas classics and songs to listen to all year round.

I loved it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe inspiring, tear producing!","review":"Before this album, which I bought on purely a whim, I'd only heard a snippet of one of these guys' other songs, but it was enough for me to know a Christmas album would be smashing. Personally, I prefer when they sing together rather than individually, but this album reduced me to tears within seconds. Sometimes one chord is all it takes to produce a musical climax within me! This one hit that chord-repeatedly. I could do without percussion on Ave Maria, but other than that, this is superb.Reviews I read hadn't mentioned the bonus track, Isabel, which is a variation on Faure's Pavane - I swear this had me involuntarily boo-hooing, which sounds like a bad thing, but it was absolutely cathartic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merry Christmas, oh YES","review":"Rather then complain over the length of a CD, go for quality over quantity.

This one is a DUD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversung","review":"Let me begin by saying I am no music expert. This album is not worth the money, even discounted. These guys need 2 or 3 years more experience in singing together so they can gain a bit more control over their combined voices trying to sing as strong as they can - too strong. This CD would have been much better had they recorded it at a live concert. And, who ever heard of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" on a Christmas album, then the shouted Ave Maria, give me a break. Yes, their singular voices are beautiful, but its like I have to hold my breath while they are . . . singing? . . . shouting, then at times the music is dragging as in \\"A Child Is Born\\". Someone lost control -- too slow -- to much trying to be too great! I guess you can say I am disappointed with this CD and am sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I too am sorry I wasted my money on this CD.

I ordered it through Amazon UK, being such a fan of the first recording, but, OHHH, was I wrong! It is over produced, over orchestrated and overpowers, rather than showcases, the group's voices.

I like Il Divo a lot, I think they have great voices. But this is very lackluster to me- I can't feel any Christmas spirit in this album.

Overall, interesting, but hardly any Christmas spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Acceptable","review":"Il Divo -- the Christmas Collection was a disappointment to me. Frankly, several of the songs sounded like the guys just got together without even rehearsing and said, \\"Let's sing Christmas songs!\\" I expected more of this group so I was disappointed. In my opinion, this CD was just thrown together so the Il Divo could have a Christmas CD and the producers may have hoped that people wouldn't notice. Well, this person did notice.

I poured water from my measuring cups to verify that it was less ounces than stated. So, if you are getting this to fill up two large 16oz mugs, or four small 8oz mugs, don't waste your money.My second complaint is that it's difficult to clean, and there are no way to seperate the parts for thorough cleaning; not to mention the fact that this came with no instructions either!

I started with tea balls when I was a young lass. My teapot collection can now go to the thrift store because this is all I need. Brewing the tea without a basket or a metal strainer makes a strong and flavorful cup of tea. It's easy to clean and refill as the better teas can get another steep or two out of them usually. Now I need to buy this pot for my mother, my children and one for my desk at work. LOVE IT and so does my family is pleasantly surprised too! I first saw this teapot in a comparison of products on America's Test Kitchens. They rated it the best tasting cup of tea and I went online and purchased it straight away. I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever Little Teapot","review":"This teapot was purchased to replace a similar unit that lasted at least 3 years. We would make 3-4 pots/day for more than 300 days/year. The failure of the first was a crack in the lid that make it difficult to keep the lid on; it still made tea.The plastic's heat conductivity is low enuf that there is little cooling during a 4 min. steeping. My trick with most teas is to fill it 1/3 full of hot water then drain quickly to clean the leaves and reduce the bitterness [my daughter likes the strong bitter part]. I can get about 3 pots of tea by using 2 rounded teaspoons of tea and increasing the steeping a bit for each pot.This unit is entirely of plastic with a removable filter that my wife cleans with a toothbrush occasionally. It is fine enuf that none of the finely-ground PGTips comes thru. It seems to be sturdier than the previous unit. It's a 4 1/2 star job which would have gotten 5 stars if it were a bit easier to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Teapot","review":"This is easily the best teapot out there for brewing loose teas.

A bonus is that this works even with narrow-mouth water bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Way to Brew a Cup of Tea","review":"This was seen on a products segment on a national food/cooking TV show and my husband just had to have it! The price was very reasonable and it works like a charm! He took it into the office and enjoys his daily tea with it. It is a bit tricky getting it back together when washed, especially the strainer piece at the bottom but once you do it a few times, no problem! The acrylic is good and sturdy, does not crack or craze with the high temperature of the boiling water for proper brewing, and it makes 2 generous cups of tea. I think that it is a very clever design with excellent functionality and ease of use. We actually ended up with two of these so we can keep one at home. It takes a bit of experimenting to learn what the right amount of tea leaves work best for the ideal cup of tea, but that is also dependent on different teas and your own taste. Two thumbs up for this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally got some tea to use this!","review":"This came pretty soon after I ordered it, though I had to wait for the tea to use it!Finally got to use this for the first time this morning. It is very simple and neat to watch. My first taste was of some plain black tea (Tea Forte Single Steeps Loose Tea Sampler) and it was great. Doesn't leak and super easy to clean. I recommend this for anyone who wants to be stingy with their tea, lol, because it only makes about one large cup. That's fine with me because so far I'm the only one in the house using loose leaf tea. (Though I'm hoping I can hook everyone else so we can get it more often. The place I like to go to get it is 30 minutes away!)Great buy! I can see myself using this everyday!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea with one major flaw...","review":"For the first few months that I had this teapot it worked great.

I used it to make an 8 oz. cup of Rishi Organic White Tea Wild Rose. I added the loose tea to the infuser, added 185 degree water, & steeped for 2 minutes. The tea maker didn't leak on my counter. Next, I placed the infuser on my mug & it drained. The results were perfect. All of the tea stayed in the infuser. There were not any little bits of leaves in the mug of tea at all. I also like the fact that this tea maker is BPA free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"filter screen lifts up when the hot water is added","review":"I love the concept but am disappointed every time I use it because unless you hold the filter screen down with your finger while adding the hot water, it will lift up, your loose tea will get underneath and clog up the process of the liquid draining and loose tea will get into your cup. I have stopped using it because I have to dump the hot water with the tea into something else to strain it. My Mom has one of these tea steepers made by Teavana, and I should have ordered one like hers but I bought this one because it was cheaper. Big mistake! PAY A FEW DOLLARS MORE YOU WILL BE FAR AHEAD IN THE LONG RUN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"12 oz Ingenuitea Teapot","review":"This turns out to be a terrific way to brew loose tea. Infusers don't allow tea leaves to expand fully and yield a weak, feeble liquor. The Ingenuitea allows almost as much expansion as a clay pot, and does a pretty good job of preserving heat. The latter is important because some black teas really require it to develop full flavor. This pot does lose some heat and stirring the leaves helps diffuse the liquor (something you don't usually have to do with a ceramic pot or clay pot). Because of the heat loss you need to brew for whatever the full recommended time is for your tea type. Cleanup is pretty easy, although at one point the screen at the bottom of the pot came loose under running water (it was easy to re-install, however). The manufacturer says the pot is dishwasher safe, but I haven't tried that (rinsing and leaving some residue on the sides seems to enhance flavor)."},{"rating":"2","title":"tea time","review":"Amazing for winter especially which is the time for cold and flu when you do some herbal tea to avoid leaves and remainings this is a perfect ergonomic product, I bought for my mom also instead of my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this little teapot.","review":"Some places show some sort of base that you set it on, but this one doesn't have that... Also, the lid is just closed by gravity, there is no latch or snugness to the fit, so you might set something on top of your teapot while it's brewing if you want to make sure it's closed.I don't seem to see a way to remove filter, but it hasn't been a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best teapot ever!","review":"A fellow tea-drinking friend of mine recommended this teapot to me & after slacking for a few months, I finally got around to ordering one. I love this thing so much that one week later, I ordered another one to use at work. It is so simple to use. Put hot water in with about 3 tsp. tea (depending on the type of tea), 2-3 minutes later (again, depending on your tea) put this on top of your cup and the tea drains down into the cup. Done! One thing to note is that a 'normal' size teacup is less than 16 oz. I've found that with mine, filling just below the Ingenuitea logo is just right.

The first one ordered came with just the tea pot but the second one came with a nice plastic plate to keep it from dripping on counters, etc. When I contacted the company because the first one was missing the plate they promptly told me that they no longer sold the pots with the plates, yet I got the plate with the second one I ordered.

It is exactly what you need in a dorm/travel situation, and having two at home makes for ease with the dishwasher. In addition, this allows (requires) the use of truly \\"loose\\" tea, a product whose taste will be a revelation to those who have subsisted on tea bags over the years.

My wife's has a screen on the bottom to filter out the leaves. This one does not.Here's the problem. I like to use it for green and oolong teas, teas that I can re-steep a couple of times. This teapot works great for these types of teas, at least the first brew. For the second or subsequent brews, a leaf can get stuck in the bottom drain hole. When it does, the tea will leak slowly out the bottom during steeping. The teapot with the screen does not have this problem because the screen blocks the leaves from blocking the drain hole.Otherwise, the drain hole does keep the leaves out of your mug. For a once off brew, like with black tea, this will work just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, good size","review":"Big enough to make a tall glass of iced tea if you want.

That's how it should be!\\"","review":"I got a pot of tea at a cafe recently and they served it up in an Ingenuitea. Within about 5 seconds, I realized this was the perfect way to make tea - or coffee, actually, and that this is how tea should be made.

Ingenious, indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect way to brew tea","review":"I just purchased one of these after using a friend's, and I love it. This is the perfect way to make loose leaf tea for one. Unlike with tea balls or spoon-size infusers, the leaves have plenty of room to unfurl as the tea steeps and there's no clasp to come undone. Unlike with basket infusers, there's no dripping or mess when it's time to remove the leaves. You simply get perfectly brewed tea with no mess every time. I can't recommend this enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for making tea at the end of the world","review":"This was the last item I received from Amazon before the dead walked the earth...

For those who have never experienced the flavor of loose leaf teas, you don't know what you're missing! The only problem I have is making that second cup of tea by reusing the same tea leaves. The leaves have a tendency to get stuck in the valve on the bottom and I occasionally have come back to dispense my tea into a cup and have found my tea all over my countertop! I have found that as long as I don't reuse the tea leaves, this product is perfect!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Tea Infuser","review":"I adore tea so after my second ceramic teapot broke, I was in dyer need of another teapot. I remembered seeing a local restaurant use the Adagio infuser to serve iced tea orders which I loved and thought I might try to find it online. Not wanting to spend more than $50 (which is what you usually have to spend to get a decent ceramic teapot) this was THE PERFECT solution. I drink tea almost every morning and I am very very picky about my tea (no tea bags only loose leaf!), and you would think that the plastic might somehow result in a lower quality brew, but that is definitely not the case with this product. The ingenuitea is indeed ingenious. It makes the perfect cup of tea, is easy to clean, it is transparent so you can steep those beautiful blooming flower teas, AND I don't have to worry about breaking it! I got the 32 oz. which is great if you have company (or want a pitcher of iced tea). It makes about 4-5 cups. Best $22 I ever spent!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic gadget for any tea fan!","review":"What a FANTASTIC little device! My boyfriend has something similar at his office, and after many months of looking at the product online, I finally bought it for myself. Boy am I glad I did! It is so simple to use, I just put my tea leaves in, add some hot water, let it sit for a few minutes, place it on my cup and viola, perfect tea without the hassle! I was worried about it leaking water/tea out of the bottom, and it doesn't. Sometimes it isn't the easiest to remove the old tea leaves (if I'm not reusing them), but I found out if I put a little bit of water in the tea pot, I can dump it out and it is once again clean without having to dig my hands in or bang it on the side of my trash can multiple times.

We took it apart and inspected it. There were no visible defects or damage to any of the parts. After putting it back together, it still leaks.

Add your tea leaves, add your water, and when you are ready put it on your mug or cup and the release valve empties the tea quickly. Your leaves are then ready for their next infusion! Repeat as often as your tea can hold up. Clean up is relative easy because the lid wisely detaches allowing for a thorough rinse out. Another great advantage and entertainment option is not see your tea leaves hydrating and expanding. This visualize feedback also helps to tailor the dose of the leaves to your particular taste. This is the greatest tea maker, ever.

Somehow it keeps the water hot and it fits almost all the cups I have (and I have a lot of different ones.)The only short coming is that1. The lid is attached and can not be removed during washing, which makes it a pain trying to make dry after washing, or let it sit upside down to air dry2. The bottom where the liquid is poured from, is also hard to clean. Therefore, after about 2 months of use, the dripper on the bottom looks darker, due to the tea coloring.Other than the two above mentioned issues, the product is great and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good times","review":"For a while I used a tea ball for loose teas, but you always ended up with a bit of sediment which took a bit away from the tea. At some point, however, my tea ball had gone walk about and for Christmas my girlfriend bought be a whole tin of Piccadilly tea, so I was upset since I couldn't properly drink it. For a bit, I used coffee filters and stuffed a teaspoon or so of leaves into it, but the tea basically just tasted like bagged tea when I did that, which simply would not do.So I was looking around for new tea balls, when I recalled that my partner had said we needed to get a teapot sometime. So I was looking around on Amazon and recalled that a friend had bought one of these a bit ago and was raving to me about it. I decided to order it and am quite well pleased with it.

Also, it won't easily fit in the dishwasher or drainer.- Tea leaves get caught in handle and hinge.- It's made out of plastic--yes, BPA-free plastic but plastic nonetheless.- Doesn't fit larger mugs. Work-around is to hold it over the mug and press the bottom of the Ingenuitea with the end of a spoon.- Not sure how this is any better than my ceramic infuser cup that cost $10 and has none of the above issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Tea OR Coffee","review":"I've used off and on for years (same one).

My favorite part about this product is that I get to see the water transition from clear to tea and even use the color of the liquid to gauge whether my brew is ready or not. I love the way this product works. The only thing is that once your tea is done brewing, you need to empty it all out of the Ingenuitea, otherwise the leaves will just keep on steeping. There are simpler ways to do what this product does, but none so elegant and visual.If you're worried about drippage (as I kind of was), there really isn't a problem with that, just make sure not to touch the release valve before you're ready for it to release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Everything About This","review":"Title says it all. This little teapot has been so much fun and so easy to use. I only drink a cup or two at a time of tea anyways, and I've only recently started using loose tea.

When you set it on a cup (I have tried several different sizes and it works on all of them) it opens up at the bottom and drips into the cup at a pretty good speed. Doesn't drop excessively when you lift it off, either. And it is really easy to rinse and clean - nothing gets caught in the mesh.

Two minor flaws: Its cover only flips up to vertical (does not flip all the way over). This makes it difficult for me to get the leaves out into my countertop compost bin instead of rinsing them into the sink (which is easy to do). Also, it is hard to see how much tea has poured into the cup; you have to keep lifting it up to check to avoid overflow, because the steam obscures the view into the cup even though it is see-through on the bottom. I think slightly larger \\"vent\\" holes would have helped on that count.And, FYI, when you get this \\"larger\\" one, it says \\"Iced Ingenuitea\\" on the packaging, which worried me until I realized it is just the same (except bigger) and that is just for marketing.

With this, i can add my tea, brew it and keep the leaves inside the pot for a second brew.The only problem that i have had is that the Jasmine Tea i like is long and stringy.

The filter then expand and stays. I don't want to have to add steps to compensate for their design/manufacturing mistakes.I now wedge it in tightly with a strip of tea bag (bought the roll your own tea bag assortment) That works, but again. Shouldn't happen.There is a competing product with a large, wide bowl. I would try that one instead. Another advantage, the wider bowl will allow you to load the filter more easily.

The 'epic' film, by definition, requires a huge canvas, and \\"The Alamo\\" is monumental, visually; Tiomkin gives a musical grandeur to the movie, as well as providing a very necessary 'pace', essential for a long narrative.\\"The Alamo (Soundtrack)\\" is classic in the very best sense of the word, with Tiomkin at the peak of his skills; if you love film music that can lift you, each time you listen to it, look no further!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dlm","review":"The cup and saucer I received did not match the picture.

While there is unquestionably a lot of golf lingo in the book, I either asked people in the know what the terms meant, or I let the words just fly over my head and focused on the general storyline instead.

The movie wants to simplify and drive home a message from the Bible. You might want to watch it first, since it talks of being martyred. Children will come away with a sense of appreciation of the great sacrifices people in the past have made for Christianity.Then it's turned on the modern boys' experiences of persecution--how it's so much less-- and how modern Christians need to stand up for their beliefs in their own type of experiences.I gave it 4 stars for \\"heart\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never be ashamed of the Gospel!","review":"This movie shows how, in this evil fallen world, Christians are ridiculed and abused for their faith.Stephen, the main character, is a little boy mocked by his classmates for being a Christian.After a dream, where he saw the persecution of great men of faith such as Stephen and William Tyndale, his faith was strengthened.The movie makes me reflect how it is important to proclaim the gospel in every hostile circustamce and teach children not to be ashamed of the gospel.Some scenes may be a bit disturbing for little children, so I would suggest parents to watch this movie with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE SAME","review":"I purchased these dental chews from my Vet for years and he highly recommended them.

There might be 100 people in the audience and the maker of the video spent more time walking around and filming dancing children, interviewing forgetful hippies, and generally ignoring the performers.

First of all, the match was to be Triple H vs. Steve Austin for the WWF Championship, but Austin did not want to drop the belt to Triple H. I felt that this was a selfish move. So, to resolve this little crisis, WWF's creative team threw Mick Foley into the mix because of his and Austin's backstage friendship.

It was an instrumental number called \\"midnight Drag\\". That song prompted me to take a chance on this album and I was surprised at how good this album is. The style is Chicago blues, with an emphasis on the shuffle. Sam is one of the few singing blues drummers around, and he has been playing since the 50's. He really works the shuffle well, and is backed by very tight band. The lead guitar work of Larry Burton is outstanding, and the keyboards played by Celia Ann Price are equally good. There is a good variety of tunes, from the classic chicago style opening number to the raucous \\"Rush Hour Blues\\", and ending with the jazzier instrumental \\"midnight drag\\". If you enjoy the blues this is one quality album worth getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Release","review":"Back in the \`60s, Sam Lay was the drummer in the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. These days, he has his own aggregation, for which he drums and sings. Judging from this recording, however, these guys seem to be just going through the motions. The music sounds formulaic (this can often happen with the blues genre, but this is a fairly glaring example), Lay's voice does not seem very expressive, and even his drumming does not seem particularly noteworthy. Maybe these guys put on a good live show, but blues fans will probably want to pass on this recording. Even the sound quality is a letdown--OK but nothing special. Overall, then, this recording is quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"KRAFTWERK 12\\" LP Records","review":"Superb !! in every means..Excellent sound quality which will defenitely beat CD audio and best packaging.

I took him to small claims court, won my case, and recovered a decent amount of the money I had paid him. My recommendation would be to avoid working with David Wexler.

I suspect that the sizing on this product simply runs smaller than one would think. I returned the item, asking for a larger size in exchange, but instead was notified that this was a return and the charge was removed from my credit card. I'm not unhappy about that; I can look for a cami somewhere else, but the experience was somewhat odd. The item looked OK. Of course I have no idea how it would wear. If it looks like something you would like, I would caution you to order a size up.Cuddl Duds Square Neck Camisole"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting biography","review":"Very interesting with plenty of background military history. A little sparse in the area of General Van Fleet the man - but lots of information on his military exploits and leadership. Unlike other famous and successful WW2 leaders, Van Fleet's career has been a bit overlooked by biographers.Like most comparable books, the maps are poor. They are largely reproduced from official, contemporary, U.S. Army documents. They are too small and many of the locations referred to in the text are not shown on the corresponding maps. Some have no scale key. Why can't publishers or authors arrange for better maps, specifically designed to illustrate what the book's text describes?The photos are fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the personal touch?","review":"The autor writes too much about the research subjects.

It is not easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story, great characters","review":"historically interesting story of the cotton industry in a part of the UK, great complex characters that evolve. loved it felt very merchant-ivory to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true to book!","review":"If I hadn't recently read the book the movie might seem great. After reading the book I was very disappointed in the movie. Neither Mr. Thornton or Margaret are so haughty as portrayed in the movie but they are quietly strong willed in their own ways. It's the subtlety that causes you to like them both and ache for Mr. Thornton as he keeps trying to win Margaret's favor. Also, Mr. Thornton, his mother, and sister all have differing accents in the movie. Weird. Read the book! It's one of Elizabeth Gaskell's best works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably Romantic","review":"This is so wonderfully romantic. I am a huge P&P fan, but Richard Armitage knocked me right off my Darcy obsession...at least for awhile!!! This is my favorite movie of all time. Bar none."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"I bought this movie sight unseen which is something I never do but I had read so many glowing reviews, at more than one site, so I took a chance. It's the best movie I've seen since the 1995 version of Pride & Prejudice. Richard Armitage gave the best performance I've had the priviledge of seeing as Mr. Thornton though all the performances were wonderful. I enjoyed all the scenes Thornton had with his mother as well as the union leader, Higgins, but it is his love of Margaret Hale that drives the story. The last scene is the most romantic scene I've ever seen on film. I highly recommend this movie - you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couln't have been better","review":"A must see!!

I love period piece movies and this one is now on my list of faves. The story line and the love story walk hand-in-hand through this great movie. You are taken into the turmoils of early industrial pitfalls, but the development of the characters and their individual stories is what makes this movie so enjoyable. It is a keeper and one to watch over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Darcy has a rival!","review":"I'm shocked to say that Richard Armitage's Mr. Thornton has knocked Mr. Darcy off that #1 fictional man spot in my heart. Mr. Thornton is a bit more rugged, and you get to have the pleasure of seeing how deeply he feels things. Mr. Darcy was so much more reserved. We have another bona fide sex god to enjoy. Thank you BBC!If you loved Pride & Prejudice, treat yourself to another wonderful romance. Even if no one can touch Darcy in your heart, here's someone who will give him a run for his money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word - AMAZING!","review":"If you haven't already purchased this DVD and are still thinking about it, DO IT! For years, I thought that Pride & Prejudice was the best period drama ever produced but that was until I watched North & South. Words can't described how much I enjoyed watching this film. It's well worth every penny you spend on it and it may just replace your copy of P&P on your shelf, or at least sit nicely next to it! :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"I was expecting this to be a sappy chick flick. It was better in some ways, and much worse in others.What it lacked in vapid emotionalistic romance, it made up in a heroine who is horribly self-centered, feministic and manipulative, a story in which the heroine doesn't take responsibility for her questionable actions, has a very egocentric morality and behaves reprehensibly, lying to police investigators, luring a mutinous brother to town which causes the death of a man, insulting her apostate father's successor at his vicarage, stringing along an obviously still-smitten former suitor while it suits her needs.Add to this the BBC's relentless socialist touches to the film, sloppy modern additions like the ridiculous kissing scene in the train station, and cardboard characters on par with the later Star Wars movies, and you have a real mess.There's much, much more to dislike. Don't waste your time.Just wretched."},{"rating":"2","title":"North & South","review":"One of the best \\"costume dramas\\" I've seen. The entire acting ensemble is first rate. Richard Armitage, the male lead, is swoon-worthy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves more than 5 stars","review":"I bought North and South based on the description of the product and the customer reviews. It surpassed my expectations as it is an excellent production. The music, the scenery, the actors, everything was fantastic. I love period pieces and this one is the best I have ever seen. I especially enjoyed the interaction between the Higgins (Nicholas, Bessy and Mary) with Margaret Hale; and of course the tension between John Thornton and Margaret Hale. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell","review":"It was far beyond my expectations. A movie of top quality.

I even got my husband to watch it and he thoroughly enjoyed it too. Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutelly Fantastic Miniseries!!!","review":"I happened to catch this miniseries on BBC while channel surfing one day. I didn't even catch it from the beginning and I was still hooked. It has a way of sucking you in and you just don't want it to end. The acting, script, and cinematography are superb. Each character is engaging and you can't help but be swept away in their lives. I especially liked the romantic conflict between Margaret Hale and John Thornton. A bad first impression and subsequent misunderstandings keep these two main characters apart for most of the movie, but secretly longing for one another. It just pulls at your heart and you can't wait for them to get together at the end. And the ending is so sweet and perfectly fitting to close out a fantastic miniseries. A great movie that I would highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please support this beautiful movie","review":"This is my first time writing about a movie because I wanted to let others know what a wonderful, clean and moving movie this is. I have been a fan of Elizabeth Gaskell since seeing \\"Wives and Daughters.\\" I always thought \\"North and South\\" would make a great movie and am so pleased with this version of it. The movie is magically filmed and composed to transport you along with the characters to this strange, new textile town in the north of England. Just as I love Jane Austen for her witty dialogues, I enjoy Gaskell for her deep, well-developed characters. All the characters in this movie have a depth to them to create a realistic, complex story. I enjoy watching this over and over as I have \\"P&P;\\" and \\"Wives and Daughters.\\"This movie is fun, sad, informative, clean and downright fabulous! Please see this movie, tell your friends, and support such family-friendly films."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite miniseries","review":"I can't find the words to express how wonderful this production is. It's truly truly beautiful. Not since the Ehle/Firth version of Pride and Prejudice have I been so in love with a story. If you adore Lizzy and Mr. Darcy you will adore Margaret and Mr. Thorton. Their relationship begins with much dislike and misunderstanding which of course leads to a deep and soulful love. The ups and downs we experience in watching these 2 characters is wonderful. And the ending is...MAGICAL. Oh so romantic. I can't recommend this movie enough. For you period piece romance lovers--this movie will be at the top of your list."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top 5 period dramas","review":"Great adaptation of the Gaskell novel. Very interesting romantic leads and a great window into the class differences of the time. Margaret Hale is a wonderful protagonist. Wonderful production value, acting, and scoring.

The love story was just so beautiful as well. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me breathless","review":"I have been struggling to find words to describe my reaction to this DVD. Everything I've come up with so far has sounded trite and cliche. So, instead of gushing about it - as I could easily do, I'll keep it simple. I found the story powerful and, at times, haunting. The acting was superb. The overall cinematography was stunning. And Richard Armitage was perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great social comment","review":"North & South is a remarkable social commentary on the lives of people in a dark period of England's history. What makes the series even more intense is the sexual tension between the two leading characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right up there with BBC's Pride & Prejudice!","review":"I've been a longtime fan of BBC's Pride and Prejudice (with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle), and very few movie adaptations of classics rate higher than a 3 for me. But this was an exeption. I love this book, and when I found there was a movie version, I immediately rented it. I watched it and was captivated. They stayed true to the heart of the book and its characters. I fell in love and bought it right away. I highly recommend it to other fans of classic historic fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie!","review":"I can't believe I missed this movie when it first came out, but on the up-side it was a wonderful recent find for me.

I would advise every American not to purchase this DVD as it will only play in Region 2, which means it will not play in Region 1 - The United States of America. How ridiculous is that.

I would highly recommend not buying this product unless you live in the UK or Australia which is \\"Region 2.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"I am a huge fan of British historical dramas and was disappointed. I read a few reviews that compared it to Pride & Prejudice -and how that our male hero Mr. Thornton was akin to Mr. Darcy.

This is my favorite series/movie OF ALL TIME, and that's saying a lot since I am a movie fanatic. How have I never heard of this until now?? Only found it by chance as a \\"you might also like\\" link from another DVD. I am officially obsessed. I went back and read the book which helps flesh out the characters tremendously, too. And RICHARD ARMITAGE - OMG, where's he BEEN all this time?? Just a beautiful love story about two very different people learning to appreciate and value one another's good qualities and placing loyalty, devotion and shared ideals above concerns about money or the opinions of others. I wanted it to go on forever... That's all, just love, love, LOVE it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best period dramas by BBC","review":"I loved everything about it and the actors are brilliant.

It's one of the best BBC novel adaptations out there!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"On recommendation of my daughter I purchased this film. It is something akin to Pride and Prejudice. It jumps right into the soup of life with the characters and situations surrounding them. The acting is superb, setting you up to dislike the \\"villan\\" in the beginning...and then warming to them. The heartwrenching nature of living life like a slave in textile mills was brought home by getting to \\"know\\" them.It was long enough to become fully engaged in story and characters lives. By the end I knew I need to watch the ending a second time. It is a new family favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best bonnet film out there","review":"Great performance of all the actors involved. My wife and I love watching it together.

I just love the pace of this miniseries! Sure the ending is a little rushed. I wish there was more. More talk/explanation and of course I did feel sorry for Henry, but AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!! So good. I love Thorton. Sure he was a total ass in the beginning. And he's quite the \\"Master\\" snob, BUT he was good. He had reasons, a bit violent, but yeah... I wished there was more Margaret and Thorton scenes though. But the little glances are so cute. Love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome!","review":"The story line was very captivating and the characters were well developed. All of the acting was excellent; it included action, suspense, and romance in one. My husband and I loved it, especially the ending. A must see.

Although, my husband and I watched three in one night;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth owning","review":"I rented this movie, and when I finished watching it I went to Amazon and bought it.

The cast was awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, absolutely GREAT miniseries!","review":"You can hardly do better! A total must for period drama and literature lovers.

The last few minutes are some of the best in cinematic history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic!!!","review":"Captured the problems of industry and labor while throwing in a real romance in the style of wonderful Jane Austen. I especially appreciated the fact that the author took into account the fact that a true lasting love has to have two partners and friends to form a lasting relationship. Whenever I read/watch a story now, I want to believe that the two characters are looking beyond the \\"love\\" of the moment and thinking about what it would mean to spend every day \\"living\\", working, playing, being silent, and loving just one person for the rest of their lives. I replayed the ending several times. I was touched by the simple gesture of her finally taking his hand and holding it in her own - now that is true romance. A simple, gentle touch that says so much while so simple; if only other film makers could realize the power of a sweet gesture!Of course, the acting was wonderful and the casting perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the North & South meet","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of Gaskell's North and South.

This classic period movie has great cinematography and the actors surpassed my expectations!

(I have not yet read the book, but have it on reserve at the library) I liked that it had some strong, intelligent (though not perfect) female characters. Almost all of the characters are developed enough that I understood what drove them. I could also see a visible evolution of several characters throughout the movie as they were exposed to new people, cultures and ways of thinking.I thought it portrayed fairly both sides of the workers and masters of the mills of the time. I felt the awful struggle of the poor workers as well as the varying attitudes of the masters.I appreciated that the movie was clean, yet had enough \\"chemistry\\" going on to keep the romance lover part of me hoping for a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as they get...","review":"As an avid fan of the Jane Austens and other similar period pieces, I bought this without much knowledge of the book or the movie.

I've since read Gaskell's book and although there are changes, the movie is very faithful to the spirit of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST EVER, YET!","review":"The best period drama movie/series I have seen. I will treasure this DVD. My day is not complete without watching it before I retire, kind of addictive. I recommend this movie to those who love drama and romance.

Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe are excellent as the romantic leads.

After viewing most of your messages, North & South has become one of my favorite movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Darcy, move over!","review":"If you're a fan of Pride and Prejudice, this movie is for you. It's a movie, once again, in which the main characters misunderstand each other. Our hero in this movie is much, much darker and has a more fiery temper than Mr. Darcy. Our heroine, while not quite as appealing as Elizabeth Bennett, does grow on you as the film progresses. If you like the 6-hour A&E production of Pride and Prejudice, this will definitely do the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"North & South","review":"Set during the mid-Victorian age, this fictional story not only reveals the stresses of human relationships, but of the social/geographical/economic divide. The lead female character - Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe), is a middle class southerner from the town of Helstone, a somewhat picturesque country community. The lead male character - John Thornton (Richard Armitage), is a mill-owner from the northern town of Milton, an industrial town where machines are heard everywhere and smoke fills the sky. Amidst the ideological struggles between a laid back southern girl and an industrial northern man, a love story unfolds....I read the book by Elizabeth Gaskell AFTER I had watched this DVD. I love both versions and long ago realized that everything written does not always translate well to the screen, that there will always be some differences. All in all, this is one of my favorites![also reviewed on my blog \\"My Personal Reviews\\"]"},{"rating":"2","title":"North and South is wonderful!!","review":"I just love this movie.

If you are a fan of period drama you must see this! It has a beautiful storyline and the acting is superb. I have heard other people say that this was better than Pride & Prejudice, I can not honestly agree with that. The overall feel of both stories are so very different that I wouldn't even compare the two. They are each in a class of their own, both wonderful from beginning to end. I would highly recommend either of the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Love clean, classic movies. Historical & interesting.

Didn't want it to end; wanted more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"As a student with very limited means, it is very rare for me to buy anything without being totally sure of its' quality- this being said, I have felt no guilt whatsoever in indulging in this excellent adaptation because the price is well worth the many hours worth of enjoyment it brings. I will not give a synopsis because it has been done so thouroughly by so many others, but all I can say is that if you can possibly do so, buy this adaptation- you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful interpretation","review":"As a devout reader of the classics, I am always skeptical when a movie based on a classic literary work comes out. I worry they will take out pivotal pieces of story, ruin an important scene, or cast the wrong actors for the parts. Thankfully, North and South does none of these things. In fact, I found this movie to be delightful with a well written screenplay and an excellent cast, particularly Richard Armitage as Mr. Thorton. From his well tied cravat to his deep brooding stare, he embodies Mr. Thorton perfectly. I have even begun to think he might be more handsome than Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, if that is possible. I highly recommend this film to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch, repeat","review":"I am a BBC miniseries fan but I don't feel compelled to own many of the series that I watch. North and South was an exception. I rented it and ordered it promptly upon finishing my first viewing. This will be adored and watched repeatedly as will my copy of the 1995 Pride and Prejudice. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable movie","review":"I got this movie for my wife. It's a BBC film split into four one hour episodes. I watched it with her and was impressed with the depth and complexity of the characters. It had believable acting and a good story. It was a very enjoyable film. As long as you don't mind movies that require patience, it is great. If you are a fan of any of the Jane Austin movies you will probably like this one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Sigh*","review":"Everything about this production is first-rate. Terrific cast all-around, beautiful music, and a great adaptation.This is not only a beautiful love story (the look on his face when she kisses his hand at the train station is heart-breakingly sweet), it's a fascinating look at the industrial revolution and how it affected everyday people. It's not a dry history lesson; rather it feels immediate and contemporary.Love it, love it, love it, and will watch it over and over with family and friends who haven't seen it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"North and South","review":"Another wonderful English period piece showing that England also has differences between the north and south.
