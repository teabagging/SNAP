I read the book first and my initial impression was negative. However, I let my friend go ahead and read it. My son liked it, but he also enthusiasticaly took on the 'Spinky' attitude and began to sulk after the slightest rebuke from anyone. Spinky is negative, selfcentered, and unforgiving. He pessimistically finds ulterior motives for others acts of kindness toward him. His last minute realisation that the folks aren't all bad, at least they're trying, so I guess I'll forgive them afterall, doesn't negate his negative character that is built up in the first three quarters of the book. Kids will pick up on his basic character, not his one act of forgiveness at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one.","review":"We threw this book right out. William Steig is very disappointing this time around.Spinky is a spoilt, undisciplined, overly-sensitive brat. His parents are extremely indulgent and coddle him endlessly. They permit and encourage this sort of tantrum-ish behavior. This book is so pop-psych that it's sickening. Instead of disciplining him and/or simply telling him to get over it, they spoil him endlessly. The story really is quite stupid. My children were not impressed either.This book encourages this sort of self-centred nonsense that has become all too common in this day and age. I mean, come on, what responsible parent is going to allow their young child to sleep outdoors in the pouring rain overnight? Don't get this one. Even though we will not be using our copy, I don't even plan to give it to anyone, or to recycle it. It's going straight in the trash.His other books are better.

Because of drugs or whatever, his playing seems uninspired and labored. He seems to play much of his songs with less enthusiam than at other times in his career. Compare \\"Live Alive\\" with other albums such as \\"In the Beginning\\" or the El Mocambo video. Those recordings show Stevie Ray at his finest, his playing inspired, and his emotions desperate, as if it would be his final performance.

While the film has been described as \\"restrained\\", it is also possible to receive the film as an incredibly eruptive effort: one that portrays its characters *always* on the verge of breaking down -- both physically and mentally -- from the wholly destructive and lingering effects of the bombs.

Therefore, with the short screws Panasonic provided it cannot reach the crossbar. I'm going to try using some other screws and a nut to finish the job, but I expected more from Panasonic, especially if they're going to charge $160 for a piece of plastic and metal. The item was manufactured in China so what do you expect.Also tried tracking down the department at Panasonic to send me the part. Good luck. They have 50 million departments.

The stand and monitor had to fit into my wife's beloved Ethan Allen \\"country crossing\\" entertainment center. I had to remove the sliding doors from the entertainment center to fit the monitor. The problem we encountered with the stand is that the base of the stand stuck out about 8 or 10 inches in front of the TV and the shelf in the entertainment center. My wife did not like that and it did look bad. SOLUTION: I took the stand apart, removed the top plate with the vertical prongs, attached it to a piece of plywood with wood screws and then attached the whole thing to the shelf of the ent center using wood screws. It worked out great and the TV is flush with the front edge of the ent center. Happy Wife=Happy Life.

It seems obvious to the listener that this CD was written at a time of great emotional stress for the artisticly attributed Troy. This album very adequately expresses the feelings of pain, stife, love Troy wished to convey to the listener save any Morrisey like whininess. In addition, the lyrics are well painted to the melodic three piece that accompanies. The subtle breaks of song, or music, helps to let the listener comprehend what is happening, and is very relevent to this listening process. While, it is clear that this music is emotionally draining to the performer, the last song, on this album, Wake, is appropriately named, as the listener does \\"wake\\", from this album feeling refreshed. This album is far more than mood music, and leaves the listener with a feeling of afterglow, without needing a shower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Characters","review":"This book may be in the wrong category. I would not really place it in the action group becuase it is a display of a deep character driven novel. It is really a very interesting look at this difficult time for Russian's. It was also much more enjoyable then I thought it would be. The descriptions of the locations and main home were very good. I also liked the characters that were created. They had depth and feeling, not just scratch the surface to fill pages. The book is not the feel good hit of the year, it does had a rich plot that you need to keep up with, but the author rewards your efforts with a masterly written book. I think when it comes down to it that is the strength here, the writing is just very good, a lot of feeling comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lostness after the colapse","review":"A novel of the end of the Soviet Union----shortly after the collapse of Communism and the Berlin Wall.

The main character is a hedonist painter, with a small group of characters stuck in the unintentional web. We see the effects of culture and prejudice and how it determines peoples thinking.Peters is a former army officer who has toured these areas and understands the culture. He brings out the miserableness of Communism----the people----the unhappiness----the lostness----the falseness. Peters has an ability for variability in his writing, and an uncanny eye for detail. He is unique in the way he gets inside an individuals' head. I think he is one of our great versatile writers of our time.

Of course, as already revealed by other posts here, after a series of crosses, double crosses and triple crosses, the gang sets out on another exploit.Podesta has an amazing array of bizarre getups including the opening one with strange Catwoman glasses. The film is fun but not frivolous. It definitely is something I'll watch again.Also, for those familiar with Sinister Cinema and concerned about print quality, it is definitely excellent. The colors aren't washed out, the image isn't blurry and the sound isn't muddy. It's great.

You can't set 3 CD alarms or 3 radio alarms, etc. Still, I like this product. It is easy to use and has a lot of features. You can set the sleep timer and listen to a CD, the radio, or the nature sounds while falling asleep. It has a bass boost and AM and FM presets to save your favorite radio stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice display but unrealistic features","review":"i bought this from circuit city today because it allows 3 alarm settings and it's a cd clock radio. It was to my disappointment that I found out that the 3 alarm settings are preset to either cd/alarm, radio, or nature sound.This means if you wanted to listen to CD to sleep and wake up to the buzzer, it's impossible. In order for the buzz to work, you must not insert a cd the night before. This kind of ruined our plan since my boyfriend wanted to wake up to the buzzer and I wanted to wake up by CD.It seemed a waste for Timex to factory-program the 3rd button to the Nature Sound since the most of the nature sounded like woods animal on crack. It stressed me out listening to it.

So - if you listen to the cd in the evening you cant use the buzzer to wake up (really stupid design.)* Difficult to learn.

But the old radio with an analog tuner actually does much better at separating radio stations. The radio station that I am trying to listen to is 107.9 on the FM dial. The interfering station is 107.1. It is my expectation that these stations are far enough apart that a \\"good radio\\" would keep them separated. The Timex radio does a very poor job. The good news is that I now realize the radio I was replacing is actually a good radio even though it has an analog tuner - I have to fiddle with it now and then, but when it is set, no more interference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"The quality of reception on this radio was never good.

It now produces mostly white noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great combination of features at a great price","review":"While the features could be set up to be combined in other ways, I love this product because it has the three (four if you count the beeping) types of alarms, and can play CDs.

I have no problem with viewing the display and enjoy the dimmer and large display."},{"rating":"1","title":"features that don't make sense","review":"In addition to the previous review, here's a few more poor design features of this unit. The \\"triple alarm\\" feature is stupid. Alarm 1 is buzzer or CD only - Alarm 2 is CD or radio only and Alarm 3 is nature sounds only. Geez - I just want a 2 alarm CD radio that sets off one alarm at 5:15am and one again at 8:00.

The Timex (a clock maker) has a great display. However, the FM reception is weak. I got too much hiss, in a location the Aiwa and a very cheap radio had no hiss. Also, the startup and stopping of the CD motor was annoying, especially if you have chosen a track at the far end. Finally, there was no timed \\"snooze\\" when using a CD. The cd would play all the way to the end. There is a timed snooze with the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible reception","review":"It's pretty and reasonably user-friendly, but this is a wretched radio. It picks some signals up too much - one station bled all the way from 91.5 to 90.7.

Granted its supposed to be a \\"live performance\\" at the Prancing Pony, but half the time you cant even understand the words they are singing.3rd, the main instrument heard is an electric keyboard.

While I had no problem reading through the details of the battle and campaign, I would like to have seen more maps (the ones in the book are well-drawn, but too few) and illustrations (having more pictures would add a more personal touch to a well-written book).Complaints aside, I recommend the book as the best summary of the Chattanooga Campaign!"},{"rating":"2","title":"COZZEN'S CHATTANOOGA","review":"Another masterfully written account on the military operations of the Army of the Cumberland immediately following the withdrawal and defeat upon the fields at Chickamauga.

But sadly, despite the marketing ideas, I was let down by the qualtiy and ease of use of this product. This product does work and does do what it says it does, but it takes too much time and fidgeting to get it to work right. The idea of 3 guards is great, but for hairy people, you have to wash the guard way too much. I could go about 6-12 inches before having to stop and rinse the hair out of the guard. This made the process painfully slow. The guards are a great idea, but there is really no release for them from the razor. Everytime I wanted to change guards, I had to pull the head off of the razor and felt as if I was going to break it. The razor has a solid body, but the head of it feels somewhat cheap.

Finally, the battery is so weak that after less than a year the thing no longer holds a charge, so fully charged it tries to shave for about 3 minutes and then dies out.

When you take the plastic clip guards off, they take the entire head off of the device where you have to snap it back on.

It can't do much more than a centimeter's worth of hair length on your head before it starts bunching up and cutting nothing. The plastic guards are a pain to put on and take off, are inconsistent and frequently PULL the hair straight out of your beard.....not pleasant. The hair on my back is rather fine and stays pretty close to the skin and the shaver did little to get it all.I guess I shouldn't have expected as much as I did but with a name like \\"Bodygroom\\", I would think it would work on more of your body. I can't even imagine how angry I'd be if I had used those crummy, hair pulling guards below the belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!!","review":"Does not perform as advertised.

I bought it because I have come to trust Norelco and Philips for quality and living up to their claims, but the bodygroom is just awful. The trimming option, what I mainly bought it for, works terrible. It's flimsy, awkward, and just doesn't trim well. I tried to shave with it figuring it might make up for its lack of trimming quality that way. I was wrong. It kind of pulls the hairs, making it feel uncomfortable if not plainly painful. On top of that, the shave is nowhere near as close as what a regular razor would do- I would have to use it twice a day to look smooth, and it takes forever to actually get that close shave. I know it says that it takes time to adjust, and that you should give it 3 weeks, but it was so bad I wouldn't have given it another day. The only good thing is that Philips has a 60 day refund policy, which I am taking advantage of today. TERRIBLE PRODUCT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Handy, Just Plain Good","review":"I just purchased this product from Wal-Mart because I was tired of having to use razor after razor to handle all the areas I dislike hair on such as the chest, groin, underarms, etc. and I didn't like the pain factor of waxing or the odor factor of using chemicals such as Nair so on an impulse I saw this item and decided to give it a shot. Well while taking a shower, I turned it on (Comes right out of the box charged) and after getting a bit of a feel for how it works, and how to angle, went to work and sitting here now I am thoroughly pleased with the results. No razor bumps, no irritation, just clean, smooth skin.

I trim down my pubic hair using the 1 mm comb and I've been very happy with the results. With the comb your hair is trimmed to a uniform length and it never cuts your skin. Safe to use in \\"sensitive\\" areas. In the hard-to-reach corners right up between your legs you can take off the comb and use the naked blade...again, I've never cut my skin with this. I haven't had the guts to try the naked blade on my shaft or scrotum, but I suspect it wouldn't be a problem.I also discovered that it's excellent for trimming the chest and back of the neck.

I don't know if the battery is faulty, but I charged it before initial use. When I turned it on, it made alot of noise first off. You'd think with all the technology, you'd be able to make a razor that was more quiet. Again, maybe it was the battery because it started crapping out after 5 minutes of use. It was a painful 5 minutes too, because I tested it on some safe parts of my body. Well, it tugged and pulled instead of cutting. I thought, maybe the hairs are too long? Although this shouldn't be an issue with a razor of this acclaimed magnitude. So I went \\"down below\\" because those hairs are already short. I averted any pain, but this thing did me no favors. I haven't bothered with it again. Based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but again, perhaps it was an isolated incident. I gave it 1 star above the minimum because it looks cool.

A fully-charged battery lasts 50 minutes which is not enough time for a guy like me who's only moderately hairy. It takes many, many times of shaving over a spot to get the hair neatly trimmed, and even then sometimes it just won't work. As far as shaving (as opposed to trimming) the groin area safely, it doesn't work very well and the exposed cutting edges at both sides of the foil can cut if you're not careful.The Norelco Accuvac, which Amazon sells for the same price, is much sturdier and trims body hair much faster and more neatly; it has 9 settings which are changed by turning a dial, as opposed to the cumbersome and hard-to-change 3 plastic attachments that come with the Bodygroom. As far as shaving the groin area, trim with the Accuvac and then use a new style razor such as the Gillette M3 Power or Venus Vibrance; they give a much closer shave and are almost impossible to cut your privates with!"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't cut efficiently, attachments are useless","review":"I am not a very hairy person and i wanted something to trim all the hair off my chest and legs. I tried all 3 attachments but this groomer just wouldn't cut the hair. It would cut little pieces here and there. Without any attachments the groomer works much better but you have to repeatedly go over the same spots and every 2-3 seconds the head will clog so you have to pull (or wash out) the hairs. If you press hard against the skin and go very slowly this will give a good close shave, but you have to keep doing this over and over again to get your desired result. I didn't buy this so I can spend 50 minutes shaving my chest. perhaps my item was defective or maybe I just need to try the bg 2040 for better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless if you actually have hair","review":"Let me first start off by saying that I am a hairy guy. Not a little bit, but pretty much all over. And it's not a lightweight coating. If your like me this product isn't for you. It does work in the shower, but falls apart easily, gets clogged, the guards snap on and when pulling them off it at times it will pull the actual head of the clippers apart. I also try to go for that 'unshaven' look and this is completely useless for any sort of facial trimming. Yes, you can shave your sack, and yes, it will nick you if you aren't totally careful, but I really cant justify owning a shaver for just that purpose. I have typically used a 'pro' set of clippers (the kind they shave your head with) and those are far superior to this, even the cheapest pair of them have outlasted and outperformed this product. I think this lasted a week and a half before I tossed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be a lot better.","review":"There are two major flaws with this product. First, the shaver requires an enormous 8-hour charge for a measly 50 minutes of use. Not only is this not efficient it's also inconvenient. The only time I am at home for that long is when I am sleeping. The fact that the batteries lifespan is reduced from overcharging does not help this flaw. Second, all the attachments trap the hair in them and clog up. This means in order to shave your body you have to constantly push out the trapped hair. All in all, I would like to see a higher quality product for more money. As it is you're better off buying a nice Wahl beard trimmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hubby's hates it","review":"My husband did not like this at all.

DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!","review":"I purchased the Bodygroom 2020 on Amazon about 2 years ago. Still have it. The product does what it says. Hair is gone quickly and painlessly and the best part is NO SHAVING BUMPS a day or two later from ingrown hairs. Shaving with a safety razor in the shower always produces those annoying little red bumps. For optimal results the skin must be completely dry. My method is to apply baby powder first to absorb any excess moisture on the area to be shaved and I get a much smoother result. For shaving the bean bag, it is important to pull the skin tautly otherwise nicks can occur. Nobody wants blood in their undies. My body hair is fine and not coarse. I imagine that thicker, coarser hair may pose a challenge to the shaver and hence the negative reviews. For longevity of battery life, I let the shaver run out of juice completely before recharging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"This is my third time purchasing this item.

Hair collects in them easily and prevents further effective shaving. The hair is hard to remove without taking off the attachment. Also, note how the blades are positioned on both sides of the foil; it makes it very hard to use the foil on sensitive regions without nicking oneself with the blades. Finally, I tried using this once and only once in the shower. The razor stopped working the next day. RIP.For shaving one's own back hair, it's too hard to reach with this; try the Mangroomer (as silly as the name may be, it's a good product)!

I was, however, very disappointed after several unsuccessful uses. The trimmer works fine, but the shaving process is near impossible to do in a time efficient manner. It only gets a close shave against the grain (which would be fine but if you don't go against the grain it hardly gets anything done). It also takes way too many strokes to get a close shave in one spot and this leads to irritation post shave.After spending a half an hour in the shower I was able to get a close shave on the abs (skin irritation included), but the contours of my chest were near impossible for this thing to properly shave.After all the reviews of how easy this thing is to use I am curious if I got defective one or if there is something I'm missing about how to use it, but all in all, this product has not done what it is supposed to for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great....for about one month.","review":"The shaving head is held by plastic tabs.

That's about it, though. Whether my hair was wet or dry, I just didn't have much luck. Any part of your body that you shave, you'll have to go over it again and again. I'm not the hairiest boy alive but by the time I spent 50 minutes with it, I could have gotten a closer shave with a Gillette Mach 3 or any other 3 bladed razor.

The stand also doesn't come with a charge indicator. The only one is on the AC adapter and it only lights up to show that the circuit is complete.2. The attachments are really difficult to remove from the shaver head. They are also a little pointier than I think necessary. I've jabbed myself in the arm more than once when using this.3.

I purchased this product a few years back and found that although it was crafted cleverly to appeal on the eye and look good it was far from that. I found that simply cutting long body hairs in simple places became a choir for this groomer or it just painfully pulled hair right out. This often caused the head of the trimmer to fill up or even pop off. Regardless, I purchased this product to remove hair from the back and neck and well after about 6 uses too many this product became a resident of my garbage can.

Doesn't last.","review":"This item is very cheaply made. The foil is only held in by four pin head-size \\"dots\\" while snapping into the head. Also, the combs attach in a very similar snap-on and hold with dot concept. They are difficult to get on/off. I have only used this maybe ten times, and now the foil starts falling out all the time. The dots fail to hold it any more.Without the combs, it is too \\"dangerous\\" for trimming sensitive areas. With the combs, it is too clunky/bulky, and you have to go over the area about ten times. I found an old electric Wahl-type trimmer (with combs) works a lot better and faster. Finally, the charger base is a stupid waste of space and plastic and often the contacts don't work unless you really pay attention or jiggle it. A conventional plug would have been a lot better.I also have the Philips Norelco grooming kit and really like that one, but this cost me almost triple, and it is falling apart after much less usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!! Don't even think about wasting your money on this!","review":"I purchased my first BG 2020 in May of 2006. I used it several times a week and within a few weeks it started making a terrible rattling noise. This noise was the cutter and foil rattling in the head. This also caused the cutter and foil assembly to fall out regularly. It was effectively worn out after a few weeks. I contacted Philips and had to send in the original BG for a replacement. After using the replacement, same thing happened. It's not durable at all- apparently they only planned on the user using it once a month. If used once a month, it MIGHT last a year. It's definitely NOT designed to be used every day or every other day, unless you want to replace it every few weeks.It needs to be completely redesigned as far as the cutter/foil goes so it will be more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"stubble maker","review":"This is not an effective body trimmer or shaver.

Even when the battery was in new condition, the unit wouldn't last for more than 45 minutes of shaving. For an entire body touch-up, one might need a trimmer with that can actually last an entire trim or shave.Also, the unit is made of flimsy plastic, which cuts down on weight but also decreases durability. And though I've never exposed the trimmer to shower conditions, I doubt it would hold up, despite its being touted as \\"wet/dry.\\" The no-guard foil option up to a #1 guard are close enough to nick skin and draw blood, so watch out!Bottom line: Look elsewhere when considering a male body hair trimmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice...but not perfected yet","review":"Trimmer still catches skin in those 'highly sensitive' areas.

I clean it and recharge it, and the blades move until I start using it again. It's especially bad with the attachments.The T765 model I replaced with this was a much better trimmer, and took years to degrade in shave quality to where my Bodygroom is after 2 months. Only coming with 3 attachments, which you have to take on and off is much less convenient than other models you can adjust up to 9 times as you go. The #1 attachment is too long for some areas for me, and there's no way I'd use it without an attachment in more sensitive areas considering how it's shaved everywhere else. The #3 keeps hair to about 1/2\\", which isn't good for much because hair longer than that will clog the razor in no time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good product","review":"Definitely a great buy ... you have to be paitent when using it, but it works very well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bodygrooming","review":"Philips Norelco Bodygroom ShaverThis is a great product.

I used it maybe 10 times, if that, over a one or two year period. I was very sad when it stopped working and I had intentions of buying a new one until I read some of the bad reviews on Amazon. I think I will try investing in a barber type shaver instead. I never really needed the waterproof option, it was just convenient that I could shave over the tub rather than having to stand over a towel.

It would no longer hold a charge and was very hard to switch on and off. The shaver does a good job but you have to be careful in certain areas because if you tilt it to far the larger cutting blades on the edges will cut or scrape your skin. You also must take your time and go over areas several times to get a smooth shave. It also has a long charging time (8 hours) for a short shaving time (55 minutes approx). It could use a light or something to tell you when it is fully charged, instead of watching the clock.

They also don't seem to spike up the hair too much so that the blade actually cuts them. After a while I've noticed that it becomes very slow and doesn't really trim down the hair even after charging.What I do like is that it charges, so no batteries required and its very light.

I can shed my winter coat in about the third of the time it used to take me with a sideburn razor.After a few uses, though, the metal foil became bent, and now only one side of the razor is usable. It should be replacable, of course -- even the manual says so. But every time I call or write Philips they tell me the replacement heads aren't available yet.If that wasn't irritating enough, the battery life is really poor, and gets worse every time you use it. You can't run it off A/C power. And there is no battery indicator light on the unit, which just screams of cost-cutting.I'll probably end up buying another Bodygroom since there really isn't any other option.

I tried bending the screen, but this is only a temporary fix and eventually falls out after a minute or two of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Shaver, Philips Norelco Bodygroom","review":"The razor does an excellent job removing unwanted body hair. Its easy to use and did not irritate even the most sensitive areas. The only problem is, which is not actually a problem, is that you need some assistance in the hard to reach areas of your back.

How about if I specify that it ONLY works great on thick, coarse hair?If you're at the Robin Williams level of hair coverage, this shaver will do an awesome job of shearing you. But unless you want to wait until you're Robin again before using it again, what you now own is a skin-reddener. I could even live with skin irritation if it still shaved the few-days-worth of regrowth, but it doesn't even shave at that point. It's /just/ skin irritation.Anyone with so much body hair they want to shave it will likely want to keep it off, and this shaver will not help you do that. You're better off just using a normal razor on chest, stomach, arms, and legs, and the very goodMANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaveron the back.

I bought it to use on my chest, shoulders, and abdomen, thinking it would be a cheaper alternative to constantly buying razors. Does not work very well at all. Barely removes any hair from my chest as it does not conform to the surface well. Works slightly better on abs but not even as well as my Norelco shaver I use on my face. The only thing I use it on now would be my eyebrows as it has some attachments/guards to produce consistent length. Advertised as a body groomer but is very ineffective on most areas of the body.

Definitely not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never been irritated enough to bother ... until now.","review":"This thing just flat out does not provide the function for which it was designed.A very small amount of hair collected beneath the guide is enough to block hair from entering the cutters.Therefore, expect to stop very often to clear the guides.

I managed to misplace the charger for the body groom, and after a month had still not found it. Frustrated, I looked online for replacement chargers--none to be found. I called up their customer support to see if I could buy one through them. Unfortunately they do not offer the charger separately. However, the customer service agent said that he would send me a COMPLETE REPLACEMENT kit free of charge--all I had to do was send back my current unit when the new one arrives in the self addressed package. Not only do I get a charger, but I get a brand new shaver!

VERY disappointed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great below the neck","review":"As reviewed by others this works very well below the neck only. I've found that the Norelco Body groomer works best on pubic area if shaved only weeky. It works very well in the shower if you lather with Dove soap first as a lubricant then shave the pubic areas take your time it can nick if you're not careful. No bumps, very smooth shave front and back side.I do not use the Norelco on the Kiwi's, I use the Gillette Fusion, the Norelco will nick the Kiwi fruit skin and that is not fun. Be careful, take your time and let the shaver do the work. Pressing hard does not improve the result it only causes rash and pain.I'm glad I made the purchase and so is my wife, judging by the amount of time she spends in the area now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A struggle to use......and a waste of money","review":"I bought this as an easier alternative to methods I had been using. It turned out to be a total waste. I threw it away. It had only one redeeming quality which is the fact it can be used in the shower. The cutting blade on both sides of the shaver is a struggle to get it to cut anything and when it does it clogs very quickly. The razor part is also difficult and ridiculous.You are much better off to use a standard hair trimmer (like for cutting the hair on your head) for the big jobs and a safty razor for the close jobs. This shaver is just a gimmic. Another tip, I recently figured out that shaving my skin on my back and arms with a safty razor is easier when done completly dry.......who knew!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaver","review":"The shape and weight of this product is perfect.

It isn't a super close shave, but it's not meant to be other wise you would end up with painful ingrown hairs. Doesn't chop through thick areas of hair very fast. I have gotten a couple of minor cuts when shaving my pubic region, but that isn't the fault of the trimmer. There is really no way to be totally safe shaving loose skin like that. Overall I would recommend it.UPDATE 5/6/2012: A few months back this shaver stopped holding a charge. Works for less than a minute before dying now. Very disappointing that less that 2 years old and with very occasional use the battery would go like that. This is now the 2nd bad experience I have had with Norelco products and the last time I will ever buy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died in less than three months","review":"Used it once a week with average results, had to charge it every three uses or so, around the three month mark the device refused to turn on, even though the charger indicated a full charge.Someone skimped on something while designing this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuts but doesn't last","review":"I've owned two of these. Both of them cut very well and would, easily,be worthy of 5 stars were it not for the fact that both died within an 18 month period. I just had the second one die, now. The button to turn the device on and off failed on both units and, quite obviously, rendered the device useless. With the second unit, I had to pry it open and cut a power cable just to get it to shut off. Even pressing the button on the circuit board, itself, didn't work.I needed a replacement and, based on my experiences with the Bodygroom line, I went with a Remington. Hopefully, the Remington can combine the very close shave of the Bodygroom with some sort of longevity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 3 months...","review":"This product is not for anyone with thick hair. I've only had the product for three months and already something broke or shifted to allow the internal razor to pop up and eat its way through the protective wire mesh... I'm extremely displeased. Next time I'll just buy a normal electric shaver and deal with the soft skin issues with a cream or something... I can't believe Philips puts this product out. Normally they're a pretty good brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Start, Weak Finish","review":"Mine worked great at first. I only used it once a week or so. Trouble is, the internal (recharging) battery gets weaker and weaker over time. As it does, the blades get slower and slower and the amount of time it will stay on gets shorter and shorter. At first, it's just a minor annoyance and the shaver just doesn't run as long but still cuts hair long enough to get the job done. But eventually, it starts \\"pulling\\" hair instead of cutting it, even when taking it straight off the charger. For that reason, I can't recommend it. If you decide to buy it, expect it to work great the first year and then start slowly going downhill. I definitely would not recommend you buy any additional blade heads because the shaver won't last long enough to wear the original one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its okay, wouldnt purchase it again","review":"I bought this with the intention of using it occasionally when i got lazy and didnt keep up grooming around my \\"box\\" (female) just to get down to a more managable length to then use my traditional razor.i didnt use it very ofen and from the beginning i didnt think it cut that well ... and i never really attempted to get any sort of smooth shave with the foils. i had it for about 2 years and used it maybe a dozen or so times and it quit working. it showed it was getting a charge when put on the base but it wouldnt turn on. i didnt really think hair got stuck under the blades like some others complained about though i only used it in the shower so maybe that helped rid the hair with the constant water flow.this was my first electric razor so i dont have anything to compare it to, but i know i will not purchase it again. i agree with another reviewer stating a $40 razor obviously isnt the best but also shouldnt be a throw away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bodygroomer review","review":"Product designed very well.

I was wrong, the teeth on the clippers constantly pull the hair and cause pain. I am returning this thing to amazon.

You have to go very slowly, what took minutes with the Wahl clippers took half an hour with the bodygroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is a toy","review":"I just got this item (Norelco's on-line ad suggests that they understand very well what men are looking for), but they got it wrong somewhere along the line.

Don't waste your time and money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"Pretty unhappy with this product.I am a cyclist so have been trimming leg hair formany many years. Usually I just use a hair type trimmer with the short attachment. We use to shave for competition but these days a trimmer is close enough. Unfortunately this unit does not seem to do anything at all.I was really surprised because there was so many good reviews. Perhaps these folks have longer hair?In any case I wish I had not wasted my $$ on this one. It really does nothing at all for me. I drag it over my lags but it does not seem to cut anything at all. I am using the smallest attachment for the shortest hair cut. But no joy here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be prepared to spend lots of time shaving","review":"This product looks great and keeps a very good charge. Other than that it is pure frustration. The angle of the head in relation to the handle makes it very difficult to do the back of you legs. It requires multiple and I mean multiple passes to give a reasonably clean shave. If you have not shaved in a while you would need to use a trimmer first before using this. Really not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible shaver, slow, missed spots, waste of money","review":"This is just a terrible shaver. I bought it primarily for my stomach, chest and under arms. It is really slow. I had to go over the same body area 5-10 times, really slowly in order for it to cut all the hair. On areas such as my stomach it wasn't too bad since the skin there is smooth but on areas like under arms or the chest area it was a nightmare. It barely cut the hair, took for ever and left a stubble. Not very smooth. Before when I used a manual razor, it took me around 3 minutes to shave my stomach and chest and with this electric shaver, it took like 10 minutes and it was nowhere as close as with the manual shaver.After 3 weeks I called Philips and told them I wanted to return it. I got the 45-day money back guarantee form and I will drop off the shaver in the mail tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"not all it's cracked up to be","review":"I'm still learning to use it I guess, but it just doesn't live up to the billing.

If I have an operational breakthrough I will share."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk!!","review":"Frankly I'm dumbfounded by the positive reviews here. This was pure flimsy plastic junk and I just returned it. It didn't work for me at all. It shaved about 10% of what I asked it to, and no matter how many times I went over certain spots this thing could not hack it. Also, according to the cheaply done instructions, it can be overcharged if you don't unplug it. Hello? What year is this? A little more sophistication please! I suppose if you are accustomed to shoddy poorly made products you'll find this thing acceptable. Definitely one to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing needs Viagra","review":"I've had this for over a year now and it worked pretty well in the beginning. Now, as other reviewers have said, the metal razor part that is supposed to pop out for cleaning will not just pop out on its own while in use. A couple times the device wouldn't turn off and the only way I could get it to turn off was banging it on the bathroom counter until something lodged back into place. Worst of all though, the motor has lost its umph. Since it has lost much of its power, it takes several passes to shave anything and you dare not allow too much hair in at once - or it starts pulling!So, you can buy it if you need one immediately for some hot date and the store isn't selling anything else. But, it will probably not last very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"body shaver","review":"Philips body shaver works very well. I was amazed how gentle it is with sensitive skin areas.

I tried it on my arm with guid comb #3, not a single hair was cut. Tried it with comb #2, nothing, Tried it with comb #1 and maybe cut about 1/10000 of a millimeter, I could hear it was cutting something but visually no difference at all. I tried it bare, no combs and finally started to work but this thing pulled and tugged my hair to a very unpleasant experience. After trying to make it work for 30 minutes I gave up.

There is absolutely nothing glamorous about violence - it isn't pretty. To defend yourself successfully, you must act quickly and decisively. In addition you must be prepared to use brutal techniques if fleeing isn't an option or you can't talk your way out of a situation. If you don't have the right mind-set you're going to be put in the hurt locker by some thug or some thug and his buddies.

On the other hand, if you're just starting out in a martial art, this book might save you thousands of wasted hours (and bucks) by steering you away from some techniques that will only wind up getting you stomped with a little style.For the intermediate-level martial artist, this book is filled with solid advice and suggestions that might help redefine your training emphasis in ways you probably never expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sold me bad film","review":"I am extremely disappointed and angry that I bought a 2 pack of Polaroid film from this seller.

It also includes a duet with Michael McDonald (She's Dangerous) and a swooping title track, arguably the album's strongest piece. Unfortunately, the album missed certification just as his previous Vox Humana; a distraught Kenny Loggins due to a crumbling marriage, a slick, synth-heavy, and unequivocally dated late 80s' production that suffocate the compositions, and the overall change in public perceptions at the time are all factors that contributed to its lack of success."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think to use this book you have to be an experienced witch","review":"I belive that even though you can use some of the spells you have to watch out because, there are some that are of cruel intent and will therefor come back to three times.

If you want to feel just a little bit closer to unraveling the mystery that was JFK, Jr., this book does just that and it does it with eloquence and grace.I enjoyed the professional unbiased perspective that Rich used. In addition, he provided the reader some interesting insights into the decision making of a non-journalist, non-writer, and non-politician that was an editor-in-chief of a political magazine.I was an avid reader of George Magazine and I also liked learning what made them choose some of the articles that they did.Buy it, read it, and enjoy.

Kennedy Jr. who seems to be attempting to make a couple of bucks off of a respected celebrity who has passed on with this book. While Richard obviously knew John, after reading this book it is apparent that he barely knew him outside of work. Judging by the cover and name of this book one would suspect that it is about JFK Jr. In reality this book is about George magazine and Richard's experience working there, with tales of dinner with John placed randomly about. If you are looking for a book that will give you an idea of what type of person JFK Jr. was, I would recommend \\"The Men We Became\\" by Robert Littel. He was John's best friend and knows far more about John than nearly anyone else ever did."},{"rating":"1","title":"a book more about the author than john john","review":"Richard Blow is a good writer (see Harvard Rules, Greatest Game). This is a very strange book in which the author waxes more about him and his place in JFK Jr's world, than the Man himself. Blow comes across as an educated posse; he thanks Bernard Bailyn in the acknowledgment section. But unfortunately, the author is no Kennedy. He is a Blow (now Bradley).(At one point, the author waxes poetically about how he wanted his own wedding to be as good as John's, a wedding which Blow was never invited to). In the end, Blow writes as if nothing would make him happier than being John John's full time jock strap sniffer.As for George Magazine, the advertisers fled in droves for a reason.This book will entertain you for the three hours it takes for you to read.If you buy this book for a $1 (plus $3.99 shipping), the book is worth your investment.On the other hand, I highly recommend Harvard Rules and the Greatest Game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok...","review":"The book was an easy read.

Very, very sad indeed and I am sorry I bought the book. I was looking for gossip and rumor and found it. I was looking for a good story and did not find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a story about Richard Blow, not John F. Kennedy, Jr.","review":"I am an avid biography and autobiography reader. I have read every book written on the Kennedy family. No wonder they are up in arms about the book. This book is about Blow and his experiences at George magazine. This is not a story about Mr. Kennedy. He simply used his name to sell a book because we are still so in awe of the only thing we as Americans know as \\"royalty\\". All of the mentions of Carolyn seem as if they were taken from the already well known published information in magazines. All of the examples of her except for one were instances that were well documented publically. Personally, I think someone in the Kennedy family should sue him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you want to learn anything new about JFK jr. do NOT read this book. The book is basically one long whine-fest about why the magazine \\"George\\" failed (hint to Blow: because it was stupid!). Richard Blow apparently saw in the death of Kennedy his one shot at fame--nothing else had worked. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positve portrait","review":"I enjoyed this portrayal of JFK jr. I felt that it was done in a positive and admiring light.

It is just a story about a man and a magazine and an untimely death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow's Autobiography","review":"Blow should have titled this book \\" Enough About You, Let's Talk About Me\\". Instead of an intimate protrait of JFK, Jr. this book appears to merely be an opportunity for the author to capitalize on his business association with a famous person. Unless you are interested in how a magazine begins, this book is a dud. There are other books about JFK, Jr. that are written better and have more depth than this one, (The Day John Died, for example). I was greatly disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but lacking","review":"The book describes in great detail the author's working relationship with Kennedy. It is a one-man perception of a period of Kennedy's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Surprising","review":"Not a lengthy work, but the author did not have a long history with the subject, nor was it a deep personal relationship. He produces little new insight to Mr Kennedy. Most of the material might have been taken from other long publsihed works, as well as supposition and innuendo. This is NOT a definitive work on a life lived in the public eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very revealing portrait","review":"For a man who had the chance to write an in-depth book about his very famous boss, Richard Blow has not succeeded. While first reading through \\"American Son\\" I thought the author treated his subject with a certain amount of distance and reverence. As I continued, that reverence simply became timidity.One learns surprisingly little about John F. Kennedy, Jr. in this book. Some may not know that JFK, Jr. had a temper or he liked to stroke his wife's hair when she visited him at the office. But I kept waiting for more and I think that Mr. Blow, while not hiding his love of JFK, Jr. has done a disservice....in an attempt to humanize him, the author has made Mr. Kennedy appear to be less of an interesting figure than he probably was.Richard Blow writes in an even, readable style. As with most things about JFK, Jr., however, the best part of \\"American Son\\" might just be the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Richard Blow was in Love with John Kennedy","review":"I think there is a tortuous element to this book. It reads well - it is extremely well-written. But underneath it all, one gets a sense that the author is, in fact, secretly, deeply in love with John Kennedy and without that being clarified in his mind, it muddles the take, the whole approach to this subject. What was this book? The tale of a good magazine that died with its editor? A biography? No, a secret love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening","review":"The book itself is the work of a man who desperately wants to be seen as part of the inner circle. Indeed he was not. As one reader posted, Blow really did not have the opportunity to spend that much time with John if you examine the contents of the book closely enough. As I was reading I got the feeling that Blow had to fill in a large amount of space that easily represents his lack of true knowledge about the subject. The book was long and held on mildly interesting anecdotes that have already been previously published about the Kennedys and in particular John. If Blow wanted to make waves, he should have revealed things that are not already known by the public. He could very easily have gotten his information from many other sources, thus rendering his own account less than unique. As someone who has read inordinate amounts of information on the Kennedys, I would not recommend this repetitious, boring work to anyone unless of course they can read it for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"odd","review":"There is something odd and unpleasant about this book. The author was by his own account, not the best friend of JFK Jr. It isn't a great or even very good biography. The author also, can't seem to explain why he wrote it. This book, alas adds nothing to history and seems more like backstairs gossip than anything else. It's Kitty Kelly without the clever writing. Even if you collect Kennedy books this is not a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's this book about?","review":"Is this book about JFK, Jr. or is it about Richard Blow? After reading this book, it appeared to me that the author just wanted to make sure that in remembering JFK, Jr., that we all remembered that Blow worked with JFK, Jr. It's sad that someone like Blow, who is obviously talented in his own right, would decide to cash in so openly on his association with Kennedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Idea for a Book","review":"I thought the idea of a book about John Kennedy, Jr.'s tenure at George magazine was a good one. Instead of a slick and glossy tome about \\"America's Prince\\" or \\"The Most Beautiful Man in America,\\" his former associate, Richard Blow, has fashioned a interesting account of the beginnings and ultimate ending of a man's search for identity and purpose.That JFK, Jr. was able to put together a political magazine as he saw that world, does indeed make for fascinating reading. The inner workings, in-fighting and eventual ending of a publishing phenomenom is a nice change from the usual tabloid fare that we are used to seeing about members of the prolific Kennedy family."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheaper at Smart & finals","review":"these are nice suckers but the price is too high.I found these at Smart & Finals for $5.99 almost half the cost.Save the extra money you can get these cheaper!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Taste but poor packaging .

Island Records originally messed with this Rods effort upon its release in the states back in '77, dropping certain studio tracks in favor of tacking on some live EP material to capitilize on the American's penchant for live performances. This has all been corrected as the LP is back in its original form, with the addition of numerous bonus tracks - the aforementioned live tracks, some rarities and a handful of A and B sides.

I tried putting it on length \\"3\\", but when I started to trim, it went down to length \\"2\\". Then I started on length 2 and it went down to length 1. Besides this, the cutting block is too far away from the thing that touches your face (not sure what it's called), so it's very hard to cut any hair at all unless you choose the length setting 3 or lower. I know all this may come as a surprise to those of you who have had success with previous Norelco trimmers, but the fact is that this thing is a serious piece of Sh_t. In my estimation, their aspirations to achieve the fancy \\"vacuum effect\\" has clouded what should be their primary goal with this device: to trim facial hair EVENLY and EFFECTIVELY!

The only thing that kills it is the fact that they decided to include an AC adapter that only works with 120 volts. In other words, if you travel, you can't charge this trimmer in most other countries. I don't think it's that much more expensive to include an adapter that accepts 110-230 volts. My last Norelco trimmer that lasted 7 years could accept 110-230 volts and was always with me in my travels.Items such as trimmers, shavers, cell phones, laptops, etc. all should accept 110-230 volts, since they are mostly travel items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad...Very Bad!","review":"I bought the Philips Norelco T908 Turbo based on other customer reviews.

I then called Norelco and was told that the hair catching unit is not an available replacement part. It seems absurd that the only removable part on the unit, a part that is removed regularly as a part of its function, a part that is made of fragile plastic, would not be available for replacement.

The vacuum feature is nice and makes cleaning up small jobs easier, especially since I don't have to sweep hair off a wet sink afterwards. Cleaning is straightforward as all the pieces come apart and go back together pretty easily. The turbo feature is also helpful. My beard is very coarse, and tends to jam up most trimmers. This one gets hung up sometimes, but if I go slowly and don't try to cut too much at once, it works fine.One note: The hair \\"reservoir\\" under the vacuum fills up quickly, so it's better to use this more often on smaller jobs than waiting to do a bigger trim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Product","review":"Been using the T980 for a few weeks now and it works great!

Second, you have to clean the vacuum chamber really often, once every 10 seconds or so depending on the hair size! If I could, I would remove my 4 stars and put 1 instead! I couldn't use it anymore.

But the quality of its trimming is far below that on my Norelco shaver. If I'd known then what I know now, I would have passed on this item. It may be good for those who don't have a Norelco shaver with the trimming feature, (and don't want to pay a hundred dollars or more for such a shaver).

It also silently switches from trim number 3 - 2 if you press down hard enough. Also the blade has a 'shield' that aids in sucking the cut hair down into the collection chamber. The problem is the 'shield' blocks the head of the blade. Very dangerous if your cutting a line for your moustache-- your literally cutting blind. It does come with a cheap attachment for linings, but I prefer cutting from the blade, like in the older models.Too much of my life depends on how good of a shave I give myself.

Adjustability was fine. The easy-adjust ring was nice. It functioned great plugged in or not. The problems I encountered were:1 The swing-out door to empty the clippings broke. It's cheap, and has barely any material supporting it. It's not like you can just tape it closed, because you need to be able to open it.2)The spring-loaded trimmings hatch stuck open, and lost its spring. So, even holding the clippings-door closed, trying to \\"make-do\\" and not have to discard this so soon, is very frustrating because the trimmings don't get captured - they stay at the top and spillover the trimmer.3)The turbo has no extra sucking effect. It's useless.4)The turbo is too easily turned on by accident.5)The turbo is LOUD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clean cut but few problems","review":"I bought this trimmer in 2009 and have been using it every week since. It is easy to handle and provide a comfortable clean cut. However it is very hard to clean. The trap's hinges broke twice already. This is rechargeable trimmer with a long lasting battery (~8 beard trims) but it is not really a travel trimmer. It charges only on 110v and the on/off switch place atop tends to turn the trimmer on in its traveling bag. I ended up growing a thick holiday beard on few occasion!

The vacuum is a nice feature, it simplifies cleanup. The guide comb is almost a necessity, this is the only electric trimmer I've managed to cut myself with.

It holds a charge for a few weeks (based on using it 2 x week, 5 min each), recharges quickly, works with or without the cord. My only complaint is the size of the trimmer head.

Length adjustment never changes. Turbo mode is never used. I seldom see even a stray hair on my towel or sink. Recharging has been done six times and unplugged when full charge is reached.I bought in spite of some bad reviews. Now, the criticisms baffle me. The purchase was made with confidence, because it came with a 90 day return guarantee. I haven't a clue about reviewers who abandoned or threw away the trimmer when it didn't work for them.

No more! It may not capture every single hair, but I would say it gets a good 90-95% of them. Regardless, it vacuums up enough of the hairs to keep my wife happy!In my mind the only two small items that keep it from being a 5-star product are: 1) it does not have a pop-up trimmer like my old model did - you have to take the regular blade off and put on the trimmer blade, but that is the price you pay for having the vacuum feature, and 2) its harder to get up close and trim under my nose - it can be done, it just takes more effort than before; again I think its the price you pay for the vacuum feature. Overall I have had great luck with Norelco trimmers and this one is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trimmer","review":"This is the best trimmer I have used. When on 'turbo' mode, the vacuum catches almost all hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"clogs constantly","review":"I have owned various panasonic beard trimmers for past 20 years, untli the non-replaceable batteries go bad. This is the first one I have had which sucks the trimmings into a built-in container, which is a great idea. The problem is it clogs every 2-3 strokes, which makes it unusable. Now, if you use this on a daily or every 2-3 day basis, and are cutting hairs taht are 1/8\\" long, for instance, I bet it would work well. But when you do trimming every 1-2 weeks, and the hair is 1/4\\" or longer for head hair, it will clog, and this product is not for you. So I would give it 0 stars if you are like me, or 4 stars if you plan on using it constantly, for an overall score of 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special...","review":"I purchased this electric razor when my old Phillips Norelco razor died on me. I had it for about 6 years so I figured I would stay with the company. This razor is way to bulky and does not get close enough for a good trim for your mustache or goatee. After one day of use the blue piece that gathers the hair into the vacuum broke right off. I returned this razor the next day for a refund. I would definitely not recommend this razor for facial use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Semi-close Trim","review":"This quality beard trimmer is excellent for catching beard hair and for making cleanup easy. It also trims beards to desireable longer lengths well.But, if you want a very close trim, like a two-day beard look, you must remove the adjustable head and make sure not to work from the bottom up. That said, it then gives a fine two-day trim.This trimmer does not need to be re-charged regularly or plugged in to maintain its charge. That is a benefit."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"I have a fairly thick beard. This trimmer delivers as advertised. It is powerful, holds a great charge and the vacuum feature works as designed. The vacuum keeps me from cleaning the sink of hair so it doesn't go down the drain. I have tried several trimmers over the last ten years - Wahl, Panasonic, an older Norelco - this is the best by far. Great value. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"shifts levels","review":"First shave and my husband lost his short beard. It shifted levels without him knowing it and left a racing strip.

It turns out cheap flimsy plastic does not last long. I did not drop it or submerge it in water, it just stopped. I contacted the company and they told me that they would do nothing to help me since i bought it over 2 years ago (2.5 yrs ago to be exact). I will never buy norelco again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This trimmer is terrible- a complete waste of money. For startes the vacuum does not work! even when set on turbo. The \\"lockable settings\\" in fact do not lock, and any pressure at all applied to the trimmer will switch your desired length to a lower number. But the biggest flaw of all is how bulky the design of the trimmer is. It's much too large and clunky to fit the contours of your face and to give an even trim. DO NOT BUY, you will be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work!","review":"I gave this product one star because the trimmer works very well, but I have had many trimmers that worked very well. What I expected when purchasing this product, and it does cost a lot more than most, is the vacuum that it advertises to work, and it clearly does NOT! Oh it does suck some of the hair into the chamber, but it left just as big a mess of the trimmed hair all over my bathroom counter, as all the other trimmers, that don't have one. That to me is unacceptable, and I think Norelco should not be allowed to advertise as such!!! Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Registration and Customer Service already a problem!","review":"I am so mad about trying to register for this trimmer for warranty service on the Phillips Norelco web page that I can't actually say whether or not the trimmer is any good. I went on the web page for registration and they require you to answer a full privacy invasive survey to register the product. When I refused to do the survey to register and complained through the webmaster contact I then get an answer back from Phillips wanting me to waste my time calling an 800 number for Norelco - we all know how those calls go!! At least with the 60 day money back guarantee maybe I can calm down and decide if I like the unit - sure don't like the service so far!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel cheated","review":"I ordered the trimmer but did not realize that I would not be getting the trimmer attachments"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great All Around Trimmer","review":"Was looking online for a solid trimmer for detailing my goatee, and after much research settled on the Norelco T980 Turbo Vac Trimmer. Although I wasn't interested in a vacuum trimmer I have to say that the vacuum works better than I thought it would and actually turned out to be a welcome benefit ie. no more extraneous hairs all over the sink. As far a detailed trimmer I find it very easy to use as it allows precision trimming lengths and the detail blade makes fine detailing a breeze. It even does a better job shaving my head than my Oster Turbo 111 electric razor. It's build quality is solid and the battery charge lasts a long time. I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the previous Norelco trimmers","review":"I've had a couple of Norelco trimmers in the past, most recently the T780, and have never really been happy. This newer, top-of-the-line T980 is pretty much what I've been looking for. It's solid, powerful and holds a charge through several trimmings. And the length setting holds! (Previous models would change settings as you were trimming because the change ring was right under your grip and moved too easily.) I think I'll keep this one for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"KISS","review":"I had a Norelco trimmer that lasted several years and loved it. The main reason I chose the T980 over the T765 is that it can be operated from the plug. However, the comb is difficult to re-attach after cleaning and ultimately busted completely after less than 2 months of use. The vacuum is a nice feature but the receptacle is not secure, sometimes sending hair flying everywhere. The worst part is the vacuum feature makes it impossible to use the bare blade to trim edges; you have to use a separate attachment for this. The button to operate the \\"turbo\\" feature (totally unnecessary) is extremely cheap and came off the first time I pressed it. Norelco / Philips trimmers are definitely the way to go, but don't shell out the extra money for the shoddily designed extra features. Get the T765, I just did as a replacement for this piece of dung."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not cut close","review":"I was pretty disappointed when I found out that this shaver WILL NOT cut short hair, it has to be at least 1/4 inch or so before the blades can pick it up. That was a deal breaker for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product: It Just Works!","review":"I've had the trimmer for a couple of months now and simply love it! Philips Norelco thought of all the elements that make up a great beard trimmer and put them into a low cost product.1. It needs no sharpening.2. It needs no special oils for lubricating.3. It has an integrated vacuum that pulls out more than 90% of the mess!4. It's easy to clean.5. It's easy to adjust trimming height.6. It has a narrow head for fine trimming.7. Charge lasted for > 1 month of trimming every other day.8. Reasonably quest unless you turn on the turbo vacuum, which I only use with the narrow trimming tool.Did I mention that it doesn't leave the bathroom sink full of hair trimmings?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's advertised to do","review":"I've used the trimmer a few times since getting it and so far so good. The vacuum feature actually works pretty well. I don't have a lot of facial real estate to cover, so I don't have to empty it as often as others might. It doesn't catch all the hair, but I'd say 95% of it.The construction seems a little flimsy. I wouldn't like to see how it would react to a sudden impact with a tiled bathroom floor. That's about the only negative aspect I can think of.What I really like is the adjustable guard. It's much nicer not having all those attachments. All I have to do with this one is dial the length I want and I'm all set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had purchased this sooner","review":"I grew a goatee a couple of years ago and was using what I thought was a decent groomer. That perspective changed once I started using the T980 Turbo. What a difference! It has dramatically cut the amount of time that it takes to groom my goatee. And it's more comfortable and much more accurate for a far superior result. Plus, this one does a great job of catching all of the clippings making it a very clean and effortless experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norelco T980: Does what it says","review":"This unit has performed as advertised.

My mistake. The unit is apparently not designed for heavy, thick or long beard hair, as it does not trim that well, the vacuum just clogs up and then blades tend to pull rather than cut smoothly. The blade guard (?) just lets hair jam up against the blades, which again makes for a less comfortable trim. My plan is to now get a much simpler version of this type trimmer and go back to trimming as I have always done it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy the thing","review":"I did the same thing you are doing right now. I researched a number of competing trimmers and read all of the comments. I finally decided upon this one and am now just utterly confused with what must be wrong with those who didn't give the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo a good review.-the vacuum works great, not a hair on the floor yet-not once have i experienced the standard \\"ouch\\" moment when shavers catch-The charge lasts for a looong time and recharge is really quick-the length setting is solid and doesn't slipI have a sneaky suspicion that many of the bad reviews are from people who complain about anything when given the opportunity.

Theliterature with the Norelco didn't give a smidgen of help.

But once I figured out how to position the thing and use it correctly, I found it to be just fine. Very much worth the price.

This product had good ratings so I gave it a try. Overall it does an good job but the flaw lies in that it is super bulky and it isn't good for close up trims. What I mean by this is I have a goatee but because the trimmer is so large, it isn't good for trimming the mustache area right above the lip. For all other purposes and general grooming it is fine but the bulk is an issue for very detailed areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good trimer for the $$$","review":"I bought this to replace and old Wahl vacuum-style trimmer I had for years. So far after a couple of weeks I can't complain about this unit. I have still not drained the initial charge, but it is a much better trimmer than the Wahl ever was. It gets about 95% of the clippings (I can trim with a dress shirt on) and I only need one pass, where the Wahl needed two or three. The trimmers adjustment knob does have some wiggle as other reviewers have mentioned, which hopefully will not get worse over time. I wish the trimmer guide was made out of better plastic, it looks/feels somewhat brittle. Lastly, though it has little plastic nubs so it doesnt roll, I wish it came with a stand or holder. My holder for my Wahl trimmer will have to suffice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've used better","review":"This trimmer is marketed toward facial hair and sideburns, and that's all it's good for. Anything finer than coarse facial hair jams up the vacuum system, so forget about buzz cuts or body grooming. When the vacuum part is backed up, it blocks hair from entering the blades, forcing you to clean it several times per trimming session. The vacuum is weak at best, and left me cleaning up almost as much hair from my counter as my previous, non-vacuum trimmer. Although I've enjoyed Norelco products in the past, this one has been a disappointment and will be on its way back to Amazon tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wear your glasses!","review":"It trimmed without inflicting pain. Thats the best I can say about this machine. The setting indicator is so small I need my reading glasses to insure I've got it right. Swiching to the sideburn/edge trimmer involves removing the adjustable guide, the trimmer head, and replacing with the edge trimming head. Part alignment must be perfect of they don't fit. Replacing the guide comb requires precision as well. A pop-up trimmer would have solved those problems.The vacuum is gimmick that works more or less, but the recepticle can pop open without warning and dump lots of little trimmings everywhere. The carrying case does not seal... just a velcro flap... so when packed, bristles can get spread around your suitcase.I dropped it yesterday, and broke one of the trim heads. I was unable to find replacement parts online, and I must say I was relieved to be forced to replace this unit with a better designed model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I bought the T980 to replace a trusty T765 that had finally died after several years. Bad idea! The plastic hair chamber fell apart after just a few months. The length setting adjustment slips-- it doesn't lock in place as advertised-- so I cut my beard shorter than I wanted to. And the turbo function doesn't really help anyway; it drops a lot of whiskers. So I went back to the T765 and I'm glad I did-- fewer bells and whistles but it does the job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok trimmer","review":"Not too bad but could be better.Instructions stink.Haven't owned it long so maybe it will get better with age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After all the other reviews I read on this I guess I expected too much. It's another piece of China junk. The on/off switch is too large so it's constantly getting turned off in use. The adjustable attachment for length fell off between cutting strokes & I gouged me beard. That sucked!I was expecting a better trimmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this trimmer","review":"I agree...with the negative reviews. I really like the guide on Norelco trimmers but that is about it for this latest model. I threw it away 2 days after I received it. I practically shaved off my goatee after it switched from the 3 to the 1 setting by itself. The vacuum doesn't work all that well and if you travel, it is so easy to accidentaly turn this on as it just takes the slightest pressure on the switch to start it up. Bad news all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowest setting isn't short enough!!!","review":"I like the concept of this trimmer with the vacuum and all, but I'm really annoyed that the people who make these things won't tell you what lengths the comb settings will trim to. Even if you go to a store to look at one, they have it all sealed in plastic that you have to cut open just to take a look at it. So I got this thing home to see if it would trim to my preferred length, and no it won't. I'm liking the stubble look, and about 3-4 days growth looks best on me. This trimmer only goes down to what represents 7-8 days growth for me. I have another Panasonic trimmer that works fine, but it has the same issue. I can take the comb off and cut the stubble down to about one day's length and then let it grow back a few days, but I'm getting really tired of doing that. I think these manufacturers should specify their trimming lengths so you can do a reasonable buying comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beard trimmer, Stubble creator","review":"I purchased this product because blades are too expensive these days and I'm just not a morning person. I like the stubble look so after searching product reviews, purchasers of the 980 seemed confident in it's ability to take care of business on setting #1.It does a great job, 90% of hair gets sucked into the trap. No facial irritation.The only thing you may need is a regular razor to shape your beard's edges. With the length guard removed you can get pretty close but if you want no hair there you'll need to resort to trimming to zero length then shaping with a razor (while not perfect in that it can't do it all, the results are perfect)!Pros:Lightreasonably quietno oiling!grip it by the twist height adjuster and it works greatCons:doesn't have a foil-like shaver attachment for removing hair to zerono stand/dock (only a neg for people who have no place to hide it)not a smart chargerI believe it's an old style battery so don't expect it to last as long as lithium"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Shaver, Bad Trimmer...","review":"This trimmer has a dial-like setting for determining the length of hair. Unfortunately the razor has a VERY bad spring/strength mechanism for holding the desired length in place; i.e.: I like to shave at a \\"3\\" and by the mere act of pressing the razor against my face [HEAVAN FORBID!!], it pushes the guide down to level \\"2\\" & \\"1\\" which are closer to the blades and lead to considerably shorter hair. I thought this was simply a manufacturing fluke when I first bought it, so I returned the trimmer directly to Norelco (very friendly service). The replacement they sent was 'stiffer' for a couple of months, but now it's back to the same ol' defect - I'm left with a beard that looks like I just haven't shaved for a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"The vacuum works better on this one than my older Norelco. I'm not sure why I need to press 2 buttons to get the good vacuum speed. Fast and easy to use. When putting the comb back on the trimmer, make sure it responds to the height adjustment ring. It's all too easy to put the comb on wrong which is typical of the Norelco beard trimmers."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth, no nicks, no cuts, no pulling","review":"This is one great trimmer.

The zoom dial adjusts by itself even with the slightest pressure while trimming giving an uneven cut and closer trim than was desired.

Noise level is unusually high, but that's least of my concerns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best if used in the USA only","review":"In this day and age when almost all portable electronic products are universal power based, I regret to inform you that the Norelco Trimmers are mono voltage and cannot be operated outside the US. The unit can be charged only from (110v /120V). Neither the Philips nor the Amazon websites point this out to buyers.Since I travel outside of the US quite a bit, it is a big hassle to use this trimmer with a voltage converter.

I chose the Norelco T980 trimmer. I am pretty much bald except for around the back and sides so I use the trimmer as my hair clipper. Because of the vacuum, it is noiser than the other trimmer but it collects all the hair, so that more than makes up for the noise. To use the nose/ear trimmer you have to pull off the clipper head and install the trimmer head. With the older model you merely slid the trimmer forward.

I really liked the old Norelco so I thought I would get the same brand. This trimmer had all of the features that I wanted and I figured that since the price was so high it must ba a great trimmer. Boy was I wrong. I have a fairly thin curly beard that this trimmer just could not handle. It would not cut some places at all. Using the hilarious \\"turbo\\" button just makes it louder and does nothing for performance. After leaving my beard a patchy mess I decided to just shave the whole thing. Even with the guide off it could barely shave my beard. This trimmer is virtually worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norelco Turbo Vacuum Trimmer","review":"turbo is unnecessary, and there does not appear to be a benefit...vacuum is great addition to product...trimmer setting can change while in use if you push the trimmer too hard against your face...trimmer settings different than previous norelco trimmer (not a good difference)...for my beard, the previous product set on #2 was too close and on the turbo trimmer, the setting is not close enough (#1 setting is too close)...Carrying case is so soft it is useless if you travel and want to protect the product, and the second trimming head...previous product had a cord that plugged directly into the socket...this trimmer has a bulky transformer attached...removal of trimming heads is not easy enough...on occassion the trimming head came off so strangly that it was dropped on the floor...not happy with this product although, as previously stated, the vacuum is really a great addition"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got my designer stubble groove on!","review":"This trimmer is exactly what I needed. I read all the positive reviews and decided to give it a try. Truly impressed!The vacuum suction keeps the basin clean and it is a breeze to use. The charge lasts a long time and pulling it apart for cleaning is very easy. I occasionally use a compressed air can to thoroughly clean it once a month.I love the way you can choose the size of trim with a simple twist, but I use the trimmer bare or at setting \\"0\\" to get that fashionable stubble look. The stubble helps because my skin does not respond well to razor shavers.It probably takes me 5 minutes in the morning to do and lasts all day. The given attachment also helps with closer trims and helps fine tune the trim, so no need to follow through with a razor shaver.Also the carrying case they included was useful during travel too and accommodates other toiletries. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best beard trimmer that I've ever owned","review":"I have had this trimmer for about a month now. It is easily the best beard trimmer of the many that I have owned. Exceptionally well thought out, simple design is very user friendly. The vacuum feature, which I was actually pretty skeptical about, works extremely well: there are only a few clippings that fall to the sink or countertop requiring cleanup after trimming. Cleaning of the trimmer itself is a snap as well. The depth gauge, blade head and vacuum collection chamber all simply pull off and on smoothly without any difficulty lining them up or anything like that. I also really like the feature of running off either corded or cordless. I can use the battery to complete depletion and then finish the trim using the cord. This will allow me to fully discharge the battery and, hopefully, give it a longer life. I haven't actually had the battery run down yet -- even I use it 2-3 times per week -- so I'm liking battery life as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"A great product. The vacuum feature works very well, leaving little to no cleanup. Battery life is long-lasting as well, even when constantly using the Turbo function."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the T980","review":"I like this trimmer. The turbo vacuum catches most of the hair, though not all, especially when switching from the accessory heads. I can now trim my beard at the sink with a fraction of the cleanup that was required with my old trimmer that didn't have a vacuum. I really like the \\"specialty Mini-Beard trimmer attachment\\" which allows me to easily shape my beard and moustache while still using the vacuum. That was one of my hesitations before purchasing the trimmer, but it has exceeded my expectations. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and the value I've recieved for the money spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This is a pretty good trimmer.

Thumbs Up !!","review":"This trimmer does exactly what it is supposed to do, and does it very nicely. The turbo function though a bit noisy, but very handy. The vacuum function sucks most of the hairs, so there is less mess around when I am done trimming. Though its not perfect, and for sure hairs do fell off but again way less messy than other trimmers. Battery time is good, easier to handle, its a little but, just a little bit on the heavier side. One thing that I might complain about is the ability to cut the longer hair, lets just say its not perfect for that. But I think its a very good purchase for the money, and after I've used it now, I would buy it again. Thumbs up from me !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, Not Great","review":"I've had a beard for over 35 years and used various trimmers and shapers including Norelco.I love the fact that I can use it corded or cordless beacuse sooner or later the battery is not charged or dies.If the battery dies (AND THEY ALL DO) in many trimmers you have to trash the whole unit. This model seems to not have that issue so that's a plus.What I do not like is the vacuum. Come on, I mean simply let everything fall in the sink, scoop and flush. It's just another thing to clean and maintain. My real issue is the vacuum shield gets in the way while I trim my beard. It moves as you trim but blocks my visual for pinpoint trimming.In anycase so far so good and does seem well made as my other Norelco products."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is OK","review":"It is OK. It does its job. You need time to become more accustomed with it. You need to pass it a couple of times until the surface is really even. But eventually you receive what you wanted. I tried to use this device for other parts of the body and it works. Of course you should be more careful. It can be easily dismantled for cleaning or razor head exchange and assembled again. The cleaning is not very easy, probably because of the brush. The vacuum collects up to 95% of the cut hairs and the rest should be collected manually, but, I think, it is still worth. A battery keeps its charge very well and a recharge process is easy and quick. It is very helpful too that it can be used with a cord power supply. I do not have an experience with other trimmers and cannot compare it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed","review":"Worked will at first then within the first couple months of ownership plastic parts began to fail, generally when the unit was being taken apart for regular cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"No point in saying what has been said, but GET THIS TRIMMER!","review":"Few notes... its NOT a shaver.

I keep my goatee pretty short, and my first time using this i knocked it down realllll close (more so than my liking). Was my fault, I put guard on 4, tried and was too long, put on 2 and well... was too short.Anyway, I love the vacuum aspect. I had no mess from when I did trim it. I also had no mess when I used on my back.Def worth getting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I just received the Philips Nerelco T980 and I am impressed. Feels great in your hand and trims amazingly well without shooting hair all over your bathroom. Only thing is make sure you open the hatch over your garbage because it doesn't slide out... It's just a hatch so beware. Overall, very happy so far. I also got it in less than 2 days after I purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trimmer","review":"I bought this trimmer to replace an older Norelco trimmer for my husband and this one is much better.

My husband is very satisfied with this trimmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A veteran trimmer says \\"Not at all what I was hoping for\\"","review":"I have had several trimmers over the years, and while I'm still using this after 9 months, it isn't what I was hoping for. My biggest issues are as follows... The beard setting that determines the length of the beard can shift unknowingly to a shorter length as the trimmer is pressed to the face. Also this unit cannot trim the area of the mustache just beneath the nostrils - I still need to use scissors. Finally, it is not easy to remove the beard length piece to perform a close trim right above the lip. I would not recommend this and I am only leaving this review as I am on Amazon looking for a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I expected - pretty good","review":"I've had no problem with my trimmer. It stays on the number I set it on and performs well. The vacuum is loud, but then again, it's a vacuum so it's bound to be loud. It catches over half of the hairs, may closer to three-quarters. It makes cleanup a lot less involved than it used to be with my old trimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"amzing","review":"It came with a sealed pakage.

Turns out I was wrong. This thing actually works really well. My girlfriend is happy that there isn't hair all over the place anymore, and I'm happy that I don't have to clean up (and apparently leave a lot behind, as my girlfriend likes to point out) hair scattered around the bathroom.The other reviews are right about the turbo mode, though. It is both necessary to catch most of the hair and very loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - Poor design","review":"My Norelco T900 was great, but broke recently, so I went out looking for another one, only to find it was discontinued. Didn't see any Norelco trimmers comparible to my old trimmer. Bought a T980, took it home, and found out the first trim... its junk (I'm being nice with my wording). Overall, its too big to easily hold. Worst of all, the trim height setting moves when you press it against your face... so during my first trim, it ruined my goatee. Not a good trimmer, period. Too big, too much bling. I don't need a vacuum cleaner built into my trimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it elsewhere","review":"Great product but it is cheaper at drugstore.com.

(I learned to check this out first) Don't recharge this NiCad Battery unless its totally discharged because you will damage the battery by recharging every time you use it and don't leave it plugged in either. Just charge it when it quits that is all!! Took a little looking to find the rotating ring that sets the height (or depth) of the hair but it works fine. I found that I look better if I use two heights for different areas. I like the two speed and I Love the vacuum for not leaving hair everywhere. After using it I can't imagine using anything that does not clean up after itself (vacuum that is) I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one...","review":"This product is really cool one from Phillips.

I feel my experience is consistent with most reviews presented. The trimmer does a great job, is easy to adjust, and the vacuum function works very well. Again, does not get 100% of clippings, but I would say at least 80% are caught. One shortcoming is that this likely would not work well for long thick beards as the longest setting does not seem that long to me, but I'm just speculating since I keep my beard short so this is not a problem for me. I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"Product received in non-working condition. It would not turn on.

So I ordered it on Amazon. I am very pleased with the purchase. It does a good job, maintains a nice charge, and I was amazed at how well it vacuums the trimmed beard hairs into the waste compartment. When I had used a scissors to trim my beard, the results were just so-so and there was always a big mess to clean up. But this produt does a very nice job and it makes very little to no mess. I reccomend this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the lot...","review":"Finding a shaver that works well for me has been more than a challenge. This is the best one I have found so far. While the little vacumn may seem like a gimmick, it actually works very well compared to not using a vacumn at all - don't expect perfection - BUT it is very good. It is nice not to have to do a major sink clean.As with all shavers I have not been able to catch the hair right below my nose - and thus require and additional device (the flip up here is still too big...).I will say that this is much better to use than the Remington 3000 that I have seen selling for nearly $100 on Amazon (which I originally bought for $50).I generally like the shave.I would recommend that this be the first one you try - you may not want to go to any others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer- No complaints","review":"I bought the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer because the older version I had died after about 3 years of use. Overall, I enjoy using this trimmer. The adjustments stay in place and do not \\"jump\\" while in use. The vacuum doesn't get every little stray hair but I would say 95% are caught when I use the turbo function. The vacuum power of this model is much better than other brands I have tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slowly dying of thirst for some good Satch","review":"I am a long time Satch fan, have all the albums, etc. I use to love his music despite its sometimes shallow nature and its regular disregard for instruments other than the guitar. A lot of Joe's music is evocative and inspiring. This album, however, with the exception of 'searching' and 'bamboo' was a waste of money. Joe can't sing or write even passable lyrics. Some of the tunes on this album are so boring and lifeless that they sound like something a band of teenager might produce. In fact, my step-son just brought home a demo of his friends band that I enjoyed more. I forced myself to listen to this Satch album every day for a week looking for the good stuff and haven't listened to it since. It has nothing of the old Satch in it. Sounds a little like the worst of the Extremist. Buy Blue Dream, Crystal Planet or the self title instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same song different day","review":"I bought it, I listened to it several times, and I hoped I would hear something new from Joe, but I haven't. What a waste that such a brilliant guitarist has confined himself to the myopic dimensions of rock. But, can we blame him...that's where the money is, and hey, we all gotta eat. I would dearly love to see Mr. Satriani stop playing the Testosterone Two-step and explore jazz, but it doesn't look like it will happen in my lifetime. This album is good...not great, but definitely good as are all of his other works. Buy it if you must, but don't expect to be surprised. It's just more of the same stuff Joe's been cranking out since 1989."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best (or close to it) Satch CD Ever","review":"This CD rocks! Some guitarists can play notes in perfect time and with consistant acuracy but can not put together many songs that make you want to bob your head while you crank up the volume. Satriani continues to combine all of the technical skills that make up a great guitarist with a cool groove that makes his somgs special. This CD captures his groove as well as any he's released. A must have for any rock fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satch boogies on","review":"Guitar hero Joe Satriani returns with what might be his best album since \\"Surfing With The Alien\\". Now in his late forties, Joe started out teaching guitar with students such as Steve Vai, Kirk Hammett and Charlie Hunter. Vai scored a gig with with David Lee Roth and praised his teacher and the rest is history. \\"Is There Love In Space\\" is simple, satisfying Satriani. Free of gimmickry, Joe just burns from start to finish. It's a myth that guitar instrumental albums are just for other guitar players. This is just great rock and roll and belongs in anybody's collection who appreciates an incredibly talented musician. Thanks Joe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar God","review":"Once again Satch has outdone himself. On the Spinal Tap scale of 1 to 11 this is a 10 1/2. He sings on two songs (I could do without the vocals) and that's the only downside. Tracks 1 to 4 are smoking with track 2, UP IN FLAMES, clearly my favorite. Has a \\"Surfing W/ The Alien\\" feel to it. A must have for any Satch/Vai fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy listening hard rock","review":"Bland offering from the electric guitar virtuoso is not without it's spectacular moments of soloing grandeur, though Satriani's penchant for sucky rhythm-based guidance along with some ill-advised vocal indulgences often kills any gaining momentum. He attempts to somewhat atone for this late in the game but it comes too little, too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satch hits bottom","review":"This is the only Satriani album that I don't go back to and listen to again and again. Actually, that's not true; since I bought it, I go back to it about once a year and listen to it all the way through 3 or 4 times again. Every time, I come back to feeling disappointed by this album.I guess what it comes down to is that not one song here is memorable and not one song is catchy. With every one of his releases prior to this, I've wanted to listen to the new CD for 4-8 weeks straight, before I'd even think about putting another CD into my car or truck. With this one though, I had it changed by the end of the first week.I'm not saying that the CD is bad per se; I'm just saying that it isn't good and it doesn't sound like Satch."},{"rating":"1","title":"meat and potatoes rock","review":"This is probably Joe Satriani's worst cd. There is very little creativity in it. Pretty much just formulaic rock. It's a huge step below some of his masterpieces, such as \\"Crystal Planet\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standard Satriani","review":"This is a great album, but it's hard for a player like Joe to continuously push the bar even further ahead. There are some really cool tracks here like Gnaahh, Hands in the Air, If I could Fly, and the title track. Searching is great - very reminiscent of The Forgotten Part II from Flying in a Blue Dream. I don't much care for Joe singing, however, and the two vocal songs are only mediocre. If you love Satch, you'll most likely love this album, but it doesn't give you that \\"holy %$&!\\" feeling as did Surfing with the Alien and Crystal Planet. I remember the first time I heard Up in the Sky from Crystal Planet; the opening riff blew me away. Never quite got that feeling on this album, but I got enough other great riffs, melody and mood from Joe that I'm more than content. Rock on."},{"rating":"2","title":"MELODIC, BLUESEY, FUTURISTIC, HARD ROCK","review":"If you like melodic hard rock guitar instrumentals you will like this album. It's not as hard as \\"Surfing with the Alien\\" and \\"Crystal Planet\\" albums but it's close. It has two songs with vocals \\"Lifestyle\\" and \\"I like the rain\\", the rest are instrumentals. \\"Is there love in space?\\", \\"Just look up\\", \\" Searching\\", and \\"Bamboo\\" are slow songs, the rest of the songs are harder and faster. \\"Gnnaahh\\" has a good melody as does \\"If I could fly\\" though I think \\"If I could fly\\" goes on just a little too long. \\"The souls of distortion\\" is good, Joe gets some weird sounds out of his guitar. I like Joe's hard and fast songs, I don't care for slow songs. There's 7 hard, fast songs and 4 slow ones.

It was a different title and the same words. In my opinion this is a scam and it is OK for people with a new puppy but it was nothing new for me. I just got a Yellow Lab who is 17 months old to replace my Black Lab who I had to put down 3 years ago. I don't need the book and would be glad to give it to someone who needs it. I would like to know something new. Many people don't know anything about dogs but I do. I have raised 4 of them. They are smarter than people generally. You have to spend time with them and talk to them and make them understand you. Then have treats ready. They will follow you anywhere.

I bought it on a friend's recommendation years ago and found it so useful that on the very rare occasions that I breed a litter, I include a copy with the \\"New Owners Pack\\" that goes with a puppy to its new home. The advice is very sensible and clear. Even dog owners of long standing can learn lots of new tips. The discussions on crate training and house training, preventing aggression and dominance problems and the advisability of obedience training are excellent but whole book is uniformly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptional book on how to raise & socialize your puppy:)","review":"This is an exceptional book!! I was interested in the both the physical & the mental growth & development of puppies & this book completely fit the bill:) It also relates really good activties & skills as well as some disciplinary strategies to promote good growth & development in your dog.

It doesn't cover everything but its a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oustanding and informative","review":"Oustanding and informative book, especially for the first time puppy owner. Explains in detail the emotional, physical and social development of a puppy.

This book was suggested to me by a friend and I'm glad she made the recommendation. It's a fairly quick read and covers a lot of territory, to include the pup's developmental stages and the importance of you, the alpha dog, making a favorable imprint on that development and the dog's personality. Basic training techniques are covered as well as discussion of pitfalls owners can potentially encounter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aptly Named Book","review":"Good book on training a new puppy.

As a Kennel owner I recommend this book very highly. The infomation is presented in an easy to read format and pertains to every puppy, no matter what breed. Every puppy we sell is accompanied with this book as they leave. I only wish more people would read it before they purchased a puppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"This book is very informative for every phase of bringing a puppy into your life - from preparation before the puppy comes, to what to expect through his complete development. I got the book as soon as my husband and I started looking for a puppy, and pulled it out for a review of what to expect on the first day once we found out we were getting one for sure. The information in the book has helped make us feel completely prepared for what to expect, how to control the environment, and how to react in situations that might have otherwise seemed beyond our control. We feel confident we are getting our pup off to a great start, and that he will grow into a wonderful adult dog. I also bought \\"Puppy Primer\\" and \\"Good Owners, Great Dogs\\" at the same time. All three are excellent books, but I keep finding myself turning to \\"How to Raise a Puppy...\\" most often. I think it's because it's not too short, not too long, but just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marcykelly","review":"As a first time puppy owner, I picked this book to help me figure out how to start on the correct foot from the beginning. I've found the information very helpful as it describes in detail the stages of a dogs development and ways to enhance their early learning experiences to broaden their horizons and essentially help them be a better dog because of exposure to those experiences. I have also found it a little frightening because a lot of what is suggested is for the period during which the breeder has the puppy and I don't have any control over what happens while he is there, so I have to just hope that the breeder is doing all the \\"things\\" that the pup needs to be a well balanced dog. I guess it is good if you are a breeder and want to know what to do with a 3 week old pup. Overall, a good read. Helpful suggestions for socializing the young pup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspensful and Refreshing","review":"California Angel is a nice break from the normal criminal and legal thriller we are drawn to. The more I got into this book, the more I couldn't put down. Raymond's character was so heartfelt and I couldn't wait to see what happened to him and how Toy and himself would eventually intwine later in life. I couldn't wait for Toy to dump her husband and it couldn't be too soon. Joey was a God's send (no pun intended) for Toy and you knew he would guide her right from their first meeting. I loved the ending (usally I am disappointed and endings finish to quickly) and not giving anything away I felt renewed in faith that maybe this isn't such a bad and troubled world and there are people making a difference, if not only for a few hours of reading. Get reading for the Christmas season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I've had no problems so far with this thermostat.

I mounted a regular thermometer next to the area where the probe was placed to help regulate the temperature better in the warm area of my vivarium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not give temperature","review":"It's simple: this device lets you change the heat setting of your heaters, IT DOES NOT GIVE YOU TEMPERATURE RATINGS. So, if you set it to high, your heaters will remain on until the \\"high\\" setting of the device is reached. If you set it to \\"low\\", your heaters will remain on until the \\"low\\" setting of the device is reached. Ridiculous isn't it? Why didn't they just include a thermometer to allow you to set the temperature you want the heaters to go on and off at, like the Hygrotherm the same company makes? If you don't mind doing the work of finding the corresponding temperature to the setting of this \\"as useful as a doorstop\\" item, then you will love it. Me, I don't want to waste my time, so I returned this and bought the Hygrotherm, and plugged in an adapter to allow me to plug in my three heaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO temperature gauge","review":"A thermostat without a temp gauge is really not worth it , pay more money and get one with a digital temp readout. I sure wish I did.What blows my mind is I read all of the reviews and yet, somehow I missed this, rechecked and I guess no one thought it worth mentioning.So now I have to go purchase a good digital remote sensing thermometer, I will most likely end up spending more money then if I have purchased a Thermostat which included a digital readout of the temp its senor was picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Edit: came back and read that a lot of people had luck with this product.

I do recomend this thermometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not control temperature that well","review":"The package says that it will \\"give you precise temperature control within the range of 70 F to 110 F\\". Mine, set to the lowest setting (which to me should be 70 F) does not cut off until 89 F. There is nothing precise about 19 degrees over the set point. I am very disappointed with this product and want a refund.

When choosing your preferred temperature, one has to guess how hot to set it and modify with time. If it were able to show a range (70 - 75 degrees, etc.) as opposed to the cool-to-warm color gradient on the dial, I think it would be much more useful. All three failed within two years, and I shan't be replacing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died in under a month","review":"This product worked decently at first, however it died after less than a month of use (the day after the return cut-off date, of course).

In the case that your pets are highly temperature sensitive please carefully monitor this system in case of sudden failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke 5 months later","review":"I bought this for my hedgehog's cage and haven't been very happy with it. I found it was a bit difficult to regulate and the temperature didn't always seem to hold steady. In hindsight I wish I had gotten a digital thermostat so I could know what temperature I was setting it to, and it looks like now I will go ahead and do that since this one doesn't work any longer. The other day I noticed the light was on, however the temperature on the digital thermometer I keep in his cage was really low. When I felt the lamp, it was cool and I realized the lamp wasn't on. I thought it might be the bulb, however when I plugged it into the wall, the bulb heated up, so it had to be the thermostat. Unless you are really tight on funds, I'd recommend going ahead and spending a little more on a higher quality thermostat. Five months is not very long, especially considering it just sat on top of his cage with me occasionally adjusting the temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working","review":"I used this for my Ceramic Heat Emitter set up for my hedgehog. The dial sucks, it goes from low to high. It would be nice if you could set it to a temperature. About two weeks after having it, it stopped working.

This means that if you make a mistake, and accidentally delete a design or part of a design that you may have spent hours on, there is no way of getting it back.

Plus there are more errors where there is not enough space here to include. It is too bad because the book looks real nice but never judge a book by it's cover.

I thought maybe things had gotten better and bought this book - much to my regret. I can not read it, it is so bad. I have forced myself to read the first 70 pages, but I doubt I will finish it. Is Woodiwiss a pseudonym and someone else writing these novels? The writing is different. Please bring back the original author(s).

After the first chapter, I was sorely disappointed. This was nothing like KW's normal writing style. Everything seemed overly dramatic and unreal. Perhaps even a bit forced. I had to force myself to even get through the first few chapters. I am about 1/2 way through and still have yet to finish it.

As one person asked and I agree, has she lost all respect for her readers' intelligence? Her sentences ramble and become confusing and her use of pronouns has one constantly attempting just to whom she is referring. The story line is similar to her others and that in itself is enough to deem it boring but the writing makes it even more so...and her characters could be plucked from so many other historical romances that there was nothing about them that held my interest. It was all I could do to finish the book and after I had I was angry with myself that I had wasted my valuable time."},{"rating":"1","title":"God it pains me to say, but I couldn't even finish it.","review":"I love Kathleen Woodiwiss of old - books like A Rose in Winter, Shanna, and Come Love A Stranger are some of the best in romance out there, I believe. She had passion, strength and the ability to craft a story so incredible...This novel, I struggled through the first few chapters and couldn't force myself to continue it. I really wanted to get into the story, but the overdone language was a huge barrier. The characters were a bit flighty and I couldn't seem to muster up enough emotion to care about them.

But THe Flame and the FLower and The Elusive Flame are written so well and I got caught up in it. I was just disappointed Jeffreys story got killed by writing.

I came to the conclusion, about 40 pages into the most stultified prose I've ever read, that I would have been better off with Tom Clancy. Even the BEST author can't make an introduction of 8 people last 80 pages and keep the dialogue flowing. Her characters have no personality; I could not find anything likeable about Colton, and Ariana came off as a silly bimbette. Plot? I couldn't parse through the prose far enough to get to a plot, although of course Roger did it; that he was a villain (whatever the crime) was obvious from his first entrance.

She was way too descriptive in her writing. I definitely need dialogue to keep me involved in the story. It was so hard to get past those first pages. The story itself wasn't great either. I didn't understand why Colton would all of a sudden desire Adriana and why she would be so upset with him. She was SIX when he left!! That was the most baffling thing. The way Ms. Woodiwiss wrote the story, it sounded as if Adriana was heartbroken that her teenage crush had left, but no, she was only a baby. It just made no sense. I continually skipped over all the parts with Felicity and Roger. Overall, this was a horribly developed book and I am glad I only borrowed it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid!","review":"Is this supposed to be a parody of every negative thing that can be said about romance? If not, it should be. Perfectly ponderous prose. Cardboard characters whose often mentioned traits are more irritating than intriguing. A confused, convoluted plot line. The only thing \\"magical\\" about this book is how short-lived wolfhounds are bounding about at 18. Save your money. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Confusing","review":"Actually I didn't want to read this book but I had to review it for a German publisher and I hated every minute I had to spend on \\"The Reluctant Suitor\\". It's such a confusing and badly written story. Don't get me wrong, I really loved Kathleen E. Woodiwiss earlier books but her downfall came with this two strange short stories and the book \\"A Season Beyond a Kiss\\". This new book is simply not worth the hardcover price and the effort you have to put in it for reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A reluctant reviewer","review":"The Flame and the Flower, Ashes in the Wind and Shanna are among my all-time favorite romance reads, but I honestly could not finish The Relactant Suitor. The cumbersome prose was painful to read, and Ariana's devastation over Colton's rejection--at what, age six?--was ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute drivel","review":"I couldn't even get through the first chapter. The author takes PAGES to describe something that should be explained in one paragraph at the most. The descriptive terms used and the prose overall border on the ridiculous. As I skimmed through the remainder of the book, it did not seem to improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Miss The Kathleen Of Old","review":"I can't express how very sad I am about this book. I am a huge Kathleen fan and I just can't understand what happened to her to change her writing style so dramatically. Her earlier books were far and above the top in excellence. This book was hard to read and easy to put down. It took me from first release to just now to finish it. I gave her two stars simply because she is Kathleen and I adore her earlier work. Instead, read my favorite by her \\"A Rose In Winter\\" or another favorite \\"Ashes In The Wind\\" You'll be much, much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reluctant fan meets reluctant suitor.","review":"The best book I ever read is KW's \\"Shanna\\". I keep extra copies around just to loan out. And I keep waiting for another good book from her and have been disappointed. But I keep hoping, so I eagerly bought this hardcopy hot off the press. I've read 100 pages and still don't know what its about. A real waste of money. Thanks for Shanna BUT Sayonara, Kathleen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did she really write this?","review":"I have been a fan of Ms. Woodiwiss's for over 25 years and this book is awful! Where is the character development? There is so much exposition I skipped pages. After forcing myself to complete the book, I seriously had to ask myself if Ms. Woodiwiss actually wrote this book. It is so far off of her usual brilliance that the only saving grace is that I read the library's copy and didn't waste any money on actually purchasing it first.If you like good historical romance, do NOT read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"excruciating agony!","review":"Total crap -- everything in this book is total crap. And to the reviewer above who loved the book for its detail, please don't take that statement the wrong way. The detail isn't in the characterization or the intricacy of the plot, not the detail of historical setting. It's actually the detail of the stupid thoughts that go through the minds of our \\"hero\\" and \\"heroine.\\" The lackluster plot ought to give both of them something to think about, but instead all you hear is a repeated litany of trite nonsense. The whole book felt like a rambling repetition of story lines and conversations that ought to be in a romance, but strung along in such a way as to feel more like an ad-lib game where the author just filled conversation into a standardized plot like with inane remarks and violently vapid emotional outbursts.This review is merely an effort to protect would-be buyers looking for a good classic romance. This shouldn't even get the overall rating of 2 stars it has now."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book! I had a little trouble getting into it at first, but I read it in just a few days (and I'm a slow reader!). It didn't start out like Kathleen's other books, where you kind of knew what was going on, but once I could figure out who everybody was, (within the first 30 pages or so) I absolutely couldn't put it down. It was typical, fabulous Kathleen!! I have read all of her books at least twice. I've read Shanna 3 or 4 times. I will definitely reread this one in the future. If you are a Kathleen Woodiwiss fan, don't let the bad reviews deter you from this gem!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Former Reader of Kathleen Woodiwiss","review":"I read Kathleen Woodiwiss's earlier books -- Wolf and the Dove, Flame and the Flower, Shanna. Those were her best. The last two books that she has put out have been horrible, and this book was the worst. I thought after her last book, this would be much better. I could not get over the fact that she kept going over how \\"Colton acted when he left home and how horrible Adrianna felt.\\" That line went on throughout half the book.\\" \\"Adrianna couldn't have been that devastated -- she couldn't wait to marry him. If it was that bad -- she should have married someone else.\\" After reading this book, which I took out from the library (Thank God), I have given up reading anything that Ms. Woodiwiss puts out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't finish it","review":"I don't think I can finish this book. It is just awful.Maybe the only way to make it enjoyable would be to read it as a group and then get together with a few bottles of wine and review the more sordid passages. With enough alcohol that might be a hoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One of Her Best","review":"I think I skimmed more pages than I read and was still able to get the gist of the story. I have read several of Ms. Woodwiss' books and have enjoyed them tremendously. This book was so wordy and trying. If I had to read one more forthwith, I would have gone crazy. The best part was the ending with Roger getting his due."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"This was one of the worst books I have read in a long time. I kept thinking it had to get better, finally I gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disappointed","review":"I have been reading Kathleen Woodiwiss for the past 25 years and I must say this is the most disappointing work I have seen from her. Both main characters are unlikable and the side story of the baby and 'dead' mistress/wife who pops up later takes away from the relationship. If you collect all of Kathleen's books I would wait until this one comes out in paperback. If you must read it now, please check it out from the library and save yourself some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"I truly wonder how this book ever made it through the editing process. From the first page to the last, two otherwise intelligent people spend an inordinate amount of time obsessing about a stupid marriage contract. The title suggests that the suitor may be reluctant, but as far as I can tell, that was really not the case. And why in the world would the author throw in a dangerous murderer?? Maybe to liven up this dull story.Also, use of words such as \\"portal\\" and \\"winsome\\" began to irritate me about the second chapter. Felicity had such a \\"winsome\\" smile, nose, manner, face, backside, ....find another word!!If you still plan to buy and read this book, I would suggest buying it from the used section of Amazon.com or checking it out from the library so you don't waste [$$] on the hardback like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely disappointed","review":"As an avid fan of Kathleen Woodiwiss, I was absolutely disappointed with her latest work. The first half of the book was a real sleeper. On more than one occasion I considered putting it down for good. However, I managed through it until the end where I was definitely let down. Most of the action takes place in the last 100 pages of the book and even that is fairly lame. This book certainly is not the same caliber as The Flame and the Flower (a master work which I have read countless times), Come Love a Stranger, A Rose in Winter, or Shanna. In my opinion, the author did not spend enough time developing Colton and Adriana. I felt they were both too shallow for me to really be involved. I hope her next book will be more like the Kathleen of old."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"Fortunately, I bought this book at a discount. I had read the reviews but couldn't believe it was all that bad. It was. Scenes that normally would have inspired Ms. Woodiwiss to elaborate on were casually dismissed in 5 sentences. Plots to new events were explained later on, as an afterthought. At first I thought it was due to the translator that I got discouraged (English -> Dutch) who pleasantly mixed up names and family lines (throughout the book, Adriana was called Samantha or Felicity and Colton was involved in a small bout of multiple personality disorder when he was Roger or Riordan at one time or another) but I must agree with most reviewers. Do not buy this book! If you like Ms Woodiwiss' books, reread any book you have of her. It will keep you satisfied till something better comes along.... Although I do doubt I will buy any book of Ms Woodiwiss any time soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"With this one, I am giving up :-(","review":"Much like what has happened with Johanna Lindsay, alas. Very hard to believe that the same author who gave us the absolutely wonderful Flame and the Flower and The Wolf and the Dove is the same person who has written such unreadable books for the last decade or so. Even harder to think that this latest one is her hard cover debut. Get it from the library if you insist on still giving her work a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Woodiwiss Standard","review":"Kathleen Woodiwiss took too long to develop her plot in her latest novel. It is not up to the standard of The Flame and The Flower, The Wolf and the Dove or Shanna. Numerous times Ms. Woodiwiss repeated herself and the book seemed to drag. I always wait for her latest edition, but I was really disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reluctant Suitor","review":"As a life long KW fan, I was very disappointed in The Reluctant Suitor. KW should have used less lengthy description and concentrated more on development of the plot. I found myself skimming through paragraph after paragraph searching for the story to unfold. It never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really shocked....","review":"After many years of not reading romances I picked up this book and really regret it.This is not the Kathleen Woodiwiss I remember....The characters are okay. However the book is long, draggy, and has way too many subplots. Including an \\"evil villan\\" that abuses women. If I am reading a romance I don't like to read about \\"abuse\\".I am really shocked that Ms. Woodiwiss wrote this. All of her other books ahve been so wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck is this?","review":"I am 10 pages into the book. If this author isn't kidding, this is one of the worst books I have ever attempted to read! The prose is ludicrous, and if she mentions eyebrows one more time I'm going to scream. I am a fan of historical fiction, such as those written by Norah Lofts. This is just drivel......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic dialogue was the high point of this awful book.","review":"This is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. The characters were all annoying. The interaction between the two main characters was stilted and unbelieveable. The hero focused on the heroine's appearance rather than her inner self. I would have given this book zero stars if I could have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my time","review":"I absolutely love a good romance. I will even suffer through slow starts in the hopes that a book will improve. I put this book down and returned to it FOUR times, each time hoping that I would not get lost in the scenes that went on and on, FOREVER. Sadly, it was not to be.I didn't make it past page 100, nor will I attempt to do so again.My complaints? The prose that was stilted, the lack of character development, and the almost immediate fixation that Colton had for Adrianna's beauty and NOTHING else.My biggest complaint? There were a thousand and one references in those first 100 pages back to the when Colton knew Adrianna before he took off. The continuous references to the type person she was and her feelings for Colton and how his rejection affected her was simply ridiculous. She was SIX years old!!!!! True, there were hints at the person she would become, but not nearly to the extent that Ms. Woodiwiss dwells on this. It was tedious and very unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying To Be Jane Austen","review":"This book is truly awful. I just wish I had read the reviews before I spent $7.99 plus tax on it. I have loved many of this author's previous works, so I assumed it would be safe to spend my money. I was wrong. I wish I could get my money back plus damages for having to read this muck. It seems to me she is trying for the style of Jane Austen, but failing miserably. Note to the editors of the book: Just strike every other word from the text and this book will make more sense than it does now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Paper","review":"I read pages 1-118, and was still reading a story about events taking place on THE FIRST DAY the protagonists are reunited.I flipped back to look where day 2 begins, it's not until Chapter 5 on page 140.I threw the book in the trash.The first romance novel I ever read was Shanna, and that compelled me to read The Flame and the Flower and The Wolf and the Dove. I can't believe this was written by the same Kathleen Woodiwiss. What everyone else has said here is true; the book is interminable."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be a textbook for poor writing","review":"I remember reading The Flame and the Flower as a girl. I don't know what has happened to this author since then, but the prose could be an advertisement for poor writing.Every verb had an adverb, every noun an adjective(or two), and the sentences are not merely \\"run-on\\" -- they gallop in a writing style so embellished it is ludicrous. But far from enjoyable. Don't buy this book, you'll never get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm \\"relunctant\\" to ever read anything by this author again","review":"This was perhaps one of the worst books I have ever read. I finished it solely out of a sense of duty (for I hate to leave something I started unfinished). The plot was thin and the characters abrasive -- especially considering that their \\"love\\" seems forged out of an obsession with the superficial. The reluctant Colton only considers pursuing Adriana because of her pulchritude and throughout the novel her beauty and his handsomeness stands as the only foundation of their relationship. In my opinion, neither have redeemable qualities except token scenes where Adriana conveniently demonstrates maternal \\"instincts\\" with local orphan children.It seems not a page goes by without Colton praising Adriana for beauty that is ostensibly not only second to none but practically rivals Venus. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garage-sale worthy, but her other books are great","review":"I normally wait to buy my romance novels used, but I snatched this up at the store when I saw Kathleen Woodiwiss had a new book out! Unfortunately, I can't seem to make myself finish it. There were no challenges to this love story! The title and the book description on the back are both deceiving. Colton is hardly a \\"reluctant suitor\\" once he returns. He and Adriana fall in love with little difficulty and both characters seem annoyingly perfect. Woodiwiss' best characters in the past have been flawed but ultimately very likeable. These characters are very superficially written and are hard to identify with. Also, the other storylines in the novel are difficult to follow -- I found myself flipping ahead to avoid those extraneous subplots. Woodiwiss' other books really are wonderful; I'm just sad that this latest doesn't measure up. Not even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow ..I thought it was just me","review":"I was in for a long Doctor visit, (no appointment) so I knew I would be waiting forever..So I grabbed this book from home, thinking, hey Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, I will never notice the long wait...OMG it was awful...It was so full of detail, wasted detail... that meant nothing. I finally put the book away, and played solitaire on my cell phone. I love you Ms Woodiwiss..but this book was so unlike any you have written. It was just boring.I am glad someone liked it...I think getting it from your library was a good thing....you didn't have to spend a dime."},{"rating":"1","title":"did someone steal K. woodiwiss's name?","review":"i wish they offered a zero star rating option. There is no way that Kathleen Woodiwiss wrote this book unless it was a desperate attempt to overcome writers block. This was the worse book i've read in decades. I have all K.W's books but have found that i am more and more reluctant to spend the money to buy them as they seem to be getting progressivly worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers. This book was horrable. I too am a big fan having started with 'So worthy my love' and bacame a fan. But since A season beyond a kiss, was beyond boring, I've been hoping that her writting might improve. I have been let down. I think that KW has run out of ideas for her books and just falls back on flowery prose.Another thing, every time I have seen a Good review for her, it sounds more like a person form PR trying to convice the unaware public that the book is worth the money. Trust me it is not. Buy some of her other books and see for your self that this once great auther did have some talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment","review":"I had read all of Kathleen Woodiwiss's books years ago. When she finally came out with a new one, I was excited, hoping to be taken back again. This book just plain stunk! I was terribly disappointed from the opening pages. What struck me right off the bat was how there were these family dogs that were 17 years old and STIll alive and very active, having remembered Colton from when they were puppies! THAT is what made think that this is stupid. The things that were happening throughout the book were just so farfetched that I wondered if I was reading a regency romance or a book with superheroes in it. I had a really hard time getting through this book and I think that if Woodiwiss writes anything else, I'll just pass on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her finest work...","review":"I've been reading Woodiwiss novels for years and was eager to read her latest offering. So eager that I didn't even wait for it to come out in paperback. I wish I had. The story was slow and a chore to get through. As another reviewer so eloquently put it, what a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reluctant to Believe it is by Woodiwiss","review":"The Flame and the Flower is my all time favorite romance novel. I've purchased at least 6 copies over the years - due to loaning it out and not getting it back. I'm always eager to get her new works, but from the very first page of this one, I knew it just wasn't right. I felt that Woodiwiss was grasping for something to say. The story was good, but the endless flow of useless, flowery passages made it difficult to enjoy. The whole book was as if she didn't have enough words in the draft and someone else came in and added all the nonsense. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"Kathleen Woodiwiss has always been one of my favorite authors. I can't tell you how many times I have reread Shanna and Ashes in the Winds. There is no story here until the last twenty or so pages. Three chapters to get out of the front hall?!?

I kept thinking, \\"This has got to get better!\\" Well, let me warn you, every page is terrible and it never gets better. Adrianna, the spoiled heroine spends her entire life hurt and upset because she hears Colton state that he didn't want to marry her (AND SHE WAS SIX YEARS OLD)! Eventually, without a courtship, she marries him (sixteen years later) and they live happily ever after. Oh, and there are murders, sexual perversions and other side stories that make this a really boring book. There is no romance in this book so it should not even be called a romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reluctant Suitor","review":"I am a life long KW fan that was VERY disappointed with The Reluctant Suitor. The story lacked any type of plot development as KW concentrated on her poor use of sentence structure. I would classify this novel as an \\"evocative\\" boor that ran-on about nothing for 300 pages. It would have been a fine short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Exceeds Low Expectations!","review":"Low budget films have their charm. I watched this preview with a slight smirk on my face, but as it progressed my expressions changed to sheer delight. I love watching amateur acting and shoddy camera work because I know it's practice for more amateur acting and shoddy camera work. This movie, like many other films of its caliber aren't gonna move you with empathy --maybe you are noticing that from the shrewdness of this review. This type of movie is sure to give you a few laughs, and checking it out is worth the small rental or purchase fee. I guarantee you'll get a unique experience not offered anywhere in a major theater or even the most extensive Netflix Horror Movie list.

I was disappointed and didn't even make it through. I was not open to the way the book started by stating you should ask family to financially support the adoption. I made the mistake of leaving it out and my mom picked it up and had the exact reaction I did - not good. Maybe the points were better later in the book but I would never give this to a family member because it seemed like I would be asking them for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for everyone","review":"This book was great.

Everyone's intentions are always good; this book helps your family to better understand how you might be feeling and to really be supportive, as they had really wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a read","review":"This book is worth reading and offers some good insight. It's a concise book that by no means covers everything but is a good starting point. If you're early in the adoption process then I'd recommend reading it.

Also it was insensitive to the fact that race plays a role in these dynamics - perhaps the author didn't feel she could speak to this personally; but then her approach should have been much less grandiose and over-arching.Instead on intimate partner violence, I recommend:America's Dream.

Much of the book deals with shooting in a traditional fashion, such as not using sights (line up along the arrow and cant the bow) and how to let the string roll off your fingers.I shoot with sights and I use a mechanical release (this is a string holding device and lets you release the arrow after pulling a small trigger).

After this tragic even, Tony decides to leave Stanacombe and to live with Marina's sister Lucy and her husband Matt Prior. They possess a grandiose and remote mansion called Otherways which was the only house built by a strange Edwardian architect.Soon Tony, still plagued by the memories of Marina, is strongly attracted to Lucy and at the same time discovers a letter which states that Otherways was the setting of the mysterious murder committed in 1939 known as \\"the Milner enigma\\".Lucy and Tony become lovers, Tony thus betraying his friend Matt and Lucy wrecking her marriage. And as Tony tries to uncover the mystery behind Otherways, the list of victims grows longer and longer and disaster can no longer be avoided.The plot in \\"Set In Stone\\" turns and twists and Robert Goddard is truly a master story writer in the suspense genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better then Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"While I have enjoyed many books on motorcycling, this one stands out by combining the joy of riding and it's dangers, while inviting the reader into the world of fine literature.

After reading this book you'll want to buy a motorcycle and collect rare books. Though the content is much deeper than that ofMotorcycle Therapy: A Canadian Adventure in Central America, Riding with Rilke will make you laugh just as hard in spots.

At least it was free on Kindle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fairy Tale for grown -ups!","review":"I have to start this by saying, OOH, I loved this book! What a great fairy tale, with all the fairy tale elements. Handsome prince, wicked king, power crazed duke, lovely maiden, spells and magic. Add to that, sensual scenes that make you blush and some cute humor, and you have this wonderful book.Sometimes it is the hardest thing; you just can't see why a hero loves a heroine. That wasn't the case here. You can see the characters draw strength from each other, even when they think it is just magic. The romance stays front and center throughout the book, weaving in the fantasy and intrigue parts to strengthen the romance.I highly reccomend this book. Ashley may be my new favorite author next to Kleypas and Robards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took me by surprise..wow!","review":"Jennifer Ashley is a new-to-me author, and clearly from the cute cover of this book I thought it would be a typical sweet historical romance. It was anything but that! Combining historical, fantasy, a bit of paranormal (magic, and logosh creatures) and steamy, erotic love scenes I was absolutely thrilled as an avid romance reader. I loved the well crafted characters and felt very well entertained by the whole story. I certainly will be looking forward to more of her stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another free bad kindle book","review":"I typically read all books cover to cover, but not this one. Couldn't finish it. The plot was stupid and reminded me of some really, really bad porno films - a stupid story line mixed with sex scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Read","review":"Truthfully, this book was so erotic I couldn't finish it. I read about half of the book before I just couldn't read it anymore. Basically Penelope just sits in Prince Charming's lap, NOT playing hard to get. Half the book is them having sex and \\"trying\\" to resist eachother, but in the end just having sex. The story then further irritated and disgusted me by having them get married becuase they \\"just couldn't live witout eachother\\", even though they've only known eachother for about a week. Ugh. And then to confuse readers even more, at their wedding, some beast comes flying to kill the Prince ( or whatever his name is). At that point, I just couldn't read this book anymore. It's bad enough that Penelope didn't have a backbone, and now flying creatures come out of nowhere. I really would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like","review":"I am pretty easy to please, but the only thing that I can say I liked about this book was that it was free when I downloaded it. I read a lot of historical romances and enjoy many of the authors in this genre. I have to say that this book was so inane that I found it very difficult to finish. If you are looking for a book that will satiate your need for erotica, than you may find this book appealing. I found myself skipping many pages of this tome because that is not why I personally read romance novels. I guess I really shouldn't complain because it was free, but trust me... if you pay for this book and enjoy authors such as Mary Balough and Julia Quinn than you will be just as disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairy tale, fantasy,medieval????","review":"At any given time I had no idea what I was reading.

I became Fay, seeing, tasting and smelling things through her eyes.. I was torn when she was ripped from her mothers home and all that was familiar.. I greived her new life of hunger, poverty, and shame.. and her disappointment of bearing unwanted twins and having the man she loved abandon her to raise fatherless children.. But it is a story of hope and courage as she takes her one opportunity and turns her life on a new course.

This is an absolute must read...a page turner.. and something that lasts deep within your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!!!","review":"I just had to E-mail the author Joyce Palmer and tell her how much I enjoyed the book on so many levels.

This book is the only one extant specifically covering these textiles. The coverlets were not signed or dated. But designs for them appear in coverlet weavers' manuscripts as early as 1819. A chapter in the book discusses some of these weavers and their manuscripts. The last chapter in the book describes the method by which a coverlet may be analysed.Over eighty coverlets were analysed. Handweavers can replicate the textiles exactly, or use the designs to weave other types of fabrics. The book is also of value to antique dealers, textile researchers, museum curators, and coverlet collectors. Craftspeople wishing to incorporate these old designs into modern works may find inspiration in these pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry & the hang glider","review":"As a hang glider pilot, I have been looking for a childrens book on hang gliding for my 3 year old daughter.

We are getting the radio versions not serious entertainment. I want more. I expect more and so should every serious Sinatra fan.

Were all the writers at the National Enquirer busy that weekend?), manipulates and twists the facts as quickly as a street mime making a balloon hat. But political fantasy is still fantasy.

As for the latest scare in the health news about black licorice and fluid/electrolyte abnormalities, don't worry. I'm an M.D. specializing kidney diseases (a Nephrologist), and you would have to eat a grossly large amount of licorice over several days to induce the problematic hypokalemia, metabolic alkylosis, and fluid retention. People with underlying kidney dysfunction may be more at risk.

While putting together such an album, they've also managed to create on of the best dancehall albums in a long time as well. The entire album with the exception of the very slack interlude is awesome. My favorite cuts are Pain 21st Century, The Illness, Don't Push It, Eyes Wide Shut, Da Pum (Brain Damage), defintely Grimey, and I could go on and on and on. However, my absolute favorite track is President of Hoochie Land, and another cut called Ma Doggs is growing on me, and if you're an Elephant Man fan, he's also here on Anything-A-Anything. Overall, I'm in love with this album, if you like hip hop you'll probably like this album, it has that total feel on it, and certainly if love dancehall music, then this album is a must have, it ranks above the excellent T.O.K. as far as a group record is concerned.

This is the story of how he realised that dream and how he came to earn the respect of his peers, which was one of the few things in life he valued. It seems that it didn't matter how good or bad someone was according to Eddie, if they complimented him on his driving, then they were okay in his book.Eddie makes a very interesting character. He was a mixture of extreme naivety when it came to common emotional issues, but he had an instinctive cunning when it came to survival. It gives him a much deeper level of complexity than was first apparent and is one of the great strengths of the book.I found this to be a very quick read and is modelled off the old pulps of yesteryear, both in external appearance and in content.

As an artist matures, he begins to more successfully blend he influences with his own style and finds his own voice. Devin Davis' \\"Lonely People\\" is clearly derivative (and may be subjected to criticism because of it) but I personally have no complaints because Davis has (1) clearly chosen some of the best of the genre to emulate and (2) has pulled off an entertaining collection of songs reminiscent Matthew Sweet's \\"Girlfriend\\". If you miss Ray Davies' power pop and are looking for someone who rocks the same chords with the energy of the Spiders From Mars, check this CD out.

It requires a nudge to edge loose leaves out of the tiny mesh. Yet, this very fine mesh keeps out any leaves (even from fannings or rooibos) in the pot or cup, unlike tea balls or the larger infuser by Tovolo--which I review and I do recommend for work or travel, by the way.At home, the ForLife is preferred.

I still don't know anything aobut art or art history, but how Leo and Bill think and talk about art brought some insight to me, and it prompted me do have a look at some of the artists described in there. We're reading about full-fleshed characters who have the ability to constantly surprise us because there is always something we have not yet figured out about them. This is a very good read, not least because Siri Hustvedt knows about the use of language and the art of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sad book","review":"I have found this book really wonderfully written, the style is very beautifull. But the book brought me into a very deep depression!!! Everything in this novel is completely hopeless!! The book gives one a feeling that life is ONLY sad: children die or go wrong way in their lives, adults also die, divorce, separate, become un-happy. There is not even one positive event happening in this book!!!! I am really wondering what drives the author to write such a book. Is this an expression of Siri Hustvedt's own un-happiness?.. After reading this book (and after reading a lot of other books from modern literature) I decided to stop reading modern literature at all, and to read only books on history: those will al least give knowledge and information about our past. But the books like \\"What I loved\\" give no information, but only disturb one's psychological status and bring one to a very bad mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Women I missed in this novel!!!","review":"I am very asthonished, Hustvedt mentions more than 100 important people in Science, Fine Art, Literature ... but only men, no women. Why? Is our world so andro-centric? Or only Leo the protagonist?Why Hustvedt developes Marks behavior as a typical borderline personality point by point (see the Theory of Sternberg). It is a little bit boring and like a psychological story, not a novel!I am angry about the missing women in the novel and angry because nobody of the readers sees it. Hustvedt did it too secretly."},{"rating":"1","title":"No women?","review":"Why does Husvedt mention so many men in science, in medicin and in fine arts specially - more then hundred! And no woman!Hustvedt is a woman. But she ignores women in high positions. Why?This is an anti-women-book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent but unexpected","review":"The thing is, Siri Hustvedt's first novel, The Blindfold, was so different, so brilliantly dark, and the same went for The Enchantment of Lily Dahl. The darkness is still there in What I Loved, but the intensity has been watered down *a lot*.Here there is more narration than introspection. And after the women of her first two books (slightly neurotic but very interesting), I felt a bit let down by the characters Violet and Erica- it felt like Hustvedt was holding herself back.I thought the book was still very good- stylistic, well-executed. The story is engaging, this time more 'familial', and full of speculative thoughts on relationships and love. It is also especially nice to see Hustvedt come back to discussing, through Bill's character, the topic of painting.. which she talks about with amazing intelligence and flair."},{"rating":"1","title":"New York Porn","review":"THe only reason to read this book is to soak up the street names, professions and pastimes of contemporary Woody Allen-style New Yorkers.The male narrator has no discernible maleness or individuality about him. He is clearly spewing the words of a too-serious, portentous woman writer. The narrative has scarcely any plot until late in the book, when it suddenly turns into an overly dramatic and cliched imitation of a second-rate thriller.How did this book get published in hardback?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am in the minority but ...","review":"I found it very difficult to read. The first 100 pages left me cold. It then peaked occasionally ... but it is such a pretentious book! And the complicated family set-up was so ridiculous. At the end, poor Leo.

I think not.All my book club agreed .. but then we are English... sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I Loved?","review":"I loved this book. I hadn't read a novel that I really could get into for a long time- I find a lot of novels are just too 'clever' and are lacking in emotion. I loved all the descriptions of the art- it reminded me of when I watched the original version of \\"Blow-Up\\" on TV late one night and the whole film was like looking through the eyes of a photographer and it gave me such a jolt, because that's the way I look at things, at their colours, shapes, textures, patterns.I felt immersed in the world of these characters and connected with the emotions. It is quite a sad book, but what's wrong with sad, you can't just have a pallette with reds, yellows & oranges, you need the greens, blacks, purples and blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I Didn't Love","review":"What I didn't love was that I wanted to read the book but two \\"reviewers\\" who were unhappy with it wanted to ruin it for the rest of us by giving away important details.

See the book/film \\"Party Monster.\\" I guess I just found that to distracting to become invested in the second half. It was just wierd to have this go from touching to tabloid.

However, I cannot agree that this is a good book. In fact, I had to force myself to finish reading it because it grated on my nerves so badly.In my reading, I found the main character unbelievable - first because he did not read as a male, but rather as a female, which confused me. Then I was put off by the observations and descriptions of the art and the art world. It sounded to me like the author was just trying to show off, but that she really did not know what she was talking about.In sum, I found the novel, tricky, trite and pretentious. I would not recommend it nor would I ever read anything else by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for lovers of Augustine","review":"This is the best biography I have ever read. Brown does a superb job of synthesizing an immense amount of biographical and textual information. The book is comprehensive and thorough without ever becoming tedious or heavy -handed. In fact, Brown writes so well that the book would probably be enjoyed by people who are not paricularly interested in Augustine. It is remarkable that Brown can do all of this in fewer than 500 pages, when biographies of figures far less significant than Augustine often exceed 1000. The only limitation to the book is that the author, as he himself freely admits, does not attempt to grapple with Augustine's most profound theological writings such as \\"The Trinity\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making Augustine a Human Being","review":"I read Brown's book as part of a raft of books on theology and Christian history during my studies.

It seems I am in good company in thinking of this as a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Work","review":"Excellent book. Peter Brown is clearly an amazing scholar who has done his work. He seems familiar with every square inch of Augustine's massive body of work and has an incredible mastery of the socio/political environment in which Augustine lived.

Mary's story is entertaining but reading the book is exasperating to any person with even a little editorial skill.The book is rife with misspellings (including the female lead), incorrect word usages (triad vs. tirade), grammatical blunders abound, and at one point the author moves from winter to summer in the blink of an eye leaving the reader wondering what time of year the story is really taking place.More time and effort in the editorial process would have produced a quick, easy, enjoyable read.

I HAD AN ADDED BONUS IN THAT THE USED BOOK I BOUGHT HAD A KRANTZ BOOK CALLED WHIRLWIND COURTSHIP THAT WAS ALSO EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this one","review":"I've heard a lot of folks criticizing the characters in this book for being unrealistic, even as they rave about what a great guy Tyber is. Well, the thing I loved about this one is that I KNOW this guy, in a dozen different forms (including my husband of 14 years). I've spent much of my life surrounded by wonderful, eccentric geeks, and was really happy to see one portrayed in a more-positive-than-usual light. Geeks are NOT all blind, balding, pasty-faced, and out-of-it, and I'm glad SOMEONE out there besides me knows it. Yeah, Zanita's a little ditzy, but then, so am I. Two thumbs way up for an entertaining read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed and juvenile level of description","review":"I'd give it no stars if offered the choice. This is the second novel by this author I've attempted to read. \\"Attempted\\", and not read in full, as her truly juvenile style is difficult to focus on. Possibly she is writing at a level appreciated by regular online denizens, with her overuse of vague superlatives. Endless referring to the hero or his smile as \\"sexy\\" is just not enough detail. (She does the same thing in \\"Mine to Take\\".) Two novels of dumb heroines, who let themselves be lead into various actions by the hero (uh, after saying \\"no'), means I won't be back."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILLARIOUS!","review":"I've never seen a hero that is more sexy and perfect than our Tyber Evans. God, why can't I meet this man in real life. They just don't make them better than this. I'm not usually a fan of contemporary, but if any other authors wrote like this I would be.I was a bit reluctant to read the books in this series due to the cheesy covers, but the content is fantastic. I had to call up my book buds and tell them about the chef/grounds keeper that thinks he is on a pirate ship. LOLI seriously wish I could visit this couple, they just sound like such fun people. Even their cat has personality!A MUST READ!!!Top 5 favorite series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing about this book will irk you.","review":"Before I read the book, I noticed that some reviewers complained about how dumb and immature they found the story's heroine, Zanita. Sure she is, but not to any unusual degree; there are lots of people like her in the real world, who think (really, she thinks foolish things more often than she does them) in a way that seems foolish to an outside observer. Almost the entire novel follows the romantic relationship between Tyber and Zanita, which is very sweet and affectionate. The love/sex scenes are good - fairly brief, but plentiful, and exciting without being vulgarly graphic. I recommend High Energy without reservation as there is very little not to like about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stultifying","review":"I think I lost brain cells reading this mainly because the author just couldn't stay on task. The book suffered dearly because Ms. Joy was too busy being cute and let the story wander around haphazardly. The bad-guy is so unconvincing that his bits were painful to read. I'd rather have taken on 300 pages of crazy than 300 pages of not funny enough to be comedy, not together enough to be interesting, not serious enough to be convincing.It's sad that fun characters had to languish in a story that didn't suit them at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"DARA JOY'S NOVEL HIGH ENERY WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT.","review":"THE FIRST COUPLE OF CHAPTERS STARTED OUT PRETTY GOOD BUT THERE WAS TOO MANY SEX SCENES IN THIS NOVEL. IT WAS ALL THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS (ZANITA & AUGUSTUS) DID IN THIS NOVEL. THERE WERE OTHER CHARACTERS MENTIONED IN THIS BOOK ALSO THAT COULD HAVE DEVELOPED MORE TO MAKE THIS NOVEL MORE INTERESTING. THE STORYLINE BASICALLY JUST DRAGGED ALONG....THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS NOVEL BECAUSE THERE WAS NO STORY THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT WORTHWHILE TO READ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"I like Joy's Matrix of Destiny series, but this book was very disappointing to me. I usually read a book in a couple of days, but I kept putting this one down because it annoyed me, then picking it back up hoping I'd been wrong. I left the last 50 pages unread because I just didn't care any more.The problem was in the tone of the book and of the two main characters. The hero is a brilliant physicist. He condescends to the heroine at every turn. He thinks her dumbness is cute. She mistakes a physics class for a psychic healing seminar. Ain't she cute. She even has an itty bitty job of her own-- she's a reporter. Of course, it's for the family paper and they gave her that job to keep her out of trouble. But that's OK, the big strong smart man is now there to make all her decisions for her. Gag.Joy's heroes Rejar and Rian are wonderful because no matter how arrogant they are, they respect their heroines. I wish that part of her style had been carried over into this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"blank pages","review":"Dont bother buying this book.

So I am really happy to find it here on Amazon.---It's an all-time classic watch, nothing too fancy, but everything useful and beautiful in a simple fashion. Also it's very stable and I never had any mechanical problem with it. Of course, it's a Tissot.I especially liked the little lighting dots making it easy to read time at night (if you wear it during the day, then it would light up in a dim greenish light for a few hours).The only discomfort is if you sweat a lot, the connection parts on the brace might accumulate oil and get dirty, so you should clean the brace every half a year or a year.---But this is a common problem with any watch, not just this one. And I believe the things you love will only last longer if you take good care of them. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"I just resently lost my tissot watch, that I had for years and loved. I was not looking forward to the search for a new watch (i am very picky). Amazon made it sooo easy. I found exactly what i wanted and for a great price. It came in the original Tissot box with all books and info. Tissot make amazing watches, this model has a saphire cristal face so it stays clear and scratch free, it's also waterproof which is very important to me and has a better closuer then my previous watch so it will be really hard for me to lose it :) The braclete was a little too big, but local jeweller had no trouble taking couple links out ( he did not even charge me). Overall if you need dependable, beautifull and classic watch that you can wear all day everyday without beeing afraid of demaging it- this is it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch doesn't keep proper time","review":"I was very excited to receive this watch for Chirstmas, but within two weeks I realized that it was gaining about a minute per day. At the end of one week it was 5 minutes fast. I thought maybe I hadn't set it correctly. I re-set according to an atomic clock and kept monitoring the time. It is absolutely useless to have a watch that gains about 20 minutes per month. It was so disappointing to find that what I thought was going to be a very reliable watch was so lacking in quality workmanship. Fortunately Amazon credited my account (but not my credit card). Also, my husband paid $185 for this watch from Amazon in November 2008, so I was very surprised to see the price listed at over $400! I double checked the order number to make sure I was looking at the exact same watch. I will never buy a Tissot again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't keep good time","review":"My husband and I got his and hers versions of this watch -- we were impressed with the price (for an automatic) and thought they looked great. But within a few weeks of the purchase we noticed that they had a strange problem. BOTH the watches were consistently 5 minutes fast. We would reset them and within a few days they'd become five minutes fast again. But they wouldn't progress any further than that -- they'd stay five minutes fast for months. We actually didn't mind the problem. But after about a year my watch completely died. I couldn't get it to keep time even after wearing it continuously for days. I'm writing this because today the same thing happened to my husband's watch. He has had it for two years. I'm now more inspired to take both of the watches to get repaired, but this defeats one of the upsides of the automatic -- the fact that theoretically you never need to break the seal by opening them up. Not a happy purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tissot PR 50 Automatic Watch Not Worth It","review":"I bought a women's Tissot PR 50 Automatic 5 years ago. Within the first year, it started losing a few seconds every day, and this susequently grew to minutes per day. When I took it in for repairs to a certified Tissot repair shop, it was still under the 24-month warranty. When I got it back, it worked well for about another 12 months, and then started losing time again. When I took it in the second time for repairs, I was informed that it would cost $220. I contacted Tissot directly - they did not offer any help, other than to suggest a repair shop, and I declined their offer knowing the shop I dealt with was reputable and that I wouldn't get a better price elsewhere. I had no intention of paying $220 to repair a $400 watch with no guarantee that it would work well for any duration after that. The watch is therefore useless now. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"More bootleg garbage from the underbelly of life","review":"Who wants to buy garbage made in some Bubba's basement?

She used them a few times and now they just sit by their lonesome on the shelf. Well here's the deal. They're good for working on my laptop, they fit good over the ears, and, the color is a nice pure white, and, they keep the sound in, but, they don't convey the music very good, and, the cord is too short, unless you like hooking up the extention! I think ALL headphones should have a 6' cord (minimum). I like my $14 jensen headphones better if I could find another pair I'd buy them. My wife took mine from me. Man oh Man! I want'em back!

So I thought that I would give them a shot for $40; just for back up and see if they worked out. The styling alone would be a welcomed change and was my incentive. However, the headphones are smaller than I thought (even though they are 40mm drivers), flimsy and leak a considerable amount of outside noise. I would never recommend these for a DJ. Low end is hollow and difficult to discern. Therefore, one would have to turn the volume up considerably to hear the distinctions between the kick and snare drums in a live cue; all the while the headphone signal will have to compete with the outside club noise leaking in...again...more volume. Hence: HEARING DAMAGE! Performance of these validate about a $25 price point. Styling may warrant close to the $40; if you're more into look than sound.

An extremely well written book, giving a valuable insight into the subject of managment 'fads' and managment 'gurus'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making sense of what gurus?","review":"By its title and the accompanying description, one would suppose this would be an objective and critical look at management gurus through history, with emphasis on the current ones. Instead, we get one chapter each on two gurus and a scathing review on the current management craze (which in itself is now a fad). Unfortunately, the argument against the \\"fad\\" is based on incorrect assumptions. Those subjects take up the first 100 pages, and then the authors ramble off for 200+ pages into disparate subjects and try to establish their own theories. Although most of what they say is correct, these are not necessarily the burning issues or the best characterization of the ones they do discuss. In fact, this effort is no better than a lot of what they want to criticize.

No consultant or management guru can ever know a company's business better than its employees do. The best the gurus can ever do is mouth generalities.

It's obvious he wanted to appeal to the under 25 crowd and in doing so alienated those who loved the original classic albums released back in the 1960's and re-released by the same Shout Factory label last year. I am praying this will not sell and soon go out of print like so many other worthwhile artists' cd catalogs of the past have done in recent years. This is no better than what most of us are subjected to in summer with the windows down, forced down your throat by the younger crowd with their rap-crap noise pollution from their 500 watt stereos in their cars.

The original 1960s version of Whipped Cream and Other Delights was not exactly a serious work of art, but it did sell extremely well. I have it on LP and play it occasionally to time travel back to the non-rock 'n' roll part of the 60s. In 2005 the album was remastered and now sounds excellent. Then this remix was released the following year, but it almost sounds like a parody of the original. Because Herb Alpert is capable of very good work (Rise is a fine example), I was hoping that this remix would update the original to the point where we might consider it almost a work of art. The exact opposite seems to be the case. This cd is not the least bit serious. So, I am thinking that it is a joke. Not a bad joke, just a joke. It is kind of funny. It is also kind of weird.

This new version updates the originals into the modern \\"lounge age\\" without destroying the original melodies in the process. One might even ask for more experimentation in some cases (the \\"Taste of Honey remix\\" for example). Standouts here include the \\"Whipped Cream\\" remix, \\"Green Peppers,\\" and \\"Love Potion #9\\" (with great vocals by Ozomatli). Herb himself even overlays trumpet on a few of the tracks, a nice touch.

It was good that he re-released all of the original classics by the TJB first so a new generation could enjoy this phenomena (and all of us with those old scratchy LPs could hear these great tunes without the pops, skips and scratches).

Changing \\"our\\" to \\"my\\" cahnges the entire point and tenor of the poem. When a translation has this glaring an error in the first line, it does not bode well for the rest of the text. On a less academic note, this version does not have the original Italian on the opposite page. Even to non-speakers, the original language is still beautiful to read in comparison to the English.

Bogie is an American tank sargeant in WWII. The best part is Bogie's cynical stoic attitude, especially when dealing with the Brits. The story is paced well and even my wife enjoyed it.

It is jingoistic for sure but I dont mind, as were most of the war movies during that period.The international composition of Bogarts tank and passengers I felt was a way to show that international cooperation was going to be essential in overcoming the germans and that the Italians really were in this conflict over their head.Anyway very enjoyable film"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless and tough...","review":"I've seen this movie to many times to count. This is one of the great epics of men in war. All the sorrow, joy, and evil of war is wrapped up in one dynamite package. Bogart at his best. The penultimate \\"tough guy\\" with the soft spot that makes the character so human. The scene where the Nazis front Bogie and tell him all about how many they are, how they'll just come and take the water are reminiscent of Leonidas and the Spartans at Thermopylae where the Persians tell the Greeks to lay down their arms and Leonidas replies, \\"Come and get them.\\" This is Bogie at the cutting edge.

I enjoyed the scene where the Free French soldier is describing his eating habits, some cheese,some bread, a little wine.

We also have an expensive extra-long twin latex mattress, but it is only maybe six inches or so thick, and I still get sore sleeping on it. Since a twin X-long is exactly one-half the size of a king mattress, I decided to purchase a king latex mattress topper, fold it in half, and put it on the twin, so I can sleep on it sometimes. It worked perfectly! Nice and soft for my hips and other joints. I didn't really save any money doing it this way, but I like having it all in one piece, and it also affords the flexibility of unfolding the pad and using it on top of a king bed, if needed. Good for indecisive people, lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too soft.","review":"Won't buy this kind of product again online because it's too much of a pain to return it, but we found this to be too soft for us. Probably would be good on top of an ultra firm bed. I was actually using it to keep me away from my too hot memory foam mattress."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a soft topper- this is not it.","review":"First, we live in a small town. I looked and looked for a topper in the nearest city (85 miles) with no luck so I had to purchase online. I purchased this topper to go over my memory foam mattress. I feel that the memory foam is too dense, therefore too hard. I read all the reviews and thought I would be happy with this topper. I was hoping to soften the feel of our mattress BUT this latex topper felt nearly the same as the mattress itself. I was so disappointed.Then to add to my disappointment- I am responsible to pay return shipping and a 15% restocking fee. I paid 298.00(incl. shipping) when I purchased this- I paid 71.00 for UPS return postage and 41.25 (approx.) restocking fee. In the end it cost me about 140.00 to try out this topper.Finally, my advice- don't buy unless you can try it out in a store."},{"rating":"1","title":"soft but still a liitle hot","review":"I ordered latex because my research stated that it was not as hot as memory foam.

That's exactly how it is going back too (at my expense of course...).If you sleep on your side don't bother with this thing. I like a firm mattress (I've slept hundreds of nights on military cots). But in terms of comfort I'd probably take the military cot.This mattress pad compresses down very easy to maybe 1\\" (I am 5'11\\" and weigh 180lbs) and then this mattress pad stops - completely. Might as well be a piece of plywood under there as far as your hip will be able to notice. My mattress underneath is a Beauty Rest I just purchased last month for what it's worth. I thought it would be nice to add a non-heat latex pad to it for when it gets hot here in Dallas during the summer.Forget about this mattress pad if you sleep on your side. Maybe back and stomach sleepers the firmness doesn't matter but for my hip I'm not going to sleep on this thing one more night. It's going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller is better","review":"After frustrating myself with ETS' GRE book, I found this little gem at a local bookstore. ETS' book does not prepare you for the math/quantitative part of the exam -- the book's exercises are not set up the same way as the computer or written exam. Meaning you have to solve out completely any equations or problems, rather than picking from a set of answers.This book is considerably cheaper than many of its contemporaries, but don't let that fool you. This book was a better prep tool than its $25-30 brethren.Very helpful was the frequently used GRE word list -- having taken the exam yesterday, I can tell you a lot of the words in the list are on the test.Quite a bargain, and well worth the $9."},{"rating":"2","title":"ETS-like tests, same material as bigger Barron's books","review":"The Pass Key is a great study tool, if you choose to purchase this instead of the regular Barron's How to Prepare for the GRE. The contents are comparable and the exams are often repeats.However, its size is its best asset and also the source of its faults. It's a small book that's great for carrying around, and its vocab list is especially concise. But its size sometimes make for awkward exam formatting, so that the second question on a graph will be on the back page. Also, the regular Barron's has a larger vocabulary, word quizzes, and root/prefix lists, as well as more practice question sections and exams.If you're short on test preparation time and need the pith of understanding how to best approach the GRE, the Pass Key would be a great purchase. If you would like more practice, then buy the regular Barron's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"This little book worked really well for me when I was studying for the GRE. It is broken up into the verbal and match sections along with a smaller section covering the essays.I was able to make copies of all of the tips sections and then make notecards out of them. This was a great method for me and I really noticed the results. I could have worked harder studying for he math section which I scored right around average. The verbal section surprised me and I scored over a hundred points higher. I scored slightly above what I wanted on the whole and am satisfied with my results.If you are an on the go person and studying for the GRE I recommend you get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable is Good","review":"The Barron's books are always great. This only gets 4 stars because the normal size book is obviously better because it is more detailed and has more examples. However, I got this book so I could easily transport it with me everywhere. It's easy to hide it at work. -Recommended if you want something portable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless if you are aiming for a high score","review":"The author of this book is trying to help you more at guessing than to help you understand the matter. Let me start with the verbal section. Some problems in the practice tests do not make sense at all. Reading the explanation I am surprised to find out that some words have meanings that cannot be found in any dictionary.The math is horrible. In general the graphs require great skill at guessing where the values fall or otherwise you will not get correct numbers. (Practice test 2 questions 14 and 15) There are graphs that are wrong. (Practice test 2 questions 20 and 21). The problems are solved and explained in such a manner that shows you the workarounds if you have no idea how to solve the problem. The essential theory behind the problem that is being actually tested is not explained.I would not recommend this book if you want to get an excellent score. Rather it would be good for someone who wants to get the scores from low to an acceptable level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quantum Mechanics in Hilbert Space","review":"This is a mathematics book for advanced mathematics or physics students, in graduate study.To get the most from it one should have already studied Quantum Mechanics in a less mathematical setting, and had some exposure to the theory of functions, and Lebesgue integration.

His anecdotes start out interesting, but turn into self-serving drivel that trivializes a very complex situation and culture. What bothers me most is that his writing is gimmicky- he puts words next to each other that try to sound cool and witty, rather than sharing any real insight. P>Predictably, the Thailand chapter concerned itself mainly with the sex trade. This a common theme, and it's sad that so many authors can't come up with anything else to say about a truly diverse and fascinating country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could definitely tell an improvement.","review":"Replacing the old coil with this MSD coil on my Neon was definitely worth it.

Also, there is hardly any advice to parents adopting infants. I would have been much better off waiting to purchase this book IF I needed it.

I was emotionally invested the whole way through. I'd say that this is an impressive 'first novel', but really this is an impressive novel period. When the next book in the series is out, I'm going to be first in line to place my order for it.P.S.

Not only is Lilla often wrong in his interpretations-- only his reading of Derrida strikes me as plausible -- but the central argument of the book is utterly disingenuous. As a good Straussian, Lilla unreflectively, and anachronistically, rehearses the ancient category of Tyranny without paying any attention to the work done on the nature and scope of totalitarianism in the twentieth century. And let's not dwell on the organization of the chapters -- the chapter on Strauss is, of course, in the middle. Thus following the obtuse numerology often found in the Straussian sect, as well as the one-sided interpretation of Kojeve.That a simplistic argument such as Lilla's, one done with blatant smugness, has received raving reviews, and has been published by the NYRB, are signs that the world of letters has indeed -- to borrow an apt phrase from Godfrey Hodgson --\\"turned right side up.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs help","review":"A bit disappointing.

It is made of heavy gauge steel with a tough crackle finish paint on all surfaces. It has two high BTU burners that are as quick heating as home gas ranges. It is a bit larger and heavier than the 'suitcase' style but well worth it in cooking performance. The legs are sturdy but a bit inconvenient to erect because they do not lock into place; they just slide into formed steel slots that can allow one leg to fall out as you are trying to install the other legs. Legs and windbreakers install on board the stove but the gas line and valve does not have a specific manner of storage and tends to swing freely when one is carrying the stove with by its built in handle. Nevertheless, this is a great stove that puts other smaller units to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Were Perfectly Fine","review":"This short story was read aloud at a recent dinner party, and it was hilarious.

My favs: TeachMe, TheQuestions(classic Musiq Soulchild formula), Today, MakeYouHappy, Millionaire, TakeYouThere (my fav), Lullaby, and the absolute best song on the album GreatestLove-this song has outstanding harmonies and the melody is perfect and flows well with the concept of the song.I would definitely say purchase this album! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Piece","review":"Something that i can cruise to with my family. One of the few artist I can point to in the modern era as a classic material for this generation. Good stuff to talk over issues of love with budding youth with question. Usher and others could really take notes from Musiq and Anthony Hamilton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relatively strong showing!!! I like it.","review":"Some people seemed to have slept on Musiq's latest cd and trying the compare it the to first. Now love this cd, but his debut album, in my opinion, is a r & b classic and I doubt that he will ever make in album greater than his first one.With that said, for a true music lover, not those who get cds and skim through them, this album is a pretty smooth lesson. I favorite song is \\"Greatest Love,\\" followed closely by \\"Ms.Philadelphia.\\"He voice is still great, even in the background voices (which he also does, showing his crazy vocal range). His arrangements are very unique and crazy how some songs start one place and end where you wouldn't expect it to end; very nice.If you really look at his albums, he follows a pretty consistent formula, and although the \\"average\\" listener might not fully appreciate this album, it really has beautiful moments and showcases one of the more talented r & b/ neo-soul / soul artist of our time. Cool listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Musiq","review":"Not only is this brotha fine, he could make Mary Had A Little Lamb sound good...This CD is the BOMB!!!

My bf bought it for me a few days ago and I've been playing it constantly for the last few days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurt","review":"I've loved all of Musiq's albums except this one. It sounds very forced and uninspired. His last cd \\"soulstar\\" had some of the most uninspired moments of his career at the time, but the good far outweighed the bad. With this release, there are only two songs that will stand the test of time. Those are \\"Ms.Philadelphia\\" and \\"Takeyouthere.\\" This is Musiq's first disposable album. I don't think anybody will be playing this one in a yr or two. We'll all cling to his first 2 cds, and some of us will include his 3rd. I don't think anyone will have this on their \\"greatest neo-soul albums\\" list in a few years. I've loved his Musiq up until this point, but this album is a great disappointment. If you're new to his music, I suggest \\"Aijuswannasing\\" or \\"Juslisen.\\" If you're one of the many fans who never heard the \\"soulstar\\" album, it's worth the time too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Buy","review":"Every track on this album is great.

Of course, it's always interesting to see how 'mind control' is portrayed in the media, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Action, please","review":"I once loved Gunn's novels so much I would read them like a prayer book. They were borrowed from a Scottish friend. So I ordered them all. Alas, I no longer want to read 20 pages of a salmon's progress and a boy watching it. The folk are now folkloric to me, not noble beings. The prose is more like poetry. This is not a bad thing. Maybe it is the mark of the times - I only know that I do not want to read a book with virtually no action, no dialogue, and a valorization of the lower class gathered at river's shores. So sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally some energy!","review":"I've been taking this product for a few weeks and I've noticed a definite increase in my energy and alertness. (For reference- I'm a 27 yo female, graduate student, married, no kids) I was taking a very expensive, high quality vitamin but I could only take 2/6 (6= full dose) because I needed to split it between my husband and myself to make it last. Anyhoo- I was feeling fatigued most days and taking CoQ10 to help with energy, but the effects didn't endure throughout the day. Now I'm taking this pill once a day (along with Solaray's Calcium Citrate + D3) and my energy levels are very high and last until the end of the day. Also, my husband is a triathlete who trains just about every day and he even noticed a difference in his energy levels!Great product! Plus, I love that it comes in a capsule form!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed after years of use","review":"My Wife and I have used Solaray Once Daily Multi-Vitamins for approximately 20 years.

I bought my first one in 1994 and it lasted until this year and I put it through the ringer. I wore it all the time and never took it off. It really was the most amazing watch.

LOVE IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective wenger watch","review":"When I opened this package and took out the watch, it was just what I wanted EXCEPT it wasn't working. I assumed it was a matter of a dead battery. When I finally had time to take it to a jeweler to inspect it, it was not a matter of a dead battery. The electronic response was almost nil even with a fresh battery.So, unfortunate as this watch was almost identical to a similar Wenger I had for several years (of which I had broken the stem.)Thankfully, Amazon took the watch back and offered a full refund. Yay, Amazon. Boo, Wenger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Watch","review":"The Wenger Women's Standard Issue Two-Tone watch made a nice gift for my mother.

It came with a price tag showing a suggested price, great for a gift ;-)The only complaint I have is with the crown when trying to get it to the right position to change dates, I often ended up changing the hour instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love My Wenger","review":"I've had this watch for 10 years. It's worked like a champ in difficult conditions. I've been known to drown and beat watches to death. I've showered, worked with fish, back packed, and otherwise put this watch through it's paces. It's been under water quite a bit over the years. It has kept the time very well. After ten years, the date doesn't change as well as it used to, and I think I'm going to buy another one just like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swiss Army Dive Watch","review":"I love my new watch.

It was a little confusing at first about which side to open, even though it was Hebrew opening, it had English cover as well on the opposite side. So I wasn't sure. But currently I am testing out the Mishkan Tefilah. But when I get toward using Gates of Prayer regularly, I am sure I will be able to appreciate it alot more.

This is an 1100 page promotional pamphlet for Microsoft and the SQL Server wizards.DON'T buy this book if you expect it to be a resource you can return to to answer specific questions / problems about SQL Server. It's not organized in that fashion and it doesn't cover enough of what a DBA really uses.As an example: In 1100+ pages there is a single paragraph explaining the master database - and NO mention of how to rebuild the master db or the rebuildm command. Something that I would think any Admin Companion book would cover in-depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish the other two reviews","review":"I wish that the two most recent reviews of this book had been written before I bought this book. This book is a waste of time. As the other two reviewers have stated, the majority of the book is stepping the user through Wizards. How anybody can call this a good book for experienced DBA's is beyond me. Anybody who is technical or has a lot of experience will find this book a waste of time and money. I will definitely be waiting for more reviews of Microsoft Press books before I buy them again in the future. I think that I must have bought this because it was one of the first books to be released on SQL 2000.If I had to say something good about this book, it is graphically pleasing. Lots of pictures of the screens as it steps you through the wizards. This book might help a lot if you're the company stud at Excel and they suddenly promote you to network administrator and you're looking at SQL for the first time.This book is defintely a newbie book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably good for newbies, too light if you have exprience","review":"Unfortunately I have to disagree with other reviewers. I didn't find this book particulary useful. Half the space is devoted to snapshots from Enterprise Manager and walking through its wizards. It is probably an OK book if you are completely new to SQL Server, but if you have a couple of years behind your back, don't waste money. Very little coverage of new features in SQL2000 (UDF's, INSTEAD OF triggers, Cascading DRI, Partitioned views, etc.) I was unpleasantly surprised that such weak book was produced by the same team of authors who wrote a real gem: \\"SQL7 Performance Tuning Technical Reference\\". Get back on track, guys!Michael Neymit, MCSE, MCDBA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad book from Microsoft Press","review":"This book does a good job of describing how the database functionality and concepts work, but that's about it. As far as examples go, it just walks you through a bunch of wizards, so you end up playing sheep to the click here and click their method. Also the book doesn't describe how to fix any problems that may occur while walking through the examples. Should any errors arise, your stuck. The book also seems to be slightly outdated or not completely thorough, I've noticed steps in a few solutions that are completely missing!???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Astral Projection from the Western Tradition","review":"I've been reading these negative reviews and find that they are based primarily on a fundamental lack of knowledge and in a couple cases easy solutions to the complexity of this kind of work. One reviewer claims that this book is too \\"occultish\\". That's laughable, becuause not many things are more \\"occult\\" that trying to force your spirit from your body with the intentions on traveling to other dimensions of reality.Having said this, the book is challenging because it actually asks something of the reader......dedication and commitment to the process. These authors are practicing metaphysicians/magicians for many years and are the head of a magickal order based in England called Aurum Solis (Denning recently passed away).There is a lot of experience between these pages and it can work for you if you work with the techniques within.Namaste"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"This book is utter trash. The techniques described are confusing and hard to understand. You have to concentrate on so many things at once it becomes tiresome. Also there is no sort of description of WHAT you will feel as you project. I gave up until I found William Buhlman's \\"Adventures beyond the body\\" by only reading the narration and journal entries contained in the first 2 chapters I was able to begin the initial stages of projection WITHOUT all the nonsense.

I wish I could give it 0 stars!","review":"If you want real Astral Skrying or Projection, use the Golden Dawn techniques given in \\"The Golden Dawn\\" by Israle Regardie. If you want a fantastically unrealistic book written by and for New Agers, buy this book instead. Any true Occultist can easily see that this book is full of junk and New Age lies.

The instructions are nice and clear, the tricks chosen are appropriate, the instructors aren't annoying or dressed super skimpy, and the trouble shooting parts are always helpful.

Two days later I started reading the book and could not put it down. I simply had to carry on reading because I felt so humbled by Rick Husband. I am a 41 year old and remember vividly when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon back in 1969. Rick Husband, against massive odds, time and time again, pushed through and did it. He never let anything, except his love for God, his family and respect for his fellow man stand in the way.I am not embarrased to say that I was in tears for most of the second half of the book. More than once I stopped only to reflect on my life and thank God for his mercy, love and grace in my life. I felt Evelyn's pain time and time again.

As you know, we are constantly matched up against those to have an intellectual edge as well as acute (s)wordplay, to your advantage this book will give you the necessary verbosity to handle various situations you make face.

If I didn't have the upper arm monitor to reassure me, I would have called 911, thinking I was on the verge of a circulatory episode.

In addition, one of our mothers has lost quite a lot of muscle and the cuff would not inflate correctly for her tiny, bony wrist. But if you're not elderly, it is fast and easy to use.

When I tried using it on patients, I found it more and more difficult to get a reading. This machine was so touchy that it wouldn't even start unless in the EXACT position, which was completely frustrating. after trying it on 3 more patients, and myself again, it still wouldn't register to begin taking a reading.

The much-vaunted APS system is a joke, inflating and registering only at crotch-level when on the right wrist!?! Steer clear of this product; mine was returned after a very frustrating afternoon of trying to get it to do ANYTHING in a repeatable fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is wrong with this thing.","review":"it always shows wrong readings.for example my BP was 97-152 and it was showing 75-118. i never got any even near by readings from this device.ORmy device is kaput."},{"rating":"2","title":"Constant Improvement","review":"Omron has made continuous improvement in wrist BP monitors over the years. This one makes two important advances for me: 1) automatic measurement averaging; and 2) Detection and display of irregular heart beat. Plus the monitor has become physically smaller, making it a bit more convenient to take along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate, easy to use","review":"I had the monitor checked against the one in the doctor's office several times. It is totally accurate and easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"Getting the sensor to be activated is a painful task. I had to re-position myself many times to have BP measured. Many times the monitor stopped working mid-way because I moved a bit and gave inconsistent results within 1-2 mins of measurement.Frankly, I am not a big fan of wrist monitors. Arm-monitors are more reliable albiet a bit bulky in today's technology standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omron wrist monitor","review":"My wife used it about 4 days and now it does not beep until it hears the heart beat but just takes off and is inaccurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use!!!!!!","review":"I purchased this unit because I was having trouble using my wifes arm-cuff-style blood pressure monitor. I found this to be just what the doctor ordered. It is very easy to use. The Advanced Positioning Sensor makes it imposible to position incorrectly, and the reading have agreed with the one's my doctor gets with his expensive unit. Best of all, the easy of using it is fantastic. I just slip it on my wrist, press the start button, position the unit near my heart, and it does the rest. OUTSTANDING. I would highly recommend this unit to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Innaccurate monitor","review":"This blood pressure monitor was off by at least 15 mm Hg every time I checked its accuracy.I went to my doctors office to check it's accuracy against the nurses reading, and had an EMT friend check it also.I'm on blood pressure to keep my blood pressure down, and need to accurately check my pressure a couple of times a day. This monitor does not do the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"product accuracy","review":"The Omron BP wrist monitor 650 has proven not to give an accurate reading. We tested the product on several employees known to have high blood pressure and every time we received normal BP readings. We used the old type cuff and pump on these same people and results were 20-30 points higher. These peopled reported that the old way was more in line with readings they receive in their doctor's office. We are not pleased with this product's performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Unacceptable performance, we returned it for a refund. This product is EXTREMELY sensitive to position of arm relative to heart and does not work with patients having compromised circulatory systems. Save your money, buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful product does not work for me","review":"I have been a medical professional for many years in the past. I know how to take pressure. I have had an Omron self BP cuff for about 7 years and it just got tuckered out and not doing its job any more so I decided to try a wrist model since I have trouble with my right hand and it is hard to pump the bulb to get the blood pressure.This thing did not work for me at all, I must have gotten a bad one. At first it was giving me a wonderful reading of about 140/72, I wish, I normally can't get below 150/80, I was 158/88 last week at the Doctors office.This morning when pressure is usually high this machine registered 63/44I am dead and don't know it yet. If you buy this make sure you can take it back, I bought it at a local CVS drug store, it cost more but now I don't have to waste time and money on shipping it back. Make sure you can test it first. I am going back to the manual unit. This is not a product you want to fool with, it literally can mean your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to use but disappointing results","review":"Based on the reviews I purchased 2 of these, one for my mother-in-law and one for me. I found them very easy to set up and use. However, my mother-in-law's systolic pressure would run 10-15 points low on this monitor as checked against her doctor's results, and at age 88 this is her most important reading. Both of my numbers would vary by 10-15 points in either direction compared to an arm unit that had been calibrated at a doctor's office. I liked the units and found them easy to use but the readings were so erratic as to be unusable, so I have returned both."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Simple to Use","review":"This has got to be one of the easiest blood pressure monitors to use. It really doesn't start until your arm is in the correct position, letting you know by beeping when you've got it right. The display is large and easy to read and understand. I definitely would recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the confused or elderly","review":"I purchased this product to use with my patients, but many of them are unable to follow commands or maintain a particular posture. This device will not work with these patients. There should be a warning that you should not buy this product if you or your patient will be unable to hold a steady and precise arm position for the duration of the reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned: Not for the elderly or people with arm weakness","review":"Let me start by saying that if you're an average healthy person this is a fairly decent BPM. It takes fast readings, is easy to put on and store, and has a memory of the readings taken including heart beats per minute. The big problem is that the advanced positioning sensor is very sensitive and requires your arm to remain completely still at 45 degrees in front of your chest for the entire reading. If you cannot find the correct position it will not take a reading at all. If it starts to take a reading and you slightly move out of the required angle it will give you an error message. Elderly folks, those with tremors, weak arm muscles, or people who are fidgety may not find much use in this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk - Don't Buy - You'll be sorry!!!","review":"This product is a piece of junk. It does indeed have a Advanced Position Sensor and an audible indication. The advanced position indication requires the device to be in the proper position and indicates when it is by beeping. The beep is so low as to be almost impossible to hear . . . no matter if you have perfect hearing . . . you will not hear the beep. If the battery is just the slight bit low it fails to work and the battery indicator does not indicate the low level below which the device fails to work. Forget about using it on your right arm, you can not hear the device when it is in the proper location and you can not see the face of the device when on the right arm. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!! YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, working as should.","review":"I really like this wrist blood pressure monitor, it is small, accurate, quick, and very easy to use. The only \\"problem\\" is that my wife's wrist is thin, and sometimes it does not works properly. But I believe this is not a problem in the product. Just wait a few minutes and try again.One thing that I miss on this product is the option to monitor two different profiles, like two separate history of measurements. With that it makes easy to control two different users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch your BP","review":"I recently purchased an Omron 650 Wrist Blood Pressure Cuff. It seems to be accurate within a couple of points (when compared to a stethoscope and upper arm applied cuff.) It provides an easy to operate, almost foolproof, means to keep a watch on your own blood pressure at home. I also really like that it keeps a running record of your readings...up to 90 readings. This can be very helpful when providing the information to your doctor.

The wrist-type is very convenient, can be used while wearing a sweatshirt. I like the automatic positioning feature, and believe this helps insure against false readings. Before believing all the Amazon reviews, I called pharmacists at two local drugstores and asked which brand of blood pressure monitor is the best: both promptly replied \\"Omron\\".

Both recipients (in their 60s) are pleased with how easy they are to use and at least for now are fairly accurate.

At first it seemed to be right on the money, but after about a week, I noticed I would get oddly low readings (as compared to all my other readings). I received an arm cuff monitor for christmas, and when I compare the two, taking one blood pressure about 5-10 minutes after the first, they are definitely different. The monitor is wonderfully easy to use... but if it doesn't take your bp correctly, it isn't any good. Therefore, I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omron HEM-650 wrist blood pressure monitor","review":"This blood pressure monitor was very complicated to use. Not only do you have to have it in an exact position on your wrist, but also your arm has to be in an exact location across your chest and then it is supposed to inflate automatically.

Overall it is very impressive. However, like so many high tech things they tend to pack so many extra features that to some degee it takes the simplicity out of using it. Like my first unit it is very accurate and easy to use, however it is very sensitive and must be held in exactly the right position over the heart. This is not much of a problem but takes getting used to. The design is very well thought out and the quality is very good. I would buy it again in preference over the other brands and models. Nothing wrong with the price either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convenient but How to Compare to Doctor Readings?","review":"This is a convenient product and easy to use.

Immediately, I realized that her characters, plot and situation were unique. The book is fast-paced -- a real page-turner which I found hard to put down. In fact, I put everything else aside and read it in one week-end.The plot is intriguing, and the depth of situational and character exploration make this book extraordinary. The realistic portrayal of young inner-city dwellers will absorb those who have \\"lived the life\\", as well as those who have not.

Of course, the city itself is the same, but the way people dress and act and the cars could not be more different. It's also nice to see that no matter what the era these people had a lot of hope for their future. The futurama fair was the most interesting to me, as people thought we'd have flying cars by now. STill it's all fascinating and I might want to buy the other volumes soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Album","review":"I really like this CD. It's sort of a cross between Heavy Metal and Power Metal. It's melodic but heavy. The singer is not your typical Power Metal high hitter. He sings high but is more of a screamer like Tyrant Conklin or the guy from Jacob's Dream.This album is a concept about some kind of futuristic corporatation. Kind of has a MATRIX feel.Songwriting is very good and overall the band does a well above average job of sounding unique. I guess this is sort of a cult album in that it is far better than the little fanfair it was released to."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent but nothing out of the ordinary","review":"This album is not that bad but it's definately not that great.

This is not a ha-ha, funny book. This is a \\"life [stinks], don't it\\" book. I really enjoyed it and have read it twice. I suppose this falls under the heading of a guilty pleasure, but it was a lot of fun. Readers of military SF will like it, I think. Lots of action. *Not* for kids. Lots of sex-related content - mostly jokes - but I did not find it offensive as I do some such. This felt pretty real to me - like a grunt would really think in a similar situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"really fun read","review":"Very interesting premise, especially with all the genetic testing now taking place.

He read it and laughed his way through it and insisted that I read it, too, to which I agreed readily enough. I won't recap the story, but I will say it is a hoot and a half! The rats are hedonistic Shakespeareans; the bats are revolutionary Irish; and the vats are hapless humans who are just along for the ride. And, of course, you have the land-owners, who have the money - throw in the evil bugs from outer space and the benevolent aliens who are providing the technology to defeat them (or are they?) and you have a mix that is sure to please anyone who likes military science fiction, space opera, or just plain silliness.

The book opens with the creation of the desperate need of man. Man through his selfish rebellion has seperated himself from his eternal Creator. That Creator seeks out the hidden rebel to promise to him that means to restoration: Jesus Christ. The story of restoration unfolds through the means of the new nation of Israel. Sacrifices and the Law reveal the nature of the Creator and His means for restoration. The story concludes with the coming of that Means to restoration. His sacrifice at the hands of the rebels is the payment for all of their rebellion. That hole created in man by his own rebellion is filled in the person of Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This works very nicely.

The only shortcoming is that there are thicker hanging poles for the frame but the rest are really thin and some of them do not seem to be welded enough so they have detached from one end.

Sturdy frame, great for small places, or a back porch of an apartment. The mesh covering for the top of the rack is a little small, and ripped slightly while trying to stretch it over the top where it belongs, but I won't be removing it a lot, so not a big deal.

However, after light use I noticed that several bars have bent, so don't put heavy clothes/towels on it. One of the legs was also slightly bent because my wife was moving the rack around the house, but luckily it was easy to bend it back.I was debating with myself on whether to give this item 3 star or 4 star, in the end I gave it 4 stars because I use it to dry my baby's clothes/towels so those are relatively lightweight, but if you have big towels to dry you should look for a sturdier drying rack"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST DRYING RACK EVER!!!","review":"It's not sturdy at all!

Pages 171-176, for example, were originally published in an Internet World column, though he acknowledges that nowhere. In fact, the entire book consists of such retread material spliced together, sometimes seamlessly, sometimes not. Many readers who haven't followed the free speech wars won't recognize this; they may simply wonder why the book is occasionally disjointed for no apparent reason. The other significant flaw in the book is that it stops with the CDA decision, in June 1997. For a book published in late 1998, it could have covered later material, especially since most of the book was cut-and-paste rather than new writing. It's a reasonable introduction to the censorship wars on the internet for readers which are completely unfamiliar with the history; but as for me, I'm pleased that I checked this book out from the library rather than purchasing it. -- Michael Sims"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sin that has finally been corrected!!!","review":"This, Dave Loggins' second solo album (his first being \\"Personal Belongings\\" for Vanguard), is finally available in its entirety on compact disc. \\"Apprentice\\" not only showcases Dave's beautiful \\"Please Come To Boston\\", a standard by any measure, but his thoughtful \\"Sunset Woman\\" and an overlooked gem, \\"My Father's Fiddle\\".

Its amazing what gets released, record companies will put out any filth if they think some lamo will buy their filth. Comparisons in earlier reviews to Blondie or other talented artists are totally unfounded here....... This band may sound good live, recorded tho the final output is much less forgiving. A fair comparison to this 'music' would be Avril lavigne crossed with mouldy socks, not pleasant and very stinky.Save your money for a more deserving band as there are many, in 5 years no-one will ever rememeber this band I guarantee you.

But in small bites","review":"I got this CD because I saw one of their music videos and it was really catchy. And I guess because they sound like a cross between The Killers and Blondie.I guess the only thing I can add to these reviews is, these songs might be more enjoyable in small chunks. Especially if you're the type to get worn down or annoyed after a while by the vocalist. This shouldn't be a big deal since you crazy kids these days don't listen to an entire CD straight through in order, and would rather throw songs into your iPods and shuffle the hell out of them with other songs.

I love this Swedish band and was so excited when they finally launched this, their second album. Still holding on to the Blondie new wave sound but adding a few more synths, the sound is tight and The Sounds are simply fun.The first single \\"Song With A Mission\\" and \\"Queen Of Apology\\" open the set with a 1,2 punch of attitude, and \\"Night After Night\\" is super catchy though I have to say I love the bonus version (a ballady counterpoint to the album track).

The chocolate truffle cake looks and sounds great, but is dry and dissapointing. The Cream of Lentil Soup was bland, the topping added a bit of flavor, but not fabulous.

The songs are slow, or boring and nothing really stands out. Incubus is nothing more than a pretentious rock band who after a couple hit albums (Make Yourself, Morning View) have done everything in their power to NOT have a hit record again. There's nothing wrong with having some commercial appeal is there? If they keep making records that noone wants to listen to they will lose their record contract and the band will be over. Light Grenades had the biggest second sales dip in billboard history! It dropped from 1 to 37. Some incubus fans are so fanatical they like ANYTHING that incubus does.

Particulary notable songs include: Dig, Oil & Water, Rogues, Light Grenades, and Pendulous Threads. None of the 13 tracks can really be considered 'terrible' though. I would have to say Earth to Bella would have been better if it was one song and not split up into two parts. If I had to pick, Earth to Bella parts 1 and 2 are the weakest cuts on the album.

I never expected Incubus was capable of making a bad album until i heard Light Grenades. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone who likes all the other Incubus albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Incubus CD yet","review":"As a longtime fan of Incubus, I thought Crow Left of the Murder was a great move for them. That was the direction I thought they needed to move and really showed them growing up. Light Grenades is HEAVY on LIGHT and LIGHT on GRENADES. It really has no soul and nothing to grab onto. It's just an empty disc with a track or two that are worth listening to. I haven't listened to the disc since it first came out. I was hoping Brandon and the boys would channel a little more angst about the state of the world and put aside the teenage emotions. Perhaps that's as far as they are capable of going. Let's get back to more Megolmaniac style writing and passion. Light Grenades is a major DUD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Album By Incubus","review":"Like a fine wine, they boys of Incubus seem to get better with age. I wasa huge fan of A Crow Left of the Murder, enjoying every song on the album. While this new album has a few tunes I could do without, the good songs far overshadow the few the fall short.Dig - Great song, one of those that grabs you the first time you hear it.The other great songs on the album are:Anna MollyLove HurtsA Kiss To Send Us OffEarth To Bella (Part 1)Oil And WaterDiamonds And Coal"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Incredible","review":"Incubus is the band you can't simply go wrong with.

Good Luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus.","review":"Jesus this is horrible Cd. I loved Incubus when they first came out but slowly I realized there would never be another: Enjoy Incubus, Fungus, or S.C.I.E.N.C.E album ever again. Don't get me wrong I don't think that they need to repeat every album but come on! You can only write so many love songs for god's sake. This Cd makes me really think that they have run out of creative ideas and now they are doing whatever they can to get on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"There is only ONE great song on this CD, in my opinion,.and that is \\"Anna Molly\\". Which is the reason I purchased it in the first place. I thought I'd like the rest of the songs,.and I tried to,.but I can't. the rest of this CD just plain sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVEN 2 STARS IS A STRECH","review":"What is this Sh**? Incubus seems to be getting worse with each album. Atleast A Crow Left Of The Murder had 1 or 2 hits on the album (although it sounded too much like a RUSH album). Light Grenades offers no hits at all! Incubus kind of reminds me of another band I used to like, STAIND (AKA SELLOUT), because the first few albums were excellent and then I just have no idea what happened. With Incubus, I have no idea what they are trying to do with this album. Parts of songs are good but I'm having trouble getting through the whole album. How can people say they've gotten better? Listen to \\"Make Yourself\\" or \\"Morning View\\" and then \\"Light Grenandes\\" and tell me which of the 3 sound like CRAP! I've been to a few Incubus concerts in the past but now I can truly say I have no desire in hearing new music from this band ever again. R.I.P. Incubus, we had some good times together but like with most bands you just had to leave me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing!","review":"Wow this new Maroon 5 album is intense. Is this really the same band that put out S.C.I.E.N.C.E? You can say this band has matured.. I really just call it the biggest sell out in the history of rock. Congrats guys.. Loved the latest Gap commercial Brandon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long gone are the Morning View and SCIENCE days...","review":"I'm not sure why I expected anything more than a pile of heaping, steaming brown poo, especially since Crow Left of the Murder sucked so bad. They seriously either need to go back to making good rock or just throw in the towel and give up. It's sad to see the #1 rock band in the world at one point go from EXCELLENT to Crow Left of the Murder and the even worse Light Grenades...it's insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much, too convoluted, too metaphorical","review":"Get ready to suspend reality in this heavy-ladened, multi-plotted at-times tedious espionage/thriller. And I do agree with many others, the title is totally misleading.There is little doubt one would guess this is the author's first book. The metaphors are more than the grains of sand on a beach, the suspension of reality and lack of knowledge (or ignorance) on the part of the author is evident - I cannot believe how he describes the Old Executive Office Building. In another part of the book, one of the characters is a family man who would never engage in a certain behavior. Yet, pages earlier, we find out the same guy was involved with a prostitute.I didn't finish this book when I first took it out the hardcover from the library - and now I went and waste money to buy it. I should have trusted my first instinct. Save your money. I hope Damage Control is a big improvement for Mr. Dugoni."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time; Angry that I wasted my money","review":"This book is poorly written, boring, and inappropriately titled. I gave it several tries & finally had to give-up on it, deciding that it simply wasn't worth the time --- nor was it worth the $$ I spent when buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"The reviews all say how \\"fast-paced\\" the book is. Yes it is fast paced, it jumps into action-scenes, throw 7 sets of characters at you with no character development and never gives it to you and expects you to care/get attached to the characters. The dialogue is wooden. The action scenes themselves are the only redeeming quality about the book, but again, not a legal thriller there. If you want action, fast paced thrillers, with actual interesting characters - go with Lee Child's Jack Reacher series."},{"rating":"1","title":"good beginning silly ending","review":"The author has talent - he can describe events and scenes. He cannot link the plot together logically.The plot zooms out of control and becomes silly and irrelevant.Any more comments are not worth the effort. The book was a big disappointment.If curious - wait awhile and buy it used under $1."},{"rating":"1","title":"These other reviewers are friends of the author....","review":"1) The book throws out a lot of characters early on but accompanied by such a lack of motivations or past it's hard to stay interested.2) At more than halfway through the book, there are so many disconnected plot threads you feel like you are finally going to learn something...instead...you get MORE shady characters!3) Good thrillers keep you entertained because skilled writers know how to slowly give out just enough information to keep you guessing. This guy keeps it all to himself.4) The author tries James Patterson's style of 4-5 page chapters, but all he does is frustrate you because he keeps cutting away from something happening. Perfect for people with A.D.D.I give it two stars because some of the action scenes aren't bad, but just as something interesting starts happening, it cuts to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COMPLETELY MISLEADING TITLE!","review":"After the first few pages of the Jury Master, this lengthy, complicated read has nothing to do with juries or the courtroom.The blurb writers who describe it as a \\"legal\\" thriller obviously did not read it. It was very disappointing to be so thoroughly misled by reviews and a promising first few pages of the story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great first book!","review":"I was introduced to Robert Dugoni's books about 6 weeks ago and have now read ALL of his fiction books (except the most recent which I've bought but haven't finished yet). I typically like to start with an author's first book - hence \\"The Jury Master\\" - in case the author decides to repeat a character. Glad I did because David Sloane has appeared in subsequent books. Having lived in the San Francisco Bay area for a number of years, it was great to relate to the places mentioned in the book. Mr. Dugoni is a great storyteller! If you like twists and turns in a plot, by all means, pick up one of his books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakout first novel","review":"Robert Dugoni is a New York Times bestselling author of legal thrillers that should put Scott Turow and John Grisham on notice: There's a new voice in town and he's taking no prisoners. Introducing attorney David Sloane in his breakout work The Jury Master, Dugoni showed that, well defined characters, crisp pacing, relentless action and page-turning excitement is just the beginning of a well-plotted, suspenseful series. Start with this book first, and work your way through his entire 'David Sloan' series. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Fun","review":"If you are looking for an intriguing page-turner, pick this up now! The Jury Master is a book for keeps--keeps your attention, keeps you guessing, and keeps you entertained. The depth of detail pulls you into every page.

I am looking forward to Dugoni's next book--this one went by too fast for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for thriller fans!","review":"Dugoni's debut novel is a wonderfully surprising twist on the over-done lawyer thrillers of Grisham and Lescroart. Dugoni combines an intricate plot with complex characters, slowly revealing the story to the reader in a refreshing, less-is-more approach, requiring his audience to work for the novel. The Jury Master has raised the bar for lawyer-courtroom novels.

For the price I hate to give up but it is a struggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"no no no","review":"The title is apparently for another book, since it doesnt apply to this one at all. We are told twice by the main character that he is a whiz in the courtroom and another comments that she doesnt know how on earth he talked his way into a meeting...but thats it. This is not a courtroom thriller, in fact there is no thrill, no nothing. It is not believable, in fact a bit insulting--there were too many leaps needed for any of it to work and I'm so tired of all the cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hard book","review":"Remember when you were a kid and you used to complain about certain books being \\"too hard\\"? That's this one. Cast of dozens, too many plot twists and turns......it was so convoluted it couldn't keep my attention very well. There's a good book in here if only it had enjoyed some streamlining and editing so it could move right along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning on Kindle Edition of the Dictionary","review":"The Kindle edition of the Dictionary is not searchable (and the only index is based on English & has no page numbers) making it very difficult to use. A searchable dictionary is great, as the reader can zip straight to the desired entry but, without a search capability or even an index, the only way to find an entry is the old-fashioned way - by iteratively flipping pages in the guessed-at location of the desired entry; given that each Kindle page flip takes 6 to 8 thumb strokes, this is a very cumbersome process. For $5 more you could buy the paperback which, although you probably won't carry it with you on the road, would be much more usable.Note: Within an hour of bringing this to Amazon's attention (on a Saturday, no less), they had refunded my purchase priced and promised to look into this design flaw (my term) and to let me know if it gets fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read on a Complex Subject","review":"This book covers great spans of time and geography and illuminates little discussed, but important and interesting, stretches of history. I found it an easy read, despite the complexity and many characters.The only downside is that more detailed maps, and perhaps a timeline, would have been useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is what it says it is","review":"This book is exactly what it says it is: a military history of central Asia. And if you read it in that light and are not a specialist in the field, you will probably not be disappointed. Just bear in mind that there were other factors weighing into the eventual demise of the steppe societies besides simply the introduction of modern weaponry. After all, couldn't the steppe peoples have adapted to firearms just as readily as they adapted to siege warfare earlier in their history? But even for warlike societies, wars still have to be financed. It was only after European seaborne trade began eliminating trade along the legendary \\"silk road\\", and thus the profits of the central Asian middlemen, that the steppe societies fell into decline. Which does not diminish the overall value of this book. Just be wary of the conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong thing","review":"This was the wrong thing.

The acting is bad. The dragon, fight scenes, and blood are all CG effects, and not very good ones at that. The movie certainly has some MST, it might be funny if stoned quality to it. But for the normal sober viewer this is a big time avoid.In the beginning our horn-dog hero is spying on a young topless girl, then later he won't get into a bath tub with a major league babe. The movie has some gem lines: \\"You may call me...Stranger.\\" or \\"You must continue along this route until...you find shelter.\\"No F-bombs, no sex, was that brief teaser nudity in the beginning?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Potential, Bad Scenes and Editing","review":"Another Asylum movie. Some are good, and some are not so good. This move is somewhere in the middle, with a pretty fast-paced (meaningless?) plot and average acting. The fight scenes ranged from slow and clumsy to rather well-choreographed. The limited pieces of orchestral music are effective, but not played nearly long enough; perhaps more of the budget should have gone to the musical score and performance.Some of the most important scenes in the movie are boring and poorly-filmed. Marc Singer's final battle-scene should have been serious and important, but it felt like just another death. The climactic battle . . . kinda stunk.Needless nudity and a drug reference in the first few minutes of the movie was both funny and unnecessary. Lord of the Rings and Star Wars are archetypal movies, and this movie combines the two. This movie could have been epic, but it was only run-of-the-mill. Two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops I ordered the wrong film","review":"OMG, I mistook this for another film and I couldn't even watch this all the way through. This is garbage, AVOID AVOID.

A few week ago I began searching using different title combinations on Amazon and could not believe my good fortune to find it. I have ordered it and can't wait for the arrival. This book is wonderful. Yes, it has a romance but it goes far beyond. Its illusion of what seems to be an island paradise is interupted by WWII.

Of course, it reflects some of the beliefs and stereotypes that prevailed in that time period, but I think that(to some extent) that is to be expected. It is true, as some other people pointed out, that Cooper can be a little bit long winded some times, but I think that is very typical of literature written before the 20th century. Overall, I think it is a very good story, and if you like adventures and early American literature then you will love this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Time","review":"J. F. Cooper's classic Last of the Mohicans, is quite a read. This is the second time I have read it, last time was in college. Being older and more mature, I appreciated it more now. I realize, in our instant gratification society, that this eloquent and romantic style of expression may seem to most, verbose. To them I would direct to the movie. Frankly I was transported to another time when one could describe a single scene in several pages and not watch the clock. I enjoyed the expressive style, as well as the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This is a good book to read, though it tends to drag on at times. The story is well known, and attests to the authorship of James Fenimore Cooper. This will forever be a classic piece of American literature with characters people can identify with and appreciate. Cooper is a very good storyteller.Another \\"character\\" of the work is the landscape in which the story unfolds. Cooper's description of upstate New York does for literature what the Romantic painters of the Hudson River School did on canvas. Cooper writes of the crags and forests in such a way that the reader feels every drop of water or every sharp stone the books character's encounter.As said this book drags on at times but in general it has a good pace. Twenty-first century readers will struggle at times with the context and verbage, but this will remain an important book from the nineteenth century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the movie","review":"I adore the movie & wanted to love the book, but just couldn't. It just seemed monotonous & flat, almost too detailed sometimes in a boring way ... like Moby Dick (sorry to fans). I had to force myself to finish it, there wasn't enough complexity or realism to the characters but perhaps that is because I saw the movie first so had high expectations.

It's so bad that when you listen to the commentary track on the DVD, you find out that even the writer, director, producer, etc think it's horrible. They tell a few things about the movie and how they made it, but most of it is talking about how the movie is horrible, utter garbage. They talk about how no one is probably hearing what they're saying, because they already shut it off, took it back to the rental store, and threw it in the employee's face. The movie itself seems like a waste of time. Why did they make it, when it seems they only put 1% of effort into it? They even talk like the movie was so under- budget it couldn't be made right. Stay away from this movie, no matter what you do.

On the back cover it reads \\"Dazzy his BEAUTIFUL girlfriend.\\" Well, her ugly face was the biggest HORRORVISION in the whole movie. Who did the casting for this movie?? STEVIE WONDER!

I felt the content of each chapter to be a little bit to brief, as if to wet your tongue but not completely satisfy. But then again fifty years of racing history is a lot to fit into any one book.If Ferrari racing is your main interest then this book is a must have.

The two screwdrivers did the job well enough.

The coloring is just plain off. Colorized versions of old Gilligan's Island look better than this. Also, I thought I could get past the music part, but OMG it just sucks.

They didn't replace elevator music with other elevator music; they replaced classic oldies, IMPORTANT TO THE TONE AND TIME OF THE STORY (at least to the CREATOR of the show, and to the fans) and slapped on throwaway MUZAK. Universal ripped me off on Season 2 - AND IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Director's Vision Without Music","review":"I like the show. However, without the music, it is second rate. Quantum Leap relied on the music to give us a sense of nostalgia for the eras Sam was transiting. Music was also an integral part of the director's vision for the storylines.It is criminal to market DVDs without original music as a \\"complete\\" season. They are not complete. I will no longer purchase DVDs before their release dates until I can verify what I'm purchasing is the director's original vision for the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not original","review":"I will keep this short. The seasons of Quantum Leap outside of season one are not the original artistic vision. Yes, the writing may be the same, the acting may be the same, but the music is not. Anyone who argues that music is not relevant in a film is utterly ignorant and has no artistic appreciation whatsoever. Imagine watching Star Wars sans the Star Wars theme because they couldn't get the rights to have it and replaced it with a generic sounding muzak. While this sounds absurd and never would happen, it serves the point. Music is very relevant to the experience and it affects our emotions and perceptions of what we see on screen. I, for one, will not be buying this DVD set nor any of the subsequent DVD sets. It serves as the only protest I can offer to this shoddy product."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the Music doesn't matter to YOU, good for you....","review":"But I tell you what, it mattered to the director, to the viewers and to say that music doesn't matter is simply nonsensical. I check ed out this 3rd set and I am not buying it. Universal con'ed us with Season 2 and make no mistake, the music is essential. How does it differ to change the music (which in this series was a character as much as the actors) to edit our actors, change the ending or what have you? To add to the insult, what Universal is adding is truly elevator music, done on a synth in 2 minutes. I love this show, I love the idea, but I for one can't watch this butchered show. If you can, and you truly think, music that was intended to be in there as a plot point, doesn't matter, good for you. Don't tell John Williams. Or James Horner. Or Mike Post........"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame","review":"I loved the show as it orginally aired. It was a masterful weaving of acting, writing, wardrobe, camera work, etc... along with the music. It was a wonderful tapestry which has been reduced to shreds because the music thread has been removed.I will always remember the great times I had watching the show air for the first time. Unfortunately, I have no copies of the show on VHS, but I would rather just go on with the memories of a great show than to purchase the tatters left here.Perhaps to other people it is, but to me, it isn't worth my money.Thank you to the team that created Quantum Leap.

It's not in chronological order (often it's not even clear when some of the events described took place), and it gives very little perspective on Benny's long career. For Benny's life, look elsewhere; for his humor, get one of the many collections of his classic radio series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Decembrists rock!","review":"I'm 57 years old. I've must've heard Stairway to Heaven 10,000 times. The Decembrists offer musicianship, lyrics and melodies that are, in a word, refreshing. Picaresque is a fine example of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.","review":"I was a bit worried about this group. I really love their first LP, Cutouts and Castaways, but the follow up album, Her Majesty seemed like a bit of a dissappointment, although it definitely had its moments. It seems that they hit their sophomore slump awfully hard, and it hurt to see such a promisng group take such a lousy turn, but I digress. With Picaresque, they seem to have recovered their initial footing surprisingly well. The opening track, \\"The Infanta,\\" is a catchy and upbeat folky number that sounds more like their old material. \\"The Mariner's Revenge Song\\" is probably one of the best and most epic tunes they have ever written, and \\"Sixteen Military Wives\\" even contains a bit of \\"subtle\\" political commentary that seems to work well for the group. Overall, I give it 4/5 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique, and in moments also timeless","review":"one must marvel at the lyricist, as its rare songs go beyond some catchy lines around mundane rhymes. every song on here is a literary-tour-de-force, and one can justify owning it just on that basis.but its hard to ignore the incredible musicianship and catchy swinging tunes, esp present on \\"the sporting life\\" (great song for every non-jock) and the album's opus, \\"the mariner's revenge song\\".much like dan hicks, modest mouse, and the beatles, this music will be played forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro","review":"I had only ever heard one Decemberists song before (July, July!), and was convinced I needed to buy a CD. It was tough choosing between Castaways, Her Majesty, and Picaresque (this was pre-Crane Wife) so I had to know where the Decemberists were at that time. I found them in fine form. Catchy, long, musically interesting songs.A person can listen to these songs over and over due to their complexity or their strong pop sensibilities.Meloy's creative writing background is apparent and the milieu he creates is decidedly not set today.Overall, the album is musically and lyrically intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"the decemberists","review":"The first time I ever heard this bands music was on xm radio. I was instantly intrigued by their unique sound. To me this music sounds like a cross between traditional folk music possibly from the late eighteenth century in the united states, and subtle influences from english/irish laments. The singers voice imparts a sorrowfull tone to the instrumnentals which is well suited for that style of music. Finally, when I hear the lyrics I develop a mental picture of that world he is singing of, which I think takes a very talented person to convey. I would definitely recommend this cd to anyone, that likes to broaden their musical tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, amazing does not even begin to describe it","review":"The Decembersits have outdone themselves once again. This album is unbelieveable, evey song is amazing, clever, and sure to become a favorite in its own way. The song \\"The Meriner's Revenge\\", is especialy worth mentioning because it is such an extraordinary story in itself. \\"From my own true love\\" and \\"The engine driver\\" are hauntingly beautiful. It's really hard to explain exactly but you'll know the first time you give any of the songs a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artful relaxing music","review":"This was the first I had heard of the Decemberists when I got this cd a couple weeks ago. At first I only liked a couple songs (we both go down together, and the engine driver). But once I took the time and listened to this album three or four times (and also looked at the excellent artwork and lyrics), I discovered that all the songs are full of art and are great to relax to."},{"rating":"2","title":"my first in-depth introduction to this band...","review":"i figured it was time to buy a decemberists album, after liking a few songs whenever friends played them for me, and after listening to the 5 songs that repeat on the band's myspace page. i picked this one because it was cheap (used) on amazon. i dig it. there are a few boring songs, but the good ones are REALLY GOOD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Album","review":"This album has it all. The songwriting is deeply passionate, poetic, and takes you away to another place and time. The instrumental performances and arrangements sweep you away from the opening note through some amazing crescendos to the final fade. If you like these guys, you may also like Huffamoose who are sadly not making new music, but did a hysterical movie about being a band on the edge of fame but never actually reaching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good pr?","review":"I bought this album after reading rave reviews.There are some moments on the album, but a lot of the music is so contrived and I feel like I have heard all the stuff before.I listen to the album and can't get the thought out of my head that the record stores are full of this type of stuff.A cool name is a good start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before...","review":"Hmmm...the kids sure love this. Third time's a charm, huh? Pretty simialr to the first two.Really, this sounds like Jethro Tull's, \\"Songs From the Wood,\\" which is to say, like \\"Aqualung\\" without the rockin', heavy bits. That's no good!After recently cranking the ass-ripping, scrumtrulescent wonder-phantasy that is \\"Bittersweet\\" from Roxy Music's, \\"Country Life,\\" it's an absolute wonder to me that Bertolt Brecht-esque vaudvillian showtunes and sea shantys are such the rage and so \\"new-fangled\\" with all the younguns...Good but just extremely overrated..."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Picaresque\\" It Certainly Is; Picturesque too, But Good is Another Matter","review":"What's most annoying about this CD? I can hardly decide. Maybe that it's a bunch of Portland people pretending they're Steeleye Span or Fairport Convention? Or the fact that rock opera has been going straight downhill from Tommy and this one (though to be fair it doesn't bill itself so grandly) does nothing to stop the slide? Or that the lead singer and writer's voice grates on me like fingernails across a blackboard? Whatever, while the raves for it are very plentiful here, I have to dissent and say these folks are melodramatic and decidedly mediocre. I had to immediately put Surrealistic Pillow on the CD player to get rid of the bad aural taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blander than pinochle with your grandma","review":"This band is very bland (as the title of this review suggests). Lifeless would be another word you could use without fear of misrepresentation. I will agree that they have improved greatly since Castaways and Cutouts; they seem to have found more of a style for themselves. However, they unfortunately do not grab my attention. Some bands have bridges/parts that might sound like filler, the Decemberists have nearly 11 tracks of it. Also, I can't get over how much the singer sounds like a watered-down Jeff Mangum (Neutral Milk Hotel), intentionally or not, it's somewhat annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poseurs Sans Talent","review":"Can't sing, can't play, can't even get \\"Decembrists\\" reference right. This crap is anti-music for inverted snobs. It isn't half as smart as it thinks it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart and Diverse","review":"The Decemberists have a brilliant album here. Not only is the music entertaining to listen to, it also is smartly written. From the slow, mournful sounds of \\"Eli, the Barrow Boy\\" to the driving rhythm of \\"The Infanta\\", there is certainly a diverse range on this album.However, what truly makes this album great is the though that was put into writing the lyrics of each song. To some it may seem like \\"big words\\" are being thrown in at random, but a careful listen reveals that they are appropriately used in their context. \\"The Mariner's Revenge Song\\" especially shines in this aspect. It is a sea shanty of epic proportions, telling the tall tale of how a mariner seeks revenge on his arch nemesis who had ruined his life.If you are looking for indie/ folk rock, then I can't recommend another album more highly. Picaresque is a fantastic album that stands high above other albums that I have listened to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the original, real paper, filters","review":"These filters, are not like the original. I got a package of filters with my Acme juicerator, and thought I was ordering the same thing when I ordered these \\"paper\\" filter replacements. The original lapped a little when installed, enough to completely cover the inside of the blade basket, and keep the pulp from sticking in the basket. These are 3/4\\" shorter, and barely meet, so there may still be some pulp that gets on the basket, and is a pain when it comes to cleanup. The other thing is these are NOT paper, like the old ones were. I put a match to one, just to prove it, and it did not burn like paper, but melted like plastic. Poor design, and poor quality.... and not an acceptable replacement for the original REAL paper filters. Disappointed here, but stuck with no other options for filters that I can find."},{"rating":"1","title":"General comment regarding lack of product information","review":"I would likely spend a lot more at Amazon if someone would take a brief moment to put some basic information on the page. Using space to say it's attractive is a waste of time; I have eyes. Better to tell me how much coffee the canister holds. If I'm shopping for glassware, I want to know how much liquid the glass holds.

I can press into them with a finger nail and leave a mark. I dont know of any stainless steel that you could do that to, what a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: PRODUCT MISREPRESENTATION","review":"These chopsticks are NOT STAINLESS STEEL; they are NOT EVEN METAL.I can hardly blame the folks at Amazon for not realizing this initially: the product comes in a box with ceramic sauce bowls and chopstick rests that contribute significantly to the overall weight of the box. One wouldn't be able to easily distinguish silver-painted chopsticks from actual stainless steel chopsticks until the package is opened. Furthermore, I have serious doubts about whether these chopsticks are dishwasher safe.I would have returned them had I not found uses for the bowls and chopstick rests.In hindsight I wouldn't order these again.There are metal chopsticks available on Amazon (I recommend Global Decor Stainless Steel Chopsticks, 4 Pairs). Sadly, even these are not steel, probably aluminum; but the get the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the most part","review":"I got this as a christmas present for my sweetheart because I always forget to ask for chopsticks at the restaurants. I love the fact that it has chopstick holders so I don't have to lay them dirctly on the table, the bowls are really shallow and I'm not much of a sweet and sour sauce or soy sauce guy which is all i would see they would be good for. The chopsticks unfortunately are too smooth to hold any of the food in place, I may not have the most finesse but when i'm working with wood chopsticks I do just fine but smooth steel not so much. I've heard of people taking knives to them and creating etches or sanding them somewhat to make them rougher but I'm not the type of person that buys something so I can do more work to it to make it work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT STORY..TERRIBLE PRESENTATION","review":"The saga is well told, highly descriptive narative of a most unusual set of real life circumstances. (5 stars for this portion of purchase) The problem came about one-third through the text when the book spine split more than half way down the binding. This condition worsened as I read on, with total separation before I finished. Given it is a paperback, its life should be longer than the first reading.(1 star for this portion)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Ophelia","review":"I'm a fan of the original work (you know, Hamlet), as well as a consistent reader of any sort of updated fairy tale young adult novels (despite my growing age), but I was bored within the first three pages of this one and stopped reading after I hit around page twenty. For the first time in years I skipped ahead to the ending and was glad that I did so, to spare me the trouble of reading the middle. I won't ruin any of the few details, but in the author's blurb it claims that she was never satisfied with the original handling of female characters like Ophelia. Having written several term papers on various Shakesperian plays, I feel confident when I say that re-imagining the life of Ophelia, a character as fascinating as she is complex and tragic, is really unnecessary. Instead, stick with Roselind, Romeo's Ex, a book that works with the original story instead of against it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the association with Hamlet","review":"I read this book for a paper I was writing regarding the use of YA novels in helping students better understand Shakespeare's play Hamlet. This book does a poor job at reflecting the true story. It completely twists Shakespeare's plot and characters in an undesirable way. Fiedler completely removes the tradgedy from the play. This story has no value and fails to address the key themes and dillemas that the original has to offer. Michelle Ray's Falling for Hamlet is a much better choice and is executed beautifully. I would recommend reading that version over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dating Hamlet gives kids a start for Shakespeare","review":"I've read this book quite a few times, and I liked it very much. It encourages the younger reader to open to Shakespeare's plays, and I think Lisa Fiedler has done it very well.Great job, Mrs. Fiedler!!! You rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Dating Hamlet is good for anyone who does not like Shakespear. The original Hamlet is an ingenious tragedy, and Fiedler makes a joke out of it. All seriousness is lost by this false Ophelia play-acting everything. Fiedler's dialect is really bad, and it distracts from the plot of the story. I gave this book two stars instead of one because I couldn't seem to put it down. I did not like some of the things Fielder added (such as Polonius not being Ophelia's father, which wasn't in the orignal Hamlet.) If you want to read a great fantasy book with a strong female role, this isn't it. If you like Shakespear, don't read this book. But if you like characters who seem a little egotistical and fakey, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty product","review":"It worked fine for 2 weeks but now the thing will not quit cutting the power, it is not my wiring since I have another of the power sentry units and it works fine but the one that works is not the one with the coax.I have emailed CCV sales about the problem but have not heard from them yet.

The strap looks beefy enough from the photo but there is a reason the seller fades the photo and does not show the bottom part of the strap. Below the black webbing you see the strap has a very small quick release buckle that separates the strap from the portion that attaches to the camera. This buckle is of extremely low quality. A mild tug on the buckle and it will separate without pushing the buttons. I can forecast an unexpected separation and my camera crashing to the floor.The second major design flaw is the thin twine used to attached the bottom portion of the strap to the camera.

I liked the fact that it had a battery indicator into the taillight switch. Genius!The bulb is BRIGHT. For the size of it, it's great to have for traveling, better than a big 'ol maglight in your book bag. It also can take a beating, I've accidentally dropped it a bit, and it holds up.

While similar to the first disc in most respects, the song choice makes this sequel stronger. Always intoxicating, moods range from mellow to hyper.

Jessica Lange was superb in the role of Frances, but unfortunately, the movie-and book- are highly sensationalized and will leave you finding Frances Farmer capricious and not very sympathetic. Furthermore, the fictions in both book and movie, are, among many, that FF was lobotomized, and that the mental ward she and her fellow female patients occupied was opened up at night to US Army soldiers for a nights of mass rape. Never happened. There are good sources of information about Frances Farmer, but Shadowland was meant to sell, not tell the real story of the beautiful, rebellious and highly intelligent FF.

Although it delivers on its premise, namely sketching out a history of Japan, it was a relief to finally put the book down after having read it.This book I bought for the dual purpose of being entertained and learn something in the process, but it could only fulfill the latter requirement. It may be unfair to ask of a book to be engaging and still tell a whole country's history in under 300 pages, so I'm probably unfair - the book just reads too much like a textbook, and that wasn't really what I had hoped for.Not knowing too much about Japanese history from other sources, I can't comment on the accuracy of the text, but there's an annoyingly high frequency of simple spelling errors, etc.Lastly, there's only one map of Japan in the Southeast Asian setting, and it's buried deep inside of the book. I really missed a map of Japan in the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Have Been Better!","review":"Besides the rather blatant reviews, I for one really liked the concise history that Mr Meyer has written. In my opinion, this book really is great; it gives a rather detailed explanation of Japan from its prehistory, to the Mongol invasions, to the Tokugawa isolation, to the Meiji era, to the American invasion of Japan in 1945, and to its current military and economic world power position today. The book could have had some more illustratons, except for a map of Japan, but then again, it's all right. I suggest that beginners in Japanese history start with something a bit more generalized, but it's a great book. In my opinion, every history buff should own this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"I loved this book--I couldn't put it down I was so involved with the characters and story.

This is not written for the mediocre but for the aspirant and as such it is a literary masterpiece. Edward has done justice to the philosophical tenets that captured the imagination of those curious enough to ponder an alternate form of government. Where the notion of being beholden to crown would become a foreign concept. He delves into much of what must have been a turbulent and often dangerous time and captures the \\"rain drops\\" as one, the reader, understands and is awed by the profoundness of the charachters, vile or not.

Or a poem about celebrating the 'spirit of woman' or another that scolds consumers for not recycling? I give it one star for having a pretty cover.

This is obviously a DVD for real conductor enthusiasts - Bohm's rehearsal technique, as Mr. Morrison states, is detailed, demanding, and rather cranky, but he gets the desired results and his knowledge of the score is amazingly precise and impressive.

Every time you touch the thing the fur continues to fall off. It has so little quality in comparison to the other 4 that I almost wonder if it's a fake. Cheaper to throw away than return it for another one. I would not recommend this animal and would not purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Present!","review":"I got this for my daughter and she was very happy.

Just so you know what you are paying for. A mini Webkinz does have a code like other products for Webkinz - but is NOT a full size Pet and is not the same as the regular Webkinz pets that are adopted on line to open an account with.I had to go out to several stores in order to find the one she actually wanted - once I compared the Yorkie to other pets out there I wasn't very impressed.

We are treated to a little more of the lighter side of Serge as he passes the summer playing house in a typical Tampa neighborhood.Of course, if Serge, Coleman and Sharon are around, then you know things will be anything but typical as plotlines swirl wildly around the neighborhood until crashing together at Jim Davenport's Fourth of July party.If you enjoyed any of the previous three books by Dorsey, this one should be no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Builds up to a violently hilarious Independence Day gathering","review":"Tim Dorsey is at his top form in portraying hilariously dysfunctional characters and thing their stories together while polishing off the bad guys in comically fiendish ways and somehow rewarding the \\"good\\" guys whether they intend to be \\"good\\" or not.

I need to see some type of timeline here. Maybe I'm on Dorsey overload, having breezed through the first three novels in as many weeks, but this one didn't do it for me. It does definitely have it's moments. Serge addressing a college campus on graduation day after building a following both in numbers and prestige is hysterical. The climactic chase scene is well written echoing that of the wackiness of simlar scenes in movies like \\"What's Up Doc?.\\" If I had to list these in order of favorites thus far it would fall like this.1. Orange Crush2. Hammerhead Ranch Motel3. Florida Roadkill4. Triggerfish TwistIf I were to read this somewhere further down the line (after a much needed break) I might give it a third star.

They looked like Adidas from a (great) distance, but they fell apart in weeks.This book is akin to those cheap shoes: it's kind of like one of Hiassen's comedic books for adults, but it falls apart when you read it.A positive point is that I actually laughed aloud two times while reading. A negative point is that the book is only a series of set pieces that are supposed to be funny but have no structural justification. Hence, if the gags fall flat, as most of them do, there is no reason to read them, as they do not advance the plot (there being no plot to speak of) or convey necessary background.The book's light reading and I did manage to finish it--this I wouldn't have if it had taken more than three hours--but I wouldn't recommend it, though I wouldn't actively warn anyone away, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny in an offbeat, over-the-top way","review":"This is not the funniest book I've ever read, but it is quite funny in spots and entertaining overall.

The scenes cut were the 'steamier' ones. Obviously some uptight censor got hold of this film after I had seen the original in 1974.

I bought these along with a set of 12\\" from a local pet store. I prefer these tongs because they are sturdier and offer a better range of grip; strong enough to hold up a f/t jumbo rat but gentle enough to release when the snake tags it.

So far it has withstood the scrutiny of my high school students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over forty years old and still the best.","review":"Of the large number of books available on the subject of orchestration Piston's is still the most useful. Although published back in 1955 it is clearer and more accessable than any book written since that I have encountered. Occassionally Piston's literary style is dated and a tad dull but the book is not intended to be entertaining but rather be used as a reference book to be dipped into when needed.Of the other books available, Forsyth's 'Orchestration' is the most entertaining and well worth a read. For anyone interested in how 20th-century composers have written orchestral music I recommend Morgan's 'Anthology of 20th-century Music' (published by Norton) which includes extracts of a number of 20th-century orchestral masterpieces (as well as chamber and solo instrumental works). But if I had to choose to own just one book on Orchestration then it would have to be the Piston."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Pistons are burned out","review":"Walter Piston taught at Harvard. I am a former Harvard music major. I find all of his books to be excessively pendantic to the point where they are boring. There is no joy in his writing. He approaches his subject like the author of a high school alegra text. He wrote for money and his books were published because he had impressive academic credentials, and for no other reason.The true test is to do some brief comparative reading with texts by other authors. Who inspires? Who bores? Judge for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"This is considered the essential book on the subject... not by composers but, I am sure, just by students who simply have been told as much by their teachers. As a composer I can assure you that this is not a well-written or thoughtfully organized book. The musical examples are fairly limited and, quite simply, anyone who is interested in orchestration will not get good information here. I don't want to go on about it... it's just not a good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinese Folklore and the History of the Lim Family","review":"\\"Parasol Tree Village\\" is more than just a delightful story of the Lim family. In addition to providing detailed genealogical charts, this little book includes not only charming legends such as the story of the Tree King God, but also the family legends, nursery rhymes and lullabies that are a part of the author's heritage. Ms. Lin summarizes in an interesting way the tale of Emperor Zou, his vicious nephew-emperor and his evil concubine, Dah-chi. She also gives an account of the belief in the Goddess of All Trades, Mah-tzo. All of this is written in a beautiful, poetic style. The reader will discover unexpected gems; an explanation of Chinese astrology, and beautiful sayings that were handed down in the author's family, one of which is \\"A centipede has a thousand feet, but it crawls no faster than a snake\\".Anyone interested in folklore, the cultural heritage of the Taiwanese people, and Chinese history should own this small volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 of the 3 stories were good","review":"I wasn't sure that I'd like \\"Risky Business\\" but I was pleasantly surprised. The adventure was interesting without being too involved, and the romance and relationship built very nicely.The same cannot be said of \\"Storm Warning\\". There was no romance in the story and the male protagonist was hateful. The story, beyond the love story (if you can call it that), was interesting. It reminded me a little bit of some of Agatha Christie's stories.\\"The Welcoming\\" is a very nice story about a man ready to learn to love and a loving, giving woman. Likable characters.This book isn't Roberts' best but the first and last stories are nice reads. If you can get passed the nasty male protagonist and the lack of romance in the second story, you might find the mystery interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for die hard fans!","review":"I gave this book two stars - one for Risky Business and one for The Welcoming - they are typical stories written by my favorite author. Predictable, yes, but enjoyable. Storm Warning made me mad. I wish I had not spent the time trying to figure it out, It made no sense! Do not buy this book. Go check it out at the library and read the first and last story, but skip Storm Warning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a difference 22 years makes...","review":"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan, but it is evident in these early works what a difference 22 years of writing has made for her.These are so-so short stories that show hints of her current style without the polish.Risky Business and The Welcoming were okay - nothing special - but could have used a little more character development. Okay as a short stories go.Storm Warning was definitely not her best effort and could have used about 100 pages of character development to explain the history of the two lead characters - especially the male. (Maybe his character was indicative of the time it was written in and the style used back in 1984.)All in all an interesting look at her early efforts/style, but her more current works are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keychain Wallet Card-Holder","review":"Well-made and attractive.

Royals always have been known for double standards regarding sexual activities. The story revolves around Mrs. Keppel and her daughter Violet.The book was very well written, never dry and actually based on memoirs, diaries and letters. We get our voyeuristic tendencies gratified but you also feel the deep emotions that a mother and daughter go through no matter what the era.I had read other books regarding Mrs. Keppel, her daughter Violet, but never one on Violet's lover Anita Sackville-West. This additional entry of West almost caused a upper crust cat fight between mother, daughter and the daughters lover. Aside from all of that, the book kept my interest with true insight into Edwardian social values being threatened by an out of the closet event.A most enjoyable, well written and enlightening book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for everything","review":"I have loved this product.

As a sheet metal worker these snips are the worst I have ever used. The head is too big to cut in small spaces.

If you read \\"Timepiece\\" and \\"The Christmas Box\\", you must read \\"The Letter\\". This book was a little slow in the middle, but keep with it. However, the ending packed a powerful punch. Again, I cried. I fell in love with David and Mary Ann Parkin all over again.Richard Paul Evans is a gifted writer. I hope he writes more books like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Disappointed in this Conclusion","review":"I LOVED the Christmas Box and bought several copies for friends. I enjoyed The Timepiece but not quite as much but it would still be in my Top 20 books. The Letter, however, was a big disappointment. I felt it didn't remain true to the characters and I especially didn't want David and Mary Anne to have problems and waste precious \\"Time\\" together. It may be a truer account of life but that's not what I was looking for. The other story line in the book was all that held this together for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hate to see the Parkins Go","review":"I wish the Parkins' story didn't have to end. They were a family whose love endured all, and I loved imagining how powerful was the loved they shared.

This is a great book to snuggle up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dead LetterZone","review":"I admit that I have not read the other books in the trilogy that \\"The Letter\\" concludes, but this book gave me no inspiration to read the others.Trite and predictible, it's poorly developed characters seem wooden in what should be an emotionally charged semi-biography. The author relies on maudlin, mawkish emotions to propel the characters along. Rather than it feeling like it is based on a true story, it comes too close to being romance novel.I suppose if you like \\"The Bridges of Madison County,\\" you'd find this enjoyable reading, but I'll pass on any more by this author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This book was the perfect end to the Trilogy by Richard Paul Evans.

They really could have/should have pushed it another season, and it's ridiculous that Season 2 hasn't been widely released (thus the sky-high prices).

We get his insight into basically every film he ever made just with the introduction; and then he gives us the dish on how they all came to be. I have read a few of these \\"on\\" books and this is the first that truly interested me. Fellini was a genius and saw the world in a way we could only try to understand through his films.

Despite the title and cover illustration, the book has nothing to do with Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. Each of the book's eight pages features a brief rhyme and an illustration of a Christmas-related scene: carollers, stockings, a tree, Santa, etc. There are no reindeer mentioned or pictured in the book. Apparently this is one of those Christmases when Rudolph was left at the North Pole.I get the distinct impression that this book was written by a middle-school student and never saw an editor's pen. The rhymes are weak and obvious, and on the last page of the book the verse inexplicably changes from present tense to past tense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinese junk","review":"I was under the inpression I was buying a knife made in Switzerland.

For those that are interested the blade is beveled (it is hard to see in the picture), and I found the edge to be not as sharp as I would have liked (personal preference).Perhaps the most useful feature about this knife is the sheath. The plastic sheath is made to fit the knife perfectly and is vented to allow for drying. I have found that when the blade is inserted in the proper orientation, part of the sheath designed to hold the blade in place sometimes catches the blade, making insertion awkward at times. All in all the sheath is great.

The plastic cover/case works well which is handy because there were no more open slots in my knife block.

I found it to be very messy and not very effective. I almost ran out of strips before I was finished with one leg. I had to go over the same spots multiple times, and still ended up using my razor to finish the job. It may work better if you are more experienced or possible have a wax warmer. Who knows.

I can not reiterate the amazing complexity of the melodies and rhythm structures in Double Figure. The layers of these songs all work together creating a warm and inviting sound that can be replayed for ages.

Genius, just genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 Plaid are one of my favorites ....","review":"Tracks 13-19 (mostly co-written with others) almost reach the edge of decency, but the bulk of this 70-minute disc is a real shocker! Forget the intricate, intelligent composition they've become known for. This is mostly electro that sounds like a few kids tried a to play piano for the first time and someone directly translated their musical thoughts into techno sounds and basic beat loops. I know that sounds really harsh, especially since I love Ed & Andy and so highly praise their former work, but this really IS bad!! I can bearly listen to it, and only if I'm feeling particularly masochistic.

The original Broadway cast recording is outstanding. This recording unfortunately fails to do justice to the great music that is \\"Hair\\". The songs are poorly mixed, with overpowering background vocals, which in retrospect are probably a blessing, as the lead vocals are poor at best. The lead singers are unable to cover the range the songs require, and on some of the pieces their voices crack, screech, and change octaves like teens going through puberty. Ultimately it's the director who is at fault though, since apparently they believed they could arrange these pieces better than the songs' creators.

One can only wonder why this book has not been written before. Zirin makes it apparent that he had no shortage of material from which to cull these informative, socially conscious, and well-crafted essays. To whom would they not appeal? Sports fans, the politically aware, athletes--young and old, history buffs, teachers, and avid non-fiction readers will all find something in this book to interest and inform. To live in this sports-obsessed society and not be aware of the way resistance, militantism, social awareness, and social activism have played a part in sports is possible, but, with the publication of this book, simply unnecessary now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched, thin, bias, socialist propaganda","review":"This book is the worst kind of biased liberal journalism in that it implies that everyone with an opposing view is a racist. The book is thin, ignorant of the facts, and one-sided. The book is about black athletes affected by racism, but why does the author always use racism as an excuse for everything? In Zirin's world, no black athlete can be held accountable for his actions, is responsible for his own actions(ie: Ricky Williams, Barry Bonds), and it's disgusting the way the author uses racism as a defense mechanism to any counter view. Worse, I believe the author is dishonest. He takes his point of view, not because he believes what he says, but because it's the only platform he can find to write inside of. Besides that, the book is thin, poorly researched, and the interviews are self-serving. Is there any athletes' behavior that offends this author?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Left-wing propaganda","review":"I hated this book.

I found this book a great disappointment, however. It reads as if it were slapped together in a hurry without much thought given to organization or coherence. This is one more book that begs the question: what do today's editors do? Certainly they don't edit. Zirin weakens his thesis by repeatedly overstating the case, stretching the point, and taking cheap shots. I wish he would have put some more time and effort into this. Dave Meggyesy (who did the forward) wrote a much better book. Read Harry Edwards or Jack Scott if you're interested in this topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by an excellent writer","review":"I have always enjoyed the sportswriting of Dave Zirin, so I anticipated reading his approach to this very compelling subject. Unfortunately, What's My Name Fool simply fell flat with surprisingly uninspired analysis within a text that comes off as preoccupied with \\"dead horse\\" incidents of ancient times.Being a sports buff, and having read much on this subject, I dare say that the the scope of published works already available are far beyond where Zirin takes up the matter--sometimes decades beyond. Many works have shone brighter and more direct lighting on the politicization of America's pasttimes, but Zirin gives them little attention.I would suggest that we wait for when Zirin makes more time to really invest in this subject--he certainly has the potential to do it justice.

A little expensive but if they last 20 years its worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bent after 1day use","review":"I purchased this steel saucer for my daughter (Christmas 2012). Two days after Christmas is snowed--awesome and too the hill we went. We used this saucer 1 day and it was bent, lost the paint and was rough to ride (feel every bump).

My 12 year old son didn't go over any jumps or do anything crazy, he just plopped his butt down and went. After 5 runs, the sled was unusable: dented in multiple spots and the paint cracking off all over the place. This thing is a veritable piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"I was really excited Santa brought two of these for my kids this year. Finally we get our first snow, within 10 minutes both of them were completely dented and most of the paint had come off. They dented so badly, they are unusable. We couldn't even get the entire way down the hill. If I had pulled out a baking sheet from the cabinet it would have worked better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I wish I would have read more of the negative reviews before purchasing the product.

Going to check and see if we can return them.Pure junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as you would think","review":"I thought i had purchased an item that was definitely a steal. Product seemed sturdy when it arrived...decent weight...made of metal and i couldnt wait to try it out with my familiy. Unfortunately after one run down the slopes it was dented in...I believe some other reviews had similar comments and so now you can add this one to it. Maybe its weight specific (didnt look into it before buying) but either way its too bad that a product that seemed to have potential failed the way it did. Maybe its better for smaller children who are lighter weight but this definitely didnt hold up for an adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"This sled sails down the hills!","review":"I purchased this sled for my nine year old.

You can't go wrong with metal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Furious Flexible Flyer","review":"We recently purchased the Flexible Flyer Steel Saucer sled for our daughter after having worn out two of the plastic ones each season. It is definitely a product I would recommend to others. It is durable, goes fast and she loves it! The steel is stamped and rolled on the edges so there aren't any sharp spots. The only thing she mentioned is it is a little harder on the shins. When I asked if she would trade it I got a very adamant NO. Now, if they only made a sled for adults out of the same material!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and durable","review":"Our 5 year old daughter loves her sled. We purchased it last year and we probably won't have to buy a new one until she outgrows this one.

It's short and sweet--and very entertaining--and packed with useful tips for planning your trip and getting around once you are there. The best part is it fits in a purse or pocket, so we took it everywhere. We actually wound up contacting Nan to arrange our tours and she is lovely. The most helpful tip for me was the suggestion to pick a color and pack only items in that color so you could mix and match--it elimated an entire suitcase, key when traveling by train between cities. The pronunciation and key phrases sections were excellent as well. We dog-eared many pages we used over and over again. I've purchased seven copies in the past year for other friends traveling to Italy and have urged Nan to write instructions for Paris, Spain, and other countries as well--she's really got the formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Pretty disappointing. The book is about 3 x 5 inches and maybe a quarter of it is taken up by vocabulary that is easily available in other guidebooks or on the web.

There is little here that you could not find in a good ordinary guide book.Nan is also inclined to romaticise. For example her notion that Italian drivers belong to a sort of community of the road and that they have a highly developed perception of what is going on around them that allows them to drive the way they do with impunity is simply not borne out by their shocking road accident statistics. And after 4 weeks driving on Italian roads my observation is that they are often simply just impatient and reckless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Italy: Instructions for use-I devoured it in one sitting","review":"This is a wonderful book, especially for novice travelers.The writer includes pictures to assist with vending machinesat the bus and railway terminal, phrases invaluable for any visitorand simple hints to guarantee a most wonderful trip.

Having said this -- most of the writers do an outstanding job in interacting with Barth's thought. Webster's introduction is nicely done. Heron's conclusion and interaction with Barth's legacy is also beautiful. And then, its worth having the book just for Bruce McCormack's, George Hunsinger's, and Trevor Hart's articles on Barth.

Definitely recommend this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two stories in one...","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Once you begin to read it, most likely you won't want to put it down. The author begins by telling stories of two different people, Porter Washington and Winona Fairchild, with completely different lives but with similar issues. They are both in a major transition period in their lives; most of their battles were internal and somehow the author was able to make them entertaining. By fate, they were able to meet up and the story picked up even more steam. After I read it, I was convinced either the Ms. Robinson knows people such as the ones in the book, or she has the greatest imagination I have ever seen. This is a book where you will make yourself read it from beginning to end just from there being so many twists and turns. So far, I've read two of her books and they have both been top-notch with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sounds for 2001","review":"This is a great CD mix of Club feel.

The second Album by Tall Paul is also nice and I kind like both of them. A few songs are repeated from other Ministry of Sound Albums. I am more of a Hard Rave person.........so the end tracks of both Albums were quite appealing......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and quiet","review":"Great value, quality product, only advice is get tennis racket grip tape if your hands get sweaty or you use hand cream.

They weigh quite a bit more and the forearm cuffs are still too widely gapped to stay on my arms if I let go of the handles. Since they are fairly new for me the cuffs may still be adjusting to my forearms as is claimed. The adjustable components are strong and well designed. They are comfortable. The metallic/chrome body is stylish in an industrial sort of way and is probably less likely to show scrapes and scratches than my previous pair. They feel very sturdy and are quiet. They are easier to stand against a wall or some other support without falling sideways because the cuff is a soft, non slip material. More experience is needed to form a final opinion about these crutches but so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect and economical","review":"For such a good price these are very solid, strong and stable.

Shoddy and doesn't work too well!","review":"This shoddy, poorly made product isn't even worth a dime. The blue bases, that are supposed to provide stability so that the 'wiggling jets' stand up, are lightweight and shift all the time. Thus, the wiggling jet thingies often don't wiggle, and are stuck on the ground instead. My daughter and her friends were very dissapointed.

I have uploaded an actual picture in the customer photos section so that you can see for yourself. Out of 15 nozzles, only about three of them spray anything worth playing in. The rest lay limp on the ground or spray maybe 6\\" of water, at best. The item is poorly made and lacks the weight to keep the nozzles upright. We have tried using things (stakes and weights) to help it, but quite honestly, it just wasn't worth it. We ended up turning on the lawn sprinkler and the kids were a bit overjoyed. At any price, this is NOT worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"It's too hard to keep the tube straight so that it sprays correctly.

This works perfectly. You don't even have to use the extra blue bases, just connect it to your faucet. Every one of the small hoses wiggles and squirts. Any problem any one else has had must be due to their water pressure being too low. My 7 yr old thinks it works great. There is nothiong wrong with this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"My kids are sad.

I am a novice when it comes to authoring help systems, and as I read through this book I could not figure out why I wasn't understanding much. After much consideration, I realized that the headings in this book are resembling headings for a help system, in that they are mostly gerunds. This wouldn't be such a problem if beneath the headings, the author would actually have written paragraphs explaining the material. Instead, most of the content in the book is bulleted--as if they were steps you'd follow in a procedure!! To say the least, this book is disjointed. It is not for people seeking to learn about writing help systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"What a disappointment. Many more eloquent writers could have done much better with this exciting idea. The style of this book made each story feel like a cliff note. Incomplete.

The controls work fine (the touch wheel control requires a tiny amount of pressure) and the case seals well against dust and debris. The arm band works great and keeps the nano controls from accidentally being pressed.The case might be a bit bulky for those wanting a case for general purpose.

As someone who is into counseling, preaching and theology I highly recomend the book. It has been a comfort to me, helped me to see some hard times in a diffrent light and perspective and I am convinced it will do the same to everyone who still believes that God exists and whatever his theological back ground is because Talbert makes the Bible the most important positiv argument.

Horror picture fans will not be disappointed and even the casual horror picture fans may find the series engaging. Very well done indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for one play","review":"I liked this game for one time through, but it doesn't continue.

I look forward to season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT NEW SERIES!!!","review":"I have watched all six episodes and it did make me jumped off the couch with one scene. I was sure I wrenched my knee flying off the couch. It looks like they had a lot of fun making this and I hope there is another season. It is not your typical zombie show. It actually has a plot. It is also a cliffhanger. I like the characters; except for the wife, I agree, she is weak and they need to boost her character up a lot. I find the hillbilly character very good. He gets the job done and he is not the stupid one in the group. It will be interesting to see if they continue the sequel. It does keep you on your seat and in suspense. It would definitely not want to miss a show as it comes each week. I like seeing how they get out of each situation they come upon. It has potential. Seeing the First Season makes me want to see another one. I hope they bring it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show good; unbox BAD","review":"The show was great.Unfortunately I didn't get to watch it for over a week after I ordered it. I tried to download it onto my netbook, a couple days before a trip. Unbox used 100% of the CPU and ran for two days and still failed to download a single, complete episode. I tried to continue in the airport(s) but not only did it not make progress, but it started back from the beginning! I will not be ordering any more digital video content from amazon for a long time. Hopefully if I give it a year or two Amazon will improve their downloader/DRM manager to something even slightly usable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A spoiler... don't watch! See Episode 1 First","review":"There are just too many key elements of the plot revealed here and it's always a shame when trailers wreck the really great films they are intending to promote. I was just lucky to have watched Episode 1 before watching the free 5-minute preview. And Episode 1 is spectacular... a 5-star show, excellent special effects and great acting. I am hooked and can't wait to watch all of the rest in Season 1. This is the best zombie flick ever and some very fine sci-fi in general. It just leaped way ahead of Zombieland which was my previous front-runner. The story is much more true-to-life and riveting. BUT...

I'm only rating the product that AMC seriously needs to reconsider prices for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show, but only 6 Episodes? Really?","review":"I really enjoyed following the story, but can't help but feel a little ripped off being charged so much money for only 6 episodes. If anything, AMC should include some fun stuff with the series. Maybe a map of everywhere the story as taken place thus far? Fake blood?

But the two disk Blu Ray version has a SERIOUS AUDIO PROBLEM!!!! The volume of the conversation on screen would go from barely audible to VIOLENTLY LOUD as soon as any action occurs. I understand the concept of raising the volume to denote the action but this isn't a little adjustment. I would have to turn my volume up to 50 to hear the conversation then it would get so loud I had to turn the volume down to 20 during action sequences only to have to adjust the volume back to 50 when the conversation started again. This issue alone cost it 2 stars IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking Dead: Season 1","review":"I was skeptical at first to watch a 'zombie' TV series but the plot and acting caught my attention from the start. The first episode had the flavor of an old flick titled 'Day of the Triffids', which I, and I'm sure many other Baby Boomers will agree, enjoyed. The story line proceeds smoothly (with some bumps) throughout. One gets used to smashed skulls, brains and blood very quickly. The make-up and special effects are supurb. I had to buy the second season (which I never do) to see where it's all going. Now I'm dvr-ing the third seasoning. Hooked I am.

And yes, i do have a fast internet connection. I experience scuffs in a couple of scenes. My only explanation would be if by HD, this shows it in 720p, and not 1080. For the most part though, the show will grab your attention and those scuffy HD scenes may not bug you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Zombie intro.","review":"I must admit, I watched this series not having much experience in the zombie genre beyond Michael Jackson's Thriller video. I found it to be really well written with a great cast that delivers a believable performance. While I'd not been a zombie fan in the past, I have long been interested in end-of-the-world and catastrophic themes. The idea of a super bug taking out the majority of the population is not a new idea but adding the zombie twist was new for me. I found the first season of The Walking Dead to be entertaining and far too short at just six episodes. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Show - DVD lacking in special features","review":"First of all, I love all things zombie so I'm biased towards liking this show.The DVD was lacking in the special features to me.

It is very slow paced and lacks tension for most of the episodes. The acting involves too much acting and there are not enough zombies. The main characters sit around and mope far too much as they apparently wait for the studio to hire a semi-competent writer who could liven things up. The pacing is pretty much exactly the same on Survivor.It feels entirely contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic??

Whew!Then add the tiresome people that are hiding but then act stupidly suspicious at the wrong times; the redundant raiding of department stores; the usual military has a safe haven; the tiresome search for survivor groups. The, by-the-way, Who decades ago thought up the zombie walk?, since it makes no anatomical sense but at least in this TV series they actually run which also makes no sense when they can barely walk the rest of the time.There must be a segment of the population that is zombie TV transfixed that recognizes kin in this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately can't play on our Blu-ray player!","review":"Well after a long week at work etc and very excited to sit down and watch our very newly opened package of The Walking Dead season 1, our player suddenly shows in MASSIVE words saying that the region of the disc does not match the region of the player! WTF!!! We checked to our absolute astonishment and have realised that our BD is locked to a country. Now Amazon has clearly stated that it is region locked to 1 BUT does not state in ANY WAY that its BD is locked to region A which is VERY different to regions 1,2,3,4,5,6.

This set comes with all the episodes (as expected) but also includes special features on the second disc which is nice. The only complaint I have is that the show is not High Definition. I am not sure how they filmed this series but whenever I watch it on Blu-Ray I notice it has a \\"grainy\\" sort of look to it. I've tested this on three different TVs and they all looked the same.

However, I quickly became hooked. \\"The Walking Dead\\" is an amazing, character-driven drama that also includes an amazing global zombie plot. (Side note: I am dying to win a stagger-on role in Season 2!) It's a fantastic show and I encourage everyone to check it out. The only two things that bug me about it are the fact that Season 1 was only six episodes long (whose stupid idea was that?!) and also that, except for the characters of Rick and his young son, Carl, most of the other characters really annoy the heck out of me. I find myself hoping that they all get killed by zombies. Hopefully the show introduces some more likable characters in Season 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Hype?","review":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this show. Our main character wakes up from a gun shot wound to find that the planet has been taken over by zombies. He was a police officer and he quickly goes back to trying to get order in his life, in particular finding his wife and son (who happen to be not that far away, in the woods, hunkered down with his best friend).There is/was a lot of hype around this show and I'm not sure why.

The zombie presence is there, but the focus on the story and the group's struggle to survive is what makes this a riveting show. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, even for non-zombie fans","review":"I was not a fan of zombie movies before this show, but I tuned in because a friend told me it was very good. I found it to be among the best TV shows currently. It was not the usual blood, gore, and screams zombie fest. While it does have its share of that, it also turns out to be first & foremost, a well-told story about very human characters, with all their failings & heroism, showing both the good & the bad in them. And it is dealt with in a realistic fashion, with the characters making decisions that let them survive, or making wrong decisions that get them killed, without any miraculous \\"saves\\" that we don't get in real life. It is on-the-edge of your seat suspenseful, keeps me coming back & wanting more. Can't wait for the new seasons! If you like a good story about very human characters, even if you don't like zombies normally, you'll probably like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you wanting more","review":"Like the concept and the pace.

Even with AMC's record of producing high quality series & Darabont's previous works, I still worried because adapations almost never meet the calibre of the source material. Thank goodness my worries were for nothing.The first season compromises of six episodes with the first one strong enough to be released on its own as a standalone movie. Some fans of the comic didn't like some of the changes made to the characters/plot but I think these changes didn't detract from the series at all.The episodes are well written and boast a strong cast. Viewers who normally shy away from horror/zombie films shouldn't stay away from this. Yes, there is some gore (and of course zombies!) but the story is really about the human relationships in the time of utter devestation. The zombies are merely a prop used to move the story along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Season One Finale","review":"The first season of the Walking Dead was quite good, with everything you could want--action, excitement, personal conflict, a bit of zombie gore, and enough difference from the comic book version to make it exciting.

A Zombie tv show. And get this they are actually slow!!! Amazing, with all those miraculously fast zombies that keep popping up. How is that possible? You are dead and decomposing? Right?Anyway, this is a must see for anyone who like the zombie genre. I would also suggest this to someone who is new to the genre. As we have seen from the history of zombie film, humans are more dangerous to each other than zombie to human. Once again the zombies exist here as a catalyst to let the tensions between the humans escalate.Cinematic...and beautiful.

And falls in the same category as resident evil, 28 days/weeks later, and Zombies!!! It's intense, scary, and GORY and GRUESOME!!!! Love it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series on TV","review":"I have been an on again off again zombie fan. I think playing the Left 4 Dead computer games have really help made me a zombie fan. The walking dead series on TV and comic books and continued to strengthen my interest in this genre.About the series:First view episodes does a great job of pulling you in, after that some people complain the plot and story goes nowhere. I disagree because I enjoy the character development and silly distractions the survivors go through when surrounded by the walking dead.If you are new to the genre this worth your time and money to watch ALL seasons of this show. Also I would recommend Zombieland as well! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"gory but great","review":"could happen. but maybe not zombies. maybe germ warfare with crazy gas, that makes people mean and violent. Hope it never does."},{"rating":"2","title":"This show is more addictive than drugs!","review":"This show could be on for 100 seasons and none of them would ever compare to the first season. Andrew Lincoln and the rest of the cast do a more than superb job of portraying a rag tag group of survivors learning how to stay alive and maintain their humanity in a world full of \\"walkers\\" (zombies). I love that they don't explain how or why this apocalypse happened and that they don't waste screen time filling us in on the characters background ad nauseum. They give us just enough info to form an opinion and then move on to the storyline. There's nothing I don't like about this show. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Plot, Too Graphic and Gorey","review":"Love the story and plot. Great acting. Good photography and visuals. I made it through 3 episodes by closing my eyes at some of the gore. I also had to resort to plugging my ears during a scene of chopping up a zombie body with an ax that went on forever. I couldn't watch and all the splattering blood and organs or stand the graphic sound effects. Too much violence for me..... It would be a 5 star if only there was less gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, weak, weak","review":"The show started fresh, but quickly sizzled. The concept had a lot of potential, but it's filled with too many plain dumb interpersonal relationship dramas.

Resident Evil with 1/100th the budget - ugh, had to ff through it. How can it be getting good reviews?? WOW"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks....","review":"How is this thing getting so many good reviews? - It's basically a predictable and uninteresting extended version of Resident Evil, just without any of the fun high tech stuff. Running around the southern countryside randomly stumbling into zombies....really? Plus you know exactly whats gonna happen, no surprise, no anything. The characters are soo forgettable, bland without any deep personality...was actually rooting for the zombies to eat them to put this mediocre series out of its misery - ugh, so bad, CSPAN is more exciting....STAY AWAY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD QUALITY","review":"I was so excited to receive this and watched the entire thing and season finale skipped through the entire last episode, so disappointed. I will be buying my videos in the store from now on. A lot easier to return if not working right. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Watching","review":"I didn't imagine it possible, but AMC has turned a post apocalyptic zombie thriller into a boring soap opera. The silly interpersonal relationship issues are just ridiculous, and drag on, and on.

Eventually, I hope to own all the seasons. The bonus features are just icing on the cake! I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT DYSTOPIAN SERIES","review":"This series is going to be perfect for sci-fi fans who have a knack for dystopian tales. This particular series, dealing with zombies, grips you from the very beginning of the first episode which takes place at the start of the disease's spread. Throughout the series, you'll dangle on cliffhangers and surely be tempted to watch it all at once, all episodes back-to-back. Characters are complex, intriguing and far from perfect. I would recommend giving this a shot. One episode will prove whether it's right for you or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly addictive!","review":"I don't have TV so, I hadn't seen the show.

I've been addicted to this show sine the first episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look at the real reviews","review":"Anyone reading the first review on this episode would get a very bad impression of this series. I may be biased by the developments that happened in the second season, but I really appreciate the pace at which this is moving. They started us right off with the action, and we will learn more about the characters first. It makes sense that some of the characters die before we really get to know them... What else would be more realistic in a post-apocalyptic world with all kinds of dangers around. We will get to know these characters through the memories and flashbacks or even just references from other characters. If you want realism, accept that group members are dying, and expect that some of the main characters are going to die, as well.Look at the Season 1 Non-HD version of this on Amazon for proper reviews by hundreds of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"In love with this series :))","review":"This is now my very favorite zombie show bar none! Better than most if not all zombie movies (gasp!) So incredibly impressed with the tone of the series, the actors are amazing, the human story is awesome, & it just keeps me wanting more.

People making wisecracks during this series irritate me ;-PBonus features, behind the scenes stuff is just awesome for zombie fans too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!!","review":"If you don't enjoy this show your just weird! I absolutely love it! I have bought 2 sets for christmas gifts"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome show","review":"You can't get any more realistic! So my favorite zombie movie was the dawn of the dead and will say this rises a little above the movie. Take your time to watch all these episodes and you will not be disappointed! Yes this show is gory so if you have children and do not want them watching stuff like this then ill advise you to stick to not letting them watch this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to review the beginning once again","review":"Excellent acting and a screenplay that has you on the edge of your seat. Andrew Lincoln who plays the lead character Rick Grimes is outstanding in this role. It's horror if your faint of heart. Being slowly introduced in Atlanta to each of the other main characters like Glenn (who saves Rick from the zombies) and then Andrea, Daryl and Merle Dixon, T-Dog, Jackie and Morales and Jim helps you to start connecting with who they are in the series. Each person plays an important role - even the zombie 'Wayne' is remembered for his sacrifice to help them get past the zombies in the episode \\"Guts'. I highly recommend getting all of the 3 series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased as gift","review":"Son is big fan and loves catching up on all the missed episodes.

I hope all the nonsense behind the scens does not ruin this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Walking Dead Season 1 \\"Special\\" Edition","review":"I do NOT recommend this product to ANYONE.While \\"The Walking Dead\\" is a first-class show, this \\"Special\\" edition package isn't worth the pressing. $25 is what you'd expect to pay for a COMPLETE television series' season...not a 6-episode, teaser season.Having not known how short the season was, to say I disappointed at my purchase is a magnificent understatement. Besides the scant number of episodes, the \\"bonus features\\" are sorely lacking, not even warranting the 3rd disc at all (final 2 episodes on 2nd disc, then a black & white version of the pilot and a featurette on the 3rd)...that was a purely marketability ploy.Having only seen the latest season since returning from a year-long military deployment to Afghanistan, I was very anxious to catch up with this acclaimed zombie series. Unfortunately, the high-cost/low-return investment on this scam makes it a \\"Must NOT See!\\" Do yourself a favor and buy the digits from Amazon for $9.99"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time...","review":"Imagine this scenario: You wake up one day and everyone you know is dead... except they're not. They're lumbering around outside your home, putrid flesh rotting from their bones, and the stench of death emanating through the boarded up doors and windows. This is the idea behind The Walking Dead. From the first scene of the first episode, you're pulled into a post-apocalyptic world of flesh-eating corpses. However, this series is not all blood and guts. It focuses very much on the psychological aspects of a zombie apocalypse, which can be incredibly terrifying in itself.It's about time a good horror series is on cable. It seems like every one dies (pun totally intended) well before its time. For the horror genre to be so huge, it certainly doesn't have lasting power on basic cable. I hope we see a long life from The Walking Dead with many seasons in its future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show! Terrible product!","review":"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who is a huge fan of the show. The show is split in two discs, which is all cool, but the second disc is not bluray. How does this work out?? I would've given five stars (cause everything was great), but if I spend extra for bluray, I expect the whole product to be bluray."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK at best, not worthy of all the 5 star reviews.","review":"I got through the first season (with a lot of fast forwarding after the first episode). The first episode was good, but my fear came to be realized, 90% of each episode being nothing but people sitting around talking to each other about their zombie problems. And after the first show, the zombies are lame and almost non-existent. I supposed since it's TV, they want to keep their budget low, hence fight scenes/zombies become less frequent. Final episdoe of season 1 had to be the worst - talk talk talk and you saw about 30 seconds (literally 30 seconds) of zombies. WTF ? I won't be buying season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to like about The Walking Dead!!!","review":"Of course, you must be a Walking Deadhead to like this, and if you're not yet, all you have to do is watch and you'll be sucked in! I do not like slasher/blood and gore movies so for me that's not the attraction. What captured me was the human interaction in extreme survival mode while trying to maintain human decency. Of course, special effects are quality and the violence is necessary for the theme to be realistic. Andrew Lincoln, Norman Reedus, and Stephen Yeun are so REAL in their characters, you have to believe them. All of the main character actors, so far, have been so excellent, you're immediately captured and taken on their trip for 60 minutes on Sunday night!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Zombie Story TV or Movie","review":"This is the best Zombie story brought to the screen. It has the genius of the original Black and white \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" with a new age twist. Too many recent zombie movies exploit violence for the sake of violence, out of control zombies running around like rabid dogs and leave nothing of a story to hold your attention. This sets itself way above the pack for zombie films even though its on TV. It doesn't need over the top violence, sex and cursing to be good... I'm glad its on TV: more to see and more room for the story to progress. A total work of genius in the story as it focuses in on the normal people and not your military hero with ultimate fighting skills. Greatly filmed and brought to life. There is nothing out there that can even come close to the quality of this series.I wish more shows would offer this much quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome show","review":"Such a great show. It is so realistic its scary. I purchased all of the season and enjoy watching them over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Zombie Show","review":"Love this. Great series will get the rest as soon as there released. It is great for adults would not recommend for kids.

I am not a big Apocalypse/ zombie fan. However, my friend begged me to start watching the series. Now I am hooked.

I had high hopes for this series being of interest to me, but after a few attempts to sit through a couple of episodes, I've decided this is just not for me. I couldn't get into the characters, the plot, the scenarios whatsoever. I'm glad some people find this interesting, there truly is something for everyone. If you are curious to preview an episode, Amazon Instant Video has a sneak peek as a free download. If I would have just seen that I would have known this is not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The video played well","review":"While I can't say the quaility of the streaming sucked I can say I really didn't care for the content.

You'd think they would have packed more of them in this set considering the season was only six episodes long. Deleted scenes would have been nice. Oh well, this DVD set is well worth the money for anyone who is a fan of the show. I've watched each episode numerous times already and have definitely gotten my money's worth. Hopefully the Season 2 set will have more special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm loving this show!","review":"I've been really happy with this season so far. It's not just a zombie show, but there's plenty of zombie action to remind you that they are there. There's lot of emotion and thought provoking narrative to make the show interesting on several levels. I'd recommend this show to anyone who is looking for a good drama with fine acting and good writing. A desire to watch a realistic show that also has zombies is not necessary, but will definitely be rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done!","review":"Very well done.

It has been good so far but with a few flaws. The biggest one I noticed was that the zombies feasting scene are below par. I could totally tell the actors are just grabbing on the organs and tisues and so forth, evidence of lack of devotion and not spending enough money to pay the actors. It's also slow-pace and lacks suspense. but i believe it'd be a good entertainment for the zombie fans out there. hope that helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST AWSOME","review":"I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST TV SERIES OUT THERE ITS ABOUT TIME ....

I was flipping through channels and decided to look at it. As one viewer said; it does seem like a movie. It gave me chills and thrills. As a horror fan, I was sold. What happened toward the end of the show, made me cry. All the chaos that was going on from the zombie attack was so emotional. I've seen numerous zombie attacks in movies before, but this one left me feeling sad. I guess it was partly due to all the fun they were having before the attack. Then all of a sudden, here come the invasion of killer zombies.I do intend to buy this whenever it comes out someday, provided the price is right.Update:I purchased this show at a great price of $12.99. My daughter and I watched the whole series in one day, because it was so good. I can't wait to find out what happens with the issues concerning the Officer, his wife, and the Officer's partner next season. This show is explosive and has a great story line.

As another reviewer said, the first episode was quite good. It sucked after that! I had to quit in the middle of the series. The characters are extremely one-dimensional, and everything that happened was incredibly predictable. All of this is coming from a huge, life-long fan of horror films and books. I spent much of my time watching this show thinking \\"yep... I've seen that before.\\" Or \\"I bet this'll happen next!\\" Sure enough, my predictions usually transpired.The Good: Nice visuals and beautiful cinematography. Even though I didn't like the show, it looks great in HD!The Bad: One-dimensional characters, highly-predictable story line and the audio effects were way too over-the-top.My recommendation: If you're gonna watch this, try not to spend too much money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Talking Dumb","review":"What can you expect from the walking dead?

The DVD includes various extras including \\"making of\\" vignettes, cast interviews, inside stories on certain zombies & characters, trailers, etc....well worth the $15 price tag for the 2-disc set.

The housing casts a shadow over just about half the picture when doing very close macro shots. Even 'upping' the flash-power, does not help, it only manages to create a 'hot-spot' in the left top section of the photograph. What happens is that the lens is encapsulated in a black section within the housing. The flash can not reach the section lying in the shadow of the lens.

It was easy to load the camera, and it handled well. The diffuser plate worked well to dissipate the flash on close-ups. What I didn't like was that the camera had problems focusing under certain conditions, such as taking a picture of small crabs, brittle stars or other creatures inside vase sponges. I am not sure if this was due to the case or the camera itself. The biggest problem, however, was that the case leaked on the first dive, fortunately only small amounts, so the camera was not damaged. I had a professional check it and he said that the main o-ring had uneven spots. Also, certain buttons (i.e., the macro button, the left scrolling button, and the exposure button) would squirt droplets of water every time I depressed them under water. Amazon exchanged the item. I would have rated it higher if these problems hadn't occured."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but not as good as previous models.","review":"I have been dissapointed in this case mostly because of my previous housing. My A80 housing is awesome mostly because the diffuser was way better. On this case the diffuser comes off and floats around, where as the previous was fixed and in a different configuration. There is an underwater setting on this camera which is ok, since you can't turn the flash 'on' in auto mode. The problem is when in uw mode using macro you can't get the entire subject in the \\"flash\\" leaving part of the photo dark. This was not a problem with my previous housing.

Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spice turned Sugar","review":"It was amazingly disgusting watching a band that i've grown up on idolizing as quintessential males turn into women off a common soap opera.Metallica's earlier work will always be some of the greatest metal there is...and i will always stand by that!\\"Some Kind of Monster\\" is a complete waste of time! It resembled \\"The Bold & the Beautiful\\". Half & hour down, I thought it was just Metallica with the Oprah-esk issues, only to find Dave Mustaine (to my horror) following suit... STRIKE 2I come from an older school of metal, and this documentary contradicts everything metal was (or what I believed it to be!) in the 80's and 90's. It had but one plus point once it was over and done with...I felt compelled to listen to Master of Puppets beginning to end.Barring this review, I've never looked back since!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"One of the finest music films I have ever seen. Berlinger and Sinofsky have struck gold with this intimate look at men in crisis. Who would have ever thought a band like Metallica would open themselves up in such a painful way. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A mixture of humor and high drama makes this one of the most amazing film experiences I have ever had. A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME FILM ABOUT ICONIC BAND","review":"Even if your are not a heavy metal fan, METELLICA SOME KIND OF MONSTER (Paramount) is an absolutely mesmerizing epic documenatary that looks at 20 years of the ups and downs of this iconic band. Over 10 hours of extras. This is what documentary filmmaking is all about. And it sounds as great as it looks. Unrated. 140 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whining pussies","review":"The movie is very well done and it shows a side to Metallica that you would never expect them to have, much less be allowed to see. Who knew the gods of metal were such whining pussies when no one was looking? That said, it did take some level of balls to allow the world to see them at their weakest, so there has to be some credit given there. Worth watching, as long as you have no illusions that you don't want shattered."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this DVD","review":"all and all it was very interesting. They took some heat for spending a lot of money, but I thought it was a good watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gabage","review":"This movie was terrible, over blown and did not need to be made. This only shows a band hopped up on fame and their 20+ years of lacking creativity since 93."},{"rating":"1","title":"For christs' sake...","review":"Classic! Very cynical of them to take the p#ss out of everyone with this satirical dig at reality TV. I can't wait till they come out and tell everybody. Please, tell me I'm right?!I could not sit through this pile of crap. It is either the biggest practical joke played on whoever thought this was real or it is the most pathetic display of humanity I've seen! (ok, maybe not the most, but of a rock band for sure).That 'performance coach' must be some kind of comedy actor, but he is not funny. If he is real then the future is lost. Who would pay money for such an idiot? His comments are inane crap and the \\"yeah, I hear what you're saying\\" looks from the band are......I dunno, mentally retarded!Is this what a rock'n'roll lifestyle turns a person into? A moron? I can't get my head around this, Metallica are \\"What is and Should Never Be\\".Give up guys, your families need you to be normal. Unless it was all a joke of course..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimmyod","review":"I was looking forward to seeing this video. Just as I expected, these guys are so out of touch with reality it is frightening. It is nice to see the mighty fall on their pompous little butts. That should be a lesson to anybody who thinks rock stars and rappers are anybody worth looking up too, the joke is on you. It is time for metalica to quit before they make bigger fools of themselves, and a word for Lars, learn when to shut the !@#$ up !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry Me a River...Bla bla bla","review":"You got to be kidding me? This confirms 2 things I have already known.#1 Kirk has ZERO role or say in the band and the band is all James and Lars. Kirk is way overhyped as a guitar player compared to james who gets no hype considering he's one of the best player in the world.#2 They need to leave bob rock and make music again.Metallica is overkill. They are so overexposed it's not even funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashamed to be Danish","review":"Good GOD!! Is it possible that Lars Ulrich could possibly be as in reality as much of a materialistic, immature, spoiled cretin as it appears in this painfully long and banal documentary?????? He is an embarassement to the Danish people! As an amateur drummer I can tell you...he is much less prolific than most pre-teen speed metal drummers I run into in the local Guitar Center!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Boooooring! I can not believe how anyone could find this movie \\"fascinating\\" it's just plain boring! A bunch of middle-aged whiney incredibly wealthy drunks boo-hooing about needing to have \\"control\\" over their lives.What a bunch of crybabies! Who among us really has any control in their lives.These guys are considered Gods by their millions of fans and all they can do is sit around and piss and moan about their poor pathetic lives.Give me a break! No concert footage,no glimpses into their early years,almost nothing about their wives or girlfriends or kids, just a bunch of poor sound quality clips about making just the one \\"some kind of monster\\" song.And that song is not that good anyway.I lost a tremendous amount of respect for Metallica when they made that CD with all the orchestra music \\"S&M\\".What a waste of money that CD was as well as this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"bunch of cry babies.","review":"Metallica are a bunch of cry babies. with out dave mustine or cliff burton they were nothing. Metallica first three records were the best. after that they suck big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"We knew metallica went down, but whyd they take Mustaine with them!","review":"This Movie is a must see for any metallica fan. It is really that horrible. Why, oh why!, did Dave Mustaine agree to show up for this. I never wanted to know that he would cry like a baby in on camera, i never wanted to know that Metallica was so far down the path of selling out they needed therapy to be METAL!And if you are wondering, YES you do need beer to make metal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"All this did was proove to me that Newsted and Mustaine kick ass, Lars is a panzy with no talent, Hammet is a fruitcake and Hetfield is a redneck ass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Kind of Egocentric Cry Babies","review":"This was like watching a 3 year old cry and complain about his little sister taking his toys. My view of the tough guys of Metallica quickly vanished as I watched three selfish and self-centered men complain about how they weren't \\"feeling\\" right about this and that.Towards the end, they film a video at San Quentin Prison. I kept thinking that if those gang members had seen the previous footage of the documentary, they wouldn't be rocking, they'd be ...At the end, they're reminiscing about \\"what they've come through\\" and the look on Trujillo's face (the new bassist who wasn't involved up till then) is classic: \\"What did I get myself into?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a moving movie experience","review":"I've never been a big Metallica fan... heavy metal just isn't on the top of my music list, so I was marginally interested in seeing this movie. But, I often find documentaries fascinating, so I watched it.I have to confess... I was extremely moved and captivated by what I saw. Actually, I couldnt's stop watching it. It was genuinely inspiring to see these hard-core metal icons being courageous enough to face their demons and show up real, exposing their humanity to the world ~ rather than being content to hide behind their fame.Oddly enough, this movie gave me a sense of hope ~ hey, if these spoiled, ego-centric \\"rock stars\\" can evolve and learn from their own human experience how to make peace with each other... maybe there's hope for us as a nation? My personal thanks to Metallica for having what it takes to tell the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!","review":"The band that once ruled metal now has to have a therapist almost as a band member and parent. Mustaine even whined (which he's done for over 20 years). I'll always listen to the 80's stuff but these guys have become pathetic. Burton would have quit long ago if he were still alive. I might feel sorry for them, but how can one feel sorry for a famous and rediculously rich band?"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE EDITING + BOB ROCK","review":"I think i could have gotten more into this if the editing had not been so godawful. I spent so much time thinking \\"Oh, Lars's hair is blond and short...wait-it's long and dark....now it's short again!!!\\" that it was distracting. It also made me wonder what else in the movie was taken out of context and why this was done. Too Bad.ALSO, Bob Rock made me sick with every disparaging comment regarding Jason Newsted. He acted as though Jason was a \\"hired hand\\" when he was a member of this band for almost 15 years! I got the impression Bob was sad and jealous that they didn't ask HIM to be the new member. Shame on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another \\"Reality\\" Show","review":"This one drags on far too long. Heavy metal stars engaging in endless melodrama and psycho-babble isn't my idea of entertainment or enlightenment."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"This was the worst documentary I've ever seen! When I heard there was going to be a documentary about Metallica I was thrilled! Couldn't wait to see it. Well I wish I didn't waste my money. I even turned it off 3/4 of the way through because I simpley couldn't stand it! (and I never turn off films) If you like group hugs, and a shrink to help express your feelings about how to open a pop can with out upsetting anyone, than this is the movie for you.I don't mind the therapeutic process.. BUT FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE?!? No wonder I never heard anything about it after it got released. I'm more irritated than anything. I was expecting a rock'n movie about one of the most pivotal metal bands ever to record an album... But instead it's just a long.. long, therapy session. Absolutly nothing about the past albums, life on the road, or anything else to do with the band other than their communication problems.. boooorrring!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Some Kind Of Joke\\"","review":"\\"no im not a kid\\". if this is a joke i'm not laughing because i dont think this band could go any lower than it is now. the fact that st. anger was the worst cd ever released conforms my worst fears and if their, think they can get away with this treason by releasing a dvd trying to explain what they went though to make st.anger why bother. \\"the thing that should not be\\", i bet cliff is rolling around in his grave, mustaine laughs at this in disgust, and the fans look at them and cry, it makes me really depressed because 10 years ago metallica would have been distgusted at this as well. this reveiew is from an ex-metallica fan. R.I.P burton. good bye metallica?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absolutley Wonderful Comedy - Two Thumbs up","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful comedy starring James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich with Kirk Hammet in a riveting supporting role . This is comedy at its best. Three prima donnas who've got the world by the balls complaining about how difficult life is. The three most vain , self absorbed , egocentric men ( men ? ) in rock and roll. I'm a huge fan of Kill Em All , RTL and MOP , but im sick and tired of hearing these three whiney washwomen complian about everything from Napster to Jethro Tull. Grow up boys ... there are a growing number of us fans who are absolutley disgusted ( and amazed ) at seeing three grown men act like 12 year olds girls. Do ya think you could possibly take your faces out of your handkechiefs long enough to put a decent album out ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"puhleese!!","review":"Oh, boo hoo. We're a bunch of filthy rich millionare rock stars. We have so many problems. Please feel sorry for us. This moan and piss fest made me nauseous. What they should be crying about is the fact that these pus**** have put out continuous garbage since the black album. This DVD was laughable. It's hard to feel sorry for a drummer who has a $11 million mansion. Anyway, I guess the current Metallica fans can relate to this pity party. The stuff that made them strong so long ago no longer exists. You think Cliff would've been a part of something like this? Oh, wait, 90% of you probably don't know who that is. I'd love to see Mustaine break his foot off in Lars' ass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inferior \\"Iguana\\" release","review":"I originally reviewed the phenomenal German CD single, however it's no longer available. While I still recommend the track, I suggest searching for the superior German release of this track. Due to CIN regulations this release omits the \\"RAF by Picotto\\" (the best mix of Iguana, and my favorite track of 2000), \\"Blank & Jones\\" (2nd best), and \\"Megamind\\" mixes. The only new mix is the Classix mix which doesn't stray far from the Megavoices Mix. The whole reason I gave this 4 stars is for the Mas & Megavoices mixes . The Mas mix is excellent, showing off the harder side of Picotto, while the Megavoices mix is great (but overshadowed by other mixes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always delicious!","review":"I've purchased these for years and we just finished the large assortment, every piece as delicious and moist as the last.

The quality of the Disc was pretty bad. In the 2nd half of the movie, the picture started going digital crazy and the sound would pop and after a bit get back on track and be fine, until, of course, it happened again and again. We finally turned the movie off. Disc was marketed by FOCUS Entertainment. Watching it with commercials on live TV was more pleasurable than watching this disc. Very disappointed with the quality. Should have returned it, but it was a Dvd and return policy doesn't take back anything opened. I'd really like a good copy of this film.
