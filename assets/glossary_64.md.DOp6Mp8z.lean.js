While he had help with the orchestration, it is very clear that his ideas are extremely well thought out. Each of the seven pieces are complete and polished. Whether you are a classical music fan or a fan of Mr. Banks' previous work, this is very well thought out. Several interviews that are available on line detail some of the composers that the Banks' music calls to mind. In my view, while there are some slight echoes of other composers, Banks' ideas are fresh and lovely. The words lush and pastoral come to mind. This CD is a sleeper but just well may become one of your favorites.

If it can withstand 20 degree weather for hours and still keep my cider hot, this gets 5 stars.Since I carry all my water for the day with me and cant refill, this thermos is definitely too small for my needs.

Instead, the lid kinda sits on the top of the tabs, instead of the top of the box.I ended up cutting the bottoms off of these to make them work the way that I wanted to.If you are looking for a divider to use in the Vaultz box, choose something else; or, just make your own out of heavy cardboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing tabs","review":"The producd did not have the B or T tab in the manufacturers package. makes it difficult to file anything starting with a B or T"},{"rating":"1","title":"Got wrong item","review":"I ordered 'Starting and Operating a Business in Virginia' by Jenkins [Hardcover]and got 'Incorporating in Virginia' by W.

The author seems to think that the people can get away from paying their debt using the \\"Statutes of Limitations\\" Rule, for their state. After reading his book, I looked up the Fair Credit Act and found that he left out some clauses to certain laws on credit and the rights of the creditors and customers. It was fair price for the content of the book. I have read some other credit books by Steinberg and Russell, two of my favorite authors. Some of the terms are confusing because there is no definitions or terms to define them.I would recommend this book if you have nothing better to do. I did find the listing of creditors to request credit reports from helpful and the list of the state's representatives helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Advice","review":"This book, Debt Control, contains incorrect information about the banking laws and gives consumers the wrong advice on finances.

This edition somehow deviated from the earlier format by summarizing the recommended accommodations in places of interest all together on a separate section of the book. Most of the recommended places to stay, aside from the Youth Hostels, have also gone upscale with more EEE's price code than E's, which were not budget at all, esp. considering the current strength of the Euro vs. the US$. This 6th edition would be a helpful guide only to those who are not travelling on a shoestring budget.

From the eccentric, despotic Henri Desgrange (founder of the Tour de France) to riders such as Merckx, Poulidor, Hinault, Bobet -- and other tales from past Tours de France, you get a very good idea of why the Tour has become part of France's patrimony. Wheatcroft does a marvelous job conveying to people who are new to the Tour and people who've been watching it for years, why it is an obsession for many and why no other sporting event in the world comes close. I love Wheatcroft's descriptions of the French countryside, French manners and food. This is the best book on the Tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vital Beginning","review":"This was one book that deserves the title that it bears. If you or someone you know is interested in this loving, kind, intelligent, and majestic breed, then this piece of literature is DEFINITELY your cup of tea. This isn't the same old \\"don't do this,\\" \\"do this,\\" type of book on how to raise and train your dog. Remember, we're talking about pit bulls here. Not only does the book tell you exactly what behaviors to reward and what behaviors to correct, it tells you EXACTLY how to do it; without making your dog neurotic. Face it ladies and gentlemen, pit bulls are a different breed; not the evil killing machines they are portrayed to be in the media, but loyal, powerful, tenacious, and strong-willed dogs with a great intelligence and the capacity to do anything they put their mind to.

I figured a book called \\"How to train your american pit bull terrier\\" would be a perfect match for what I was looking for. The only thing I did find was a thin reference geared towards pit bulls with a tiny section reserved for training. Most of the training information consited of how to find a good trainer, not specific techniques. This book is very basic and vague and I was quite disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This book describes only puppies who are \\"fearful\\" - afraid of a leash, afraid of your absence, etc. etc. Most of the pit bull puppies I know are rambunctious and self-assured. There are no helpful tips for training those puppies.Also, the author says that if you have a full time job, you shouldn't adopt a pit bull. Most of the dogs in local shelters are put to death, and pit bulls, as well as pit bull mixed, are quite common in this state. If you have a fenced yard and will spend time, effort, and money to lovingly raise a dog, then I say go ahead & adopt one. They have barrels of energy, but are very loving animals and deserve a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plastic bucket for your plastic bucketing needs.","review":"This bucket has many uses. You can place one, or more than one, object(s) in it, then use the handle to lift the bucket and transport the object(s).

Not for gases though, they might escape before you put a lid on it. It could be used as furniture, or a toilet, or a combination of those two things. With the addition of eye holes, it can be placed over the head for use as a disguise or a head protector. In closing, I will say this: I have seen many plastic buckets in my day.

This book is for people who think Dilbert has sold out, and that the proletariat will eventually rise up to overtake the means of production. Even with the recent strong reaction to our policies in Iraq and New Orleans, this outcome still seems mighty remote...Michael Moore is gifted, persistent, and wrong about everything.

However, having read it, I feel no great compulsion to go back and read book one.It would be hard to find this story's niche. The language - whilst not terrible - is strong enough in places to make this a young adult rather than a children's book, but the story was simplistic - almost turgid. Basically the protagonist is an 18 year old lad who has discovered he is secretly a witch prince. His mother has been kidnapped and he has a lot to learn about his father.Maybe it was that I had not started this series at the beginning, but it really did not captivate me in the slightest.

I don't like dubbed-in movies to begin with, because conversation is part of acting and cannot be duplicated in another language. But this movie is much worse: the original Dutch conversation is turned down in volume and a voice is simultaneously translating what is being said at a louder volume by somebody who could well be a court interpreter. But not in English; in Spanish! Subtitles are in English, but sometimes they flash by too fast to read. At times there is a strong echo which confuses the viewer, and at other times, the actors are obviously speaking, but no sound is heard. This is definitely the worst release of any movie I ever saw. It the Spanish voices were left out, I would give it a four star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally disappointed...sigh","review":"I was really expecting this CD to be much better. I had heard Virgin Widows and really loved it, but the rest of the album is mostly a let down. I would say overall there are only 3 descent songs, and the rest is mediocre at best. There seems to be a strange lack of genuine energy and passion, and the production is very, very poor. Maybe this is because the label didn't have the money to spend or maybe the band does their own recording in a bedroom closet? They really need help with the mixing...the vocals get so muddy and forced sometimes. I know there is lovely music in here, but the production just doesn't bring it out.

This is one of the Best films of the early 40's with The Glenn Miller Band. Sonja Henie, John Payne, Milton Berle and many great old stars. Bringing back good memories of motion pictures of the 40's. Glenn Miller plays his greatest selections, Chattanooga choo choo, In the Mood and I Know Why. You will be dazzled with Sonja Henies skating.

I am the parent of a two year old girl, and books are a big part of our lives [I am a book collector myself]...although this book may still be too advanced to put into practice with my little one, it really gives me great ideas on how to go about discussing books in a more interesting manner, and sets me up with great guidelines for beginning a parent/child book discussion group a couple of years down the road. I look forward to more enlightening works by the Goldstones."},{"rating":"2","title":"How teachers should teach reading","review":"As a fourth grade teacher I am dismayed by how many students are already disengaged by reading. A wonderful supplement toreadings about literature circles, this book changed the way I ran book clubs.

However, I had expected a book that would give me new and exciting ideas on how to get students excited about reading. Instead they reconstructed their book club sessions word for word which nearly drove me crazy and focused on protagonist and antagonist to the point of exhaustion. I cannot imagine any student enjoying one of their book clubs. If you are already a teacher I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, except for the Goto of course.","review":"As a fan of the Black Library I enjoyed many of the stories in this book, however, I would stay clear of any book with any material Goto, and here's why:As an Eldar fan, I will tell you firsthand that his work is AIMED to be offensive to my demographic. His depictions of the Eldar are grossly against the fluff, and always are aimed to belittle them and their fans.Also, his depictions of women are absolutely disgusting. He has no respect for the female gender and displays them as weak and pitiful. By the end of any of his work, any female character, especially if Eldar will meet a slow, humiliating and painful end.In short, don't go for the Black Library collaborations. I like short stories, too, but it's not worth supporting a man like Goto for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Micro America","review":"Not the regular history book, rather an intra-history: a history of America made by individuals, not by lords, kings, or dictators. It covers the stories of many American go-getters, from the 1880's to 1970, who made possible inventions that are today part of our daily lives: from packaging, automobiles, communications, to the moon-landing and the atom bomb. It covers so many aspects of America's popular culture, consumption, technology, education philosophies, that it lacks focus.A microcosm of America.You may be interested in some stories here, but there are many more that -probably- you won't care at all for.

Boorstin's big argument is that American life became more and more unmoored to local places and common bodies of knowledge, resulting in a disorienting and dispiriting world of mass marketing and suburbs, with gadgets that worked in ways no one can understand.

I wanted a name I could trust.I bought these speakers to go into a house under construction.Over all, the speakers sound great. They are all to be used for music, no surround sound--though they can be used for that.Installation was easy. The speakers come with a template which allows you to mark the correct size hole, cut and install. The grill comes off easily enough. Make sure you've left enough slack in your wire for hook-ups. Your speaker wires slip in and are locked down in place.There are 'ears' or dogs that hold the speaker against the ceiling which rotate out and lower down as you turn the screws to firmly set it in place.The grill and housing are paintable allowing the new speakers to almost disappear into the ceiling.A great pair of speakers at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the heavier side of electronics work","review":"These are large tweezers.

Clearly, the cubes were cut and polished by machine before put into the block of clay.

It's certainly not an interactive toy, and once the rocks are out it's pretty much over, but he was thrilled with the challenge. He sat there and chipped away for a good two hours at least.

I had hoped that this book would give me insight on things I had never thought of and new ways to prevent anything from happening to my baby. Luckily I bought it used.

You learn a little bit about how Gebrselassie became a runner, and a little bit about life in Ethiopia. But the pace of the movie is so very, very slow, you get only the most vague, broad ideas. It is disappointing to be given only a glimpse, not something more substantial -- the vast majority of the 83 minute running time is simply wasted. If you are interested in Gebrselassie's races, you will also be disappointed. There are snippets from one of his Olympic 10,000 meters races, but they probably add up to less than a minute; and there is nothing whatsoever about any of his other races.Why, then, did I give this movie 4 stars, when it's so empty? Why not the 2 stars that most of it deserves?Because for three minutes, during the opening credits, you actually get to see Gebrselassie run.And it is AWESOME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar bound","review":"This remarkable documentary tells the story of the famed Shackleton expedition, a doomed attempt to reach the South Pole that turned into an incredible (and successful) 2-year fight for survival.

I was introduced to Caldwell's music after seeing his name as the songwriter to the Peter Cetera and Amy Grant duet \\"Next Time I Fall\\". His songs are very melodic and powerful. His music definitely reminds me of Peter Cetera's music and 80s Chicago. There is not one filler song on this cd. It is the best smooth jazz cd I have ever heard.

Some aspects of it could have been written with more detail.I did not find the book to be hostile to Christianity.

When I first heard \\"every other time\\" on the radio I knew it was them. I still really like their debut album so I knew I was probably going to like this one. Well I did. LIFE IS GOOD is a bit different than their debut. It's got more of a rock/hip-hop edge. Not so \\"boy band\\" sounding. This time around Rich took over on most of the writing and producing. You hardly hear Devin on any tracks (except two).Rich sounds like his tongue's planted firmly in his cheek though out this album. He still throws out stupid lines like \\"I thought I might bust when she licked her lips\\" on \\"6 minutes.\\" Like whatever Rich! LIFE IS GOOD shows LFO branching out into their own style & sound. Rich's silly raps, Devin's sultry vocals and Brads back-up vocals all blend well. Devin gets to shine on \\"If I had a dollar\\" and \\"the sun still shines.\\" Those are two of the best tracks.

On the contrary, the album fell a little short from their debut album. I'm not trying to tell you to go buy a different cd, kuz this one is worth a some listening.

Thank god!LFO latest effort is so poorly produced from \\"28 Days\\" to \\"Alayna\\" the songs are just awful.This CD sounds like it was made in someones garage on a tape recorder. LFO I guess had another album in their contract even though the first CD barely went gold selling 500,000 copies.Showing by the first week debut of their latest CD selling a measly 15,000+ copies- the fan base has gone the way of N Sync (the real boy band with talent) or O-Town.Good bye and good riddance LFO, as looks and NO talent does not last long in this music business."},{"rating":"2","title":"LFO Makes A hit-filled CD Once Again!","review":"After waiting so long for something new from LFO they definetely made a great comeback. Every song on this CD is written by group member Rich and you can tell by these songs he has some great talent. If you haven't heard their catchy new single Every Other Time just turn on MTV and you're sure to eventually find it. The CD itself is filled with catchy songs such as Elena and 28 Days but also has some more edgy, darker sounding songs such as Erase Her and Dandelion; songs about love gone bad. If you liked their first CD you will most likely liek this one, although unliek the first CD it' not filled with catchy rap by Rich which is just a bunch of randomness :) The songs on this CD have true music and meaning to them so you gotta give it a try :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"it should have been alot better","review":"having heard the band right when they first came around i was hooked to there first EP. They had energy to burn and tight rythms that sound good even crammed in 2 and a half minute songs. Here though there debut full length falls flat. meandering guitar riffs, flat chorus' and poor drumming. There no real bite and some probablly have already said that there a poor mans E Town Concrete. The newly recorded version of \\"headless\\" sucks and the earnesty level here is pretty high. It sounds far too much like washed out nu metal than the impression they gave me the first go around. The drumming and the singing though particularly is what real drowns the album out. the drumming is poorly structured and the vocals go from shouting and \\"gang vocals\\" (bitted right off of hatebreeed for sure) to flat harmonies by the time they reach the chorus'. it shouldve been alot better"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will have great appeal","review":"to anyone who enjoys amazingly bad writing and plots so shallow they can't hold air.

But, as I would soon come to find out, not only is this book useless on Kindle because of the way in which the maps are hard to navigate - the images completely cut off in some cases, and hard to return to the write up that you were initially reading about - but the book is so out of date that most of the restaurants, cafes, hotels that it guides you to, no longer exist!Hanoi is not an easy city to navigate. Especially if it is your first time to Asia. Thus, if you are looking for a guide book that will actually guide you, this one is worthless. I've learned my lesson: I'm sticking to Roughguide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointing","review":"I've used Lonely Planet guidebooks a handful of times in the past, and though I'm not the biggest fan, they're generally pretty reliable and helpful. This guidebook is quite the opposite. So far, I've only used it in Ho Chi Minh City, and it's been worse than useless. Some of the suggestions are helpful, but often, the information is just flat out wrong. Addresses and phone numbers for a handful of their recommendations are incorrect and in fact sent us in the wrong direction entirely. Other times, the suggestions don't exist at all. I understand that things may change quickly in this city, but this book isn't particularly old, and the restaurants and other sites for which it had incorrect information clearly predate the publication of this book. So whatever you do, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"LP-Vietnam","review":"A rather typ LP guide book full of information required for planning and traveling.

The cycle taxi drivers in HCM City are not ex South Voetnamese army; they are simply dudes trying to scratch out a living. Worse still, there is too much emphasis on treating the environment properly and not enough on how, where and why to travel to various spots; I bought the book as a travel aid, not as a Cole's Notes on how to dispose of waste products. Once you get a bed in the right area in HCM city, you should, with some prior Internet research work, be able to get around yourself. The Cu Chi caves and Mekong trips are easily organized without this patchy volume. You can always pick up a discarded or pirated copy as you go along."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THE 8TH EDITION FROM FEB 2005","review":"I purchased this book because of the recent publication date. I wanted to get the most up to date information for my trip to vietnam.This book was a cause of great frustration and loss of time on my trip. All of the maps that I used for Ho Chi Mihn and Hanoi were all wrong. We spend a great deal of our time lost trying to find the sights or follow the walking tours. The best I could figure was that all of the maps were copied as mirror images. The are wrong.If you do have this book. Don't use the maps at all!However, I must say that the suggested sights and restaurants were good. The only problem is that we couldn't get there to enjoy them.I know now not to buy tour books with very recent publication dates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date and inadequate","review":"I've been using this latest edition of the Vietnam LP during my current trip to Saigon, Nha Trang, Hue and Hanoi.

LP dominates the travel guide book market, but they leave a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lonely Planet Vietnam","review":"I bought this book in anticipation of my upcoming trip to VN. Having gotten great help from LP Guides over the years, I was sure that this was the book I needed. Wrong. This book is superficial and only marginally useful.

You can do so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another book","review":"I have used LP books for a lot of my travels throughout Southeast Asia and usually am pretty satisfied with my experience. This LP book on Vietnam though, does not live up to the standards of other LP travel books!I lived in Vietnam for three months this past summer. Going through the book, I found out that key details about travel services were missing, maps were wrong, and restaurant recommendations were off the mark. An example of how the book was not up to par: I wanted to plan a trip to Bach Ma National Park while in Hue. Once I arrived, I realized the descriptions of the trails in the book were almost word for word copies of the free trailmap given out to tourist! Nothing new or insightful at all about the descriptions.I would recommend having this LP book over having nothing, but your better off getting something more reliable.Happy travels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great continuation of the series!","review":"There are two parts to this book. First Inspector Morimoto and Officer Suzuki have to figure out what happened, and then in the second part they have to trap the person who they think is the criminal. Overall, it's a great plot which you can try to deduce for yourself, but most people won't get it I think. Like the first book, there's more on the Japanese train system. And lots of laughs and wry humor as well. We learn more about Suzuki's character in this book, and we are able to understand the Chief of Police a lot better (who is one of the best characters). I think Inspector Morimoto will be a famous detective character who everybody will enjoy. He likes to have fun while he works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this when you want to fall asleep","review":"Another mystery to solve by the mathematically-minded Japanese duo - but is it worth reading about? I don't think so. The author describes his locations in better detail than his protagonists so the only feel I have for Morimoto and his assistant Suzuki is intelligent calm. And a story without some stress is a dull one. I appreciate the humor as overeager insurance agent Sasaki tries to help the investigation but by and large I find this story as boring as the first. No action, some travel and lots of clever, logical thinking. The author improved his writing style a bit but it's still a series that I won't bother to continue with. Again I see generic 5 star reviews given to help sales at Amazon. I know why it's done but I find it annoying enough to write a negative review."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great sequel!","review":"Thus book is just as good as the first book featuring Inspector Morimoto.And I think the plot is maybe better.It's also nice to learn some more things about Japan.I hope the next book is just as good.I'll certainly read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another award winner.","review":"I thought the first book in the series was great but this really was even better! How could anybody think up a plot like that? I've read a lot of mystery stories but this one has one of the purest plots you'll come across. At first it doesn't make sense but then in the end you can see how reasonable it is. It's all about human nature - no gimmicks. Does anybody know if there's a third book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice character development!","review":"This book followed on well from the first book in the series, and the characters became more rounded and fleshed out. They are well written - I really cared about them. The Chief reminds me of my own boss. The plot had me absorbed - very tricky! This book deserves a lot of credit. I'm really looking forward to the next installment in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Introduction to the Scientific Evidence","review":"I have now read this book and Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect.

Dorian Harewood portrays Jesse very well, but almost in a god-like perfection.

His portrayal of Nixon covers all the bases, from quiet obedience to his beloved mother to the snarling, foul mouthed paranoiac we've all come to love (or hate). The film is riveting as Hall's Nixon drags the audience deeper and deeper into his harsh world view and finally brings us to the very edge of his despair. The end will have you laughing, cringing or both. Brings into sharp relief the concept that we are all heroes in our own mind, and it will make you wonder what sort of spirit dwells in the leaders we currently elect if a man this twisted with hate, self loathing and paranoia could be elected president twice. Just an amazing film. Even if you don't subscribe to Hall's portrayal as reality you can't deny that this a talented and powerful performance. This film should be a must have among the \\"conspiracy\\" minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Stars? Whats your problem?","review":"This film is extraordinary - why would you bother to give it 3 stars? Seriously, what flaw is there? The concept is spectacular and daring, the script is bold and enthusiastic, and the execution unfolds beautifully as we watch a drunk old man wander around his basement. This film connects to the soul of America - it is a voice from our collective dream-state, a remembrance or shadow of our experience. The actor acheives sublimity - the symbololgy is theraputic and transcendent. 20th century America is alive within this project - it is expressed in the very breathe of Nixon...Nixon, Nixon, Nixon, Nixon, Nixon..."},{"rating":"1","title":"General Tools 700 5 Piece Precision Screwdriver Set","review":"As per description this kit has to be USA made not made in china anyway the quality is acceptable and description should be updated because wrong description was the reason for 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok screwdriver","review":"These screw drivers have a good tip but the major downfall is that the handle is very weak I snapped the largest one trying to scrap off some hot glue."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"This book has tremendous insight into how a man should lead his family.

It has much good advice about what a Godly man is to be. For me though, I had the blessing of meeting the author while I was reading the book, and I didn't even plan it! Stu Weber is not just any author, he actually cares about seeing young men grow into real men. I know this because I met him at a ranch in Elgin, Oregon. He showed up to talk to a crowd of about ten high school age boys, and three grown men. We talked, and enjoyed a meal together on that ranch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I'm looking for...","review":"I'm struggling raising a son with chronic health issues.

This book is like a mirror for each man to examine and challenge himself in their role as provider, warrior, teacher, and friend to those within and outside of the home. Stu Weber writes in a way that relates to all men who want to be a real man to their wife and children. Each chapter is very relevant to every man, whether newly married, a new father, or someone with a few years already under their belt. At the end of each chapter, there are questions that are good for self-evaluation or could even be used in a study group discussion. If any individual or group is wanting to do a biblical study of the definition, characteristics, and examples of a man, then I recommend reading this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I find the plot of this novel intriguing but am having difficulty understanding Kathy Mallory. The author does not allow the reader into who this person actually is. We hear from other characters about who they think she is, but we never get inside her to know what actually motivates her. Does she have a life? Does she bond with anyone? Does she feel anything? I don't get the sense that she is a real person, which, for me, spoils the otherwise excellent writing and plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than her last","review":"But not as good as her first two. Still, a vast improvement over the previous Mallory book - which had very little of Mallory in it. O'Connel sets up a great whodunit in this one, stretching back forty years. The plotting is intricate, and the characters are extremely well done. I would have liked to see more tension, however, and a little more growth in Mallory. And more of those \\"Mallory moments\\", you know the kind if you've read her before, where gorgeous sociopath takes on polite society and sends it scurrying away in confused fear while you snicker appreciatively, but it was a good read, nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychotic fantasy","review":"This is the first \\"Mallory\\" novel I've read, so I come to it with a fresh perspective. I found the novel disappointing after the opening scene. This female detective rages around trampling all vestiges of proper police procedure, and all the male cops (notoriously hard to intimidate in real life) are intimidated by her and constantly yield to/coddle her behavior. I found it completely unbelievable. Mallory wouldn't last a day in a real police department, even if her daddy was a cop. Big-city police departments do not hand out detective positions as a form of psychotherapy for the emotionally troubled.The setting for the story was evocative, though, and I really wanted to enjoy this, but found myself enduring it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIVE THIS ONE A PASS","review":"Kathy Mallory is one of the most reprehensible, unbearable characters I've ever read.She does nothing to endear herself to her loving and loyal inner circle,and she herself should be the object of police scrutiny, along with whatever murderer is in one of ms. o'connells books.

I still can't figure out how the author wants us, the readers, to take this literary endevour. It is to some extent totally illogical and it appears that the author smoked some serious weeds while writing it and totally forgot how to make all the tangled webs she wove come together. Still it has a haunting excitement about it and therefore an acceptable read. Even if you spend the next two days thinking about things like: And why did she include this? or why that?

Robinson shines as a dedicated & inexorable seeker of the truth, even as his concern & disappointment for his fallen friend shows clearly; and Barbara Stanwyck scalds the screen as the trashy, blatantly sexy femme fatale with the morals of an alley cat & an icy ruthlessness that stops at nothing -- just look at that cover art! Wrap these characters in moody, bleakly beautiful black & white cinematography, give them a witty, scathing script by Raymond Chandler, and you've got a sordid masterpiece about small-timers whose greedy, self-centered dreams are much larger than their shriveled souls. I can't recommend this film highly enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Film","review":"This is one of the best films I have ever seen. The ending is given away in the first 5 minutes. Most people would think doing so would ruin the film. But the plot is so tight in this movie it only heightens the suspense. This is noir at its very best. I consider this to be Billy Wilder's masterpiece (and that's saying something!). I would definitely choose this over The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, and The Lost Weekend, even though those are all fine films. Sunset Boulevard comes out on blu ray next week and is also a classic. But if you are new to Billy Wilder this is the place to start. The blu ray looks terrific, although you need a region free player to view it since it is locked to region B (Europe)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film noir, perhaps the greatest.","review":"A splendid film , perhaps Billy Wilder' greatest work (along with \\"Sunset Boulevard\\"). Fred MacMurray never had a better role (he originally did not want to do it). Excellent work from Stanwyck and Robinson as well. Top-notch film noir and an American film classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal Legacy disappoints... BIG TIME!!!!!","review":"Yes.... Double Indemnity is a GREAT movie! However, this does NOT excuse the folks responsbile for the Legacy Series for putting out such a crappy product. Having been so impressed with other restorations in the series, I trusted and bought this edition. Technically, I could see very little improvement over a previously released DVD, and the bonus disc, a VERY bad TV remake, is simple a waste to even bother doing!SHAME!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Psychotic Thriller","review":"This movie confirms that Barbara Stanwyk was one of the most talented actresses of her generation. The character of Phyllis Dietrichson is always fully developed, believable, likeable and detestable. Along with the rest of the talented cast, Stanwyk brings this intense story to life. The script is taught and well developed, the cinematography is great and the music is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Movie of All Time","review":"This is the best movie, the movie has everything murder, twists, great acting.Barbara Stanwyck plays her best roll ever, so does Fred McMurray,great extra features also GET IT !!!Worth Every Cent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Film Noir!","review":"This film and The Postman Always Rings Twice, with Lana Turner and John Garfield, along with Laura, Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, define film noir. I love films that are centered on the conversations, innuendos, accusations, etc. Even though all these films are about murder, they are not bloody and gory. A pleasant relief from all the current films.

A fine DVD edition as a picture like this deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Film Noir","review":"There isn't a better film of its type anywhere. And just as a comparison, included on this two-disk set is a TV-movie version of this story. If I give the original 5 stars, I'd give the remake just 2 stars. As Billy Wilder said of the remake, \\"They just don't get it\\". The original picture is as crisp and sharp as the day it was made, the sound is just as good. It is a fine story, and this is one movie that one can watch over and over again. I have, and it's great each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"and you thought insurance was boring","review":"Possibly the greatest film noir of all time, this Wilder classic is something I can watch over and over again. Simmering sex appeal and Hitchcock worthy suspense build from the first scene. If Hitchcock had directed this, he would probably have focused on the husband. Wilder's decision to focus on the villains and putting the husband in only two scenes forces us to root for them, and greatly increases the tension. One of Wilder's best, definitely."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic film but an appallingly bad DVD transfer.","review":"Double Indemnity is obviously a classic film but this DVD transfer is appalling. Almost every scene is incredibly grainy, the source print is obviously not in very good conditon (perhaps needing to be refurbished), and to top it off, there are no deluxe features and the extra packaging is rather inadequate(with no information booklet or history of the movie).This would be frustrating for any film but is downright shameful treatment of a cinema classic. We can only hope someone will spend the time and money necessary to restore the print for a new theater run, as has been done with other older films. Perhaps then, DVD buyers will get the version of this classic they deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT FILM - TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE DVD TRANSFER","review":"Do not purchase this DVD release.

Arrived quickly. No problems. Have ordered many items and have never been disappointed. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Wilder's classic","review":"What can be said about Double Indemnity that has not already been said. Great casting of Fred MacMurray against type as the eventual bad guy. Don't look for My Three Sons here. Barbara Stanwyck is great as the fiery ice goddess that makes Fred MacMurray give his life up. Edward G. Robinson is great as the dogged insurance investigator that works with Fred MacMurray. The plot is tightly wound with moments of reral thrills. This is one example you should not miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film","review":"Double Indemnity is one of Hollywood's greatest movies ever. It has everything a great movie needs, great acting, superb direction, a brilliant theme and lots of tension. The only problem with this movie is that it is slow in the beginning but it then picks up once the two protagonists or should I say antagonists execute their devious plot. Edward G.Robinson steals the show with his witty character. Fred McMaurray is pretty annoying with his accent and way of speaking but all round great acting! One of those movies which inspire filmmakers and set new standards. You have to see this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 star for the film, 2 stars for the technical information...","review":"The movis is NOT a color movie but is black and white movie, unless this edition has been colorized. If the movie has been colorized, that fact should be stated more clearly. It would be nice if those at [...] could do a little research (or even watch the movie-it's a classic!) before issuing a guide to potential viewers. The movie is in black and white, classic to film noir."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic? Not by a longshot.","review":"This is straight opinion, no summary here.Just because a film is from 1944 doesn't mean that the acting has to be stiff or the director has to make his actors aspire to be in a soap opera. Please! Citizen Kane and the Maltese Falcon were made 3 years before this film and yet 'DI' can't produce a truely beleivable dramatic moment!It's hard to beleive that Wilder could direct both this and Some Like it Hot! Excellent Characters, hilarious dialogue and even though men were dressing as women, IT WAS BELEIVABLE!Billy, if YOU stuck to comedy and STALLONE stuck to killing, Hollywood would be a better place!Fred MacMurray reaches with every line. (It's so sad when a drip can't even play an insurance salesman) And the chemistry between Stanwyck and him is oil and water.I beg of you, spend your money on something that will ENTERTAIN YOU for 2 hours, not this predictable, unbeleiveable uninspired wanna-be thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie, poor quality dvd","review":"I have loved this movie for a long time so was happy to see it available on dvd. The quality of this dvd is poor! It has a lot of very dark scenes where you can't see the faces of the actors-couldn't lighten it with tv controls. The audio was also very poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you sell accident insurance Mr Neff?","review":"This is as good as it gets in 1944. Based on the James M Cain novel and with a screenplay co-written by Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder, this film has it all. Career performances by Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray and Edward G Robinson guided by the brilliant direction of Billy Wilder make this one of the best films ever to come out of Hollywood.The screenplay explodes with just the right dialogue. Fabulous lighting by John F Seitz and a great musical score by Miklos Rozsa combine so that there is never a dull moment.If you like film, you will love Double Indemnity. You owe it to yourself to have this in your film library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"This book is too outdated.

If you have a cartridge type filter get the better wrench. You can make out four small spot welds in the photo directly in the center. Trust me they are not strong enough if some gorilla tightened the filter housing the last time. The welds break very easily.

It is entertaining but, when you think about it, this movie is an insult to anybody's intelligence. Russell Crowe is a great actor and was neccesary to sell tickets but he is completely implausible for the title character. This story about a regular couple who go through hell, because the wife is falsely accused and convicted of murder is way too far fetched for this to be considered a quality movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"Not sure why this didn't do better at the box office ... my husband and I loved it!

Tale focuses on a husband whose wife goes to jail for killing her boss and one in which the husband begins to research how to break her out of prison and leave the country. There are some nice touches in this film like the early display of the wife's temper (crucial for something later), the ring by the sewer and the Quixotic approach (including him teaching a class on Don Quixote) as to why he's doing what he's doing. Nice trick with the trash at the end of the tale. Taut thriller with substance.

The story was ok but the lay out was bad. A lot of nothing happened. The end was bad, after almost crashing they get out of the car to have a little breather. He was just seconds ahead of the cops blocking the bridge, the air port police and the van driver. The cops were terrible, the best part of the movie was Crowe in the drug dealers house, but then ruined. Having the dealer at gun point the man yells my baby and Crowe lets him run off, really stupid. The end seemed to drag on as well. Having really liked Crash I was dissapointed.

Crowe then seeks help from an ex-convict (Liam Neeson) who had broken out of prison himself, and prepares a plan.After being beaten-up seeking false IDs, sneaking and shooting his way into a drug house and killing a few meth-labbers, learning a ridiculous means of picking locks, creating false laboratory reports to get his wife transferred to a hospital, Crowe (English teacher at a local community college) springs her and we're off on a long chase scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The movie was too long.

No. Does the guy he buys them from being deaf help to tell the story in any way? No. Does the script ever convey a sense of deep love between husband and wife that would lead husband to take such drastic measures?

Had their love been something really spectacular, I could see why he would consider her worthy of such extreme measures. But there's nothing special here, just a great idea wasted on dumb characters. Furthermore the plot develops far too slowly, with little to no action other than the last few minutes. The chemistry between Crowe and Banks is so shallow that you feel nothing for them. And as I said above, Banks is so unloveable that I don't even care if Crowe succeeds in his mission to save her or not. This was just a dumb, dumb movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought this would be surpisingly good..","review":"Where do I begin?...This movie starts out with a bang, the first 15-20 minutes had me glued to the TV..and then the bad stuff begins...First of all this movie is WAYYY too long, by at least a half hour. The next hour and a half dragged by, with some twist and \\"suspense\\" moments that actually made me laugh out loud.(Not intentionally). I expected a lot more from this and Paul Haggis. Everything about this movie seemed forced and so many unnecessary scenes to try and throw the audience. For anyone who hasn't seen this yet, PLEASE do not buy it.

Russell Crowe cracked me up when his jokey side at the beginning of the film. The twists & turns in the film is nothing short of engrossing. Liam Neeson's cameo scene is worthy of an entire film. The scene when John Brennan reverses & nearly collides with a mother and her kid, shows that John Brennan's desperation of trying to get his wife out of Jail is really getting to him. I loved it all the way to the end, but i felt let down by it, because it was revealed that Lara is found innocent, but they escaped into Canada & the Authorities never caught them, & it was revealed that a homeless person killed Lara's boss, not Lara. I just wished they were caught, & found innocent in the end. But other than that, the movie was edge of your seat viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow read","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer, this book is boring.

She thinks everyone feels the same way she does and reacts accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING & S L O W!!","review":"I like a few other readers was excited to start this book after reading so many great reviews... what were they all thinking?? This book was so boring and the back and forth between then and now was painstakingly slow. The main character was so unlikable, as a child and as an adult. Her fascination with her brother Matt, was not fully explained, and really all the characters could have been written better. The layout of the book I also felt was badly edited. I literally had to force myself to finish it because I figured I'd already spent so much of my time I figured I had to know the end. What a let down.... I found it way to corny and anti-climatic. Seriously, if you're on the fence about this one, keep on searching. Leave this book alone, you'll be doing yourself a favor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring Read","review":"This book was recommended for me by Amazon and I am glad I took it out from the library instead of buying it. It took me a long time to get through the book and I found that I forced myself to finish reading it. The main character is hard to relate to or even sympathize with. And at the end of the book I feel that nothing has been resolved. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn- 1 star is too many","review":"I started this book with too great an expectation. It was recommended to me here at Amazon and I was going on vacation, so...The obvious metaphors (bug clings tightly to water tension) and the ridiculously brittle main character kept me wondering when this book would get better. If this was written from the point of view of the brother then it may have been interesting. As it was from the POV of a whiny little girl all grown up into a whiny woman it did not grasp my interest.This author needs to skip some details and not others. Suddenly the story moves forward and the only emotion you are allowed is the jealousy of this sister. The schmaltzy, predictable ending left this book to be tossed into the donate to charity pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page-Turner....","review":"I picked this book up having no idea what it was about and soon found myself immersed in the story trying to figure out what was going to happen next. It does have some slow parts, but I think there is strong character development and it kept me guessing up until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"compelling","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author was able to draw me in and I just wanted to keep on reading. I liked the setting which was clear but not described to the point of overkill. I thought the characters were compelling and make us look inside ourselves.What a wonderful book - I look forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quiet, Compelling Read","review":"The Northern Ontario landscape comes alive under the pen of writer Mary Lawson in this novel which reminds us that wholeness depends emotional maturity. There are many paths to personal integrity, Lawson seems to say -- don't be so quick to assume that yours is the best way.The novel moves between an academic setting in Toronto and the land of muskeg and mosquitoes that is the far north, the settings of the protagonist's current (and emotionally sterile) life and her emotionally intense and challenged past.If you've spent any time in the Ontario northland, Lawson's prose will paint familiar pictures behind your eyes. The story's outcome is predictable, and some of the characters are too one-dimensional to be real -- but these flaws don't alter the fact that this book is an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a touching family account","review":"i was instantly drawn into this book and it's kind, likable characters. it is a very quick read (3 nights). although it seems light it did pose some real questions for me: how much are we affected by just one moment in our lives? can we imagine our lives if other choices had been made?; etc. i did expect more of a tragedy in the end. however, after further thought i realized that katherine is the one who called it a tragedy; not other members of her family. i was touched by the love shared in this family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice read, interesting flashbacks keep you turning the pages","review":"I picked this book because I found it on someone else's listmania list and it was ranked fairly well. The story is written from the perspective of the main character, Kate. She is now an adult and college professor, but for the majority of the novel (and in my opinion the most interesting parts) she is flashing back to her childhood. Specifically, the flashbacks start soon before her parents are killed in an auto accident. She and her two older brothers and younger sister go through a series of events that are described beautifully through the eyes of a young Kate. These childhood events not only tell a lovely story, but also are influential towards the end of the book when Kate, as an adult, comes to terms with her and her loved ones' choices. This book I found to be a really nice read, not earth shattering, but a very lovely story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome family drama!","review":"When i picked up crow lake i admit i had low expectations. man oh man this is a good book!! nothing to worry about spending large amount of money on an useless book here!!! i loved the story of the orphans and how they survive adversity. i heard this was an oprah pick back in the day when she picked new books for her club and she was a wise woman. i recommend this to everyone who fancies a great, all american book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Read","review":"I really enjoyed this beautifully sad book. Lawson's story revolved around the family theme and she did a wonderful job of eliciting emotion from her reader, and created a real sense of empathy for the characters. A lot of books that receive awards (this one made the Good Morning America reading list) felt like their positive ratings resulted more from hype, but this one really surprised me. I enjoyed it even more than I expected to! Much of the storyline emerged through numerous flashbacks, which worked very well. Coupled with the majority of the book narrated from a child's perspective and the lovely Canadian backdrop, and the book became a fast and very entertaining read. Parts of the plot felt familiar, even a bit predictable, but this did not detract from the joy in reading about this family, and these characters who were the real highlights of the novel. I will definitely be keeping an eye out for Lawson's other books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy but deep!","review":"I figured this book would be the typical story about poor orphans who have to be raised apart, etc. but I loved the entire thing! I thought it was truly a tragedy when each child gave up the opportunity to go to college because of a much greater need to stay at home. The whole thing was very touching and enjoyable. Completely impossible to believe that this could happen, especially in this day with social services appearing when someone dies, but that's what makes this what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet","review":"Crow Lake is a great book: quick, well-written, and thoughtful. The central character Kate is a Toronto zoology professor in her mid-twenties, who is reflecting on her childhood in Northern Ontario. Her parents died in a car accident when she was seven, and she was left with her two older brothers and her baby sister. The family's tragic story becomes entangled with a neighbor family's tragedies, but the book is, in the end, uplifting. The characters are beautifully drawn. Bo, the baby, is amazing; her mannerisms are dead on.Mary Lawson reflects on what the essence of life is: education and advancement, as Kate has always believed, or other things. she paints a suspenseful tale set in a desolate, but beautiful, landscape, and she illuminates on how nonsensical family relations can be and how difficult, but necessary, it is to re-evaluate our beliefs as we grow older. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This story was plucked right out of my family","review":"By the time I was four, both my aunt and uncle had died tragically leaving my four small cousins orphaned in a small town in southern Ontario. An event like that changes everything and I felt that Mary Lawson had seen deep into our family and articulated the pain and the loss and the survival right on. There was nothing in this book that seemed out of place or false from the perspective of someone who's lived this book and been this family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something??","review":"It is hard for me to understand that so many reviewers are so high on this book. I found it wooden, unemotional, and utterly unconvincing. The characters are barely drawn. There is no hint of why the narrator would be so enamored of her brother Matt--because he is a totally undeveloped character, as are all the rest. And the plotting: all that hinting at looming tragedy: well frankly I felt, when it finally got there, oh, is this what this whole book has been leading up to? what's the big deal? Maybe the events detailed are momentous life events, but somehow the author is not good at presenting them in a compelling way. in addition, the thing that the narrator views as a the central 'tragedy' of her brother's life seems so outdated, and almost trite. Hardly worth writing a whole novel about. Or, at least the way this one is written it doesn't seem so."},{"rating":"1","title":"felt gypped","review":"I was given this book by a friend whose girlfriend couldn't put it down, even though they were on a romantic trip to Alaska.I opened it hoping it was an amazing book but I couldn't relate to the protagonist. Many times I just wanted to slap her for being so stubborn and closed off.I will admit the book did keep my attention as Lawson drops hints here and there but not quite what the catastrophic event was that divided the siblings. The end was utterly anti-climactic and I felt immensely gypped.The writing is simple and easy to read, but I can't classify this as a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"This is a bittersweet story of hurt, sorrow, determination, misunderstandings, and responsibility. The author tells a heartbreaking story about a family's survival after tragedy, realistically portraying the raw human emotions that guide our attitudes and behavior. There is a message here about how our reactions can create tragedy. Yet the overall tone of the book is not negative, it somehow just feels real. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treat!","review":"Mary Lawson's debut novel, \\"Crow Lake\\" is a real treat. Her descriptions of Ontario, the farming community and especially the special pond, rich with life, are evocative of both Barbara Kinsolver and Margaret Atwood. This is an extremely satisfying novel about growing up and how the things we think are important change with age and maturity.I'm planning to recommend this novel to my nieces who are 14 and 15. It's not juvenile fiction, but I think it appropriate for young women who are themselves learning about life and the choices made in adolescence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to the expectations","review":"This book is beautifully written but it is nothing more than a forgettable summer read. I kept reading on a fast pace, waiting for the great \\"tragedies\\" to reveal themselves and in the end it was nothing more than run-of-the-mill family conflicts and regrets. We all have \\"tragedies\\" like that in our families. It is almost insulting, you keep feeling that the author exaggerates so much, while waiting for the story line to deliver a punch. She should have taken a deeper look at the sad and frequent tragedies that a lot of families deal with before writing such an ambitious book. It was very dissappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for something to happen","review":"Crow Lake has interesting characters and suspense--that goes almost nowhere. The Pye tragedy is almost entirely offstage and understated. The murder is discovered years later! Kate's huge problem with her family is that brilliant Matt became a farmer. For this she disassociates herself from her family? For this she becomes a microbiologist who can't relate to her students? I read this book in one afternoon. It is slight in several ways. Yes, it's a good first novella."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"I saw the author, Mary Higgins Clark, on TV talking about this book. She said, among other things, that it grabbed her from the start and she remembered the characters long after she finished the book. Since these are qualities I look for in a book, I was anxious to read this, Mary Lawson's debut novel. There is much to recommend in this book. A good story, well told and characters who get into your heart and stay there. Although part of the story is tragic, Lawson lightens the mood with well placed humor. The antics of Kate's younger sister Bo are particularly endearing. There is a mystery here and Lawson knows exactly how much to reveal to draw the reader along. I enjoyed this story very much and I'm looking forward to more stories from Mary Lawson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching Story","review":"Having lost parents at a young age, I could relate with the heroine, Kate. Her road of discover was interesting to follow along. I'm glad I picked this book up. It was a quick read; finishable in an afternoon. I felt a lump in my throat many times as I read the descriptions of the family's dirty home and as they suppressed the grief they were feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Ending?????????","review":"I threw this book across the room when I was finished. Literally. I was interested in the characters. I was interested in the story. It drew me in. That I can admit. But what was the payoff? I'll tell you what it was - NO ENDING! That is my pet peeve."},{"rating":"2","title":"a worthwhile read","review":"Crow Lake was a book everyone was talking about so finally I got it and read it, and I wished I had not waited so long. This is a beautifully written book about family, loss, and love. The heartbreaking story of four children left on their own after their parents die is interwoven with the reminiscences of the older daughter, Kate, after she has grown up, moved from her Northern Ontario home, and become a professor.Far from wanting to \\"slap\\" the protagonist for her emotional coldness (as one reviewer suggests), I could really empathize with how the grief and lost dreams of Kate's past have affected her and how long it takes for her to make peace with things her brothers have dealt with long ago. Lawson understands that life crises actually do hurt and traumatize people--yet they can still heal and find peace even if their childhood ideals are not realized, and even if that resolution takes time.I found this book quite inspiring and written with real grace and simplicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty - don't buy this","review":"This is definitely not a well-made product. I bought 2 of these for a work activity and one arrived without the magnet. I requested an exchange but the replacement item also arrived without a magnet.

Well luck of the draw, mine came detached too and without heavy duty tools to try to bend the iron handle out a bit to get it into the two holes it should be in...and then adjust it back so it stays put...not happening. Sigh... otherwise it's very pretty....but didn't get to use it.Update 4/2/12: Tried a different style by same maker that had good reviews (none mentioning detached handle) and guess what? Detached handle AGAIN...I couldn't believe it happened twice to me...and no one else is having this problem with the other style...??? April Fools joke Amazon???Very disappointed as I really liked both teapots otherwise ....no good without a handle though...not sure if I'll try a third time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"This teapot is well made. It's everything you'd want in a teapot, for a fraction of the price. The only downside to it is that it doesn't keep the tea warm for a long period of time, but you can get a warmer for that if needed. Teavanna wants 179.99 for a teapot of the same calibur, and I bet that one loses heat just as much. I'm not sure if cast iron has the best properties for keeping tea warm anyways since it conducts heat so well. My mom saw it on my counter and went out immediately and bought the same one because she was so impressed by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged due to poor packing for 2 shipments","review":"The teapot itself looks nice and sturdy. However both teapots that I ordered over different timesarrived with the same damage - the handles had come off.And there was no way to put them back!I requested for a replacement for the 2nd order but was told by customer service that the item was not in stock.However, I checked online and found that the teapot was still up on order. I don't know what's going on andwould like to be able to reply to customer service directly without having to use the Contact Us link asI was unable to answer the question on what server I am using and hence could not send out my note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handsome and functional","review":"I'm a big fan of the heft and heat-retaining ability of a cast iron teapot over the more usual glass or ceramic, this piece is no exception. The blue finish is very handsome and both the interior and exterior finishes are quite durable. The low broad profile makes steeping teas a little tricky if you're only brewing one or two cups, as the water level in the pot will be on the low side. When making a full pot though it works like a charm.In a perfect world it would be stovetop-safe so the whole process could be done in the same pot, but still this is a great piece to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Stand the ERRORS!","review":"I have read 66% of this book and am so frustrated with the numerous typographical erros I may have to go and buy the paperback just to finish it. I started to bookmark the errors and have found 5 pages of them! The most common error seems to be writing a 1 instead of I, but I found an exclamation mark instead of a letter, and a few words spelled wrong too. The occasional typo can be passed over with a sigh, but this is unacceptable. Amazon has refunded my money at least. So, don't buy this book until they update it unless you don't mind the irritating errors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Scarf Girl is the worst book ever.","review":"Red Scarf GirlBy Jili JangHave you read a book that isn't interesting?

The book is written with very simple language, thus is easy to read, although the themes and story inside the language are much more adult, much deeper. Ji-Li relates to us only a snippet of her childhood, from age 12 to 14. We see how her school life, family life, and personal life are all torn apart by the Cultural Revolution, all the while witnessing the great respect and reverence given to Mao Ze Dong, even while wrongdoings are done in his name. This book chronicles a struggle of identity and loyalty in a world where speaking your mind openly is not tolerated and the occupation of your grandfather affects your entire future. This book is a nice read, and provides insight into a little-known area of history, at least here in the West."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"Red Scarf Girl : A Memoir of the Cultural Revolution was probably one of my favorite books of all that I have.

Having read \\"Life and Death in Shanghai,\\" by Nien Ching, several years earlier, I had already been given an excellent perspective of what it must have been like to live through this period as an adult. Now, I was fascinated to see the years of the revolution detailed through the eyes of a young girl who was trying not just to survive, but to rationalise, accept, and believe in what she saw happening around her.This is a very moving account and I believe that anyone could benefit from reading it unless they are determined not to let that happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sad, But Great Story That Will Have You Crying","review":"Jiang Ji-Li has it all.

Also works great for voice chatting but after wearing it for a while my ears start to hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 8 months.","review":"I got this is in April and everything about it was great until about 5 months in the right speaker broke. I was still able to use it but then 3 months later the left speaker broke too. I guess ill remember to go with logitech next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tight","review":"I bought two of these for my employees for online conference calls and both have said that they are tight on their heads. One complained of her ears burning when she wears them because they are so tight and stiff. And these are two normal sized women with average (or smaller than average) sized heads. They are also not as portable as some other smaller headsets. Otherwise they seem to work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well ... for two months","review":"This headset originally worked very nicely for me on my Mac laptop: showed up as a USB audio interface without any separate drivers, audio quality was good, fit was comfortable enough to wear for extended conference calls. After about two months, however, the headphones crackled and stopped working. (The microphone still works, but without listenable audio, the utility of the set is pretty much shot.) I'm sadly looking into return options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headset! Very Surprised","review":"So I first looked at this headset for gaming, as I destroyed my other pair on accident. For the price, this was the best one I really found. I was very, very surprised at the sound clarity, and especially the Bass the headset could put out. Here's my Pro's and consPros:-Very good sound quality-The microphone seems to cancel background noise well-The headset fits well, looks good, and is for the most part, conformable-It pushes out a large frequency of Bass, at least compared to my other headphones in the past.-Very very good deal for the priceCons:-After prolonged use, it tends to hurt my ears a bit if I didn't have it set right-It's a bit awkward to talk into at times, as I can't hear my voice that much, but after applying some feedback, it's fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy wiring","review":"One day, the microphone would start sporadically cutting out. This was due to a wiring problem. Other than that, the mic and speaker quality was pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice headset, poor construction","review":"I bought my LifeChat LX-3000 at Staples and paid full retail. The headset works well, but the microphone is attached to the headset with a cheap little plastic joint. Mine snapped after about 6 months of light use. You are better off buying a higher quality set, or just be prepared to buy a new one every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"My friends ignore me now","review":"Super easy setup. Good sound quality. My friends tell me they can finally hear me properly now, so they all got me on mute :\\\\ ..The software ( yes install the software, new version at Microsoft) is minimal and does a good job of switching primary audio and mic to the headset when plugged in.Really though, for the price this thing is really nice. I don't have huge ears ( at least I think so) so these sit very comfortably . I had them on for a few hrs the other day and I actually forgot I had them on.Short and simple, they are $20~, if you don't have front audio ports or a speaker system with 3.5mm jacks on a desktop remote, then just buy these. They work and sound just as good as the $100~ ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Hey these are outstanding, does everything they say they do. I didn't even have to install the software to get them to work for my online games and chat. Haven't tried Windows Live Messenger but even if I need the software for it, that is to be expected. I haven't tried any internet phone calls yet so i can't comment on that. Friends in gamechat and on vent complement me on my clear voice. The price here at Amazon was great because some places I have seen want as much as $40.00 for them.Good, solid, nice sounding, comfortable (at least for me) and easy to use. I do wish the inline volume control would have had a clip on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"well so far so good with this product. i have been using it for a while now and the only complaint i have (and i dont know if it is just that i have a bit bigger ears lol), but the ear pad gets to hurting after a few hrs of use. they were soppose to set completely around the ear and one sets on the ear instead. and thats the only complaint from me, other than that they dork all great for gaming and chatting.as far as using them on yahoo chat though they automatically turn themselves down even if you turn that option off so i would assume its actually in yahoo not the headset. due to the fact that that is the only one that they have any problems with!so i say to yahoo hay plz fix the problem lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get it to work on Windows 7","review":"I wonder if anyone has the same problem. The headset works perfectly with my Windows XP laptop, but not on my Windows 7 laptop. On XP I didn't have to do anything, just plugged into the usb port and the sound worked as expected. On Windows 7, the headset stubbornly refused to pick up the sound. I tried the install CD a few times without success. Then I found a newer version of the driver on the product home page. I threw away the CD and downloaded the newer version of the driver. Bummer. Nothing seems to work at this moment so I'm wondering what I will do with the headset because I bought the headset for the Windows 7 system.If it worked without too much hassle, I would've given a 4 star for the price and the quality. But not being able to get to work on my Windows 7 laptop at this point just really frustrated me. So only 2 stars.Btw, I bought the headset for 24.95 last week and Amazon lowered it to 19.99 today. Doh for me but it's really good price now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy right price.","review":"I am very happy with the purchase of my new headset. A required item for my online school. Easy to use and great for Skyping as well!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"Unlike many other products, it does the job it says it will do. I am very happy. The best feature is the comfort and that's only because I wear them often. The sound and mic a a close second. I'm not a gamer though so I am unaware on how they preform under those circumstances.The other great thing was the price. Everywhere I looked the cheapest I could find them was $41.00. I got them, new, for under 25.00 at amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"This was my first headset and it was definitely a good one! Once you get the hang of how to use it, it works very well.

The sound quality is amazing and they are truly noise-cancelling! The bass is clear and powerful and there is a handy adjuster at thumb level to manage the volume and mute buttons. They are extremely comfortable and I can wear them for long durations which can't be said for a lot of headphones. The recording quality is professional, clear and VERY easy to use. Its plug and play compatibility is extremely intuitive and I plan to use it when doing professional product demos. I tested the audio using my Audacity recording software and it came through amazingly well. I'm not usually this effusive with praise but these are absolutely worth every bit of their price!If you're in the market for a high quality Skype enabled headset that's easy to use, buy the Lifechat LX-3000. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another solid design ruined by mediocre parts and construction","review":"When I first tried this headset on it was magical. The design is perfect. The headphones fit snug around your ears canceling out all outside noise - great for gaming. The control is okay (outside of an obnoxiously large mute button that's very easy to accidentally hit) and the mic design is great.The problem with this headset is the same problem I've had with every other sub $100 headset to date: the part quality and construction is god awful. 1 month into owning this headset I started getting static. I opened the control case to find yet another cheap chip with shoddy construction - wires frayed or detached, chip not even attached to anything (the housing crudely glued around it) - just an absolute joke.Do not purchase this headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke the second day!!!!!!","review":"This was my first very owned headset, when i first used it, i was pretty satisfied.the sound was good. the next day i tried it, nothing worked and i was hearing a static when i touched the remote. my technical guess is that the wire shorted in the giant remote, and truthfully, the wire and the remote felt kinda flimsy. There was a review about the same problem i read on this site and i figured whats the chances that all the same problem is going to occur to me, especially from microsoft, god damn i was terribly wrong, punished for 2 weeks without a headphone because i decided to go with a brand name which i thought i could trust. dont let the same thing happen to you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even a Month","review":"I didn't even have the headset for a month and the mic is already starting to break down on me. I mainly use it for recording my voice for online classes, so when I listen to what I recorded its starts at the beginning then it stops, then it stars again somewhere in the middle of what I recorded. At first when I got it it was working perfectly fine an i couldn't be happier with it. I was going to wait a month to write my review but it didn't even last that long. That's how far my $30 went with this product. The bass is awesome though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't took your advices, and now it broke with me too...","review":"Before buying this headset, I came here and read all the negative reviews, about it being a piece of junk that broke after some days.I disregarded this reviews, as I am very careful handling my objects, and thought that you were handling it badly. Well, I was wrong. After 5 months, handling it with all the care, it simply died, the wire teared apart inside out of nothing, as it naturraly rots with time.Yes, now I agree with you. This really IS a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product!! 3 Sets went bad with same issue!","review":"I had three of these sets and had all 3 go out with the same issue within 3 months.

I figured paying more would improve the quality. It worked for one month, and then microphone and sound went bad. The conection to the ear peace became loose. I took it back and exchanged it for a new one and it lasted about one month as well. It may be the heavy volume control in middle of cord. Since this is the 2nd one I have used I must assume its a poor design! I would not recomemmend anyone buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing died in 3 months..","review":"I bought this headset 3 months ago and slowly just fell apart.

It is already broken( Dec 26). I can't hear anything from it. What a piece of junk. I would rate it negative star but the lowest they have is one star. I called Amazon.com and they told me that it was past return deadline so they would charge me shipping fee and restocking fee to return it even though it is broken. If I bought this from a store, I wouldn't imagine they charge me all these fees.

I gave them 2 stars because of this. That said if you have any type of standards when it comes to audio then move on right now. Music and movies or even games and this headset won't cut it. I've had these for 2 days and its terrible. I am here to find and buy another/better set. These will do as some backups for a short time, but again...if you have any audio standards or expectations then move on to another set.They are nice size for your head though and fit ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning these","review":"It was an incredible hassle to set this thing up. Not a simple plug and play experience at all.

I wish manufacturers would test their products before shipping them out. And I mean more than just 15 minutes of listening. Unfortunately, these things kinda hurt your ears after not very long. I could see using them for short video/audio chats, but not for listening to much music...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited functionality on Mac","review":"Note that on Macs (at least on my 2011 Macbook Air running Lion), the built-in volume controls don't work (they control the built-in speakers instead of the headphone).Also note that the volume controls in the Preferences panel only have four settings, and I find the lowest setting is too loud for comfort.Finally, the ear cuffs are slightly too small for my ears (which are not unusually large).Other than that, it seems to be a nice product. Both the headphone and microphone are very sensitive (perhaps too sensitive), and it seems to be reasonably well built. I would imagine that when used on a Windows machine with the appropriate software installed, it works fine.Since Microsoft does not claim that this product works with Macs, I have no reason to complain. However, since there are other reviews which suggest that this product works just fine on Macs, I felt that I should add my experience with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful- Unreliable","review":"Never worked properly.

Just ordered another headset from different manufacturer to avoid further frustration from this unreliable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Headset With Mic, But Mic Can Be Inadvertently Turned Off ...","review":"For the price, this is a good headset with mic. I mainly use it for Skype.A very annoying problem is that the mic on/off is a button, rather than a switch. This means you can inadvertently turn it off when you bump on the in-line controller while moving around, although it has a red LED to indicate the off state. This happens more often than I like, so be forewarned if you plan to use the mic a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT RECOMMENDED","review":"This headset has decent, although not the greatest sound. The thing I HATE about them is the cord gets horribly twisted. I have to fix the cable every day and as time passes this gets worse. The cable is so twisted now I can no loner fix it. It's as if there's a wire running through it. I use the headset for many hours a day. My ears get extremely sore. There's no way to adjust the width. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I have had this headset before and lost it. I love this headset for listening to music as well as chatting. The cord is long enough to where I can sit comfortably and I love the volume/mute/call button feature. Clear sound, and mic works great as well. The ear pieces are comfortable enough for long time wearing. I will buy this again if I ever lose this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones!!","review":"This item more than met my expectation. For the price of this item, I expected this to be \\"generic\\" but to my surprise, it has great sound and totally block out noise. You have to turn it almost all the way down to actually hear what's going on around you. My son plays his games on his PC and with his PS3 console. He can not hear me even when I raise my voice to get his attention. The cord is about 6.5 feet long but if you are trying to move around it could be a little bit longer for comfort! When I speak into the headphones, my voice comes out clear to the people I'm speaking with. Great product for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable to wear, a lot of pressure on the ears.","review":"This headset actually works well, but it is so uncomfortable to wear that I don't use it.

That combination not only sounds great, but it so comfortable I forget to take it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product from Microsoft","review":"I bought a pair of the headphone back in June but i mad an mistake and stepped on the first one and had to repurchase theses headphones.

Though it was more bulky it seemed more comfortable on the ears than other headsets. The mic quality received positive feedback from others on ventrilo.

Personally I recommend the logitech head sets. I bought one for my son who uses a head set as much as I do and he has never had an issue with his.

MS also has other tactics and this was one -- when I woke up paralyzed in the right-hand, it was, what to do? I could not get the competing hardware/software package since it was incompatible with WIN 7 (as are half my devices and programs), so I was stuck with Win7's not very grand speech recognition program and this set of headphones wit mike.

I usually play games with headphones on since I have a roommate, but as of November 2009, there is no way to get the PS3 to send audio out through a USB connection. Because this is an over-ear headphone, you have to have one ear covered with this, and the other ear open to listen to the TV, or, if you want to use headphones, you have to have this thing hanging around your neck with the mic in front of your mouth while you use another pair of headphones to listen to the game. This device could at least have a second cable or at least an attachment so that it can receive audio through both USB and headphone jack, but as it stands, this device is nearly useless for Playstation gamers.Very disappointed overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible build quality.","review":"This is my first review.I purchased the Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000 at Best Buy a week ago, to use with Skype.

From this experience I can tell you it's not one-size-fits-all.- Poor sound quality. It's not the worst, but it's enough you can notice pings of scratchy sound distortion here and there. I would not want to watch movies or play games on these.- Decent casual use microphone. Not good enough for recording since it doesn't perfectly filter other noise, but somewhat better than the worst bargain rate microphones.- Retail price is ridiculous. If you need a chatting only headset this is maybe worth the $15-20 marked down, but the original retail is ridiculous for this rather limited product."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wouldn't buy","review":"when working pretty good, but coz of USB connection and lack of help facility something was always wrong.

So it can be annoying when you can't hear your game sound very well.-Also since it covers both ears and noice cancels, it feels weird when you talk because you can't hear yourself well so it causes you to speak louder. I just use them with one ear uncovered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy heavy heavy","review":"I use a headset almost everyday to chat with my friends, and I bought this one after a headset that I had for a year started acting up. The mic is amazing, people comment on the great sound quality. That is really the only plus side about this.The mute button is positioned so that if I happen to touch that area (which happens when I move my laptop, sit up, lean over, etc) the mute button will activate and the listening party will think I am incredibly rude.The headset is very heavy, the pads are very big, and they are comfortable UNLESS I wear glasses, which will just make very painful ears after 30 minutes or so.I would have been content with the headphones and made sure I wore contacts everytime I had to use them, except I bought these Sept 22, 2011, and first week of Dec 2011, they're already broken.

I checked the cable looking for some cut but nothing wrong, just notice that sometimes when pushing mute and another button togheter on the headset make the right side to work.So the piece is already malfunctional and probably will be dead in a few months.

For frequent use there are much better options. My biggest complaint is the cord, it constantly seems to twist itself up, even if you take good care of it. The twisting causes the wires inside to break, a loose connection on the pendant volume/mic control has caused the mic to crackle every time I turn the mic on, which has rendered this headset useless.The ear pieces are also quite uncomfortable, if you have anything other than small ears. Not only are the ear slots not big enough to fit fully around my ears, but they are not deep enough, which causes my ears to press against the hard plastic on the inside (the thin foam layer doesn't protect very well), causing extended use to become quite painful.Sound quality is so-so or poor, there's a definite lack of bass.I've bought some cheap headsets but these are, by far, the worst I've ever purchased. Do yourself a favor, spend the money on a nicer headset or, at the very least, something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"If you're going to use this headset about once a month, you won't notice anything wrong with it. But if you use it for any type of gaming, you'll notice after about two hours the headset feels tight and your ears start aching. Then you'll notice that with repeated use the sound quality becomes worse and worse, until anytime you try speaking into the mic you are greeted with distortion and static. The cord is really cheap, will continually get wrapped around itself, until it finally ruins the connection and your ability to use the mic at all. Don't buy these. You'll just end up replacing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kobayashi Reveiw","review":"Alright, I might not have much to say about this but I do have to say that out of all the headsets I have used this one is the best. The sound quality from the headphone part is very good. Good volume control that can easily block outside noises, and can be worn in another way in case I want to listen to something else. Also the sound quality of anything I record is very good. It doesn't pick up any sounds other than ones made by me which is very good when recording for voice over, or singing. Also it doesn't hurt my head unlike some other head sets I've used in the past. So this one is worth the price. So I highly recommended it. However I never actually used it with lifechat though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muffled sound, many incompatibilities and poor leather earpads","review":"Right out of the box I've noticed that my lifechat had a muffled sound (ok ! this is a matter of taste) and I decided to not use it much, prefering to hear my mp3s and games alike with my soundblaster speakers.

I used it for my PC/PS3 gaming & General use. It's sound is pretty good; I can hear a lot more detail when I use them. The mic part itself is also pretty good. While talking with friends over Skype they'd say that there was no static and my voice was clear. This headset is also comfortable. However, your ears may get sore after a long period of time(5 hours+). It wasn't really great at stopping background noise, but it wasn't the worst either. I liked the mute button on the cord, I used this daily. If i had to talk to my family, I'd just mute it without having to leave my game or mute it on my computer.Overall I'd recommend this headset to casual gamers or for general use. Such as using skype and all that.Edit: I also forgot to add that this headset recently stopped working; or at least the mic part did. Still, I got 2 years of use out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and uncomfortable","review":"I've used these for less than year and am now writing a review because they just broke.Pros: Sound is pretty good.Microphone is very good.Cons: The band across the head is uncomfortable and leaves gouges in my head.

They were cheap, but they still should last longer than a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Leopard Likes It","review":"Even though this was a MS product and I am a Mac person, I took the plunge. I have to say that I like these much better than my previous Logitechs. the over-the-ear fit is great. There's even an inline remote and the volume up/down buttons and microphone mute button even work! I just plugged it into my keyboard USB and iChat was happy and the volume/mute buttons worked. To be sure, the volume up/down buttons are for the output and they actually change the OS volume, so it will be changed wether you're listening through the headphones or through other speakers. And the mute button is for the microphone and it only mutes the headset microphone, not the internal microphone or anything else.The sound is really nice too, but that probably has a lot to do with the background noise that is removed by the nice fit of the ear pieces.Note: The 'other' button on the remote isn't currently doing anything. I'm not actually sure what it's supposed to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasts a couple of months!","review":"I've been buying and using this headset for the last year or so. My husband and I have gone through about 5 sets so far, and have quit buying them.First and foremost, the big problem we have with this set is that the heavy volume control right in the middle of the wire causes it to short out over a short period of time. There is no clip on it, so you just have to let it swing free or lay it in your lap. With this set, first you hear static, then your mic stops working altogether. Our last order was for 3 of them: 1 for each of us, and a backup. The first one we opened didn't work at all, and was in 3 pieces. So we sent it back for a replacement. The two we used have now gone all but dead within a few months. The backup? Had the same problems as the one we returned. Either that was a horrible batch, or the quality is just down to nothing now.A big thumbs down to this headset nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Durable","review":"3 years ago, I bought one of these, and it is still working today.

I am actually on Amazon at work typing this review because it is so bad that I would not want an employer to make the mistake of purchasing these.Now I'm off to order my own headset to replace this one.

Good sound, comfortable, easy to install. I used it to listen to music, use skype, and never had a problem. It survived moving to and from my dorm, falling numerous times off of my desk, and getting tangled. So when it finally died, I decided to get the same brand. Unfortunately, something must have happened in those three years because my second headset just broke after 3 weeks. I was even extra careful with it this time after reading the reviews about delicate wires. I noticed that a lot of the 4 and 5 star reviews are actually from a few years ago.

The earpieces are very heavy and don't quite fit my ears, though my ears are quite normal, they leave a slightly stinging sensation after a very short while.My biggest objection, though, is to the placement of the control pad about 18 inches from the earpiece. You can't change the position of the control pad and in my case this meant that I couldn't safely tuck the USB cord behind my desk because it would have made the controls unreachable. Also, the mute button on the control pad is not recessed and as the badly-designed pad brushes again the desk, the chair etc. it tends to activate the mute button without you noticing it. I'm not going to buy a Microsoft headset again. This headset was cheap and does seem reliable but is not ergonomic and is very badly designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gear","review":"This product does everything I would expect of a headset.

In particular, he liked to put down Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels in such a way that made it painfully clear he had never read one. Don't bother buying this book.

Cheesy dialogue, disengaged acting, and special effects that are competent though hardly inspiring is what distinguishes this movie. Some people with statue fetishes might find a few scenes noteworthy but otherwise this movie leaves no lasting impact.

The story is as follows: A evil Djinn is set free form its prison, by a woman who ends up busting the Jewel in which the Djinn is trapped.

All of the riffs are basically ripped from watever popular band is playing whatever style they are trying to imitate. Example: When they play death metal riffs, it reeks of Suffocation; when they play \\"hardcore\\" riffs, it sounds like something a lazy ripoff of the Warriors would play; and when they play tech/grind riffs, well... they rip off Ion Dissonance.

These guys have two singers, and they both constantly switch off between different vocal styles, the brutal death style, the hardcore style, high pitched screams, and it blends together in a way that you will not be able to comprehend. One thing this band does not do is ever sing like a wussy, no emo garbage here. Basically if you think you're some big tough death-core kid because you listen to Premonitions of War, The Acacia Strain or The Red Chord, you don't know nothing until you've heard this. No disrespect to the latter three bands, they are some of my favorites, and some of the best live....but this CD is something else.

Some of the things that he writes about that amazed me are: a group of Americans whose speech patterns still smack of Elizabethan English, an island that is home to a herd of wild horses that are the descendants of a Spanish shipwreck from hundreds of years ago, the Mysterious Melungeons, and just about every other sub-culture group in the US.

A little bit was touched about their lives but it was like the writer and director were too lazy to go into detail and you're expected to fill in the blanks for the whole movie.

With lots of Elmore Leonard characters, Rouff writes about Las Vegas like Carl Hiassen does of Florida.

Terrific pacing keeps you moving from chapter to chapter, and the Dice Angel herself is a real treat.The narrative totally captures the moment by moment tension of live table action, Vegas-style, and Jimmy Delaney is like a middle aged Jerry Seinfield, the IRS after him, up to his ears in financial problems, yet heroically dry-witted and determined to take even a step that goes beyond his basic nature to save everything he's worked for all his life.

I would say $2.00 might be the right price, if in fact you wanted it at all. Probably would have been better to buy the plastic version, since they couldn't have made the plastic this thin without it wilting in your hand.

Anyone who can say that executives who express preference for face-to-face communication are being defensive doesn't know a thing about socialisation or tacit knowledge processes. They must think the world can be ordered around aka the military model. oh whoops, one of the authors spent 35 years as a career officer in the USAF.

I often don't find myself having the same questions as the interlocutor. Then, I want something very practical; I want to be walked through the inquiry process and methods that can help lead to awakening, not to know the semantic meanings and definitions of the words (\\"knowledge, pure mind, bliss\\"), and the meanings of the words might even be special to or specialized by the author, not the ordinary plain definition, and often the key terms are not strictly in English. My frustration is not due to unfamiliarity with the basic ideas. I have listened to dozens upon dozens of authors who had awakenings describe their experiences.

As for Nicholaa, she shows some spirit in the beginning of the novel, but she quickly bends to Royce and tries to make his life \\"peaceful\\".There was none of the great back and forth between the characters that Garwood's other novels contain.

There is a lot of warmth and humour in this novel, and you will really be rooting be Royce and Nicholaa as they gradually discover their deep feelings for each other - and indulge in a lot of (very) passionate cuddling and hilarious debates and lectures on \\"discipline\\" along the way!

It was like they were 10 years old!! I mean, I know they married young in the middle ages but geez!!

Ms. Garwood has an amazing ability to produce good ideas for books but unfortunately she doesn't do much to expand on them. First and foremost is her apparent lack of either 1.)good writing skills or 2.) a good editor. She uses the words \\"too,\\" \\"God's truth,\\" and \\"Tis' the truth\\" more times than I can count. I also think that any good 11th grade English student could combine sentences better than what is presented in this book.

So a total of 6 headsets... and not a one of them still works. There is a design flaw somewhere in these things that caused them not to work. My first guess would be the wire from the controller but they made the side that plugs into the headset with a tongue and grove so you can't just go out and replace it... I am unhappy with them even at the 6.99 price... no telling how mad I would have been if I bought them at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept BUT bad execution","review":"I was tired of replacing the cheap Xbox headset every couple of months so I decided to invest a nice pair. I like the one-ear cup designs so I was excited when I found the Motorola. It feels and looks like a quality piece but after the second use it was already starting to show problems. At first the Mike began cutting in and out and a week or so later I began hearing alot of static every time I moved my controller. There must be a loose wiring because the only way I can get any sound out of it now is to keep the wire completely straight and not move my controller at all.

While it looks nice and is fairly comfortable, the cons outweigh the pros in this case. I soon noticed that the wiring quickly developed a malfunction which led to poor sound quality/ lost sound very early on. The wiring leading from the headset to the controller mount is thin and frail. The mount, which connects into my XBOX 360 controller, cannot be turned off, and if left plugged into the controller, continues to draw power, even when the console and controller are both turned off. The volume function is not absolute, while you can turn it to low, it will not turn completely off without unplugging it. While it does look nice, and fits somewhat comfortably for a time, I found this to be poor quality over-all."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"I bought this thinking it was going to be fantastic, um yeah NO!!

It's a decent cop show. And I like Tom Selleck. What pisses me off with BLUE BLOODS Season Two is the blurry picture quality. My one star review is a response to the inferior video quality of Season Two compared to Season One on DVD. Apparently CBS wants me to give up on the DVD format and convert to Blu-Ray, and is deliberately delivering DVDs to consumers with flawed video.The drama, the acting and the writing seems as good as last season, but the picture quality is so poor I'm not sure I will bother to watch the whole season.One good thing I can say is that the picture quality for NCIS Season Nine was slightly worse on DVD than BLUE BLOODS Season Two. Maybe TV studios don't care about viewers watching on the DVD format, and just want it to die already. Well, NCIS is dead to me.

Everytime I sit on the couch, or clean the living room, I somehow end up hitting the remote and turning the PS3 system on. So then someone, not paying attention, turns the PS3 on by hitting the remote, they leave the room and then the PS3 is left on ALL DAY! NOT GOOD!

Pain in the rear for sure. Anyways, I was consent to live w/ these setbacks, but then the stupid thing stopped working after about a year. Tried to re-pair w/ bluetooth to no avail.

While the PS3 controller can be used for movies, this Blu-ray disc remote feels more natural. Bluetooth allows the remote to connect to the PS3 wirelessly. This is a great feature because the controller works anywhere in the room - it doesn't need to point at the system. The controller feels sturdy and functions well.Although you can turn on the PS3 with one button, there is no single-touch off button. You must open the main menu and choose to turn off the system. Sure, this only takes two seconds, but it is a pain (especially when the TV is turned off before the PS3). The lack of a glow-in-the-dark feature might annoy some people.

Since it uses Bluetooth instead of infrared, you do not need to have line of sight in order for the remote to operate the PS3.Cons: Since it uses Bluetooth instead of infrared, you cannot use this as a universal remote to control your TV or any other electronics. There is no light or any kind of indication on the remote itself to indicate that it is working correctly.Other thoughts: This remote will have to by synced to your PS3 before it will operate.

Using your game controller for the movies is, as you know, a joke. This thing is nice and easy to use. The PS3 should really just come with one of these in the first place.The only complaint is that being a bluetooth controller, its not a universal remote. But there are also a lot of advantages to it being a bluetooth controller too, like when you're in the other room and you're listening to music. Being bluetooth, you don't need to be line of sight for it to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"PS3 Blu-ray Remote","review":"The PS3 remote is great Playing DVDs, Blu-Ray Movies, CDs and does this alot better than the Sixaxis. The remote is very responsive and you dont have to point it at the PS3. Due to the remote being bluetooth you can't use it for your other home theatre devices, which doesn't bother me since i got it exclusively for my PS3. So the only I don't like about this remote is that the buttons don't light up which makes them hard to find at night since most of the buttons are pretty small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensible if you watch blu-rays","review":"Very nice remote, works well.

Great for movie viewing and ANYTHING besides gaming. Surfing the web, the PS Store, is all a breeze. Now i turn on my PS3 with the Remote, mess around in the xmb utilities for a while, and when im ready to play a game i pick up the dualshock, other than that this remote ROCKS.It even has a glossy finish on the face , it matches the piano black on the PS3 nicely.Highly recommended, the only thing i regret is not buying it sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"They didn't try very hard","review":"Cons:1) It is missing the 5-second skip-back feature accessible in the on screen PS3 menus. This would have been great to have a button for.2) The enter and directional pad are the only intuitive part of the thing. The remaining buttons are all similar rectangles which aren't easy to find by touch. The enter and directional buttons will work for pause, play, and ff/rw in DVD's only, not Blu-ray, so you're stuck using the rectangles when using Blu-ray.3) Did I mention there are a billion buttons and they're mostly either tiny or large rectangles. I thought designs like this were phased out in the 90's.Pros:1) Bluetooth means you don't have to point the thing in any particular direction.2) Still better than using the PS3 remote, but not as much as I'd hoped."},{"rating":"2","title":"PS3 Remotes!!

Why not only the PS button?! Turn on the PS3 on accident all the time...+ Bluetooth, so sight lines don't matter which is cool. Wish my other remotes were like this.It's a remote and it works, not rocket science. It's better than using the dual shock 3, but I wouldn't buy it again unless they added a back light!

It is the only remote that works with the PS3 also as there are no Universal Remotes that can work on the BlueTooth Mode the PS3 needs. There are third party remotes that would have you use one of your USB slots to work that are cheaper.

You can memorize where some of the main buttons are, but if you are navigating the features of a blu-ray disc, you need to be able to see what your are pressing. At only $20 when I bought it, I can see why adding a light wouldn't be cost effective.Either way, I'm glad I have this for now.

This is a true remote control with buttons that just do the job. I find myself using it more than the controller for navigating through the main menus and just using the controller for gaming. Since owning for a brief time, this has made a major difference in my use of the PS3 as a media device. Especially since i also use it for NetFlix streaming.The only flaw is no backlighting for key buttons like I have on my other remotes. This makes it difficult to use while watching movies with the lights dimmed and is the only reason why it's not 5 stars. Still, this remote is a vast improvement for using the PS3's non-gaming features.

Consider that I also often use the \\"languages\\", the \\"subtitles\\" and the \\"display\\" buttons. I don't understand how Sony can have achieved to engineer something like this, with several good examples of remotes on the market (even by Sony itself!) they could have easily copied.* The batteries last very short.

I personally don't mind the lacking power button, it's not that big of a deal to hit the PS3 button and choose shutdown. It's not like you have to get up to turn it off. But, the most exciting thing to me is the bluetooth. I still find myself pointing the remote at the PS3 out of habit, but it is an awesome change from my other remotes, some of which don't work if you are accidently blocking part of the IR. I think this will revolutinize all remotes in the future, and a few years from now we will wonder why the heck we ever used IR remotes that need line of sight. For the price of this remote, I think you will be very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remote except for two flaws","review":"The Sony PS3 remote is great -- nice button placement and feel (although that's subjective), and since it uses Bluetooth to communicate with the PS3, line of sight isn't required! That's a long-overdue feature for all remotes, because it lets you operate devices in cabinets and you don't have to point the remote at the device.The flaws:1) The DVD remote has no IR emitter so it can't control anything except the PS3. While I wasn't expecting a universal remote, it would have been nice if it could at least change the volume on my Sony receiver and/or my Sony TV.2) No backlight. I can live with that, once my fingers learn the button placement. But I've squinted at it a few times.All in all, it's worth the money.

The controller is very responsive and the unit looks very very good. Black shiny look gives it a very professional look. Very sturdy and well built. BUT ANY BUTTON WILL TURN YOUR PS3 ON. There should have been an on/off button instead. Many times the very sensitive remote will turn your PS3 unintentionally. For example, reaching for an item near the remote and accidentally pushing the remote against a surface or an object will turn your PS3 on and you have to wait for 5 to 10 seconds till the PS3 allows you to turn it off. Other then that, the unit is great and I think if you need a remote for your PS3 they will all be the same because it is a PS3 issue. One last thing, the PS3 controller runs the DVD's just fine, so you could do with out a controller for the casual DVD watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great remote until it stopped working","review":"This was a great remote control for two and a quarter years -- and then it stopped working.

Never more! And I can control my blue ray films too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"The remote does its job. I would never want to use it as another game controller, but as a remote for the PS3 for the movies that we watch its works great. Trying to use the game controller was a pain,and frequently I would hit the wrong button, and accidently pause or fast forward using the game controller. You do need to sync it up with the PS3 because of the bluetooth capability. As for on/off capability hold the PS button down for a few seconds, and the PS3 will prompt you if you want to turn it off. It is a straightforward remote, nothing fancy, but for $20 well worth not having the aggravation watching movies using the game controller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most frustrating piece of equipment I ever bought.","review":"The only reason I didn't give this one star was because it does work well for everything it's supposed to do except that it's so damned sensitive. If I accidentally bump any of the buttons it will turn my PS3 on. I contacted Sony's pathetic technical support, but they weren't able to offer me any help. There are no settings to adjust sensitivity or to assign just one button the function of turning the PS3 on and/or off. I may end up throwing the remote out and selling the PS3 in disgust and boycotting all Sony products as a result. That they offered no viable solution to my problem is unacceptable, and they don't deserve my hard-earned cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refurbished beware","review":"Make sure your remote is not refurbished like mine was, chances are it will only work for a while then be useless.

The instructions are clear and easy to follow. Based on my internet research, most people don't have a problem with the initial connection but more than a few do have a difficult time. I tried all the tips on the PS3 websites but none of the advice helped. However, I just kept trying to connect the unit and on about the 15th attempt (it seemed like a lot more) the unit finally connected. Since then it is just the thing to have to watch DVDs and internet TV.If you buy this remote be prepared to spend some time getting it working and don't give up."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET IT!","review":"If you've got a ps3 and watch movies on it, GET THIS REMOTE.

Great placement, Sony....NOT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Short","review":"As others stated, this is one busy remote. There are more buttons on it than a remote for a complex stereo system. I also do not like how it takes pressing a button twice because the remote has to wake up first. Plus with no button pushing indicator light, you cannot tell if what you did worked or not.A must have? No, I do not think it is a must have. A \\"would be ok to have\\" is better terminology. Hopefully a third party remote will come along that is a little better than this. It did some with Sony batteries, so it is nice you do not have to buy those right away.If you have the money to get this, do so. You can live with it. If money is tight, use it to buy another controller. Yes, not as pleasant as a remote, but a controller has more uses with a PS3 obvioulsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remote is not well made!!!

So now you can place your console out of sight in a cabinet. Sony added the \\"handy\\" feature of allowing the remote to turn on the PS3 by pushing ANY remote button. Hmmm, now imagine a curious child getting hold of it, or it accidentally getting pressed while you move it. Add the fact that it actually has NO power button, so you are unable to remotely power down your PS3 without going thorough the system menu, or memorizing the key sequence to blindly power down without the TV on. (Hold down the PS3 button, and click OK twice). To simply power down the PS3, you need to touch and hold the console power sensor for a couple of seconds.Some frustration happening here?Call me lazy, but isn't that why we like remote controllers to begin with?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating remote","review":"I purchased a PS3 because it was the most affordable BlueRay player on market at the time. As players go, it's not bad. But this remote is sub-par. It eats through batteries and with no back-light you can't see the buttons in my home theater. I actually have a small flashlight next to remote so that I don't have to turn on the lights. The only reason to buy this remote is that it's your only option. And since Sony chooses to use Bluetooth instead of IR, you're stuck with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The remote didn't work with the PS3","review":"I Was too busy to register the BD remote with the PS3 after I bought it. Finally I got a chance to do it on 10/19/11. I had to call Sony PlayStation to walk me through the process of registering the remote with the PS3 settings. IT DIDN'T WORK !!! Now I stuck with the remote that is not working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remote","review":"I convinced my husband to buy this along with our ps3.

If you like to watch movies on your ps3 this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still using a control to control movies?","review":"This remote is so much better than using a regular dual shock for controller movies or when streaming videos over PS3 Media Center.

If you use your PS3 as a DVD/BluRay player, you'll appreciate the easy to navigate remote that makes navigating DVD menu screens much easier. It would be better with backlit buttons, but hey, it's only 20 bucks and it does everything exactly as advertised with a solid build quality to boot. This should really have been included in the box with the PS3. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool remote","review":"Just thought I would post a quick review for this remote. Although I knew that this remote was blue-ray technology I didn't think about it due to years of normal remotes, but this remote is cool because you don't have to point it at your system. Yes I know that is a DUH comment for plenty of people, but I think for the person who doesn't know much about how technology works that it is a pretty cool thing to know. It is bigger than the old ps2 remote, I wish it was a lot smaller. However I imagine this does a lot more. I don't use this remote for anything other than watching movies on my system but it's great for that. Responds well, looks nice, had no problems setting it up with my system. A good buy, I will however mention look for it online because I found mine much cheaper than in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for PS3 movie watchers!","review":"Ive had my PS3 for around two weeks now and ive found that ive been using it play lots of movies. Its a top quality player and can play DVD's and Blu Ray movies out of the box. However, the Sixaxis controller is terrible for controlling movies. I found myself accidently pressing buttons (stopping a DVD halfway through arghh!) and wondering which button does what (the start button is the pause button...whats with that?).So anyway, i bought this remote and im very pleased with it. Its made of very high quality plastic and feels very expensive. Each button has an explanation and you can control the PS3 XMB with it too (ive found that the web browser and PS3 shop is easier to use with this). My favourite feature is the bluetooth connection, i don't have to point it anywhere to use it. The only thing that bugs me about this remote is that it really makes the PS3 complete and should have been included with the PS3. Nevertheless i highly recommend this remote to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job well","review":"Everyone probably buys this remote for the same reason. We all hate to use the dualshock2 controller to control movies. Especially since the control goes into a sleep mode after some minutes. Anywas this remote has every single button you could need for in a movie. I like using the slow step buttons to catch something in movies I never found before. Anyways everyone that watches a lot of movies in their ps3 definitely has to get one of these remotes.The only downside to it is that it doesn't let me go through some websites like grooveshark to listen to some music online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent remote for the bluray DVD player","review":"Honestly this remote should have come free with PS3 or PS3 should have had a infra red port so that we could have used the normal universal remote (instead of this bluetooth remote). Having said that this is like any other remote when it comes to using PS3 for playing DVDs. Layout is pretty simple but it does look little crowded with all those buttons. I would not use it as a replacement for the controllers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lo que necesitaba","review":"Este control remoto es lo que necesitaba para disfrutar las peliculas BD en mi PS3 Slim ya que el dualshock es muy limitado.

It seems like a waste of money. Basically, you can perform the same functions with the controller. It is too complex for those people who cannot use the controller. So I do not really get the point of it. Plus, a lot of functions you would like to see it perform are not arranged in a logical fashion. I would skip this and just use the controller. For people who cannot master the use of the controller, this remote is too complex."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm on my third remote but when they work they are perfect!","review":"I've gone through 2 of these so far and am ordering the 3rd one now.

It is convenient to have this with the other remotes while keeping the PS3 controller stored elsewhere. Just like the controller, it is simple to boot and turn off the PS3. It takes up less space on my coffee table with its slender, remote shape so that it can be next to the TV remote. Best of all, it has clearly labeled movie controls (pause, play, etc). Use the pause button instead of stop when you want to leave the room as the stop button will take you to the PS3 menu."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"I just purchased an HDTV a month ago and thought this would be a great way to watch Blu-Ray movies rather than buy a separate player. Using this remote to watch DVDs is much easier than using one of the game controlers.

It is easy to use and navigation with it is very easy. The bluetooth technology is great, you dont have to point at the console like IR remotes. You can point it anywhere and it will work perfect.the only thing I guess I could say that's \\"bad\\" about it is that it is always on, there is no power off button.When you turn off your PS3 with it that does not necessarily mean the remote is turned off.Also if your PS3 is off and you accidently hit ANY button, not just the PS button, any button on the remote the PS3 will turn on.Other than that I highly recommend this remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must have","review":"This remote is a must have if you want to use a ps3 as a blu-ray player.

Here is a small example of what the book entails; \\"When I begin to work on myself, sometimes things get worse before they get better. It is okay if this happens, because I know that it's the beginning of the process. It's untangling old threads. I just flow with it. It takes time and effort to learn what I need to learn.

In fact when I popped it in my CD player it started out great. From reading the liner notes I already knew that the last track was also to be found on another compilation album, Arabesque. That album BTW is a must for almost any music collection. It turns out however that no less then four of the ten tracks of \\"Mystic Groove\\", all on the last half of the CD, are lifted straight out of \\"Arabesque\\". It would have been so easy to replace those tracks by different ones from the same fabulous artists. So, to make a long story short, save your mon and buy the much better and longer \\"Arabesque\\" instead. Don't support this blatant rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under-produced electronica","review":"I bought this CD because it had a track with Goze - Sirocco, I loved that track from the Kelly Slate Surfing game.Unfortunately, this CD suffers from the Buddha Bar/Chill Out/<insert compilation name here> syndrome.One or two tracks are good, but you wonder where they found the other 10 tracks, (or that whole 2nd CD in some cases).Mystic Groove is supposed to take place in a commercialized mid-Eastern Electronica World.The gee-whiz factor wears off quite quickly.Most tracks on this CD are plain under-produced electronica. That's a bad combination, because it means a sounds and samples repeated just too much.There's gotta be better compilations out there, and the only good thing from this one is that I'm searching for other, better ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exotic and Electronic","review":"I bought this CD despite a few negative reviews because the price was reasonable and I recognized the following ambient classics;track #3 Transcendence - Thievery Corporationtrack #9 Caravane - RadarSo I decided to give this CD a shot and was very pleased. It is mostly down to mid-tempo electronica with asian and middle eastern influences. It is easy to dance to and I found it perfect for all the fusion dancing I am doing right now. It is also good just to chill out to or do yoga. In addition to the aforementioned great songs, other tracks that stand out are;track #2 Ghoom Charakahnatrack #6 Sirocco - Christopher Gozetrack #7 Der Bauch - MC SultanI think Sirocco is the best track on the CD.

I am always looking for literature to help my family, friends, and relationships understand what it means to have bipolar, and to help them understand what they see me go through.I struggled to read this book. It was boring and only brushed the surface of the disorder. The book also reads like a high school text book; I felt as if there should have been a test at the end of every chapter.This book may be helpful to some, but I found it did not go deeply into what people really need to know to understand and the disorder and help their loved ones with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bipolar Survival Guide","review":"Excellent resource for families struggling with this devastating diagnosis.

Then my new doctor was not really sure. So I got this book and after reading it, it finally made me sure of the original diagnosis. Although my case may be mild in some ways compared to others some of it it is not and I can definitely see myself in this book and it explains my whole entire life to me!!

However, in many respects this referrence minimizes the severity of the illness and oversimplifies the complexities of the disease. Much attention is given to \\"mood charting\\" which is an untested theory that has proven to be a futile waste of time in my own personal experience with bipolar disorder. Since the \\"moods\\" of bipolar disorder do not follow any predictable pattern (e.g. the sine curve), \\"mood charting\\" is of little benefit. Furthermore, and even more alarming, this reference presupposes that the sufferer can self-diagnose their own \\"mood\\" state at any given moment. Nothing could be further from the truth.

As others have mentioned, it isn't well written. He speaks in generalities about the first four great investors, and I'm fairly certain there are paragraphs copy/pasted from one chapter to the next. Very repetitive. The only one of the four the author seems to have done any actual research on is William O'Neil, and Mr. O'Neil has several books available that are much better and give way more detail in how to actually carry out the strategies.I'm glad I read the little book because it led me to this excellent book, but I really wish I had skipped it and went straight to the sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLEW UP","review":"I was cooking a roast and when I opened up the oven door ,The pan Blew up I have glass every where.not to mention the 7 # prime rib was trashed.

This is really quite tragic, as I see the songs on the album a perfect reflection of who and what Garfunkel stand for. I am 24 years old and was not even alive when the album was released so I cannot compare it to pop music of the time--although I never really classified Art Garfunkel as pop---more as Art Music. What I can say is that his voice, the way he chooses to use it, the songs he chooses to utilize it in, and the lyrics he expresses have touched me. He is an artist in this album in the sense that he knows himself and what he wants to say to the listener. If you are looking for the sensitive Garfunkel displaying his usual sensitive tenor voice, then this album is for you. It might even be classified as a concept album as it takes you through the journey of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music!

It didn't help that there are four \\"prongs\\" on the lid that can scratch you. Overall the only part of the lid that was carefully made was the screen. The part that screwed on the jar was a mess, with little plastic tags sticking out and rough bulgy spots on the screw threads as well as the whole lid being warped. I sent it back because I didn't want to have to wrestle with it every time I used it. Cheesecloth and a rubber band may be harder to clean, but overall it's easier to use and no risk of scratching yourself on a plastic \\"prong.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This lid does not let all the water out so the sprouts sit in water and gel up. After 5 days - none have sprouted. They smell and have not sprouted. I've tried to shake the water out vigorously. I've tried cleaning the lid. I won't be buying any more and it's not worth the effort to send them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy and Easy to Clean","review":"I like to have more than one sprouting device on hand. I most often use an Easy Sprout sprouter but there have been times I wanted to have two or more sets of sprouts going but don't much like using cheesecloth and don't have an extra Easy Sprout yet. This is a handy little lid to have. I mainly use it for beans or larger seeds because as another reviewer pointed out the holes might be too large for small seeds.I find that it's easy to drain but sometimes it takes a little longer to fill the jar with water for rinsing the sprouts, so I have to take the lid off to fill it faster. For this reason, I knocked off one star.

This defeats my purpose of having bought a lid like this, which was to make it simple to add water right through the screen and then pour out again, all in one action.So I definitely do not recommend buying this screen if you want an easy method for making sprouts--I suggest looking for one that allows water to be poured in for rinsing while the lid is on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage-Does not fit!","review":"Don't waste your money on this...it did not fit as advertised ....poor quality all the way around... ... ... ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holes are too small.","review":"The holes are too small. It makes it very difficult to get fresh water in the jar and to pour old water out.

If you want a good sprouting lid get one of the stainless steel mesh types."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice But","review":"These are nice and work as intended. But the holes in the lid top are large enough for a fruit fly (and 100 of his friends) to squeeze through. Maybe you don't have fruit flies in your house. Maybe you do, like me. Personally I have not been freaked out too much by this, but I did cut some squares of cheese cloth to put under the lids. So I'm back to cheese cloth. So what did I buy these for? Well, I didn't know about the fruit fly issue. Nobody told me. So now you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"This works but if want more than try this","review":"I have this type sprouting strainer lid and used it for years and then got out of the habit of sprouting.

This is one of those items.And if used right, it is awesome for sprouting the smallest seeds. Have had none of the problems the low star reviewers wrote about. I add the seeds, rinse, drain, and set aside to sprout. Morning and evening I allow fresh water to go inside without removing the lid, shake lightly and then simply pour the water out. Yes, I sometimes have to make sure I shake any sprouts that may remain in the openings, to remove them. But it's not rocket science.But...I also use this when I make yogurt cheese. I make European and Greek yogurt in a Mason jar and when I want to drain to make a yogurt style cream cheese I put this lid on, and turn upside down on a sake rack placed on top of a bowl to collect the whey. Within four hours I have the best and freshest 'cream cheese'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I might have gotten a defective product, because mine does not drain. Water wont go in either. I tried pouring water into the jar (slowly) through the top and it pooled and spilled over the side. I tried to make sprouts and the water barley dripped out. I tilted it several different ways to drain and water just trickled out. The holes just seem too small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly","review":"A great introduction to home sprouting. No $75.00 fancy sprouting machine required. We have made several batches of delicious sprouts using this lid, which fits perfectly on our wide-mouthed Ball canning jars.

This said, I will now tell you what I liked about the rest of the book - EVERYTHING! From her frank and honest thoughts about special youthful moments and times she shared with family members and friends. To her detail description of Dexter locations that hold a ton of memories for her and for all of us that spent our youth there in the 50s. Very thought provoking read which takes you though a huge range of emotional feeling.

I like the idea's of what she says, I just have so many other meditation CD's that I like better than this one.... ANY!

And we're more accustomed to all-over-the-map records. Basically, it all hinges on how you like the title track.... a bolero-like run up to a climax that never happens. It's brilliant but marred.

Save for the three singles (the peerles, still heart-stopping STAND & DELIVER, possibly the ANTS best single, the campy title track, and the so-bad-its-good proto-rap ANT RAP), the rest sounds like flippant, indulgent dreck & doesn't stand up today. If you remember that KINGS came out in 1980, and this came out less than one year later in 1981, the album sounds like a rush job to capitalize on ADAM's run of radio hits - clever early MTV videos and swashbuckling image aside, PRINCE CHARMING proves that third time isn't the charm!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Adam and the Ants album","review":"The lyrics \\"Ridicule is nothing to be scared of\\" said a lot to me when I heard them first in 1982.

These books are very similar and both have colourful illustrations which make identifying a bird in your backyard or in a photograph you took on holidays simple and easy. Both also have information about the birds. Marcombe's guide just has a more comprehensive coverage so you are less likely to be disappointed that you cannot identify a particular bird if you get that great reference book instead.

The book is a written version of 4 meetings with John de Ruiter and a public (in a question/answers format).Everytime I meet him, I am always surprise at how much he does not compromise the truth for any reason. I know him now since about 8 years and I can say that the book is great but being in his presence is unexplainable. The community, here in Edmonton, keeps on growing so beautifully and expect even more for the years to come.To all sincere seeker !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Truth but who is talking?","review":"This book hits home again and again. The style is all John's own and that's why I think it goes so deep unlike much of the \\"Advaita Deluxe\\", spiritual muesli, which is on the non-dual bookshelves now days.While every sentence spoken by John is packed with meaning it is a pity that it not made clear where one dialogue ends with an inquirer and where another starts. If this had been indicated then it help give an additional context and meaning. For example, I know that 'Chapter 7' included an historical exchange with Dave Oshana who one year later became an enlightened teacher with his own unqique style. However, the same chapter merges a discussion with Oshana and another inquirer, and so it is not clear who is talking.Perhaps, the editors made this choice to not distract in any way from John's delivery but for some readers the removal of information lessens the chance to get the full picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the crumbliest flakiest chocolate...","review":"Okay, so I haven't read the book, but I did go and see him, and have studied a little bit of his life, and I guess I feel duty-bound to warn people away from this guy. John de Ruiter and his group are by far and away the flakiest thing I have ever seen. I'm amazed that anyone thinks anything of this guy. Is it a case of \\"you attract what you are\\"? Delusional students finding a delusional teacher? If anyone is going to put any stock in him, at least be informed and make sure you have all the info on his life, on his sexual affairs, and the way he treated his wife.

Upon opening it, I discovered that the unit is defective, due to a manufacturing problem. It cannot be properly zeroed due to a lack of parallelism of the jaws. As a result, a visable air-gap exists between the jaw surfaces and a reasonably accurate measurement can never be taken.I contacted General Tools about this product, thinking they would be interested in evaluating it in order to make improvements to their manufacturing process and produce a better product.

Then they suggested that it was probably a used and/or abused product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for metric measurements","review":"I bought this caliper for measuring bicycle seat posts, stems, etc. Not very exacting work. Well, forget it. It's only accurate to 1mm. The dial only measures in .01\\" or 1/64th\\", not mm. When the dial shows exactly 1 inch, the scale shows 25 mm, not 25.4mm. Measuring a marked 22.2mm stem, it shows 21.5mm. The only way to make this device work is to measure in inches and convert to mm.If you never measure anything metric, you might be ok, but even if you argue that the mm scale is provided as a convenience this level of accuracy falls short of any reasonable expectation."},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic is plastic","review":"I tried this in my woodworking shop.

I checked one using a 1\\" micrometer standard. I found the calipers were both off. One was off by .021 (21 thousandths) and the other was off by .007 (7 thousandths) when measuring an exact inch. I did not have a two inch standard available, but it stands to reason that at 2 inches they could be off by as much as 42 and 14 thousandths respectively.

I have no idea where all these parts are suppose to sit inside the case, and it was damaged so bad I called Max Tool. The lady told me someone would contact me within 7 days to give me a return number. Two weeks later still no call, so I called back. Then the guy that answered said it had been too long to replace the item and that I would have to PAY for a new case. I've already paid for one, why would I risk having to pay for another that might be the same way. As for the tools, they look cheaply made and have hydraulic oil all over them.

I like the long battery life, it is very easy on batteries, and access to the battery is simple. The display doesn't automatically time out and turn off, but that doesn't seem to be a problem.The caliper reads in millimeters (.1 mm) or inches (.001 in), it doesn't feature fractional inches like some of the newer ones. When powered on, it does zero itself, which may irritate some users.I have no complaints with consistency of zeroing and reading accuracy, and in spite of what some others have said, I like the feel of it.

Only problem is the zippers aren't of the best quality and jam frequently and aren't made to bear the stress of the amount of goods that can fit in this backpack. The overall design is mediocre at best and the straps are pretty uncomfortable when you're carrying anything of substance. Backpacks like the Kensington Contour have super comfortable form fitting straps but hold next to nothing aside from your laptop.

Her work dispels myths, leaves questions where they remain, and turns a mountain legend into living history.Highly recommended, especially for anyone interested in turn-of-the-century life in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

But if you enjoy stream of consciousness narration, if you've ever looked in a mirror and wondered if the person there is truly the person you have become, well then--stop for a moment--you're about to be enthralled. 'Silence in October' is filled with delicious drop-you-in-the-scene descriptions, isolated moments that pass before they register and others that stretch out and disappear into forever. If you've ever lost someone, if you've ever been lost, if you've ever wondered how you became the person you are, if you've ever made a mistake, if you've ever committed a sin, this book will wrap itself around you and most likely will never let you go.

We're talking yawnsville here: vampire (the hero of the story) who has been around for eons has grown weary of his immortal life, chances upon fair maiden and is irresistably drawn to her, finding the love of his life...his very, very, very, very, very long life, that is; and she, in turn, knows that he is destined to be the one true love of her life, too...even though she hasn't lived nearly as long as him. I am so SICK of that premise! Dress it up all you want with vampires and mystery plots, but it's still just your basic grocery store checkout lane romance novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian's done it again!","review":"There's something about Alan \\"Nick\\" Nichols, the protagonist in Brian Rouff's new sports novel \\"Money Shot,\\" that makes you laugh. But that's okay because he's laughing right along with you. In this fun and lively romp across the real mean streets (and basketball courts) of Las Vegas, the author launches one barrage after another of what is rapidly becoming quintessential Rouffian wit -- sometimes it's almost too much to handle, but I don't think Brian's gonna stop laying it on. And good for him. Place your bet on Money Shot -- reading it is almost as much fun as winning at the craps table in Vegas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's to middle age angst","review":"Alan Nichols is a guy just like me. Hell, he IS me! Brian Rouff has captured that special kick in the balls that life reserves for all middle class, middle aged, fair to middling guys who feel like they're doomed to play out the hand that life dealt them. But, he gives Alan a chance to get even.....and maybe, just maybe, make a BIG score. This book is smart, funny, and a perfect fit for its Vegas backdrop. I loved the characters in Alan's life, especially his wife, Pam ; daughter Amy and the unforgettable \\"coach\\", Angela.Hurry up and read this book before they make a movie out of it. I already have it cast in my middle aged, middle crazed mind.FUN, FUN, FUN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Las Vegas Expert","review":"No other fiction writer knows Las Vegas like Rouff... and I mean the \\"real Las Vegas,\\" not the network TV Las Vegas. Like Rouff's \\"Dice Angel,\\" \\"Money Shot\\" had me laughing out loud. If you like Las Vegas, sports or humor, READ THIS BOOK. Luckily for me, I like all three. I'm ready for Rouff's next novel. Is there one on the way?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Right on the Money\\"","review":"Once again, Mr. Rouff has captured the essence of Las Vegas from the viewpoint of a resident rather than the usual weekender haunting the casinos. \\"Money Shot\\" is lighthearted, but with an introspective quality that grabs the reader even as the laughs come tumbling from every other sentence. What a great read! As in his first book, Mr. Rouff's characters come alive and just stick with you - I certainly expect to meet them on the street the next time I'm in Vegas. Sports fans, gamblers, lovers - don't miss this one, it's a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun summer read","review":"I loved \\"Money Shot.\\" Brian Rouff gives everyman a chance for greatness, both in the glare of the television camera and the quieter places of the heart. With his signature style of lively prose and engaging character, Rouff writes a wonderfully entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure Shot!","review":"Rebeccasreads highly recommends MONEY SHOT as a funny, thought-provoking & delightfully spirited tale with enough bumps & lumps & cross-cultural comedy to keep you on the edge of your seat, cheering.After discovering he's got the winning bottle cap for the Bigg Fizz Million Dollar Challenge, Nick's got just three crazy weeks to get in shape. As he prepares, the rest of his safe life comes apart: he quits his job only to learn the ad agency has gone into bankruptcy. Now he's winging it on plastic money & a dream ... & the NCAA regional finals in Phoenix draws ever closer.After his first Las Vegas mystery, DICE ANGEL, Brian Rouff is becoming a writer who's got good stories to tell, with game & attitude!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Tape!","review":"This was the first Christian tape I ever picked out and bought with my own money. I was probably about nine years old. The first tape I ever owned (or co-owned with my younger brother) was Wayne Watson's \\"Man In The Middle\\". I really dug Carman's style when I was a kid. He was the coolest thing since sliced bread. I would rap every word to \\"I'm Saved\\". Now I guess I've outgrown his style of music and most of it seems more like novelty stuff. The lyrics are simplistic at best, but still fun, and at least they get straight to the point leaving no doubt that it's a Christian record. I'm glad I own a copy of it for memories if nothing else. I give it four stars for it's classic status in my collection, not necessarily for the quality of the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the right one","review":"Unfortunatly was not the right version that I thinking!I believe that was a double vinyl as complete concert in cd version,so I loose my money because this item have not a complete explanation.Very bad purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the concert I went to!","review":"In late 2006 I attended a terrific Ian Anderson concert in which he traded solos with a marvelously entertaining (and young and pretty) violinist. The concert featured a mixture of multiple genres, including Tull classics. The rock band and symphony blended quite nicely.I thought this would be the CD version of that concert, but it isn't.This CD is precisely what I was afraid the concert would be!!!Bland classical music with some nice Tull tunes that have simply been schmalzified...Anybody know where I can get the real thing?PS It's an import, so it's an extra expensive \\"not worth it\\"...."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAST ESSENTIAL ROCK CROSSOVER","review":"Rock bands teaming with orchestras: By now everyone from Metallica (on S&M) to The Moody Blues (all summer, every summer at mid-sized civic centers across the land) has given it a try, usually with less-than-inspiring results. So it would be easy enough to ignore Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson teaming up with the Neue Philharmonie Frankfurt, if it weren't for one thing: There's absolutely nothing novel about a flautist playing with an orchestra. Anderson admits as much in the album's surprisingly cranky liner notes. He also admits that past pairings haven't gone so well: \\"Having had the odd show when the High School Band of Dumbsquat College, Upper Delaware-on-the-lake would have done better, I relax and rejoice when we get a good and dedicated orchestra who will work hard to find that special something which brings it all alive for musicians and audience alike.\\" The relentlessly dull album, however, is likely to result in too much relaxing and not enough rejoicing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired. Major Disapointment","review":"I was really excited when I ordered this. I've been a fan of Tull since back in the day. I recently picked up two of Ian's other solo works- The Secret Language of Birds and Rupi's Dance. Both of those discs were outstanding! I thought this would be a sure bet. I guess I should have listened to the preview clips more closely. I really don't know what some folks are thinking with all of these 5 star reviews. The performance is plodding and uninspired. The sound quality is really mediocre way compressed with no dynamics at all. Usually for these symphonic projects they go all out on production. This sounds like a cheap car radio.If you own a Blu-ray player and would like to hear some of these pieces at their best then I would highly recomend \\"Jethro Tull Live In Montreaux\\". It is fantastic! Great performances, fantastic sound. These discs cannot hold a candle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice product to give as a gift or to use at home","review":"I bought one for my brother who lives abroad. He loves American football.

The product name should indicate that this isn't a regular Cabbage Patch Kid. The other dolls have names like \\"Cabbage Patch Baby\\" or other name to indicate that the \\"kid\\" doll isn't part of their regular full-sized line.Also, the facial features don't match the photo--so if you hate a certain expression in their doll line, then don't buy this product. You just never know what you'll wind up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for three chapters...","review":"This is the best grad quantum book I have read so far. The first three chapters (Fundamental Concepts, Quantum Dynamics, and Angular Momentum) of the book are wonderfully done. These chapters, I believe, were completed by Sakurai before his untimely passing. The rest of the book seems to lack Sakurai's clarity but it does an adequate job tackling this difficult subject. Whether the lack of clarity is due to the increasing difficulty of the subject matter or the fact Sakurai didn't write it is unclear to me. After going through the whole book I only disliked the presentation of chapters four and six (Symmetry and Identical particles). These chapters were less mathematical and were more theoretical and could have used Sakurai's magic touch. The book was a great resource for a grad quantum class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little read","review":"Tons of math, but well worth it. His advanced book is also amazing. If you really want to understand QM, this and Cohen's 2 volume set would work. Great read, although I also recommend Born's and Stirling's mini books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Pretending to be rigurous, this book doesn't even mention Hilbert Spaces, Riesz Lemma, The Spectral Theorem... all of which are key to the formalism of Quantum Mechanics. Many decades have passed since the serious development of the mathematical tools (non-existent by the time Dirac published his book) needed for QM was made.

Feral cats live with separate territories and it is against their nature to live in 'clans' which I think should've been called prides considered lion prides are the only group of cat that forms in the cat's genetic family. The books plot was too focused on Fireheart who was oddly the only one who could see through Tigerclaws 'oh so complicated' plots. This book is mostly read by a younger audience which is apropriate for the level literacy the author puts into the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Yogurtstar speaking....","review":"Hello this is Yogurtstar speaking and I just wanted to say: WOW!

(And no I'm not talking about the friendly Badger I'm talking about the first book in the new prophecy).

It was sad and at times hard to read but it was still a good page turner and I really liked it though at times it was hard to see my favorite characters in such bad situations. But that is perhaps the charm of the book. There is no skimping on the bad things that can happen in life, but somehow things always do work out in the end and perhaps I read this one faster than usual so I could get the characters to a better place in their lives.

So Tigerstar asks the new clan Bloodcaln to help fight,but Tigerstar dies in the process by getting ripped apart by the leader's dog nail reinforced claws.

I loved it and I hope they make it into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest of the Series","review":"Book 6 is best skipped. Why? Because it takes a very nice, somewhat believable universe, which is also very easy to get sucked into, and suddenly throws in elements which have absolutely no relevance to the reality of said universe.

HUGE disappointment! Giddens usual clear and positive voice is very much lacking in this recording and tired-sounding when she does sing. Most of the vocal work, particularly with the male voices, sounds sloppy and off-key. The overpowering banjo strumming is nerve jangling. The first four songs sound like one continuous, monotonous strum. Then back to irritating strumming on Black Annie,and on to underlying strumming--unimaginative--on Georgie Buck, which is relieved by occasional and intermittent fiddle and vocal. Then on to more strumming, again in same key with same rhythm and same tonal range (lack thereof). Repetitive strumming continues on Band 13. The final band, a poor execution of Sourwood Mountain, has non-remarkable harmonica along with the infernal strumming. I regret having ordered this disk. The C. Chocolate Drops should withdraw this disk. I hope they return to their far superior earlier work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A promising start for an unusual trio","review":"I think this is the debut CD for The Carolina Chocolate Drops, and it's a good start.

A memorable, slightly eccentric travel book in the Chatwin/ Dalrymple mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This was a great movie. no problems, looks great (digital) I'm glad some old movies are being restored to digital."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE DISC WOULDN'T PLAY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES A \\"FOREIGN CODE, PROBABLY ITALIAN\\"!","review":"I RATED THIS THE LOWEST BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND WHO REALLY WANTED TO SEE THE ORIGINAL MOVIE, BUT WHEN HE PUT IT INTO HIS PLAYER IT WOULD NOT OPEN OR PLAY!!!

It's a miss, save your effort if you are a film buff. Perhaps the best thing about it is that it planted the seeds for Brando to make One Eyed Jacks, one of the great Westerns in my opinion, in Mexico a few years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong region","review":"I returned this dvd to seller because it would not play.

It's passionate music with a Mexican theme, by one of the very best Hollywood composers, and one who had studied Mexican music with Silvestre Revueltas himself. A score from the period when composers believed in their work. Every North score I've heard was good; many were outstanding. This is one of his best. (I'm listening to it now.) Compare, by the way, Korngold's score of around 1940 for the film Juarez (if you can find it.) Not one of his finest, but worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taper Candles","review":"I didn't read closely I guess because I wanted a candle that did drip...making wine bottle art...and this is dripless. It's a great dripless taper. So hard to find tapers anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNDERATED","review":"This is a greatly underated film. It bombed at the box office when it was released. Undeservedly so, as it's a thought provoking premise bourne out by known facts. It's also prescient in the light of what's taken place since 2001, namely oil corporations and political power.The commentary's very amusing via the director and scriptwriter. No other extras, but it's very cheap.In short it's excellent entertainment and the 2 Oscar winners (rando and Scott)and infamous refusers are on top form - well worth the price alone. The picture of Brando on the front cover is nothing like what he looks like - he lokks an awful lot like Dick Cheney in the film (hmm, see what I mean about prescience)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see!","review":"The FormulaThis is an excellent movie that for some reason never made it big, likely due to its subject matter. The plot revolves around the idea that Nazi scientists discover a means to develop synthetic fuels and lubricants from coal. This of course becomes an issue of utmost importance to the big oil companies. Realizing that with the mass production of synthetic fuel they would no longer be able to control and maintain their colossal profits they set out to keep this \\"formula\\" secret - hidden until the appropiate time. This sets the stage for this movie. The acting is high caliber across the board. I highly recommend this movie - it is closer to the truth than most poeple will want to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies good but this is a DVD-R!","review":"This DVD release of The Formula from \\"VCI Entertainment\\" is a DVD-R, not a factory pressed DVD! The picture is also not as clear as a version I had previously rented from Netflix.I guess it's not a big deal since it's only 4.99 but you would think Amazon would mention somewhere that it's a DVD-R anybody could have pressed on their computer. If I would have known that, I would have just made a copy of the one I rented."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie for Today's World","review":"Even though this film was made 27 years ago, it applies to our oil & political situation today, as no other, and may even convince you of it's truth; how would we know? The opening of the film is perfect, totally putting the viewer in the picture. Richard Lynch is fabulous as the calculating Nazi officer and the dialogue is right on the mark. Too bad they didn't dwell just a tad more on the set-up, this film is so good, they could have fleshed things out and ran at 2 1/2 to 3 hours without any lapse of interest. Brando, of course, is wonderful as the oil company exec, and the film is loaded with classic character actors like the wonderful Wolfgang Preiss, and Beatrice Straight. Scott is intense, as always and Marthe Keller is spot-on. A fine music score and atmospheric cinematography complete the picture. My one caveat, some minor Hollywood politically correct nonsense about Scott's Asian partner, a total waste of time in an otherwise wonderful and highly thoughtful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate thriller!","review":"According the classic established patterns of the narrative line of the great Frederick Forsythe 's this suspenseful picture begins with just at the End of the WW2, when a German Officer is captured with important documents which originally would become a decisive deal to firm an armistice due the potent and extraordinary finding, that previously had been a successful discover; suddenly we go to 1980 in the middle of a simple murderer but on the road, the investigation will interweave with impressive consequences as a true spider 's web.A very brief but still engaging appearance of Marlon Brando, but George Scott leads the film in the ninety five per cent of the whole shots. Martha Keller is fabulous and John Gielguld is splendid too.An intriguing plot with a subject of beating actuality, despite of the quarter of century elapsed.Admirable camera work and fabulous landscapes. This film is the masterpiece of John Alvidsen"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book For Beginners","review":"As the title implies, this book contains a wealth of knowledge for the beginning angler. Topics include: choosing and purchasing the appropriate equipment, finding a good fishing spot, understanding how fish think and act, bait and lures, casting methods, and fish identification and preparation. Fishing can be overwhelming to the uninitiated, especially when it comes to the amazing array of rods, reels, and tackle available. This book should answer most, if not all, of your questions about fishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fishing Basics","review":"I read this book earlier this summer, shortly after finding out I would be spending a week in a vacation on a northern Wisconsin lake. Not having fished for over a decade and shortly heading to a vacation seemingly destined for a fishing focus, it seemed like the right time to brush up on my angling skills. The Complete Idiot's Guide to Fishing Basics provided a very helpful primer - and, not unimportantly, a quick and entertaining one. Covering equipment, basic skills, and basic strategy, this book allows one to quickly get out on the water and start making at least a rudimentary attempt at actual fishing. If you're like me, this book won't result in a miracle - no lunkers here - but it should lead to less wasted effort and even some success given good conditions (I reeled in a couple large mouth bass and more than a few panfish over my vacation weekend). Not for those who have a clue, but a nice intro for starters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Idiots Guide to Fishing Basics","review":"As a Senior who hasn't been fishing since I was a kid I found this book a great place to start, easy and understandable.

It opens with these wonderfully sweet letters, and it twists and turns into something completely unexpected. The love scenes in this book were extremely different..there was so much tension between the H/H..it was unbearably erotic and almost desperate when they came together.....I would have given this book 5 stars in a flash, but I feel that the relationship between Folie and Robert was pushed aside too many times to focus on other aspects of the plot..I felt that the book would have been better paced if about 50 pages were shaved off. Also...regarding Melinda...I would have liked for there to have been scenes between her and her \\"suitor\\".All in all, this was really a great read..if you like Laura Kinsale this book is very typical of her..it doesnt disappoint..and the epilogue couldnt be sweeter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I am a big fan of Laura Kinsale, but this book was very disappointing. The story wasn't that great and the love scenes weren't just beyond pornographic - they were degrading to the heroine. Save your money for a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing at best","review":"If you like a romance in which the hero is first sweet, then crazy, then cruel, then by all means read this book. Otherwise don't be fooled by the opening pages which seem to hold a lot of promise. The book is actually unrelentingly dark. At one point a character actually asks the hero why he never shows his affection for the heroine, and the only answer seems to be that the author wants to keep them apart until the very end. This makes for a very unsatisfactory read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laura Kinsale is THE best!","review":"I loved this story so much that I bought an extra copy, highlighted several parts that reminded me a lot of my husband and presented it to me in a romantic setting.

I found it intoxicating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start goes downhill fast","review":"This book began so interestingly and then became weird and contrived, that's the only way to put it.

I won't try a third Kinsale."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exquisitely beautiful beginning; a badly botched ending.","review":"Kinsale can do better than this. Read this book for the beautiful first half, but be prepared for an ending which goes awry.

It is both mystifying and frustrating to us Kinsale fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING BOOKS EVER READ.","review":"The book and the storyline started out great. The characters were perfect, as was the setting. Then it all went wrong. It's amazing to think that something like this was even published. The ending was vulgar and pointless. Did men really refer to women's private parts with modern day profanities back then?!She turned an absoulutely wonderful story into trash. It was my first Kinsale book and my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Kinsale book that I tried to read","review":"I really tried to read this book...really. I loved the first part of the book with the correspondance between Folie and Robert, but lost interest when he hid in his closet.I've read most of Flowers from the Storm, the only other Kinsale novel that I've read, and lost interest in that because the hero is *too* tortured. The same goes with this one. I don't want to read of a hero who hides in closets and who is going mad. I will give the author lots of credit for language and beautiful writing. However, I just can't abide all the sorrow. I want to read a romance that is romantic and happy most of the time, not so sad that it makes me, the reader, melancholy. I don't like to write bad reviews, but I just had to put my two cents in about this book. After Flowers from the Storm, I should have known better."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMEN......","review":"Well it starts out well enough, but it became a morman recrutment pamplet.

Say it aint so!!!","review":"Let me first say that I am a huge Orson Scott Card fan. The Ender Saga, Hart's Hope, Wyrms, and especially the Alvin Maker Saga are works of absolut magnificence. Genius. But then I bought this book. The stories have completely unoriginal, stock post-apocalyptic plots. The main theme seems to be that Mormons are the only people discriminated against, and will be the ones to rebuild society after it breaks down. Yeah, right. What was he thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I had known ...","review":"I loved the Ender saga. I loved the Alvin books. I absolutely love apocalyptic fiction. If only I had read the epilogue, in which OSC describes this novel as LDS-fiction. Latter Day Saints fiction, in my book no more read-worthy than Christian fiction. Unfortunately, I was 40 pages into the novel and getting disgusted by the Saint this, Brother that, Lord and baptism this, before I scanned ahead to see if this was just current-character characterization. Nope. This is a religious book, not a very good one at that, and I doubt I'll bother reading the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow, boring, implausible","review":"World War III has occurred and America blames it all on - who else - those pesky Mormons! Mormons?!!! The least Card could've done is offer an explanation why. It would have been a little more believable if the scapegoats were Jews or Muslims (although Card can't be held responsible for not incorporating the dynamics of a post 9/11 world back in the 80's when he wrote it).After introducing the scapegoats, Card proceeds to drag us through four or five different stories about Mormons fighting for survival in a hostile world.

Despite the description that Mill was supposed to be strong minded, I thought she never demonstrated this and especially at the end where she allowed herself to be bullied into agreeing with that bossy and self-important hero. Not very dignified, let alone romantic at all! J.L. has managed to maintain the dignity of her heroines in other books having a similar premise, such as \\"You Belong To Me\\" but \\"Joining\\" didn't allow this. Mill and Wulf only seemed to be obsessed with arguing about each other's habits in a flimsy attempt to substitute for plot. Lastly the word \\"joining\\" was used about every 5 pages for some reason. I found such repetition unnecessary and very annoying. If you must read this, get it from the library like I did. Not worth the $."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been a fan of Johanna Lindsey's work for over a decade, and I can honestly say: If stranded on a desert island, the only two books available were \\"Joining\\" and \\"The Art of Watching Grass Grow\\", I would be using the pages of \\"Joining\\" to kindle a fire while tending to the lawn I've grown on the sand!This was Ms. Lindsey's poorest effort to say the least.

Alas, there was none to be found.I would still recommend Lindsey's work, just skip this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joining","review":"To sum it up....Bland. I was kind of disappointed.

The story line was predictable and the characters are weak. The constant use of italics was very annoying. Just open up to any page and you will find italicized words on most pages.I felt that the main characters, Milisant and Wulfric, didn't get to know each other.

Where is the passion and tension that was found in \\"Keeper of the Heart\\" and \\"Man of my Dreams\\"? The last three Lindsey novels I have found did not come up to the standard of earlier works, but this novel has been the most disapointing - not worthy of hardcover. I have for a while turned to the authors Lisa Kleypas, Stephanie Laurens, Kat Martin and Nicole Jordan for the excitement that I once found in Johanna Lindsey's novels - but I will still keep hoping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have waited for the paperback version","review":"What happened? I must say, Joining was quite a disappointment! While I do applaud her attempt to break away from her usual fare, and all too familiar stories and characters, I was just plain bored with this book. It seemed that this book was composed of subplots and no real primary plot. Milisant and Wulfric were just uninspiring and bland. If we must wait a while for her next novel, we will wait. The way she is churning them out it's no wonder there was nothing special or interesting about Joining nor the last couple of books (the last Mallory novel was disappointing, too).

I was disappointed in the last two (All I Need is You); and the (The Present). I am not going to give up on her though.

It lacked passion until almost the very end. The dialogue was bland and the former tomboy's metamorphis in to a beautiful lady (considering how she supposedly lived all her life) was not very convincing. I think Johanna whipped this one out with very little thought or interest. I was disappointed. But, everyone gets to have a bomb every now and then.

Thank goodness I took this out of the library becuase it would have been a waste of money. The characters are whiny, and readers cannot possibly be expected to believe that these two held such silly childhood grudges for so long, and such frivolous garbage does not fit in with the time period.

I can't wait until Ms. Lindsey comes out with another book so that I can be so thoroughly engrossed in it as I was in Joining.

In the \\"Joining\\" Ms. Lindsey has fallen from her usual standards. She also is in the \\"authentic spelling\\" syndrome many good authors seem to be dabbling in. Using the \\"Olde English\\" names for characters only brings confusion. Yet, this is not the true flaw of this selection. Here the author uses the essence of a previous work of her's \\"Tender Rebel\\". With the Malory books Ms. Lindsey is an author without equal. But with the \\"Joining\\" she has given her readers a predictable plot, uninteresting characters and a book I could wait to finish. Every author has an off selection. I'm certain many readers will love this work, I however, didn't. I hope her next selection will be up to her previous excellence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible!","review":"This is the worst book of Lindsey's I've read.

If I could, I would have given it no stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment but still worth the read . . .","review":"Given the past success of Lindsey, I would not rate this book as one of her better novels. It seemed childish and lacking in detail (I still don't know what the heroine looked like - I don't think she was ever described). There wasn't much of a spark between the main characters and some major plot holes in how the heroine thinks and behaves, not to mention the weak plot conflict. Still, it is a Lindsey and the great dialogue, as usual, makes for a fast and somewhat interesting read -- it's worth the time, if not the money so check your library first. I hope that with this May publication, she is returning to a May/December publishing schedule. I'm looking forward to more Malory stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not the best from Johanna Lindsey!","review":"The book was slow, and more drawn out than the others that I have read by her.

It dragged on and on. I felt that I was short changed out of a true Lindsey novel.

However, this has little to do with Night except that it's a holocaust survivor. Regardless, I was willing to give it a try.I had to force myself to read through this book. It is incredibly dull, boring and several scenes were pointless. Night, though I had my issues with it, was very written, this however did not have a good flow of words. Everything seemed stale and drawn out.The length could have easily been cut in half and still retain all the information. As was with Night, when this book is finished you have taken nothing from it but a pointless sadness.

This album has not. It sounds like a collection of cheesy 1980's TV theme songs. Certainly, there is nothing wrong with the musicianship of the Canadian Brass. Unfortunately, the arrangements are extremely dated, filled with strange synthesizer sounds and silly techno beats. The Canadian Brass are at their best when they're playing great classical and jazz music like no other ensemble in the world. This offering feels rather pedestrian for their immense talents. Though there might be a hint of quirky charm for some, I'm hard pressed to recommend this album to anyone except the most die-hard of Canadian Brass fans who might want to complete their collection. Otherwise, listen to their other recordings first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Couple of laughs, but nothing like \\"The Freshman\\"","review":"The Milky Way is a Harold Lloyd 'talkie' (from Paramount). As a milkman, he inadvertently gets into a scrap with a boxer and promoter/manager, one evening, when Burleigh (Harold Lloyd) goes to meet his sister, after she gets off work.This movie may get a laugh or two from you, if you're an HL fan,but after that, there's just too much waiting/anticipating for Harold's next scene.Now, unlike the silent \\"The Freshman\\", produced eleven years earlier, The Milky Way pales terribly in comparison, in the area of quality 'belly laughs', and also as a 'quantity' movie, having too many scenes without the silent era star. The Milky Way provided me with only a couple, if any laughs. Still, a fun movie to watch with family, but try to go with the older stuff, if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.

Great electronics, Dero has a great voice, the music gives me the shivers every damn time. I try to expose the musical talents of European bands to the silly rap listening friends of mine, but when they hear GREAT MUSIC LIKE OOMPH, they dont know what to do because the've been listening to rap/R&B crap for too long.

It is great if you just have 30 minutes to burn some fat or a great warm up before an intense weight training set. Gloria Quinlan is adorable, has a pleasant voice to listen to and moves very naturally. This workout is a mix of basic latin dance steps and your basic aerobic moves (v-step). It's also what you make it, intensity can drive the workout. I also use Kathy Smith's latin workout and will sometimes do Kathy's right after Gloria's. There is no comparison, one is an apple the other is an orange. Kathy's tape has great content and is based more on the latin dance steps with lots of variations such as pivots and cross steps. Kathy's video has a much faster pace. Kathy does not seem to be quite as natural with latin moves and is painful to watch. I have to follow the female dancer next to Kathy. I would probably like to see Gloria leading Kathy's video."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fast and The Frustrated","review":"I wanted a 30 minute workout to combine with my 55 minute workouts I do three times a week, so I bought this tape. I thought this would do it. NO WAY!!!! I didn't break a sweat. The instuctor doesn't explain the moves at all. The moves are to fancy... to fast... and you have to concentrate extremely hard to even keep up. There are so many moves I couldn't keep up. The music was nice but the people in the video are annoying. Don't waste your money on this tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't keep up!","review":"This tape has been sitting at the bottom on my exercise bin for awhile. Every so often, I'll pull it out and try it again. But it moves WAY too fast, with little or no cueing, for anyone to follow what is going on, let alone break a sweat! Not a good workout..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed In This Crunch Video","review":"On the description on the back of the box it states that it is good for all levels. Very untrue. This video was very difficult to keep up with. I felt that the instructor did not give good direction or illustration. It would have been nice if she demonstrated a move before she actually did it.Plus, I thought that the camera angle's were not appropriate. Meaning, that when she was doing a new step the camera was focused on her face. You didn't actually SEE the new step until the 2nd or 3rd time she did it.I am very sorry I bought this one. I guess you win some an you lose some. I only wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this so called exercise video."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt so out of place!!! In my own living room!!!","review":"Starting with the pros. I love Crunch videos, the teachers are usually great, and entertaining. They are encouraging with out being wierd. I feel the same about this video, Gloria Quinlan was very engaging. However I am no latina dancing mama, and you need to be to keep up with her.All the women on the tape were amazing, they were bustin' moves this little white girl shreeks at the idea of. If you are a dancer, than I'm sure you will enjoy this tape. If you are not, you will enjoy watching them run circles around you!I am in shape and enjoy working out, but this one was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this video","review":"The choreography in this video was far too complicated. I have been doing aerobics for over five years and consider myself to be fairly coordinated, but the steps in this video were very complex even for experienced aerobicizers. The instructor seldom gives you the cues to when the foot pattern changes and more than half the time she is moving on to a new step while I'm still trying to figure out the current step.The camera angles didn't help either as those would change to show the instructor from the waist up just when you thought you had the complex foot maneuvers figured out. The instructor tells you to pay attention to the changes, but doesn't tell you what those are. VERY FRUSTRATING!Skip this video and try Kathy Smith's Latin workout instead. She is a much better instructor and gives you cues when you need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latin goes Lackluster","review":"I bought this tape a few years ago and do it every once in a while. It isnt high impact and i dont break much of a sweat. The moves are pretty easy to get down. I dot feel like i am working up a sweat though, and when the tape is over i dont feel at all winded. Its NOT a good fat blaster tape. And you can barely hear the music. Dont waste your $$$"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dancing Disappointment","review":"I bought this exercise video after deciding not to join the gym in favour of exercising at home. I've participated in many aerobics and dance classes and thought the latin dancing would make the workout fun. I'm sure it would have been great if I could have seen the instructors legs! The instructions were given quickly, and the camera was often focused on the instructors face rather than showing us the steps. It was impossible for me to follow along successfully on my first try, and after looking at the instructor smiling and waving her arms (because I could see nothing else) I gave up in disgust.This video was a waste of money and a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't I listen to the reviews???? Awful!","review":"I'm sorry, REALLY SORRY I didn't pay attention to the reviews when I bought this video. I thought I could manage to do the steps and I really wanted to like this tape. I've been doing aerobics and other forms of exercise several times a week for 10 years and I STILL cannot manage to learn these dance steps. I have other tapes with this instructor and she is GREAT, so I don't think it's totally her fault. I partially blame the camera crew who won't pan down long enough for anyone to learn the steps. This video is insane! Buy Cardio Salsa, Latin Grooves-- or even the Macarena workout instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moving to quickly, without the right que.","review":"I found this workout to be very frustrating. The instructor constantly tells you to pay attention throughout the tape, however she does not instruct you as to what the new moves are as she changes throughout the routine. The angles of the camera were not that great, therefore it was hard to follow all of the moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money!","review":"If you're looking for motivation, Crunch: Fat Blaster Goes Latin is not for you! As the review says, you can't hear the music over the annoying voices, and the music wasn't of latin origin. Gloria moves from step to step at such a fast pace, that even the most experienced dancer would have trouble staying with her. If you want to learn latin dance steps, this is an ideal video. It should fall under dance instruction instead of exercise/fitness. I felt it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Keep up","review":"If you have never taken a Latin Dance class this video is not for you I guess the instructer is under the usumption that you know what you were doing I did not even finish the video I was so confused and fustrated.

Try Kathy Smith's latin workout, it is a thousand times better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A FUN CHANGE OF PACE","review":"When I am stressed or want to add variety to my workouts, I do this tape. It's fun, spunky, and a change from the norm. Gloria is friendly, sincere, and an encouraging instructor. Sure, the chatter is loud and the transitions are a little choppy, but the class is energetic and similar to a live class. When I want \\"serious\\" exercise, I simply use The Firm (they actually use words like gastrocnemius [calf muscle] and \\"lie supine\\" with straight faces.) I think it's good to have videos that you use for the pure fun of it. As far as the \\"un-Latin\\" comments, I think Crunch's intent was to useLatin inspiration in traditional aerobics moves. I recommend his video to anyone who wants to spice up their workout and have a some fun. I think it is a good value for the price, and well worth a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it at any price","review":"This is the worst workout video I have ever seen. The choreography is way too complicated and the instructor doesn't help much. She tries to, I guess, by frequently saying \\"pay attention to the change\\", but it would be better if she actually told you what the change was going to be BEFORE she added another move. To make things worse, half the time the camera only shows her from the waist up, which is totally useless as you are trying to figure out what her feet are doing. I'm no Ginger Rogers, but I'm not a total klutz either - trying to follow the moves on this tape is just a waste of time. Even if you could follow, this is by no means a \\"Fat Blaster\\" workout. The intensity isn't high enough to even break a sweat. You could spend your time a lot better doing anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncoordinated? Don't bother.","review":"I really wanted to like this video - I was really excited about adding a little Latin flair to my workout. Let me just say that when my hubby and I previewed this video our mouths dropped open when we saw the fast pace of this video with NO instruction at all! How are you supposed to dive right in like that - especially when you're out of shape and NOT a dancer - and be expected to learn the moves? I tried this video - and had to rewind it just to get a good workout! I tried so hard the first time to get the moves, but found myself confused most of the time. The second time I just ended up (in certain parts of the video) doing my own thing just to get a sweat going. I love the instructor - I think she is so pretty and full of energy - but she needs to slow down and take the time to teach you the move! It was like they had all taken a triple dose of ritalin that day! There was no way I could keep up. So, I'm afraid that this video will be collecting dust at my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRUCH CARDIO SALSA AND BRAZILIAN WORKOUT ARE MUCH BETTER","review":"The instructor does way too much commenting after each step,\\"nice\\", \\"very nice\\", \\"good\\", \\"very nice.\\" It's annoying.

The instructor isn't good at instructing, and although the routine is essentially easy, I had a hard time following along because she was so unclear at what she wanted. She also says \\"pay attention\\" or \\"please pay attention\\" at least 20 times (really) and a handful of times she says it really sternly. Um, I didn't see anyone behind her messing up at all--why the constant reprimands? Not very inspiring. Also, the women working out with her are awfully annoying. I know that, especially in Crunch videos, the background people are terribly enthusiastic, but these were screeching and hollering from the very beginning and throughout, even when we're doing such exciting things as stepping back and forth.Don't buy this. I implore you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheerleader Wannabe's","review":"The reviews are really all over the place on this one. I am amazed at all the reviews that say this video is too difficult to follow. I found the moves to be very basic and did not work up too much of a sweat. It felt like it lasted about 15 minutes. However, I couldn't get past all of the women whooping and hollering through the entire video. I have dozens of videos including several latin ones and have never experienced that. It distracted me so much I could hardly concentrate on the instructor. If I heard, \\"Whoo, Whoo. Oh yeah,\\" one more time I was going to throw something at the TV. They acted like Cheerleaders at a junior high dance. I would never be able to show my face in public again if I was one of these dancers. This was so annoying that I don't know if I'll be able to do this video again, even though I thought the instructor did a good job and the choreography was interesting if not a challenging enough workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Diamond Earrings at an Excellent Price","review":"I ordered these earrings for my wife as a wedding present.

Season 1 was shot on location in NYC and was very authentic for that reason. the following seasons the show shot out of Los Angeles , and that along with poorly written and anti climactic story lines makes seasons 3 to 5 basically throwaways. Hopefully the studios will release the other essential 70's crime dramas. having already released 2 seasons of the drek that is Columbo, 70's crime drama fans deserve to have ( Mannix, Streets of San Fran, Cannon and the Mod Squad) on DVD format. bring it on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waited for years and finally it's there!","review":"Universal Home Video finally brought us season 1 of Kojak!Wanted to buy all season as this is still one of the best, if not THE best, show ever!

The battle for Earth can't go on much longer. One side is going to win. One side is going to lose. And the Animorphs fear they may be the losing side. The Yeerks have declared open warfare. They are herding thousands of people into subway trains at gunpoint. The trains travel through new tunnels direct to the Yeerk pool, where mass infestations are being performed. The Yeerks are building an army of controllers. The Animorphs know that soon the Yeerks will be far too powerful for them to have even a hope of defeating. So they are about to do the unthinkable. They are about to question everything they have always thought was right, and challenge the morals they have always fought for. They are going to attempt to blow up the Yeerk pool. And in the process, thousands of innocent people may die. This was one of the most powerful Animorphs books ever. If you're a fan of the series, you definitely will not want to miss this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaver quality","review":"I purchased the Panasonic ES8078 and it was received in good condition. I used the shaver four times and thought it was great. Then I tried cleaning it in what they call Turbo Mode and that was the end of a servicable unit. The shaver would not return to shave mode.You can not shave in turbo mode as it will cut your face as it vibrates in this mode. I have tried to get Panasonic to replace the unit but with no luck.The only service center Panasonic has is in Mcallen TX and they only have reconditioned units. I wanted a new exchange but I received a used unit. They said if I returned the used unit I would get a new one,but what did I get another used shaver. Panasonic assured me it was like new.I agreed to try it and this shaver will only run in Turbo Mode.So this too is a useless shaver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent shaver","review":"My first electric shaver, and I'm very impressed!

I had to go over and over the same areas and I still could not get a clean shave.While I was shaving I noticed the hair that was removed mostly fell onto my clothes and the sink. This is not good when you are on the way to work.I just wasn't happy at all. My old razor worked better with 2yr old blades in a fraction of the time.

I got interested in the Braun Pulseonic, but it was kinda pricy. I settled for the Vortex. I am not sure about the logic of a wet electric shaver, so I have not used that feature. As a dry shaver, however, I am very disappointed. It takes forever. I have to shave over a spot over and over again to get a clean shave. And I have an extremely hard time shaving under my chin. I wish I had stuck to Norelco.Second review: Just before I ditched this shaver, I decided to try wet shaving. I had never wet shaved with an electric shaver before. I was pleasently surprised. It gave a smooth, clean, close shave. Not ulike what you get with a regular razor, so I'm still not sure about the logic. But since I've already bought it, I guess I'll keep it. Incidentally, the manual cleaning is much faster, quieter, and effective. I clean it manually, then place it in the charger to dry only."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD SHAVER","review":"GOOD SHAVER IF YOU USE SHAVING GEL.

I've owned 3 Panasonic shavers over the past 10 years and I find them to be the best for tough beards like mine. I've tried Braun, Remington, and Wahl and have never been happy with their performance. This shaver works great if you know how to get the most out of it. I've learned over the years that there are three things that are important to getting a good shave with an electric razor : 1. Keep the shaver clean. This is made very easy with this shaver since it has a combo charging / cleaning base. 2. Wash and dry your face BEFORE shaving. This will make your whiskers stand up and easier to cut. 3. Press LIGHTLY on your face with the shaver on the first pass. If you still have any stubborn whiskers, then press harder until you have a clean shave. If you follow these steps, I'm sure you'll be as happy with this shaver as I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal at Best","review":"I purchased this product about a month ago and have been giving it the benefit of the doubt. Understanding that no electric shaver can competewith a blade razor I did adjust my expectations a bit. However there are several disadvantages to this razor.1)The charger/cleaner system is some what of a mess, it takes nearly three hours to clean the razor and the sound it makes doing these routines makes me think there is a buzz saw in the bathroom. Clearly something you cannot do at night.2) The adjustable head feature only has two settings and really does notglide across your face as well as a triple head norelco.3) I had an older Panasonic that I cold stand on end in my medicine cabinet to dry and save space. This razor you cannot stand on end, a minor thing to think of however we all know how small a medicine cabinet is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied ... surprisingly","review":"Purchased from Amazon at a good price and used for 4 months now. Razor works very well even better than my previous Braun especially on my neck. I used to have to touch-up with a straight blade but dont need to with the Panasonic.

It is best if you can purchase a year supply at one time. [...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissappointed","review":"How does it shave? So-so. No better than any cheap electric I have ever owned.I bought this because I lead a life with deadlines and the thought of not having to clean a razor appealled to me. So I bought one with a self-cleaning system.Forget it.I am not convinced the cleaning system has ever worked.I clean it manually, and take my word, a \\"back-and-forth\\" system is MUCH more difficult to clean manually than a rotary. There are places you just can't reach. There are also places that look like they'd break if I tried to clean them.Don't buy this for the self-cleaning system; it's useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shave feels good but does not look good","review":"This shaver gets you a great smooth shave. I have had it for 8 months now. I had a severe rash the first time I used it but settled down in a few days.Unlike blades it does not lift and cut the hairs, so as a result your face tends to have a slight shadow although it feels smooth. This may be more pronounced in men with dark facial hair.You can extend the life of the cartridge by unplugging the cleaning system after the cleaning cycle and also by removing the outer foil and rinsing the head in water for a few seconds before putting the shaver in for a clean. Cartridges cost $5 and each one lasts for about 6-8 weeks.June 2010. After 3 years my shaver has started to die. the battery does not hold charge even for a few minutes of shaving.

When I first turned it on (at 4:30am) my dog went crazy barking which woke the wife. It's has a high pitch buzzing which is much louder than the Norelco. It is smoother on the skin only because it doesn't cut very well (except for the crack of my mouth when I tried to get shave close). It's hard to maneuver around the mouth and under the nose and leaves a considerable amount of uncut hair, especially on the neck. I have no opinion on the self cleaning. I guess it works but so did pulling the head off my Norelco and running under the water in the sink.

I really looked forward to the release of McMillan and Wife and McCloud, especially since I hadn't seen many episodes since my childhood.The script-writing is awful. The plots are lousy. The jokes are lame, the arguing with the Chief forced, the love-making with Chris ridiculous! Not enough Terry Carter, either. The guest stars (except Julie Sommars) are given almost nothing to do!I am desperately waiting for December 6th and the release of season one of The Rockford Files.

Ella Raines is very impressive as a woman who risks all to prove her employer is innocent of the murder for which he has been convicted. Her assuming of false personas (which may even briefly fool the audience) make it surprising that her performance in this film is not better known. The purely visual sexual suggestiveness in the jazz joint scene with Elisha Cook is hot stuff, and you will be amazed that Hollywood could have gotten away with it in the Forties. The excellent photography (black & white, of course) captures that grim urban atmosphere perfectly. Anyone who tries to colorize this film should be punished! The climactic revelation is highly suspenseful, and the happy ending is quite atypical of such films. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"handsome madness","review":"this beautifully casted and directed movie was eye candy for the wardrobe, location, acting and vividness even if in b & w.ella & allan's wardrobe was amazing as themselves!!i am into vintage decor and clothing, the men also dressed so elegantly , as a man should be!!!merci beau coup!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great adaption from Woolrich","review":"Cornell Woolrich is the unsung hero of this and many other films. His little stories bashed out at a tremendous speed simply make great films. Hitchcock used Rear Window to create one of his best films. Other directors have used his stories to great effect. The recent Original Sin is the latest in a very long and distinguished list.With a great story line of a man sitting on death row while his friends race to find evidence of his innocence, Siodmak really produces the goods in this film. One sequence, in particular, the jazz jam session, is as close to a sex scene as film makers could go in those days. The scene alone puts this film in the master class. Great cinematography, some good acting and briliant direction add up to one of the best film noirs in circulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty realism in this film noir","review":"Rainy streets, late nights, and a shadowy, moody aura prevails in the film noir from the 1940s. If you enjoy this genre, this film will deliver for you. Ella Raines plays a secretary from Kansas in love with her boss, a New York civil engineer, played by Alan Curtis. When he is falsely accused of murdering his wife, she sets out with determination to clear his name.Throughout the film we are given hints as to who is the real murderer. We follow Raines as she reconstructs the activities of the fateful night and encounters characters who deny seeing a woman with Curtis. This witness could provide an alibi.The twists and turns of the plot will keep you interested, as Raines unravels the mystery to find a happy ending. Recommended as a fine example of film noir."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly bad translation","review":"I'm at a loss to understand why anyone would recommend this translation of the Bodhicharyavatara, versus any of the other choices available on the market.

The Fall of 2006 should allow Sony to release inexpensive SACD Surround Sound systems and this SACD should be your first purchase. The experience is simply spine tingling and ethereal.

I assume that the author never owned a Doxie and probably only encountered a few, that is why she assume they are not cuddly as Doxies can be reserved with new people but give them a few encounters and they will be all over you.All my Doxies are EXTREMELY affectionate like no other dogs really. I'm writing this with two on my lap right now! I can't even go to the bathroom on my own without the Doxies wanting to be with me at any cost!!

This, along with providing context for the subject matter at hand, will make the paper that much stronger not only in its logos, but in its ethos and pathos as well.Especially appealing are the templates provided in each chapter.

I see these name over and over. This seems to me dishonest and not a path followed by people truly looking for Light, but those who which to lead others to a particular path.

Pacino played Richard twice on stage (in 1973 and 1979) and both times he was blasted by the critics, for the simple and sufficient reason that he has no classical talent. His only other venture into Shakespeare was as Marc Antony in an early 80s production of Julius Caesar: here, too, the critics came to bury Al, not to praise him. But nothing can daunt a stubborn egomaniac. Well, almost nothing, for you'll note that this isn't a film version of Richard III, but rather a documentary about Pacino's \\"search\\" for the character. Interesting, that. Did Branagh make a film called \\"Looking for Henry V\\"? No, he made a film version of Henry V. Did Olivier make a film called \\"Looking for Othello\\"? No, he made a film version of Othello.

There was not much humor in the interaction between the characters, and they just failed to grab my attention and interest.

I was actually sorry when it ended.As a diver, one aspect struck me as odd. Here is basically a treasure hunting dive boat with all the latest high tech equipment and they haul their tanks to shore to be filled up?

No archaeologist would look for artifacts to sell unless they were highly unethical. Ms. Roberts should have talked to real archaeologists rather than people who rape and pillage the past. Plus, the wreckage was the property of the St. Kitts-Nevis government. Her heroine broke the law by removing the artifacts.Also, her discussion of St. Kitts shows her ignorance of the island.

This is it.Treasure hunting in the ocean while some guy with more money than he knows what to do with tries to steal the site your digging in, to take all the credit and the glory is just plain stupid. It's like a bad made for TV movie that you watch while your snowed in with no place to go. The main character is just so blah that's it's not until the last chapter that the book goes anywhere.

But when the men start acting like cavemen -- i.e. slinging the \\"little woman\\" over their shoulders and carrying her off because it's good for her and winning races because they are superior it just kills it for me. I just couldn't get past it. So what if he \\"loves\\" her and just has to make her see it. Strong-arm tactics just turn me off. Leave me cold.I couldn't go on. I couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"love of the sea","review":"The box was damaged...but it did not have anything to do with the story. It was a very good! I enjoyed the love of family and daring to do something that can include all.....and introduce new characters to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved the adventure in this book. Diving for treasure is exciting enough, but then Tate is paired up with Matthew and the tension begins to heat up. Roberts' characters are real and enjoyable, I loved Tate and Matthew, and adored Tate's parents. Matthew's uncle was a quite a character as well. This is a great read - one of my favorites by Nora Roberts."},{"rating":"2","title":"I fell in love with this book","review":"I have never before read a Roberts book but I totally became a fan after reading this book. The details of the treasure hunting, underwater explorations and the growing love between Matthew and Tate totally drew me in to the story. I stayed up all night to finish it and then was left wanting more! If you want a book that involves you completely then get this one, it is a wonderful ride full of love, danger and lots of fun treasure hunting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointed","review":"I'm a Nora Roberts fan and have been waiting eagerly for The Reef to be published. I read and re-read her books all the time. However, I must say that I was terribly disappointed with this piece of work. I could barely get through the 2nd chapter. What I love about Nora Roberts's books is the witty conversations between the characters as well as the in-depth build-up of the characters which makes you identify with them. All these were lacking in The Reef. The Templeton series was, in my view, her best. The Macgregor series was pretty good too. I really hope that the next book would be a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Worth It","review":"This book was really cool. Personally, every book written by Nora Roberts is worth reading. The Reef was no exception. Because Nora Roberts intertwines a real plot with the romance story, she has become one of my favorite authors. There is quite a bit of suspense in this story. I really loved how Taylor became so independent. And poor Matthew, he tried to do his best for Taylor and she ends up hating him. But not for long...*wink*wink*. This story is a quick read only because it is so very hard to put it down. I recommend this book for anyone who has a soft spot in their heart for romance. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the most memorable, but a good read.","review":"I found this book to be a fast read. The romance was wonderful (which is typical of Nora Roberts books). The story line is interesting. However, I think that this book, while good, is not her most memorable. Many times after reading a Nora Roberts book, I will wonder how it would have ended if I had been the main character, or what I would have done differently. I didn't do that with this book. I did enjoy it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect beach book!","review":"The Reef is a perfect summertime book. With Ms. Roberts' descriptive writing and meticulously researched material, you will feel like you are right there along side Tate and Matthew, hunting for historical shipwrecks and their treasure (albeit fictional). The tension and emotion between the two central characters were not as strong as Ms. Roberts' usual pairings although I did feel like the book consisted of an ensemble cast instead of a starring couple. I loved the book for its overall tone . . . peaceful, relaxing read, good old-fashioned intrigue and love. Bring this one to the beach, pool, or your backyard and escape to the islands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reef","review":"I loved this book! The romance between Matthew and Tate was ravishing. There is a lot of suspense in this story. Nora Roberts' work gets better and better. I found the story line gripping and effective. I recommend this to all of Ms. Roberts' fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Roberts Fan","review":"The Reef is definitely NOT her best, compared to Ms. Roberts earlier stories. I wonder if Ms. Roberts is not just doing a \\"edit and replace\\" with her latest books -- same characters, personalities, scenes, etc. I so much enjoyed her earlier books, such as Montana Sky, Villa, The Quinn Brothers Series (my personal favorite). My advise is to pick another book from this prolific author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adventure","review":"The Reef was an exciting adventure with all the mouthwatering touches of a good romance. Very enjoyable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hokey.","review":"This book was cheese, pure cheese. There was nothing in it that made me think, or made me want to keep reading except for the fact that I wanted to see how they were going to beat they bad guy (you knew it was going to happen, it's one of those books). As said before, it was a cookie cutter book. None of the characters seemed identifiable, and the plot was just a variation to the classic. Boo on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nora Roberts did not write this","review":"This was the most awful Nora Robert's book ever! Very boring. The characters unlikeable.

I highly recommend this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply outstanding","review":"This CD truly is a masterpiece; not only it encompasses some of the best works from Michael Cretu but its also extremely coherent. It has an extraordinary opening with two new songs whose purpose is to get you in the mood (something the Editor didn't seem to understand when he says they are not noteworthy). Starting the CD without them wouldn't have been fair to Gravity of Love (which is one of my favorites).TNT for the brain, Principles of Lust fading nicely into Sadeness, Mea Culpa, Morphing through time, they are just great.If you've heard a couple songs from Enigma and you liked them, you wont regret buying this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY POWERFUL STUFF !","review":"Every single song is a beauty, but I particularly like \\"turn around\\", \\"gravity of love\\", \\"silence must be heard\\", and \\"smell of desire\\". They did some digital fine tuning to all the songs to make them sound even better. Germany and Italy usually produce the best music in the world.......so RUN to buy this cd, pop it in your player and hit PLAY and let this...take you to another world !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A collection from previous CD's","review":"The only new song is \\"Turn Around\\", which I particularly enjoy. A couple other songs sound like parts have been remixed. Otherwise, these are all songs that I like, so I enjoyed the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Trip for the Casual Enigma Fan","review":"I see most fans of bands and singers as generally fitting into one of two categories: hardcore or casual.Hardcore fans seem to have been divided by this album. Some like the new twists on old favorites while others have condemned the changes. Still others think something's missing or something SHOULD be missing.Luckily I've avoided all that by being a casual fan of Enigma. For me, this album couldn't be better.All of my favorite songs are represented here, as well as one or two I had not heard before. The songs generally flow freely from one track to the other. It takes me on a wonderful emotional journey no matter how many times I listen to it. The album makes for wonderful background music as well.The bottom line is if you are a hardcore fan, try it. If you are a casual fan, buy it. You won't be disappointed by this great addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first exposure to Enigma will not be my last","review":"I ignored the numerous suggestions to buy Enigma til I found LSD in a used record store. The price was good and I figured I had nothing to lose. Wow--did I get a good deal! The CD is amazing, the music's varied and I get a good taste of what I should have bought long ago. I really can't add more to the excellent reviews already in place, but if you love world and fusion type music, you need to give this CD a try--and yes, it's worth full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literally Breath Taking !","review":"This is the first Enigma album I have ever bought, although I have known there music for a long while, the songs 'Sadness' & 'Return to Innocence' have entrigued me for many years.Some of the songs on this album are just out of this world, so relaxing. This compilation brings a blend of modern percussion, ancient ambient beats & chants which together forms their benchmark original out of this world sound, the sound of Enigma.The most addictive tracks for me are - 'Age of Loneliness', 'I Love You, I'll Kill You', 'Morphing Through Time'."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"L.S.D.\\" = The Greatest.","review":"This is a great and lengthy collection of some of the best of \\"Enigma\\". It's a wonderful mix of new age, electronica, and world music. 18 remastered tracks including the hits \\"Return To Innocence\\", \\"Sadness, Pt. 1\\", and \\"Gravity Of Love\\", plus the favorites \\"Shadows In Silence\\", \\"Age Of Loneliness\\", and \\"Cross Of Changes\\". I don't think anything major is missing, and the casual fan should be pleased with what's here. So if you're looking for a great experience, try \\"L.S.D.\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comp.","review":"While I tend to enjoy B-sides more than A's, this is still a great compilation of some of Enigma's best stuff.What else need be said? It's a must have album for anyone that enjoys electronic-based music."},{"rating":"2","title":"painful","review":"I have long been a fan of Michael Cretu's breakaway music format and it is always a breath of fresh of air. It's always good to listen to Enigma when hit with the intensity of today's music scene.The playlist is pretty much on par on what I would have expected from a compilation.BUT! Where is \\"The Child In Us\\" (from their juggernaut 3:LE ROI EST MORT, VIVE LE ROI! album)? It is by far Enigma's most inspirational song. This album missed the boat 18 times to put this masterpiece of recording on the album. To me, \\"The Child In Us\\" in a nutshell represents what the Enigma project aimed to do. It may sound like I'm finding some way to nitpick, but that song *has* to be on the album for it to be \\"Greatest Hits\\".My advice is to buy the digital download of this album and then buy the MP3 of \\"The Child In Us\\" And burn yourself a master CD of this compilation. Then it will truly be Enigma's \\"Greatest Hits\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the original CDs","review":"I am a big Enigma fan and love listening to their music.Didn't care for the feel of this CD. The ambiance created by listening straight through an Enigma CD was lost in this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"great compilation!!","review":"As a fan of ENIGMA I purchased this cd just recently,altough it isn't a new release.You can find on it most of their best titles of their earlier albums.My personal 'highlight' of this cd would be the number: 'tnt for the brain'.Overall a good compilation that's certainly worth the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DELICIOUS !","review":"Who can not be entranced by the heavy breathing of a sexy sounding Frenchwoman, the beats of the music resembling the rhthym of exquisite lovemaking, and the chanting of the monks, reminding one that all this lascivious pleasure is sinful? This music would seem to transport one back to a time when carnal desires were a NO NO, and yet, they were ultimately irresistible to humans. When one listens to this music, their primal instincts are always inevitably unleashed.This music, however, isn't only concerned with lust. It is also explores the meaning of love. Lust leads to love and sensuality, which then leads people to devote themselves to life. This CD will inspire you to lead life to the brim, perhaps even causing the cup to overflow. And what's wrong with that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best \\"greatest hits\\" collection I have heard!","review":"Well this cd was my introduction to Enigma and what an introduction! Theres hardly a weak song on the cd and all the songs flow so amazingly into one another. The best tracks on here in my opinion are: Turn Around,Gravity of Love,T.N.T. For The Brain,sadness,Mea Culpa and Return to innocense just to name a few. If you are new to Enigma this is a great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"Since I first heard the song Sadeness, I have been a fan of Enigma. I highly anticipated the release of this CD and it is everything I was hoping for and more. Although my favorite Enigma song (Silent Warrior) was not included, I would not have one song removed to replace it. I cannot choose a favorite track since each song is my favorite when it is playing. Even if you own all the Enigma CD's, listen to this disc as the new sequencing of the songs is excellent--they flow smoothly from one to the next, and it puts them in a new context. Turn off the light, take a deep breath and relax......and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LSD For The Brain !","review":"Cretu and company never cease to amaze ! Unstifled by trends, unresricted by gimmicks, Enigma like composer New Age guru Vangelis are in charge of their own musical artistry;There are no compromises. Enigma dares to go where other artists fear to tread. So what if they use samples or loops or too many synthesizers; At least Cretu knows how to use them and not abuse them. Wife Sandra is still in top form with her sensual beckoning voice of passion (or lust ?). This collection has much more to offer other than just atmospheric music. The rich sonic overlapping textures and deep percussion beats on some tracks make for a healthy mental trip that transcends all time and space. The musical or transitional segues that link all songs like one musical suite or landscape can only be described as true Enigma style..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enigma - Love Sensuality Devotion: The Greatest Hits ~ Enigma [Audio CD]","review":"Love it!!

On the other hand if you like their other album's then this might be to your liking. Personally i think its a waste of money.Lucky, i was going to spend even more on getting the 'Trilogy' album. Instead check out 'Delerium', there latest 2 efforts have been very good and they appeal to Enigma fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Thing","review":"Original in their art; fantastic music, modern, sensual, sexual, animalistic.

From there, all love grows. Brenda Shoshanna has written an engaging, thoughtful book. In it, she illustrates the ways in which we thwart our opportunities to know this inner source, and the ways in which we can let go of the desire and proclivity to do so. In letting go, beauty and love become self-evident - waking from a dream. Shoshanna's book is brilliant not only in demystifying Zen practice, but in applying it in real terms to relationships of all kinds. This is not a book to be read in one shot on a transatlantic flight. It is more a book to be digested thoroughly, chapter by chapter, in one's own time.

A hero fighting overwhelming odds for some greater good, or a foolhardy commander knowingly leading his men to inevitable destruction. The movie I believe gave him fair credit, it portrayed him as neither. Gary Cole, who played Custer, was excellent in showing the various sides of Custer ranging from brashness early on, to mild indecision when it came to the actual attack on the Sioux village. The movie also covers Major Reno's charge along with Captain Benteens activities. The Indian side is also told in the movie.

The lip of both pans seems almost sharp, I would prefer the edges to be rounded smooth.The Ugly: These pans can stain and then become difficult to clean. Boiling liquid in the pan leaves a thick ring around the inside at the water level. I think it was just our hard water leaving a mineral film on the pans after boiling.

This pan came out on top. Wanted to test before splurging on the set. The handle is so much more comfortable than the all clad pan and obviously much less expensive. Will see how they wear - but so far, so good. I performed a boiling test and water boiled faster with this pan than with the similar All Clad. Though it's nice to see the food through the lid of the Calphalon pan, I am a little uncomfortable with a glass lid, and the shape of the Calphalon lid creates water pooling when the lid is lifted, which then spills onto the stove top or into the food. But, I like all three products for different reasons, just decided to go for the Cuisinart based on price, looks, and so far cleans up great.

After 5 years of everyday use it has shiny interior and exterior surfaces. It does not show any signs of wear. I was so happy with it - I bought another one.2 quarts made in China which I bought in 2007. I did not pay attention to where it was manufactured. I thought the company should keep the same quality no matter where it builds its products. This saucepan already discolored and can not be cleaned.

The author provides a lot of \\"history\\" in this travel guide but what is provided is often downright dishonest. One particularly galling example is when Stedman describes how Israel used the \\"excuse\\" of Egypt's blocking the Straits of Tiran to Israeli vessels, to attack Arab countries, including Jordan, in 1967. Putting aside the question of whether Egypt's hostile action was an act of war, it is a well-established fact that Israel pleaded with Jordan to stay out of the fighting, and it was only when Jordan began shelling West Jerusalem that Israel responded on the Jordanian front. So Israel definitely did not attack Jordan--it was first attacked by Jordan.Well, this is one example of many where facts are just plain put aside to discredit and delegitimize Israel.

The first replacement was worst - couldn' hear anyone and mic didn't work. I called them again they sent yet another one. Now this 3rd one finally worked as it should, until this time about 4-6 months after getting the good replacement again the mic is dead. No one can hear me again on any PS2 game online. Buyer beware.

The only problem I really have, and this is a biggie to many, is that it lacks grappling stuff (otherwise there would be 5 stars). But none the less, it will help everyone at least on a stand up level. Someone above said there aren't enough pictures, but that is because you don't need them. This isn't much of a how to punch or do other moves book, it is more of a book of drills to increase your attributes and does it well with words. This book can especially benefit instructors who are looking for more ways to help prepare students for tournaments, or even just keep students motivated with variety.

I haven't seen the film. I just came across this CD at the library, and was intrigued to see what two such great artists could produce together. It is not worth listening to.

There is too much good music out there to bother with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystals finest work","review":"This is a five star CD . . .you should buy it.For me . . this is all about Crystal Gayle and that is why I bought it.You will hear some of her best work ever on this and well worth the price.I can barely get hip on Tom Waits slurred attempts at singing and at times you wish he would just go away.He is a master musician however and this is a very good release.Perhaps for the more discriminating,sophisticated conosur of the arts,this is not punk,hip hop or anything popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful earrings","review":"I have been so happy with the jewelry pieces I have gotten from the Amazon.com Collection and these earrings are no exception.

This was a treat for my eyes and ears.The visual universe of Brimstone Butterfly is every bit as edgy as the music.From the feministic car bashing Quite Simple to the anti war photo doc Don't Stop Crying, from the perverse slaughter of a snake in Gimme to the weird cartoon of male thoughts in Upon the Wall.This is probably the funniest/strangest/most refreshing collection of music videos you will ever see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hihgest value¡¡","review":"Just read the previous review: it's exactly as it is.Don't miss this one.

I have a lot of love for this show, so it's awesome to be able to have the first two seasons, which are admittedly dated but always entertaining. My only gripe is that the video and audio quality is pretty abysmal. My understanding is that during the 80s, sitcoms were shot on really cheap film stock because nobody knew that 20 years later nerds would want those same shows available to watch on demand. There's really nothing to the DVDs other than the show itself, but it's a good show and worth watching.

Well, time has moved on but this show hasn't;it is still firmly rooted in the eighties - the 1880s! There's no easy way to put it - it's awful! Better stick to comedy that will stand the test of time like The Honeymooners, Wings, Cheers (the Kirsty Ally years especially), Seinfeld (barring the final season which was a stinker!), Arrested Development (the first two seconds yes; third season reaks) and Benson.

It is still my favorite sitcom of all time. I haven't seen anything funnier!

It's hard to get back to sleep after laughing that hard.My favorite episode is when they try to fix Jennifer's shower. To this day, I still say the line, \\"That spackle must be amazing stuff!\\" I've since had my own self-improvement nightmares -- though none were nearly as funny.Bronson Pinchot is amazing in this show. I got the opportunity to see him in Stones In His Pockets.

Then it occurred to me, Larry Appleton, age 23, going on 33, with a mane of curly locks that would be the envy of Frasier Crane, must be a virgin or even worse, a semi-virgin after a failed attempt to seal the deed. My backstory for Balki is perhaps a little more unsavory-- his immigration/deportation necessary due to having his way with most of the women on Mypos as evidenced by his uncontrolled reactions to beautiful women in season one.These two seasons were much better than expected. I would suggest looking up their production code and watching in that order instead of the order on the disks for a more pleasurable (not for Larry though) viewing experience. I hope the rest of the series is released!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny","review":"This tv show is hilarious, especially for Bronson Pinchot. He plays Balki who comes to Chicago from a tiny mediterranean island and the fun is about the shock of cultures and different ways of living.

But the fun of the show makes it worth it in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Clean Fun","review":"Laughing out laugh funny clean fun for the whole family.

You can't find good, clean comedy like this on TV anymore. Nowdays they think it has to be laced with bad language and sex to be a hit show. I hope they release all of the episodes on DVD. I will buy them all. I don't know why it was ever cancelled, it was just as funny in the end as it was in the beginning. No, Mark linn-baker wasn't that funny in the short-lived TWINS series, but it's understandable considering the writers it had and the supporting actors. Wouldn't it be great to get these two together again, at least for one re-union episode? I bet they still could make everybody laugh, that is, if the writers were as good as they had before.

Twice it has suffered a paper jam in which the paper was inaccessible inside the printer.

Therefore I returned it to Canon and received a refurbished replacement, which also jammed. I have now received a second replacement (also refurbished) but have limited its use mostly to large photo prints. Most text I print on a much less expensive printer with less expensive ink.

Then you'll love the iP6700D! This printer seldom does anything for me without fifteen minutes of fiddling and cajoling. It's not that I do complicated things with it, or that using it is particularly complicated. It simply does not work most of the time. For example, the bluetooth won't put out a signal until I turn it off and on several times. Or the paper tray thinks it's empty when it's got half a ream sitting in it. Or it thinks one color of ink is empty when it isn't. Ink runs out quickly, also, and is extortionately priced; but that's pretty standard for a printer. Mainly, this printer is just TRASH and DOES NOT WORK RELIABLY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great printer!","review":"This photo printer is fast and makes excellent quality prints. However, the prints tend to be too red with the default settings, which is annoying. If you switch off any enhancement \\"features\\" in the printing preferences and allow your photo processing software to do the colour management, the colour is better. For perfect colour (with a calibrated monitor), use Canon paper and select the proper printing profile.Bottom line, this is a great printer for the price.

They sent me a return tag and switched me out to a amazing HP printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, Fine and Fair","review":"First, this printer is fast. Considering the quality of the prints, it really cranks them out in a hurry.Second, it's very fine resolution. The quality for such an inexpensive printer is far better than expected. It rivals the very expensive photo printers.Third, the price is more than fair. Considering it does borderless printing and produces archival prints, you would expect it to cost four or five times as much.The only negative is the printer interface. It's not as intuitive as it should be. It takes some experimentation to figure out how to set all the parameters to get exactly what you want.

I don't use the card reader or editing screen, but even then it is still a bargain. Plus the card readers can be used as an external reader for your PC. Color is excellent (as with all Canons in my experience) and prints are sharp and clear.As others have pointed out, not the best for black text (not as good as my previous Canon, the i960). A little rough around the edges. I'd say it was a better photo printer than a general office printer.This printer is connected to a PC. I would have liked to be able to print on the network from my Mac, but as far as I know, Canon does not support that (it does support direct printing from the Mac and network printing from a PC)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Photo Printer","review":"I did my homework before I bought this printer.. all I can say is.. wow...

I'm printing of HP glossy paper from a cannon 8MP camera.. Everything I have printed out I have put in a frame and hung on the wall.. I would highly recomend this printer to anyone.. Print time is slow.. but worth the wait.. The lcd is not the best.. but if you know what photos you want to print it works great for that.. also has a crop and zoom feature that has come in handy on a few pictures...

I use Macintosh computers and Canon printers work seamlessly with Macs.Color is great. Despite some things I've read, I've found the text printing very good to excellent.

I like the book because I know what he's talking about, but if I was new to SQL, this book would frustrates me. In many of his examples, he starts with what would not work then show what would work.

By the way, I looked at several other ballet blurays for comparison and found none of them to be anywhere near as annoying as this.

Read the book and find out the truth about the Taxxons!I think that this is one of the best Animorphs. I was really impressed about how Applegate thought of how to finally beat the Yeerks. One bad thing though, is that Jake's character changed without a total explanation.

There have been patches released for the game but even they don't fix all the bugs, and finding the patches isn't easy either since the game came out under the Microprose label, which was bought by Hasbro Interactive which is now Infogrames.It is nice though in that you can play with lots of Magic cards you'd probably never be able to find and/or afford in real life.

Unfortunately, only five of the 28 articles in this book deal with what one might consider the \\"asia\\" of \\"Eurasia,\\" four of which are in English. For those interested in the Asiatic side, an article by Richard S. Davis entitled \\"The Implications of Improved Chronological Determinations for the Soviet Central Asian Paleolithic\\" is worthwhile reading.

No book of historic Florida restaurants would have any validity without the inclusion of The Columbia, Florida's oldest restaraunt. The Snapper Alicante is delicious. And everyone should try the Nicholson Farmhouse Restaraunt recipe for boiled peanuts for a taste of the old south that should not be missed. Many of the recipes are based around fish and vegetables that are particularly plentiful in Florida such as snapper, grouper and okra.

I don't have the space that it requires and couldn't do the weight workout at the end because I don't have the \\"Reebok Step\\" and you need a long step to lie down on.

I am soo surprised at the great reviews on this one, but I guess to each his own. I thought she had lost her mind doing the slide into a one armed push up! It's not that it was too hard, but it was uncomfortable and she called the moves way to quickly for any fitness level.

This album, one of three she recorded for the Prelude label, contains the majority of her UK hit singles. The production on this album is stunning as is Redd's deep, rich voice. The biggest hit, \\"Never Give You Up\\" is a dancefloor monster, a once heard/never forgotten experience. Redd was equally adept at ballads, as \\"Takin' A Chance On Love\\" will demonstrate.

What's telling is that this would appear to be a sign that the subject, and by extension men's perspectives, seems not to be treated with any where close to the same level of seriousness or respect as women's studies.

Bullet is a 1996 crime drama film directed by Julien Temple and starring Mickey Rourke, Tupac Shakur, John Enos III, Ted Levine,Adrien Brody and Donnie Wahlberg. The screenplay was written by Rourke and Bruce Rubenstein. The film was released a month after Shakur's murder.Mickey Rourke was also the music supervisor of the film. It had limited distribution in theatres in US and was shot in New York with a significant portion in Brooklyn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Mickey's best work","review":"I was surprised to see the high ratings that this film received from a lot of the viewers. This film is nowhere near the work that Rourke has been, or is, capable of. He's always interesting, but the character doesn't give him the opportunities that films like Angel Heart, Barfly, and Johnny Handsome, and Homeboy did. I think he wrote the screenplay as well under the name Sir Eddie Cook, but I may be mistaken. I can't wait to see Rourke in another role worthy of his talents. I'm looking forward to his work in the new Sean Penn film \\"The Pledge\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow..","review":"Well first off, i must correct Amazon's Plot Synopsis...Butch does not Snort coke....he's just an H Junkie.

Tupac's role isn't as prominent as i expected..but Mickey Rourke does an excellent job of carrying the movie. Unless you're offended by Violence, Drugs, and lots of F-Bombs, i'de definitely recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"Bullet is one of several extremely entertaining Mickey movies, about a 35 year old jewish convict named butch (a.k.a. Bullet) who threw away his talent (Baseball) on drugs and crime. the movie focuses on 2 things, one: bullets self destructive behavior and lost will to live. and two: his rivalry with a nieghborhood druglord named tank (a little overacted by tupac)who bullet stabbed in the eye while they were in prision. bullet and tank share an equal amount of respect and hatred towards each other and both get what eventually comes to those who live by the sword.I personally enjoy most of mickey's earlier work, and this is no acception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't We All Just Coexist?: Or Are We A Bit Preoccupied?","review":"....a fine film, but it could've been much, much better if Tupac and Rourke were allowed some 'over the top-ness' in their badassnesses. I mean, with the two appearing in one movie, you would have thought there would be much more acting pyrotechnics, and grisly drama and street posing between the two...if you know what I mean. I think Rourke was too restrained and 2pac came on the set long enough to do his lines and go--to continue Thug Lifing? There are moments in the film that are pure brilliance, however, such as the depiction of various drug induced hazes and the schizo brother's observations and all. Most of the funniest lines in the movie is from the near psycho Levine. Overall, Julien Temple and his collaborators have done a good job. It is a fine film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Film","review":"If you watch this movie because your a wanna be gangsta and you think it will be cool becase 2 Pac is in it you will be disappointed.

This one was good, but it had a few scenes that felt like they were rushed and thrown together. The acting was good though and Rourke's character is very complex and intriguing. My favorite scenes are when he is swinging his bat or hitting the boardwalks, remembering who he once was and what he could have been before the drugs and prison took everything from him. You really feel this guy's pain of a life wasted. Tupac also did a fine job and the older brother did a real good job playing the loony Vietnam vet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Big Mickey Rourke fan here but this movie was horrible.

I sunk my teeth into this film because it moved me. I felt for the people in the story, and for the people around them. It felt so real to watch Mickey act the way he did. He convinced me that his character was a good person, and that he knew what it was like to have been there. For those of you who want to be mentally stimulated, here's an awesome film about family, loss, and learning. IT's also a good way to absorb some action, and have a few awkward laughs along the way!

One asks oneself the question why somebody would need to make all these suspect claims if this book was really what it has been made out to be, namely a work of history.It is however a very good read.

This is a must buy for all RPG gamers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patience","review":"You'll need a lot if your going to make a serious adventure. You have a simpler concept to use, since it is mapped out for you in text windows. The game itself is simple too annoying to play. After seven hours, I completed one half-finished village. Imagine how long for the whole game. Plus you need to use the playstation controller to write out anything that your characters will say. Scripted events are near impossible to make, bug testing is not fun, and you will start to go insane at the point of 20 hours.Whenever you hear someone say \\"I Could Make A Better Game Than That!\\" shove this game in their face. It ought to put him (or her) in their place. Only recommended for the extremely super patient."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE COOLEST GAME EVER!!!","review":"This is probably the best creation game ever made. Very confusing, though. People say this is not for kids, but I figured this out when I was eleven. The worst part is setting events, like if you talk to someone and they give you an item. You don't want them to give you the item again, so how do you cancel that out? It took me weeks to figure out, and I accidentally deleted my game! But you can learn this game by starting out small, say two bosses. But this is SUCH A GREAT GAME!!! Can be very frustrating, because you can very easily delete your whole game. Also the SWITCH technique is so incredibly confusing it makes you get a headache. But if you can get someone to play you're game, that is the coolest thing. I have a series of games now called END OF THE WORLD. You should get this game at all costs if you like any RPG."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the most boring time consuming game ever","review":"When I first saw this game and read the reviews I admit I was psyched.

It is still custamizable, but, for example, there are only 68 songs you can chose from. Also get ready to be tired of typing a lot on one of those screens with a cursor moving to from letter to letter. It requires a small amount of knowledge and understanding of variables to do anything right. Taking upto more than than 15 blocks (if you have a larger memory card, which you must if you want to make an anywhere long enough RPG) it does not deserve a very good scrore except for that I liked the battle system and the effort. Next time though it should be more customizable."},{"rating":"1","title":"not williams' best","review":"having been a big fan for a long time (and still is), this was a bit of a disappointment.

For example, the scene where he had to use slow-motion effects to get the joke across. this review is based on comparison with his previous 2 releases: live on broadway, robin at the met.

He needs to go back to the kind of material he used in 2002 because that is what has made him one of the best comedians ever.

Robin's raw wit and energy are as fast and furious as they've always been, and he covers a broad range of current topics. The language and subject matter are a little cruder than his HBO-sponsored tour 7-8 years ago, but as long as you are not offended by his brand of humor you will not have any issues.I can't believe he's pushing 60 and still going this strong on stage, especially after coming off of open hear surgery.

His use of the F word is not inherently funny, but he seems to think that he can use it instead of real content to get a laugh. Seeing him stride around the stage sucking on water bottles as if driven by way to many shots of expresso made me just a little sad for him. I hope he stays healthy.

Very good suction-- if there is any dirt in your carpet or even under it (ever pulled up your carpet?) it will find it. I am amazed at the volume of stuff that shows up in the can and on the filter after each use.Speaking of volume of stuff though... the top filter clogs very fast if things are dirty. In an old apartment, where the carpets weren't too clean when I moved in, I would have to change the filter twice to finish the floors (luckily it comes with two). Filters are easy to clean; just rinse them out (they can go in the dishwasher too).Summary: Works great; super power. Bit of a pain to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at any cost!","review":"We bought this vacuum based on Consumer Affairs report, and were totally disappointed. Not only is it useless on bare floors, it leaves black scuff marks from the wheels.

The canister isn't small in comparison to other vacs, this one just sucks more up. Also, one of the major complaints I keep seeing from others is the weight. Weight is one of the few things you know for sure about a vacuum before you buy it. If someone wants a lightweight vacuum, they shouldn't have bought this one. I don't mind the weight, I look at it as getting a little extra excersice, which I can certainly use. My only problem so far is that my kids keep taking the duster and want to sword fight with it, but I can't blame Eureka for that.

The attachements are cumbersome and the hose is too short. The dust wand attachment is a gimmick. This vacuum had good power at first, but that declined very quickly. I suspect many of the 5-star reviews on here were written right after the vacuum was purchased.

However, it was so cumbersome to use that the great suction didn't really matter to me. Because so many parts (like the handle, the dust attachment) are attached after you get the vacuum, they are constantly falling off, which makes it very difficult to use. Added to that, because the vacuum is heavy and there is so much suction it's difficult to use around tables and the edges of the room. And the attachments are basically useless.So if you want a vacuum that will do a fabulous job for the center of your room, or for a room that doesn't have any furniture in it, this is the perfect vacuum. If not, then it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM","review":"This is a terrible design for a vacuum, unless you do not generate any kind of dust, etc. It the bagless cup holds nothing and you are constantly emptying it.

It was heavy and awkward and didn't fit well between tables, etc. The duster and it's holder did not stay in place and was constantly swaying when I moved the machine. The duster also would not stay snapped in the holder. The attachment hose was always coming out of its holder so the vacuum would not suck properly. This vacuum has two sections on the on/off switch. The first is for bare floors and the second for carpets. The bare floors did not suck anything off my floors. It only shot the dirt out behind the vacuum hitting my legs.I was very excited when I first saw the commercial but after two cleanings, I got tired of sweeping my bare floors with a broom and then using the suction tool to pick-up the dirt.I promptly returned this vacuum and gave in and purchased a Dyson.

After she went to work, I vaccuumed my office with it, only to find out that the roller brushes didn't work. I tried and tried and tried to get them working, even succumbing to dismantling the cleaner to see if the belt slipped off.

The questions are, in my opinion, quite difficult, and that was only the middle level! As I have not acquired the courage to try the hardest level, I cannot speak for it. The questions are fun and come from all areas of Disneyana-movies, music, television, theme parks and more. The game pieces used to move around the game board consist of your choice of Mickey, Minnie, Donald or Goofy. If you wait too long between spinning the dial for your categories, the game piece you have chosen will tap their foot, check their watch, wave their hands, etc. The graphics on this game are quite colorful and lots of fun. Once again, the geniuses at Disney have issued a great, fun product. I highly recommend it, but some questions may be too difficult for kids under 10 or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I ordered","review":"This shirt is exactly what I thought it would be when I ordered it.

Then we tried it, still looked pretty good. She took it to school and had a great time. The bad thing is that we tried this 3 times. I took the camera to her soccer game thinking that maybe it was something she was doing. No such luck! The camera will not store pictures for very long, not even long enough to drive home. The software is terrible, no Bratz content what-so-ever. So much for the scrap booking idea! Don't buy it, and if you ever find a good kids 1st camera please rate it so I can get one.

My daughter would take some photos which of course drain the battery, and then by the time we got home to try and upload them to our PC (maybe a half hour after the last photo), the camera battery would go dead and the photos were gone. Spend $99 or so and get something functional - and with a flash. Lacking a flash makes this camera strictly for outside use even if it did hold a battery charge long enouh to be used.The included software worked fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fiction book that teaches science/nature","review":"Very well written book that involves a fictional story about a baby chipmunk and his mother; but incorporates many important facts about nature and wildlife.

Just listen to \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" which is a continuous Ravel like repeating rhythmic figure on the snare drum (mostly) but with cross rhythms by Marcus.

The drum figure reminds me of the snare drumming in \\"Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover\\" by Simon and Garfunkel -- very precise all the way through. I couldn't hear any mistakes -- how do they do that?

My husband and I have as much fun as the children when we play. My son, who is an early reader, could play this at an earlier age than that recommended on the box. When only three of us want to play, we use a stuffed animal for the fourth player; the children think it's a riot to see the answers the animal \\"gives.\\" (We select a card from the animal's five choices without looking at it, and the children think it's so funny when, for example, the animal chooses \\"cotton candy\\" as something that is scary. This game is one of those games that is both educational and REALLY fun to play. I HIGHLY recommend that you buy this game. We have all three versions!

The interpretation however lacks spirit. It is cold, it has no soul, it's not sexy. The balance in this studio recording is strange and sounds unnatural. Smooth violins, but the other instruments are distant (flute, cembalo). A record that you would give to your neighbour who just started to play the trumpet. That should shut him up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good, but only marginal for a profenssional","review":"Wynton playes very well. I have to admit that he is a very good player, but it doesnt compare with maurice andre. The feel is cold as stone. Wynton doest have the expertise on piccolo that he has on the Bflat trumpet, and it shows on this recording. I may suggest that if you are looking for a great cd of these songs you should check out Maurice Andre. rumpet masterpeices is a great example but there are many others. As a player myself I can confidently state that Maurice is without a doubt the best Trumpet player alive today, definitely one o the top 5 of the century. No one compares. I i have heard student players play these songs just as well or better in some cases than wynton. So if you want THE recording of classic Baroque trumpet, look at Maurice Andre."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Classical Trumpet CD","review":"While I mean no disrespect to Mr. Meuller, his 1 star rating for the sublime performance by Marsalis and company here is quite frankly an insult to such a fine effort. Wynton Marsalis is without a doubt the best trumpet player on the face of this planet, and that is not going to change any time soon. Quite frankly, this debut classical recording by Marsalis is also his best (and Grammy Award winning to boot). I don't begrudge Mr. Meuller for thinking another player or performance better, but to say that *many* trumpet *students* play these works better is an outrageous statement, and I hope other prospective buyers do not take such unfair and inacurate remarks to heart.For my part, this CD has been in my collection for years (actually, I have had to replace it several times due to wearing the CDs out), and it will remain so. You have a classic CD at an unbelievable price here. Don't pass this one up for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive","review":"This book is thouroughly scientific and compregensive, yet easy to read and understand.

This is not a bed time read, but it isn't hard work either. Ted Weimann has systematically examined combat speed from a number of perspectives and brought together a coherent picture of a) what makes for warrior speed (components examined under headings of physical, psychological, and perceived speed); and b) how to improve that speed.I found a lot of insights, well argued propositions, and some useful steers on how to improve. But be warned: this is most definitely NOT \\"5 Steps to Get 5 times faster in just 5 minutes a day\\". This is a book to help you think and plan how to improve your speed - and that will involve hard work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly 'comprehensive' and poorly edited.","review":"The author (or his 'consultant') have several mistakes in this book - amongst the species descriptions for example, they say the Catalina Goby \\"will thrive in a tropical invertebrate aquarium\\" though \\"Not a true tropical animal...\\" WRONG. This fish will perish quickly in a tropical environ. There is a photo of Engineer/Convict Gobies identified as catfish! And the author highly recommends a Cleaner Wrasse in every system - foolish, these are obligate cleaners and should be left on the reef. They'll harass your other fish like crazy, and usually refuse regular food. The coverage of system setup, maintenance and disease are very, very lightweight, and rather outdated. If you're looking to get started in Marine Aquariums, buy a book from John Tullock or Robert Fenner. They're more expensive, but worth every penny.

I rarely printed photos, and when I did, found the quality well below that of my previous Epson printers. Even black-on-white printing was substandard. The MP510 is an ink-guzzler, too.

I had to buy a $39 print driver called Turbo print, which works quite well. Scanner works fine with Scangear. The printer itself is very good. If you however print out quick low quality photos, you will find if you look closely that the picture has bands.

Nothing on the CD rocks, but even as the songs are slow, the band can get a little noisy and that is welcome on the first two cuts and the Rudyard Kipling reference, When the Earth's Last Picture is Painted. In the interest of full disclosure, while it doesn't bother me, band leader Greg Vanderpool has a nasal vocal style that may grate on some ears.If you like alt-country, Texas music, but haven't heard of Milton Mapes, they are definitely worth an impulse purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Children's Book Ever","review":"I still have my original copy of The Wish Tree by John Ciardi (from 1962)-- to this day, it's one of my all-time favorite books.

These are riveting tales, about murderers and parricides, about awful deeds, but ultimately they're about the pain of rejection, abandonment, and exclusion, and what they can do to a child already in distress. A great read, and a good introduction to Kirschner's breakthrough work on Adopteed Child Syndrome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive, accurate, and upgradable","review":"I purchased a used Magellan Explorist 400. The battery had shorted and I could only use it with external power. I purchased a new battery and go the unit to work perfectly. The MapSend Top, Direct route, and Blue Nav XL-3 charts work great on the unit and are inexpensive on Amazon.com. The Magellan support site has very recent updates for the GPS Wass enabled satellites and for the unit firmware. If you want the most recent maps then you will pay a lot for the software but if you settle for the 1-3 year old maps the software available on amazon is great. The unit lacks a speaker, Headphone plug in, Blue-tooth, being that is a discontinued GPS line.... that is expected.

It's true that his views may at sometimes be a little extreme, especially those concerning the ACLU, he does offer evidence, often anecdotal to support his claims.After reading just a few chapters I remember wanting to hear the author behind the text. So I listened to his radio talk show that comes on late at night. And from listening to him provide commentary on the Iraq war, for example, you really do hear the intensity in his voice, the same passion that you find in his book. Behind every politically charged statement is not a frail writer who masks himself behind his words, but a bold, fearless savage man (!) who makes weapons out of his words.As a whole, this book shed light on issues that I had never would have looked at in the Savage way. Although it's been about two months since I've read the book I'll never forget Savage's views on the radical left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savage for President.","review":"I am a 25 year old mother of one son, married, conservative, former liberal hippy-type. I would like to thank this book, along with Dr. Savage's other best-sellers, he was my cure! That being said, this book is a scary, harrowing look into the rotting death-grip liberals have over our country. Nothing is safe from Dr. Savage, he'll take on everyone and anything. Homosexuality, feminism, abortion-you'll get Dr. Savage's in-your-face opinion, based on rock-hard logic and good, old-fashioned REASONING! Best of all, his writing is fast-paced, flows great, and his wit is razor. Just yesterday I saw a t-shirt that showed a caricature of a wedded couple in tux and gown. Above them, the words: Bad Move. With junk like this becoming mainstream, we need Dr. Savage and his fearlessness more than anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Liberalism is a choice, not a disorder","review":"Michael Savage seems to want total conservative domination of everything. So he writes these books, saying liberals are mentally ill and destroy everything (even though for the past 15 years, conservatives have taken over most of the government), brainwashes like minded people that liberals are witches and warlocks when really we want the same things. I could spend days arguing at my conservative friends that they think the wrong way and that Bush is screwing up America and they can do it to me back also. I say why not Al Franken (who I don't like all that much, comedians shouldn't be pundits) and Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, Randy Rhodes, and everyone at Air America and abroad can shut up their mouths and we can get along for the next four years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defeats the message","review":"This book offers nothing.There are reasoned/principled arguments for many of the positions that Savage takes.

There are some good arguments to be made against the secularization of America and other conservative authors have made them decently, some better than others, but this book shows an amateur. Read something by Bill O'Reilly and you get the sense that his argument is mildly reasonable, even if you hold different views. The man it seems is trying to convince you that his argument is valid. Read the pages of this book and you are embarrassed to be a conservative. Savage's goal isn't to convince his detractors or even the undecided person, that he, Savage is right, but merely to please everyone who already agrees with him.

His whole tone and methodology suggests a small man with a big chip on his shoulder. Savage needs to buck it up and be man enough to own up to the truth and start telling the truth. Savage appeals to the worst in America and is dragging down our nation into a world of division and hatred. There is no liberal assault on our schools, faith and military. There is an assault by right-wing demagogues who want to use the power of the state to push their own agenda and diminish our Constitution.

Although he professes to hate the latter, he does have some liberal values among his core beliefs. Mostly, however, I think he's just schtick -- saying or writing whatever he needs to for ratings. Unlike Limbaugh Hannity and their imitators, he's not a shill for big money. He's more of a crochity xenophobe, with a touch of decency and liberalism.Just be careful about his \\"facts.\\" Recently I heard him talk about the 400,000 Russian casualties in taking Berlin at the end of WWII. He mentioned this a few times, so I bothered to read the Battle of Berlin and Savage was wildly wrong. He also overlooked important facts that contradicted the parallel he was trying to draw between the Battle of Berlin and the U.S. invasion of Iraq.Bottom line -- don't buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascist tripe","review":"Savage has rightly been banned from entering Britain because of his hate-filled diatribes against everybody not exactly like him.In reply, he has now called on all Americans to boycott all British goods - so he has proved that he is no friend of Britain.With Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, he hates democracy: they are in truth modern fascists."},{"rating":"1","title":"The elite ownership-class who owns and control the Schools, Military, and \\"Faith\\" are not liberal at all.","review":"The elite ownership-class who owns and control the Schools, Military, and \\"Faith\\" are not liberal at all.The Bilderberg Group is not \\"liberal\\" at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wakeup Liberal Free Loaders","review":"Michael Savage again hits the nerves of the weaker vessels known as the American liberal.

He KNOWS history. Surely all have heard the quote, \\"Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.\\" Michael is just pointing out this fact. This country, unquestionably, is wavering in its position as World Power. If you think that is OK, then you definitely need to read this book. The reason we are in this position is not because of our citizenry, but because of the citizenry's neglect of \\"the republic\\".

This may sound extreme to some, but Savage articulates this to be the only way to restore America to greatness, and points to the many ways liberals and undesirable minorities have bogged us down.Clearly, Mr. Savage has learned the lessons of history, and writes that not all the activities of 1940's Germany should be condemned. Indeed, he states that some of their methods were highly effective, efficient, and have gotten a bum rap from liberals, who are too concerned with propping up the weak. Savage emphasizes in the last chapter how America must forcibly remove the weak (or \\"thin the herd,\\" as he says) from our society if we are to properly control our destiny. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover to cover bs","review":"This book is horrible and chocked full of slanted thinking (?) and outrght lies aimed at dividing this country even further.

Unfortunately for those who think he has anything relevant to contribute, Weiner is poorly qualified to pass judgement on the issues. In his book, he offers copious opinions, and practically no evidence to back up anything he asserts. In fact, he is SO far off base that he isn't even wrong. He's incoherent. His anger has made him irrational.Apparently, there is a sizable audience for angry, incoherent ramblings. And that folks, is a sad observation on the state of public discourse in our country today.

From the anti-God , anti-family ACLU to the king pins of the Democratic party, our schools, military and democracy are all being threatened by these shady people. There are far too few conservative voices on the radio and television these days. Time and Newsweek mags are dripping wet with the stench of liberalism.

This book feels like a completely different story than the last two. Most of the storylines that intrigued me were mysteriously dropped or just left completely ignored. The whole purpose changes from world scale to personal love mess. Many of the details that were built up hugely over the last two books are either never explained or dealt with half-heartedly. The final resolution, that had quite a large amout of tension built up on how to solve it, was completely anticlimactic, and felt like he just had to make an end to meet a deadline. Way too many inconsistencies. As a story it's flat and forced. As an allegory, it doesn't make much sense and is all over the place.

Unfortunately, his understanding of Christianity is closer to the current State religion than to any basic biblical approach. Shallow moralisms allow the death of thousands without any qualms.But, to the literature. Characters are 2 dimensional at best. Inconsistencies are glossed over.

One of the more common tropes in the field is that citizens voted democracy out in Germany and Hitler came to power constitutionally. Bermeo shows that the truth is much more complicated. She argues that anti-democratic parties rarely won a majority at the ballot box. Rather, elites co-opted social movements in order to stifle democracy. She uses detailed comparative historical analysis to show what happened when. I do wish the book took the logical next step and generalized the argument to citizen participation in politics at large. Do citizens ever matter in regime transitions, or do elites only hold the key?

I brought it along on a bicycle trip the length of Yunnan in the spring of 2005, but found the information extremely outdated and nearly worthless.

I found Lonely Planet's South-West China (2002) far superior; unfortunately this book is getting old and Lonely Planet does not plan a new edition. Lonely Planet's China (2005) skips over some of the best places--such as the southeast--of Yunnan.

It's liberally sprinkled with examples of the famous Berliner sense of humor. A great read for the novice or the experienced Berlinophile. My one major grumble: the Cold War era section covers the western half of the city far more extensively than the eastern half. I would have liked to see more about life on the \\"other side\\".

I laid this down in April 2012 as a ground cover for some plants in a raised 2 foot garden bed. The first week of May 2012 I noticed that the material was already degrading and tearing. We have had some rain and lots of sun and the material just does not hold up. The ground cover tears easily and seems to be decomposing. No way there would be 6 years out of it let alone a month.There are weeds growing under the ground cover pushing it up. The weeds are healthy and green. I don't think this ground cover lives up to the Dewitt brand. Very disappointed. If you are looking for something to degrade quickly as a ground cover this would be your product.

We put the covering down on tilled garden soil 25' long by 2 widths wide on May 1st, and by May 14th, the material was as tissue paper. The slightest brush against it caused disintegration. We used bent wire stakes to hold down the material, which worked ok. It didn't lift in the wind. But after being on the ground for 10 days, we attempted to cut a small hole to plant a tomato plant and the material fell apart when touched, even where it was dry. This item may work well when covered with gravel or other material, but is not good for garden cover to prevent weeds. Next year I'll purchase a more durable garden cover.

With friend Abner Perry, they dive their \\"mole\\", or burroughing machine, straight through the earth's surface where they discover the savage land of Pellucidar. Here, where dinosaurs still exist and mankind is enslaved by the reptilian Mahars, David and his friend are forced to face unknown perils and survive in a hostile environment.\\"At the Earth's Core\\" is another highly entertaining science fiction novel from ERB. Even though his format is formulaic, you're always assured of fast paced adventure in his novels. Not as groundbreaking as Tarzan or as strong as John Carter, The Pellucidar series is still a worthy addition to Burroughs body of work, and it gets an extra star for the nostalgia of being a personal childhood favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining read with some humorous flaws.","review":"First off I have to say that this book was not one of Burroughs' best, in my opinion. There were some very clumsy scenes and way too much in the way of coincidence. And the scene where the humans killed some of the reptilians, skinned them, and wore the skins to escape was ludicrous to the point where I was ready to roll on the floor in laughter. And I know that the world of Pelucidar is no longer possible to modern minds. Still, the novel was entertaining and all such old science fiction classics are.

No rose colored glasses here in the \\"getting there\\"...I've watched her on stage for 30 years and followed every movie she has made.

The layout and typography is confused and without hierarchy which makes the contents difficult and frustrating to navigate.

If my brother stole my underwear and wrote perverted letters to me, I would have ran out of my house so fast I would have left a skid marks. I wouldn't have stayed around to hear him talk to himself, that's for sure. And I don't get his wife. Besides the fact that he looked like a baby with a beard, his bedwetting would have been enough for me to hit the road.

One brand I found is Marinex, it is made of what Pyrex USED to be made of-- borosilicate glass. This is the highest quality glass you can get for bakeware. Pyrex may not stand up to freezer to oven use. I have also read many accounts of pyrex developing micro cracks you can't see.

Nobody was hurt, thankfully but the new pyrex is no longer the same high quality product that used to be made by corning, in fact when I looked at the bottom of all my glass baking dishes they were all stamped \\"corning NY\\" on there.

Grimes was playing around with reality and perception here as well as the question, \\"how well do we know the people we love?\\" Her portrayals of Lady Summerston and Sadie's brother are poignant and she is experimenting with the idea that murder is not always clear cut and even the best and brightest can be stumped. She learned from writing this book and when read in relation to the others in the series one can see her growth as a writer here.

Since then I have used it to level an above ground pool for a friend, install vinyl siding,and plumb studs while remodeling. Another friend is using it to install siding on his rental.

After only a week and a half I noticed it getting shaky and upon closer inspection found the small tube that holds the pedals had ripped from the platform. Now I know it had gotten extremely hot, I even put a small wet paper tissue on the pedal handle after pedaling and heard it sizzle, but to melt and break? Just from pedaling? It never left the underside of my desk and I never stood or dropped it or anything of that sort. Would been great if it didn't break... Not sturdy... Not recommended... All I did was pedal... Now if I pedal anymore, the upper half will separate from the lower half. Guess I'll fire up that soldering iron..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I can say that I believe this model is as good as they get. The quality is high and the pedal resistance can go all the way up to a a pretty hard workout, if you want to. I loved the design of the pedals. Fits great.

We don't have room for a bike in our home, so I ordered this pedal exerciser and I love it. I can tell a difference in my knee when I use this exerciser. Now I've bought another one for under my desk at work so I can keep my knee limber while sitting at my computer. The place where the pedals insert into the \\"axle\\" does get hot from friction, which is to be expected. I wear some footwear (shoes, slippers, socks) when I use the exerciser and I have no problem brushing against the hot area. It is convenient, portable, easy to use, I can adjust the resistance, and it's helping me feel better - what's not to like?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product. Great Price.","review":"This works really nice. The intensity is good enough for me, but i could see some people thinking it does not offer enough resistance. I use it while Im watching tv just so im moving more. Im not looking for a super crazy cardio workout...so its ideal for me.The floor pads that come on it work great. No sliding around on the floor. I love that the body, for the most part, is one solid piece. Very sturdy feeling, and not cheap or flimsy feeling at all..when i bought it, at this price, i thought it would feel like a lesser quality.I did notice that the the metal bar that the pedals are on, gets very hot. I burned myself grabbing it by the middle of the bar to move it, after using it.

It's called Ridgewood - Model 9217096WGP. I assembled the desk (without the wheels, so I can push the legs/base under my sofa - in order to bring the desk closer into me), then I placed the pedal exerciser underneath the desk. It's not perfect. But I am highly satisfied with the opportunity to work on my laptop and get some exercise in. I believe it's worth it. I plan to work like this every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"great pedaler","review":"I keep this under my desk at work. It becomes available to me basically 9 hours a day. I don't use it 9 hours a day, but I use it a little bit every day.It is really good at sticking to the carpeted floor. I've had no problems at all with it moving when I didn't want it to.The pedals turn without any problem. There is a knob to tighten it and I will admit it does seem to loosen up faster than I'd like, but it's not a big deal to me as the more important thing is the motion and movement than how hard I am pushing to pedal. I've had no issues with my knees or any physical problems while using this.It is light enough to easily move. It is small enough to store easily. Mine hasn't rusted and doesn't really get dirty. It's still in great shape and I've had it a year now. This is a great little product for a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedal Exercisers are a good concept, Pick another model/brand.","review":"In short the quality is poor. As others have mentions the rotation is not smooth. Also the resistance knob does not provide enough resistance to be a real feature. The temperature of the metal parts becomes too hot, even after a short use, to be safe and can easily cause burns to the unsuspecting user. Also, possibly caused from the excessive heat, this pedal exerciser tends to fall apart.I love the concept of pedal excercisers but if you plan on buying one for yourself or as a gift I strongly recommend a different brand and/or model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for","review":"This item is not meant for anyone who wants to do more than a very slow steady pace for a short period of time.

Being only 5 weeks out of knee surgery I could not afford an interuption in my daily physical therapy routine which is centered heavily around stationary biking. I was going to be traveling for two weeks in an RV cross country and thought this would be a suitable substitute while traveling. After pedaling on this contraption for the better part of the distance between Austin and Memphis, I was quite disappointed to find that this machine was utterly useless. The pedal rotation was to small to offer any range of motion benefit and it's impossible to tighten the resistance to obtain any meaningful strength benefit. I didn't expect the same workout as I get at home but I hoped to at least have some benefit. This product isn't even worth the small amount of $$ it costs.

But if you set this on the floor in front of your couch before a Law and Order marathon, they're going to be doing a post-mortem on it before the last commercial break"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Peddlar","review":"I bought this model and the deluxe pedlar as well for rehab from torn meniscus arthro knee surgery. The basic model was a little hard at first (4 wks after surgery) to pedal because the mechanism is not very smooth. It is light weight, easy to move from room to room, and even to work; also the feet on this model are much more slip-proof than the deluxe model. A 24\\" square anti-slip rug underlay works well under the pedlar. I keep the resistance low, so have not experienced the heating up that others describe. The physical therapist advised to use ankle weights instead of cranking up the resistance. Overall this exerciser is a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good quality","review":"After only used less than 5 times, one of the little knobs that hold the peddle strip broke off.

The tension mechanism uses friction only to bring you to higher \\"gears\\". That friction then heats up not only the \\"gear box\\" but the entire length of the pedal arms as well. Thank goodness they made the pedals out of plastic cause that's the only part of the body that doesn't transfer heat. You can avoid the heat by never turning up the tension but then why buy a tensioning pedal? My advise is to spend the extra money for one that uses real mechanical gears cause this thing is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap but still not worth it","review":"The product is built well, sturdy and so forth but just doesn't really do much for you because of the balance and inability to really stick in the ground as you pedal harder.

There were so many good possibilities available that were left unused! We finished wondering if K A Applegate cares about her characters as much as our family does. We've read them all and have been saddened by the negative, defeatist, feelings in the Ellimist and this final book. Suicide is such a cheap ending. Pre-teens and teens would be better served learning how to adapt or to change society than to think death is a positive answer to adjustment problems. We will not probably read another Applegate series as we no longer trust her to treat her characters and readers with honor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm disappointed beyond words","review":"I am very disappointed in K.A Applegate. She played with my emotions for 5 years, and then she leaves me with a book like this. This book disapponted me so much, you almost want to cry at the end for wasting your time. She does pointless killing off, and she obviously forget many plot lines. What about the other set of Animorphs, do they not exist anymore. \\"I want the Animorphs to go out like they came in fighting\\" is just a lame excuse for writers block. I am very saddened by this ending, and saddening I don't have closure for a good part of my life reading these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of Rubbish","review":"okay this is my 2nd to first most rubbish animorphs book. WHY KA? WHY? The torment!! Rachel Dead? I was in tears!! POOR RACHEL! It was bad enough you killed her, my fav character. But you made it so it seemed Marco didnt care about Rachel and hes really happy!? WHY DID YOU WRITE ALL THAT RUBBISH ABOUT them going onto tv programs and rubbish?! And y the cliffhanger ending. What or who was that \\"One?\\" what happened to Ax? if you had got rid of that rubbish the book would be slightly better!It was not up to your usual standard K A. It seems as if you spent 30 mins awake only by drinking strong coffee writing this book! Where were the parents? What happened to Jakes parents?! What about Rachels dad? If only K A could write this book again with her usual class and perfection, spending time over it. Sorry K A, i had to let out what I felt about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I Have Ever Read - A Total Waste of Time","review":"K.A. Applegate must have been angry at her publishers or editors for making her write this book. What she did about it was punish her loyal readers. I can't believe she would take readers who stuck with her through 50+ books and cheat them the way she did. No loose ends were tied up, no adventures were had, no funny lines were said, and *nobody* gets a happy ending. The tragedy that happens in the first part adds nothing to the overall storyline or the dramatic tension. The ending was bitter and hopeless, worse than \\"Sophie's Choice\\", but without good writing. THIS WAS TO BE A CHILDREN'S ADVENTURE, NOT A TRAGIC PSYCHODRAMA!!!! I advise all readers to avoid this book and imagine your own ending to the story. I'll never read anything of hers again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"Is it possible to give a book 0 stars, because if it was thats what I would give this book.

My recommendation to parents is that they do not purchase 53 or 54 for their children, because ...*** Spoliers ***at the end of 54, everyone is enslaved to the evil villain. My daughter re-read the Animorphs books many times, greatly loved them, and after reading this book cannot enjoy any of them. Terrible shame. Very out of keeping with the rest of the series. Very bad ending, not appropriate for this series' age range (approximately 8 to 10 years)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best yet...no matter what anyone says!","review":"This Animorphs Book ended in a cliffhanger. Now, as much as I do not like cliffhangers in books, I enjoyed this one. Now, many fans thought that K.A. was unfair for writing a cliffhanger, killing one of the original Animorphs, and not making the final battle a knock-down, drag-out fight. That would of been cool but, wars don't usually end like that. And, K.A. explains why she wrote #54 the way she did on the website morphz.com. And she is completely right. Now, to the fans that enjoyed the final book, I say so did I; it was great. It deserves more stars than we can give it. But, to the fans who didn't enjoy it, grow up because you people expected way too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of what?","review":"Don't get me wrong, I am a seriously devoted Animorph fan, but I can't help but feel that this book was kind of a let down...Ax gets in trouble and there is only minimum information on how that happened and why...I feel that the ending of this book was a major dissapointment. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT! K.A totally leaves us open mouthed at the end, and in my case wondering \\"What? THAT'S IT?\\" But any true fan should definetly read this last chapter in what was an amazing 3 year epic. It has battle, good characterization, a decent plot, and a very little bit of romance. All in all, a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is about the movies, good story..but not the animorphs","review":"I got this movie thinking oh my gosh it's really an animorphs movie.I had read all the books and loved them but when I got the movie it was totally different from the book.Almost everything was left out.for instance in the book when jake was turned into a controller the yeerk inside him turned into a tiger then his dog.in this he turned into a tiger and was caught by the other animorphs.also axe does many things that were not at all in the story and everything in the book did not happen at all.you can buy these but don't get your hopes up!!!!also they look nothing like they do in the cover and have completely different morphs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a favourite","review":"If you read this series, the ending is kinda necessary to have. But it's far from my favourite book in the series. Actually, least favourite would be closer to describing it.

Go ahead and buy it if you like the series, but don't expect anything outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm.. . . . .","review":"Well, I read this series since the begining and it was really just amazing. I kept the last book on my shelf for years before reading it. I know that alot of people have forgotton but animorphs lives on. Somehow they will always be a part of me. This series was the best ever. Better then Remnants or Harry Potter combined. I think about it every day. I think about what could have happened. Maybe somday, someone will give the book a better ending but until then Animoprhs lives on . . . Jake. . . Cassie. . . Tobias . . . Marco . . . Ax... and Rachel . . Rest In Piece.

To have Rachel taken out so easily was pointless. KA makes Marco seem like all he ever wanted to get was to be rich and famous and Cassie just drops everthing having to do with the animorphsonce it's<the war> is over. Jake just retreats into his mind and stays there. Also, Ax just deserts everyone! This book could have been carried on for at least acouple more chapters. Then we really could have put the animorph series to a close. < Instead of wondering wether they make it out alive from jake's suicidle plans > This book does not deserve to be counted as one of the seris, it was almost as bad as the 'AlterAnimorphs'! After seeing what KA has done with Animorphs and Everworld I am less likely to trust her with this new seris Remmenants. It seems like she just wanted to end the books. I was deeply dissapionted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Stinky Waste","review":"Five years of reading and hoping, wincing at every bad turn they got and cheering when they win. For what? A big stinky waste of paper. Did K. A. Applegate even look at what she was writing? Does she glory in human misery? WHAT is with people raving about how wonderful this book is? I found myself let down by the lack of effort K.A. put into this book. For those who have already read this book, brush up on your Star Trek aliens, reread the end of the book and remember plagiarism is a crime!

I have loved Animorphs but not this one. To many Questoins at the end. What about Chapman? The animorphs' last names? The Council of Thirteen? Crayak? Is Ax Alive?

Also At the end it said K.A.A. Made 54 Regular books, 4 Chronicles and FIVE megamorphs. One more book to Come?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beginning (Or is it the end?)","review":"This si a pathetic book. I am a fan of all the other Animorphs books, but this is a cliffhanger, and what you do find out about the ending is pathetic. All the romances are killed off at some time or another. Most of the book just says what their life is like in the future (which is not in the least bit interesting because they don't even stay in contact with one another). Plus there is almost no action in it at all. So she basically took out a life or lives (I'm not going to ruin it for you, all the romance, all the action, and most of the dialouge. What's left is a bunch of nothing, stuffing-like, pitiful ending to a great series. It was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was awful!!","review":"I have read ANIMORPHS since the beginning of the series. The first book I read was #2 THE VISITOR. That was a Rachel book. Needless to say, I was disappointed with the ending of the series. I can write a better ending right now. At the endof 54, if you've read the book you know what I'm talking about, it opens a SARIO RIP and it takes the animorphs on board back in time. This way they save the doomed animorph and the other casualty Jake feels responsible for with the help of the Chee. In this way the other doomed animorph is saved also. THE END. Was that so hard KA?"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful ending!!!!","review":"This book was awful! The author did a horrible job of making a good ending! One major character dies,and two have to say goodbye forever. This book was a big disappointment. If you prefer happy endings, I suggest NEVER to read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken ending...","review":"After reading the entire series as a kid, I hated this book.Not because it was poorly written or because of the cliffhanger ending, I thought that was one of the more slightly parts.No, I hated this book because after 64 books of getting attached to the main characters, 2/3 of this book is just dragging on unnecessarily and destroying the characters I grew to love.I think it would have been better to end at the scene on the pool ship, where they'd just won the war, but at a tremendous cost. It would have displayed the themes of the book just fine. What bugged me is how it dragged on and on for another 2/3 of the book with each of the characters becoming really broken people, then finally them all dieing (I assumed when I read it, at 12. 17 now). Even though it was supposed to illustrate a tragic ending to war to be realistic, I think it went overboard for a childrens book."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"I wanted to like this book. However, this was definately not a good ending for the series. It ended with everything haging, which was really NOT COOL. The same thing happened with Everworld, and I hope to God KA doesn't do this with Remnants. What would have made a much better ending in my opinion would be to have the entire book be the last battle, and then just little snippets of what happened afterward. WHERE ARE THE PARENTS? The Animorphs spent so much time saving them, and they just dissapear! Everyone was out of character. Marco was about as shallow as you can get,, Tobias left the woman he has been searching for since birth, and Cassie and Jake broke up so she could be with some guy named Ronnie! As bad as that last one would be, what makes it even worse is that in 53 Jake said he was thinking about marrying Cassie, and they suddenly break up. Sorry to rant like this; it just makes me mad that such a great series has such a mediocre and implausible ending"},{"rating":"1","title":"Betrayed","review":"I enjoyed the book. It was a decent ending, with plausible character developments. It was Applegate's pregorative to destroy the Jake-Cassie romance, and in war, it does not matter how brave you are, if you are cut down by 30 guns you will die. I had no problems with most of the book. Unfortunatly, then I read the ending. I was outraged. I am 17, and have been following this series since I was 12 years old and saw an interesting cover, of a girl changing into a cat, in a school book fair. Since then, I have faithfully bought the next book every month. Not actually concluding the series was a betrayal of myself and every other faithful Animorphs fan out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring Rachel back!","review":"I have been reading Animorph books since I got hooked on the second one. Rachel and Tobias have always been my favorite characters. I do think Rachel should have died, and I think her death was done very well, but I also think she should be brought back. I mean, It's very possible. The Ellimist or Crayak, something, should bring her back. I wanted this series to have a happy ending, with all the Animorphs together. Rachel, Ax, Cassie, Jake, Tobias, and Marco. Plus, I there were some questions that really should have been answered. Even little stuff, like what are the others last names? This is more of a beginning than an ending, and K.A. needs to write a real ending. I myself am currently writing an ending onto the Beginning. Rachel will be back in mine. I really see why she had to die, but that doesn't have to mean she should stay dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Book in the Series","review":"Man I can't believe this book. KA Appelgate must have been drunk or something. It destroyed Chractors that I used to like. I did like that Jake and Cassie broke up. About bloody time. It started off good I guess but why did they let Visser One live. I hated that guy I wanted him to die. The trial scene was so stupid. I could not believe Tobias lived in the woods instead of with his mother. Instead of making a good battle ending for the plot she creats a new plot and doesn't even finish it. If you read all the books in order up to this point then this is a misserible excuse for an ending. I will never read one of KA Appergates books agian. Animorphs had so much potencial. So much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs better conclusion!","review":"Animorphs #54 was a great book until the last chapter. I mean,I get what she said about war not always ending in a \\"happily ever after\\" thing but the cliffhanger was just too much! So all I'm saying is that KA should write a Megamorphs #5 and have it continue from the ending of book #54"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe it's over...","review":"Like the reviewer above, I began this series many years ago when it came out. I was only in sixth grade and I fell in love with it instantly. I still love them and this book was great but...So many loose ends, I mean the last part with the ramming of the ship? I need answers! And I can't believe that she did that to Tobias. He is in many ways like me and My favorite character. You should have given him happiness Applegate! Anyway, it's a great, if not very sad book and I will miss all the characters deeply. They were very real to me and companions, I only hope that one day she will answer the cliff hanger."},{"rating":"2","title":"The more you read it, the more you are impressed","review":"I have read this book more than several times.

Here are its problems:1. It is bulkier than most travel clocks.2. The backlight level is VERY LOW so that it is difficult to see the time in a dark bedroom at night.3. The controls are tiny and on the back rather than the front of the clock. This makes it very difficult to set4. The \\"Atomic Radio Control\\" does not differentiate between time zones so that you have to switch the clock manually when you are traveling anyway. This voids the primary advertised benefit of the clock.5.

Considering the abuse the boys were dishing out on themselves daily (hourly?) when this record was made, it is an amazing effort. Tyler's interpretation of 'Cry Me A River' alone is worth the price of the CD. Production is solid and some of the cuts are just absolutely terrific. Although every Aerosmith record has its moments, in this fan's opinion, the record is light years better than 'Draw the Line' before it and 'Done With Mirrors' which followed (I did like 'Night in the Ruts' quite a bit.) If you think Aerosmith fell off the planet between 'Rocks' and 'Permanent Vacation' and you have never listened to this record, I strongly recommend picking it up. It's a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Push Comes To Shove","review":"A lot of people find this album to be the worst of Aerosmith's pre-Geffen albums. To me that distinction would go to Night In The Ruts. This album is solid. People love to hate it because Joe Perry and Brad Whitford aren't in it. There is only one weak song. That would be \\"Prelude To Joanie.\\" My personal favorite is \\"Push Comes To Shove.\\" This would rank 4th on my favorite Aerosmith albums. Great album with awesome guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance, don't let the stigma ruin it for you","review":"While it doesn't approach either the early classics like Aerosmith, Rocks and Toys In The Attic, and it's not as good as latter smashes like Pump and Permanent Vacation, Aerosmith's 1982 album holds it's own well.While the album is generally regarded as a flop, it did peak at #32, which isn't close to their most successful album, but for Aerosmith to scrape the lower reaches of the top 40 in 1982, over 3 years after their last hit up to the point and without much radio/MTV airplay showed they still had an audience then.The sound? Classic Aerosmith with an 80's twist. Lightning Strikes is classic Aerosmith, except it opens up with synthesizers. My personal favorite is Jig Is Up, a bluesy number which still had some \\"80's\\"-ness to it.If you can find this cd for a relatively cheap price, go for it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoking remains","review":"Well, believe it or not, Aerosmith used to be a descent band in the early 70's. This album has still a little clue, of what's been going on in the past. But still it fails, offering you the wost side of Aero-style. There are only brief cuts form the huge jam they had going in the 70's. But still, it's a true masterpiece compared to the latest production. Jeess-uss..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Rocks, But What About the Songs?","review":"This album is not terrible. It is simply so-so. It captures the darkest time in the history of the band. The members' drug problems were on their way to the pits. Joe Perry and Brad Whitford were doing their own things in solo projects. Aerosmith was left with not much of a songwriting team. they were forced to enlist Richie Supa as a regular songwriter and do whatever they could to get lyrics out of Steven. Thank god they got the real band back together and made solid records again. If this were their last, the band wouldn't have much of a history.Songs like \\"Jailbait\\" and \\"Joanie's Butterfly\\" are interesting but not good enough to be great. They only stand out cause there is not much else on the album.Strictly for the Aerosmith completist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aerosmith In An Eighties Place","review":"By the 80s Aerosmith had lost it.

What i'm trying to say is this: It's not a bad album because there are good songs in it, but thinking about Aerosmith I feel that the tracks have less power that the others. Althoug Rick Dufay and Jimmy Crespo are good, the perfect (and unique) couple for \\"A\\" are Joe Perry and Brad Withford.

Just it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Criminally Overlooked","review":"\\"Done With Mirrors\\" is downright weak and \\"Draw the Line\\" is too uneven. \\"Night in the Ruts\\" is full of great material but marred by poor delivery. But there is at least one underrated gem from Aerosmith's lackluster post-Rocks, pre-Permanent Vacation period.Yes, \\"Rock in a Hard Place\\" is a good album. It's missing a couple of elements - Toxic Twin Joe Perry & \\"Mr. Whitford\\" - that make it more of a Steven Tyler solo project, but it's a good effort nonetheless. Not without a couple of weak spots and nothing smooth enough to be a radio hit, but 90% of the album is highly enjoyable and it rocks hard. Crespo brings a unique style to the band and plays nothing like Perry, but it's refreshing. Tyler's voice is surprisingly strong given it's condition on surrounding albums.Seriously, check it out. It's not as bad as it's made out to be and you're likely to come away with some favorites. Mine are \\"Jailbait\\" and \\"Joanie's Butterfly\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aerosmith in its darkest hour","review":"Ignore all of the positive reviews for this album they are not the truth. If you are a fan of Aerosmith like I am, odds are you will not like this album. Only one song is good and that is Lightning Strikes. Jailbait is ok and is the only song from this album that they tend to put on best of compilations. The rest is a boring snooze fest that you don't want to hear. Even though Joe Perry & Brad Whitford aren't on this album, I don't think that is the problem. The state of the band at the time just didn't allow them to write good rock music. Luckily Aerosmith reunited and made a commercial comeback. If you are new to Aerosmith get Pump, Rocks, & Toys in the Attic. Those are the 3 essential Aerosmith albums. This album is for hardcore fans who want to be completeists. Don't expect to listen to it often and good luck enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard worst.","review":"I bought this cd with the attitude of being a completionist.

I also expected to practice on the software but was very disappointed with the quality and quantity. The quality is ridiculous, they just pdf the tax return and let you type over it, not software like. The format is nothing like the real exam and it only has 2 questions for each section and it can't grade!!!! it just provide you with an answer and you will have to do the grading yourself. And the research section is a joke, again doesn't looks like the real exam and it doesn't perform the search correcly. Waste of money! I really like their outlines, but this one is a rip-off.

I loved that it wasn't overly graphic or disgusting in the love scenes. I loved the way the characters interacted with each other. I had a smile on my face alot of the time. It's such a sweet, romantic SciFi romance. I want to go to find a Gaian Man. Who wouldn't want a man that loves you and only you with so much passion.

Brockman takes his influences (Ramones, Sonic Youth, Joy Division) and cooks up a metallic/punk hybrid sound that can only be attributed to an unbalanced yet talented mind.This is NOT an album for the mildly curious fan of rock and roll.

Cher gives her all, but the center of the lp is not to be found.There are few tracks,and the rockish power ballad singing is hard and over emotive. Cher does this one better, with the 1995 cd(or is it 96),It's a Man's World.Blame it on producton, or Cher's lack of focus. The cover is post punk, but the cd is not.It is mediocre ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not essential","review":"With the exception of 2 songs, this album is an unfortunate note to Cher's triumphant musical resurgence in the 1980s.

This album is a great work and she sings like no one. It's an interesting album to people who don't know about Cher's romantic side.

But the packaging doesn't do the contents justice. This is one GOOD album!It's solid, early-'80s rock light years ahead of what was being played on the radio at that time. Why this album wasn't a hit is beyond me. From the opening of the girl group-esque single \\"Rudy\\" to the synth-pop of the title track, this CD delivers Cher in fine vocal form...and performing each song perfectly. My only regret with buying this CD is that I didn't buy it sooner!

Also, the leading rabbi in Rome converted to catholicism after WW-II and took Eugenio as his baptismal name (Pope Pius XII, Eugenio Pacelli).

The CD that's included has the best songs from the movies and the text lets you know that there are many more where those came from. There are also behind the scenes comments from co-stars, directors and producers that offer interesting and amusing insights into a under appreciated side of Elvis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaaay too easy","review":"I was really hoping this cardio workout would be higher impact, but it was really easy.

I enjoyed her books for a number of years, but I have reached a point where I simply do not want to read anymore about men treating the women they are supposed to love as children - even taking on the responsibility for \\"discipling\\" them. I still enjoy Ms. Coulter's modern romance and romance/mysteries, but I am through with the historicals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as reviews make it to be","review":"Even though the plot involves taboo subjects: incest and rape, it was still a compeling read. As other reviewers said, Justin took too long in believing Arabella of her innocence. I think if he had gradually realized he had misjudged her and that they worked together to find the real culprit, the book would have been more enjoyable. Catherine is a gifted writer and this is the first regency book of hers I've read. I'll have to read more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Secondary Characters Are More Interesting...","review":"Sometimes Coulter wins and sometimes she misses. The H/H were not intersting to me. I was not rooting for them to be together. The heroine begins by being an a#% and then it becomes the hero's turn. The fact that the heroine idolized her jerk of a father made me hate her. And of course he comes out smelling like a rose in the end. I don't care what he did for his youngest daughter, but the way he treated his eldest daughter was unforgivable and made him a monster. That being said, I was more interested in Elspeth and Gervaise (It's really bad when you feel sorry for the villian) than the H/H. The fact that it got me to \\"rant\\" gave the book 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hero is really the villain!!","review":"This book is read-able. However, Justin is probably the meanest \\"hero\\" ever! I don't mind men who are mean in the beginning of the book but later come to their senses. I like the Alpha-male type. But the character of Justin was just horrible. He BRUTALLY rapes Arabella, degrades her, and he's never even really sorry about it. I couldn't even finish the book because I hated him so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really hated it!","review":"If I could give it 0 stars I would.

Not my bag - the book went in the garbage and I resolve to read the reviews of my future purchases more carefully. Not buying another Catherine Coulter again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UTTER TRASH","review":"Catherine Coulter was among one of the first romance authors that I ever read. I have liked many of her books, but I have noticed a trend in her historical romance that I can't like. The men always treat the women horribly. This book is probably one of the best or rather worst examples. The \\"hero\\" proceeds along his path with blind arrogance and belief in what he \\"knows\\" to be true. He brutally rapes his wife on their wedding night and then refuses to consider it rape. She acts like a spoiled brat practically from the first moment she appears, but you begin to feel a certain sympathy for her because of the unforgivable way her husband treats her.I'll continue to read Catherine Coulter's modern mysteries, but I doubt I can bring myself to read another one of her historical romances again. This is the worst one of all. Utter trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing story","review":"I usually like Coulter's romances, but her books are either great or terrible. I have to say that this is the worst one I have ever read. The story line was completely obvious, with no suspense or mystery. The book had very little action but mostly lifeless, stilted dialogue. Very little romance at all, the main characters are uncompelling and its hard to see where the attraction is; the main love scene is a brutal rape. If you are a fan of Coulter I advise you to avoid this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was never the same after","review":"SO I'm not a professional reviewer and have only seen her once in concert, but live she is just so delicatly voiced and with almost child-like playfullness. Her album was only good for me bc I have heard her sing the sings directly and had some residual memory from that. I like her a lot, she attaches a lot more to me as a human being than just a singer songwriter. I found some of the later songs on the album to be tedious and dragging. My favorites are Cosmic and story telling girls, and she was absolutly adorable doing 1984. Orion was just devastating (in a good way) in person bc we were fortunate to hear her explaination. Very clever. I think at times her political writing becomes too over-bearing for me. I would Four star- the first half of the ablum absolutly. The second half, I'm still working on warming up to it.

I don't recommend it.Don Stevens"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting -- and annoying","review":"The author managed to tell the major & most interesting points about each of George V's children in a fairly compact & easy to read book. There is a summary paragraph on each at the end of the book and there is an abbreviated family tree showing the descent from Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to the children of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. I am glad I bought it despite the fact that there are a massive number of typos for such a small (less than 250 pages) book. It is the typos that are annoying. There are multiple instances of \\"to\\" rendered as \\"ot\\", \\"of\\" printed as \\"fo\\", \\"war\\" appears once as \\"wr\\", \\"royalty\\" as \\"roaylty\\", and the Eighth Army became the \\"Eighty\\" Army.

It's Aretha at her earliest. It has five great songs, that are tailored to the supper crowd, which was the thing to do back then when this record was recorded.It was trying to reach an adult audience and is loaded with standards to boot.This is Aretha in her between stage, where she was holding back the hot buttered soul. Yet, her passion does break out on this album, IF EVER I SHOULD LOSE YOU, is one track that you will notice her signature.Overall, this recording is a great departure from what we now know of as Aretha Franklin. It is good on its own merits for showing the versatility of an artist. If you are a big fan of Franklin's you would want this cd. If you are a romantic, you would want this cd. Simply put, it is just another style that Aretha's covering, and she does it quite well.I bought the recording and I love it. It just simply gives me another reason to dig Aretha Franklin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two worlds of music","review":"First I would like to say that I greatly admire Constance Demby's talent. However, if you are interested in buying her CDs, be aware that her music falls into two vastly different worlds. Novus Magnificat, Set Free, Aeterna, and Sanctum Sanctuorum are rich in harmony and very uplifting. Attunement, Spirit Trance, and Sacred Space Music are atonal and reminiscent of a waking nightmare. Unfortunately Amazon.com does not make much of her music available for listening so it is difficult for someone new to her music to be aware that the mood of her work varies greatly. I would love to have her compose more music along the lines of Set Free and Novus Magnificat."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be fair, it's a TON of great clip art, but very unstable.","review":"This software has a ton of great clip art and photos for use, but the browser software for it is a massive resource hog and very unstable.

But you can only return unopened one ( i already opened one bag) and within 7 days.

You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order. On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good. This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags). Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Future of Food","review":"Much food that is utterly worthless can be, given some diligence, reinvented in a usable form. This is a good example. A normal pretzel has no nutritive value. This has protein and fiber. Some people would argue 'I am just snacking on these, I get my nutrition from my meals.' This would be a weak argument: every time you put stuff in yer body, you want to have some mix of fat/protein/carbs. Carb only, no fiber food, is not good.As to spelt, not sure what that cat is talking about, these have pea flour and whole wheat flour?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Snack!","review":"I am generally not a fan of pretzels. I have tried pretzel after pretzel in all shapes and sizes to no avail. I finally stumbled upon these one day and I have been loving them ever since. They provide a nice pretzel taste without having an overpowering amount of salt. I only have two complaints about the product:1. Brown rice syrup as an ingredient. While it is organic, I would rather it not be in there because of a few health effects.2. The pretzels are coated in salt and not sea salt. Sea salt is the healthier of the two and should be recognized as such in an organic product.On the whole, great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crunchy with fiber","review":"Spelt pretzels with fiber are hard to come by.

The Protein ones are too salty for my taste, and cause me to have sweet cravings. The Spelt ones are awesome, with a slightly nutty flavor and just the right amount of salt. As a person with a digestive condition, the higher fiber content is a wonderful thing. Since Amazon sells them in bulk, these bags of pretzels are less expensive than in the stores, with normally run $2.19 a bag. My only complaint to Newman's Own is that the bags are too small at 7 ounces. Other than that, it's a great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine Also BURNT flavor!","review":"I purchased the High Protein Pretzels. I've had Newman's Own Organic Pretzels before and they tasted great - but these are not good at all. 95% of the salt is at the bottom of the bag (have to have salt on pretzels!) and they have an overwhelming flavor of being burnt and not a good burnt either! I have no use now for all these pretzels and i can't imagine anyone enjoying this taste!It is upsetting to see that a few others also ended up with the High Protein pretzels having this awful BURNT flavor and yet they still kept sending them out. I'd think maybe they'd look at batch numbers or something to prevent them from being shipped out to dissatisfied customers who will give it a bad review.Generally Newman's Pretzels are really good, but buy these at your own risk...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dieting","review":"Very good and a bonus for those trying to find fiber and protein. helps with those midnight cravings and a reasonable price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Pretzels","review":"We try to avoid wheat here and there, so we love substituting with spelt.

Even more so, when I tasted them, and like a few others pointed out, they have a very distinct burnt taste.Pretzels last just about forever.

It's one of the best overall cat books I've read, but the title is just a little bit misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Success","review":"I was having a serious spraying and urinating out of the litter box with my cats (I have three). Well I followed the advice of the book and in seven weeks have had only one accident. One of the cats was aggressive and hoarding the litterbox resources causing the other one to go to the bathroom wherever he could. I recommend this book for anyone who has problems with their cats. It shows that you don't have to get rid of the cat and that all problems are solvable with the right diagnosis of the root cause of the undesirable behavior. I have since gotten four more copies and am giving it to anyone who is experiencing problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, here's an idea....","review":"Why not have, in the listing of a given item, details on what the item IS?!

Everything over the iron curtain was done in the utmost secrecy, whilst to their credit the USA in the guise of NASA was a very public story. This DVD shows how paranoia filled the void left by the absence of hard facts. From the assumption that the USSR was basically a backward society, to the realisation that they has indeed launched a man in orbit - something not even attempted at the time by the US - the shock was palpable, and is illustrated excellently in this film. Liberal usage of TV and film archive from the time, along with an evocative soundtrack (including sections of El Greco by Vangelis - uncredited), and an appropriate understated narration by Liev Schreiber. A second disc of extra archive material round off the package.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"short lived enthusiasm","review":"This vacuum has lots of versatility and is powerful enough to get the job done. The fact that the head of the vacuum is smaller makes for more passes but it can get into the smaller spaces.

However, they weren't doing anything about it. I suppose if you have carpet, this might work for you. It seemed to have pretty good suction.

That's the only reason why I gave it 2 starts..."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressive","review":"Don't be fooled by its size or the toyish look. This is a mean vacuum cleaner. I compared its suction on hardwood floor against a full-size canister that was recommended by the Consumer Report. The Optima picked up as much dust as the canister, but at 1/3 of the price and 1/2 the weight and closet space.It is fairly loud, mind you, but the noise level is nothing out of the ordinary.

But heck, no vacuum cleaner is likely to become the showcase piece in any household's decor.For its performance, price and compactness, the Optima is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - do not buy","review":"Don't believe the hype with this machine. I did and ended up returning it to Amazon. It is extremely hard to push. But worse than that, the filter is in the same location as the dirt collector cup! That means that the filter gets clogged after vacuuming just 2 rooms. You have to take a toothbrush to manually clean the filter EVERY TIME you use it. Horrible design! In fact, Eureka finally figured it out and created another model correcting this mistake. The new model says, \\"Now the filter is not in the collection cup\\" on the box. Apparently a lot of people complained. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"forward exhaust is a major problem","review":"Bought this vacuum after reading positive reviews, but I have to say that the forward exhaust system is a deal breaker.

We will be returning it and looking for something similar without the forward exhaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY AMAIZING!!!","review":"And it really is. We just bought our first house and were considering buying Electrolux vacuum cleaner, we've tried it in the store, and the suction was pretty impressing as well as the lightweightness, but since it was $400 in stores we decided to look for a better price on the internet. That's fine, but I needed vacuum cleaner right now, because carpet in our basement looked just ridiculous. So I went to Target and choose something to use temporarily, until we buy the one that we've wanted - it happened to be Eureka Optima. What can I say - suction is absolutely the same as Electrolux, same power brush option for heavier carpet cleaning, same light weight and also very cute looking, BUT $59.00 instead of $400.00 - does it mean anything to you? I think so. We are going to keep this one - it's a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Little Vacuum in Kentucky","review":"This is the best vacuum I have ever had. It has great suction. It is as powerful as vacuums twice or three times its weight. The hose and attachments are adequate for most household cleaning.

I would recommend this to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carpets like new...","review":"I can honestly say I've never had so much fun vacuuming!

While it is easy to empty the canister, getting the clogged filter clean is another matter.

All the on board tools are great and they help me out a lot. I love it's size and it is easy to store. It is also a cute little machine and I love the green color! the hose suction is great too.

As is the same with other Eureka products, it has the problem of air coming out IN FRONT and blowing the dust away though, suction is great and much less noise compared to my old Dirt Devil Jaguar. As it is still a week since I started using this unit, I cannot mention anything about durability, but I have an impression this one is manufactured and made up well from its structure. This compact and light weight unit is ideal as a second vacuum cleaner, and also could be used as the single unit for a family living in an apartment with great suction and easy handling, I suppose. The air blowing out in front is the only, and not a small issue so I rate one star less than five."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not buy this vacuum","review":"Where to start on this machine!The wheels do not stay on the base.The handle became wabbly and the knob that switches the unit from floor to carpets does not stay in the up right position...I had to tape it. Also the unit becomes clogged very quickly which means you have to stop what your doing because the machine just stops sucking and starts to make the worst sound you have ever heard. You then have to take the filter outside and bang it to knock the dust off of it so it will work again.I will say that when it does work this tiny machine will pick up debris off of carpet...I dont think it works all that well on bare floors. Yes it is light weight and vacuums when the filter is clean but who wants to spend a lot of time cleaning out the filter and chasing wheels around the house just to vacuum.I WOULD NOT BUY THIS UNIT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You sometimes get what you pay for.","review":"I assume you have read all the good reviews of this vacuum cleaner and I agree with much of what they say so I wont belabor those points.

And I have a cat who loves to shed so finding a vacuum that is powerful and not bulky has proven to be a challenge in the past. When my old vacuum finally gave out on me, I knew the Dyson or the new Hoover were out of the question for both space and cost. I was skeptical about getting one that was inexpensive, thinking it wouldn't do the job.I was wrong! The Optima did such a great job that I look forward to vacuuming now. I have both carpet and bare floors in my apartment and switching between the two is a cinch. And unlike many \\"dual floor\\" vacuums, this actually does a good job on both surfaces. Most impressive is that this little vacuum takes on cat hair with no problem.In addition to the big issues - functionality, compact size, etc. this vacuum is easy to assemble and cute too!

Almost to the day I bought the thing it breaks. The brush still spins but the motor for the suction no longer works.

Now that it is essentially a rotating brush on wheels it is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot be worse","review":"This machine works for about a week. After that, you have to empty the canister (and inhale half of the dust that was in it), and subsequently you need to clean by hand all the dirt and grime from the filter, which take about 20 minutes, since it gets completely clogged.If you are looking for a disposable vacuum cleaner that you can discard after 5 uses, this is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filter clogs and causes vacuum to lose suction","review":"We have had this Vacuum for about 1 year and use the vacuum 1 to 2 times per week. The vacuum cleaner is light and has a lot of power. Its a little noisy but, the real problem with this vacuum is the filtering system. The filter gets clogged very fast. Once the filter gets clogged the vacuum doesn't suction (I suspect this is the problem that some of the other reviewers have had). The only way I've found to adequately clean the filter is with a needle-nosed pliers and about 10-15 minutes of my time. I do this approximately every 2 or 3 times I vacuum.

I don't know how, but I will tear one up in less than a few months. Not this one. I love it. It has AWESOME suction. You can see things coming towards it a few feet away even. The ONLY cons are: if the hose slips off of the plastic cradle, it will knock the power off, and you pretty much have to clean the filter every few uses to keep it sucking.

They have a switch to turn off the beater bar which is great for my hardwood floors but they put the exhaust fan in the front and I spend more time chasing the dust bunnies that this vac throws around than I do catching them. Not to bright for a company thats been around as long as them. It has great suction and works great on carpet though..only draw back with this is the dust cup is way to small and you feel like you are constantly emptying it out.

How long does it take to cool down? At least a half an hour!! So if I want to clean my fully carpeted second floor, which only consists of four small rooms, it will take over 3 hours. It should take 10 minutes, but I have to wait for the Fricking thing to cool down every time.Don't buy this product. It's just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WHEELS FALL OFF!!","review":"Do a search of this model with \\"431BX wheels fall off\\" and you will see this is a common problem. Oh, Eureka will happily sell you a $40 wheel kit, which will also fall off sooner than later. I drilled holes and placed bolts to put them back on. This models is engineered wrong as mentioned by another reviewer in that the exhaust is directed forward, blowing debris away from the intake. Suction is good though and the size is ideal for me. Too bad, all-in-all since it has so much potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this vac!","review":"I bought a Kirby Sentria 2 years ago and loved it, but my grandmother bought me this vac to use when we moved and we were waiting for a week before our furniture (and Kirby) to be delivered. Now the only time I use my Kirby is for shampooing. This unit is so compact that it fits underneath the kitchen counter and it is so lightweight that my 5-year-old uses it every evening to help out. The suction is great, I use it to vacuum our cars. My husband would rather carry it upstairs than use the Kirby that is already upstairs. I haven't had any problems with tracking or wheels like some other reviewers, but it does exhaust on the front and push lightweight objects away. Since my Kirby sometimes shoots them straight backward at my feet, I find this the lesser of two evils."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the price!","review":"My old vacuum decided to explode, but before it was completely fried - it dumped a ton of sand on my hardwood floor. I ran over to Target and bought a new vacuum to clean up the mess my old one made.My bissel was big and heavy, so I chose this Eureka because it was lightweight and inexpensive. What a great value for the price!Once home, it took no longer than 20min. to assemble.It has just as much power, if not more, than my old bissel; however, the brush attachment could be a bit better. Bristles are too far apart, and don't pick up as well as my old one. Other than that I love this vac!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed this time","review":"I had the older model of this unit and needed to replace it so I bought this one. When I started using it a very strong plastic smell filled my room. I thought it was because it was new so I rinsed out the canister and ran it for a little while. The smell in my room lingered for a day. I used the vacuum again after cleaning it and the same result. I sent it back for a replacement and the replacement came in smelling the same way so I didn't even take it out of the box, just shipped it back. So disappointed because this vacuum is a good little vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst little vacuum ever","review":"I only use this vacuum in my kitchen before I wash the tile floor. It is a large area, but it is all 12\\" tiles, they are much easier to vacuum than a rug with pile. I would say that over the few years I have had this, my usage would be light compared to other owners who use this as their main vacuum or use it on their rugs. I have limited usage for this vacuum because I have a large, self propelled Hoover vacuum to do all the wall to wall carpeting; and I use a dust mop for all the wood floors. So this little number is limited to kitchen use before I wash the floor. The wheel keeps breaking off! I have used Crazy Glue to repair it several times, but alas, there is no permanent fix. Frankly, I think Amazon should stop carrying the product because my experience is similar to a number of other owners' experience. This vacuum is so below par because the parts are so cheap, especially the wheels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Vacuum Ever","review":"I have never posted a customer review before but the terrible performace of this machine compels me to do so now. I have had the worst experiences ever using the Eureka Optima model. The hose is too short to reach anything, the fan is in the front of the vacuum which does nothing but create a swirl of dust as you attempt to vacuum using the floor option, the power cord is too short and I find myself having to use another vacuum to effectively clean the filter on this machine. It is a lightweight vacuum but I would not recommmend this model to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the $$!","review":"The vacuum does everything it should. The suction is amazing, the brush leaves nice \\"treads\\", the cup empties easily, the attachments are nice (and they don't fall off when you bump them), the hose is very sturdy yet flexible...I love it. There are some cheaper vacuums that are easier to push (because they have less power), and have longer cords, but nothing about it has bothered me. It lays almost flat to vacuum under tables, etc, without having to move furniture. I like the retracting handle, the filter, and even the color! It's a good buy. (I paid $55, but - having used it - I'd pay more.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks... and not in a good way...","review":"This vacuum lost suction very quickly. I have a small house and mostly hard floors and i find that this vacuum just doesnt do a very good job at cleaning. My swiffer picks up more dog hair. For some reason air blows out the front of this thing and I find myself chasing dust bunnies and hairballs trying to suck them up. And yes I have made sure its on the right settings. I have only had this vac a few months and already need to replace filter and cannot find filters in store, so have had to order online which is NOT a plus for me. Spend the extra money on a good vacuum, you'll be sorry with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best lightweight vacuum","review":"I bought the eureka optima to use when I didn't feel like using my full size self propelled vacuum. Boy was I surprised!This vacuum has all the power of a large unit and it is lightweight and EASY to use! Dirt cup is simple to empty and filter is easy to wash. Best money I ever spent - I am buying 2 more for Christmas gifts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider it a short-term investment","review":"The vac worked very well and had great features for the price, including the brush roller on/off. The motor is strong and the unit is quite lightweight. However, in less than a year, the handle started loosening and could not be resecured; this was simply annoying. Last week, we lost a wheel, and after further investigation, we realized that the wheel had simply SPUN IN A CIRCLE too much and wore the thin plastic clips securing the wheel right off. Barring some amazing repair work, I think it has died. It is a shame that this vacuum in now garbage because of such a stupid flaw. I guess I have a giant dustbuster now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little vacuum cleaner!","review":"What can I say? For $60, you cannot beat the quality. This little things sucks dirt like you wouldn't believe. I love the open front because you see the dirt as it is being sucked up. It's light weight and so well worth the money. If I had one complaint about this gem, it would be the cleaning of the filter. I have to stop often during vacuuming to empty the cup and clean the filter. I use gloves and I put on my shower cap to do so.I would recommend this product to anyone and anyone who may live in a small apartment as me.Even with the complaint of the filter, I am still giving this item 5 stars. With the filter getting filled easily, that means the product is doing it's job."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could give it zero stars...","review":"I read the reviews posted on here, and thought, gee, this seems like a pretty good vacuum. Quite wrong, I can assure you.I have never left a review online. However, this product was *so bad* that it overpowered my laziness and forced me to rate it. I just finished \\"vacuuming\\" (and I use that term loosely), and I must say, other than the lines on the floor, you really couldn't tell. I ran over the same little piece of string on my carpet about six times before bending over and picking it up. And yes, all of you naysayers, I did have the thing set to suck through the floor and not the tube. And suck it did, but not in the way that I purchased it to do.Avoid this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"After much consideration","review":"I read all the review of Amazon.com about this item prior to making a purchase, I have also waited for about 2 weeks and at least 5 cleaning cycles before reviewing this item.I can only say one thing: \\"I love this vacum\\". It's the right size and it sucks up dirt and cat hair like no other vacum I have owned (full zise included). My husband and I now argue who gets to use the vacume, we both love using it. I have found that the best way to clean the filter is to run it under warm water and let it dry over night. I also wash out the dirt recepticle with warm water to get rid of all the dust. As with any bagless the best way to empty out the recepticle is to do it outside.Two weeks later, 5 vacume jobs (includes both floors and stairs in our townhouse) this thing is still going strong, I would not hesitate to recommend this vacum to anyone considering the purchase. Well worth the $60.****************3 years later still going strong!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful but a little bit loud","review":"Power beyond believe but a little bit loud, it would be great if they can silence it a bit.You can actually hear how powerful the suction is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes care of my needs","review":"I purchased same to assist me in keeping my office clean and organized and the Vacuum Cleaner does just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst ever vacuum cleaner in the market!! period!!","review":"Give it just 2 weeks!! and to top it off, the customer service sucks big time!!

My mother has one, it gets used once/week in a one-bedroom apartment. After 3 years of use, the plastic tabs on the axles that hold the plastic wheels have broken off, and there's no way to fix them. Eureka Customer service can only sell you a new base at $79.99, which is more than the vacuum costs. I've called and pleaded with them to send me a new base free, which after doing some web research, I've found they've done for others - they'll call me back in 1 to 2 days. Clearly a design flaw - probably pays in the long run pay a bit more and get a better-made vacuum. Personally, I have a 16 year old Miele that I paid $400 for. It's VERY quiet, well-designed, and still works perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll love it until the wheels fall off!","review":"The wheel bearings of this vaccum are made of plastic and they will always break. Mine lasted about four months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me of a fancy witch's broomstick!","review":"This was a wonderful purchase. I wanted a vacuum cleaner which was lightweight and easy, while still being powerful. I put this on my wedding registry hoping someone would actually get it for me... I ended up buying it off the registry for myself! And I'm so glad I did. It is lightweight and easy to store. The color is a strange green but not ugly, just different. Easy to assemble and powerful pick-up. Just be sure to make sure you have the correct setting on (carpet vs floor) or you may be fooled into thinking that it's not working very effectively. The price is reasonable and well worth it given the quality purchase you are making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but with problems","review":"This vacuum works very well at picking up dirt and being lightweight and convenient. And it is especially handy for those that like disposable items. Because this is a disposable vacuum cleaner. Use it for a while and the wheels will start to fall off. So much so that my wife is about to pull her hair out. The wheels are plastic on plastic contraptions and soon as a little dust or dirt gets in their they start wearing away rapidly till they fall off. If it wasnt for the wheel problem this would be in my opinion at least a 4 star vacuum. But then we have had it about a year and thats probably the reason they only carry a one year warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major design flaw...","review":"I bought it in a store without checking Amazon reviews first. As you've probably already read in other reviews here, the exhaust on this vacuum comes out the front. This makes the vacuum practically a useless noise machine on hard floor types. The dirt just gets blown around the room by the exhaust before it can get vacuumed. It's probably not as bad on carpeted floors, but that doesn't help me. I had to \\"fix\\" the vacuum with some plastic and duct tape to re-direct the exhaust upwards rather than forwards, and now it works fine. With my addition to the vacuum installed, I might give it 3-4 stars, but out of the box i would give it 1-2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT DESIGNED FOR HARD-WOOD FLOORS","review":"When you think of a Eureka product, you would normally think about a high-quality engineered product. NOT IN THIS CASE...!!!The air discharge from the unit blows on the area that your about to clean. This discharge blows dirt & dust all over the place, if, your using it to clean hard-wood floors. After you use this for a period of time, you'll notice that you will have excessive dust build-up on your tables & furniture.Save yourself some money and buy a leaf-blower. It will be much faster and you can use it outdoors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd design","review":"This vacuum has excellent suction. And the canister empties easily and fits well. But the exhaust is in the FRONT, so that everything you intend to pick up gets blown into the air. Absurd design. It's also a bit heavy to be considered a lightweight and is very cumbersome and difficult to maneuver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute and modern but NOT functional","review":"I bought this upright b/c I was tired of lugging around a heavy and bulky vacuum. I have been extremely disappointed with it. It is cheaply made; the hose always falls off during vacuuming, and the adjustable handle always goes up and down b/c it won't stay fastened (it has just a cheap, plastic fastening system), which makes for an extremely annoying, not to mention laborious, vacuuming experience. This thing is not as lightweight as it is advertised to be either. Suction is good, however, and clean up is easy with no bag to empty or replace. Overall, I think this product fails to deliver on its promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised works so well!","review":"I love this vacuum! I was looking for something small and inexpensive. I never owned a Eureka before so had no idea of how their products performed. For $50 it is very much worth the price. I love vacuuming with it and the carpet looks like new. Suctions very well and easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"I thought this lightweight upright would be good for my office. It's where we have the cat's litter box and the litter gets scattered all over the low, industrial-type carpet. It totally sucks (haha) at picking up the kitty litter. It mostly just scatters it around. The hose attachment is even worse; there is hardly any suction at all and I have to hold the hose directly over the litter to pick it up (you can't hold it at an angle, thereby cutting down on the amount of surface you have to cover).I don't use it on other carpeted rooms and I rarely even use it for its intended purpose. I usually drag out the big guns if I want it to really look nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Normally, I hate to give bad reviews. But this vacuum cleaner was so disappointing. I loved it at first, but it broke barely ten days -- not even a full two weeks -- after I bought it! I used it maybe four or five times on hardwood floors -- and Oriental throw rugs with low naps -- in two rooms, just to give you an idea of how quickly the thing fell apart...and under what low-stress conditions.Then one day I smelled something -- a slight burning odor -- while I was vacuuming...and I thought it was my imagination at first. Then the vacuum cleaner abruptly shut itself off.I wouldn't complain if it had fallen apart after several months...after all, it's not terribly expensive. The warranty is a year, so I probably wouldn't mind fixing it if something happened toward the end of the warranty.But two weeks?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite inconvenient","review":"I used it 2.5 times. Then it stopped running at a nice vigorous whir and groaned slowly. I turned it off and read the owner's manual. The book says the machine will shut itself down if it gets too hot. The cure is to give it a 1/2 hour break. I gave it a 1-week break and tried again. After vacuuming about 125 sq ft, it slowed and groaned again. It has seen only very light service. I live by myself in a 1-br apartment, and I'm pretty clean. Most of the rug just lies there unused. I detest doing housework, but I vacuum the rug once a month (or maybe once in 6 weeks) whether it needs it or not. The machine broke down after very little use. I checked the refund policy and I'd had it too long for that. I checked the warranty, and I was covered, so I took it to the shop. Two weeks later, I got it back and gave the carpet some long overdue attention. The vacuum works ok now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Vacuum!","review":"My husband and I got this vacuum for our wedding 4 years ago. It is a great little vacuum cleaner! We used it on carpet and wood as needed and I think it did everything great. I love the small size since we didn't have lots of extra space. There are filters to replace,but if you take the filter out and knock it around in the trash can you can keep from having to replace it too often. The only issues we ever had was that the turning mechanism would stop turning on the floor setting,but this was because my hair(I have very long hair) got so tangled up in it that we had to cut the hair off and it would work fine again. I honestly think my hair would mess any vacuum up. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great, affordable, portable, and powerful vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"hyped reviews not the best not even close!","review":"Great as a second vac;but drawbacks abound.I got this based on the reviews but....the cord is too short;the vac feels cheap; the head of the vac is very small which means it will take longer to finish the job..Only.lvpositive.

The debris I vacuum up is clogging up the vent (I think there is suppose to be some air current that pushes the debris from the bottom of the vacuum up into the clear container). Anyways, this presents a major problem because after using it for a couple minutes, it starts getting louder and louder until it completely (overheats? and) shuts-off. I have to take out the clear container and clean off the clogged vent to use it again. Thank goodness I only have three small rooms with carpet. This is very disappointing nevertheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"I don't know what these reviewers have been smoking, but this vacume is neither \\"super\\" or \\"mighty\\".

It also OVERHEATSAND SHUTS OFF half the time I use it for more than 20 minutes.It is easy to clean, I have to admit, and light... but what good is that if it does not perform?Two stars is the most I can give this vacuum, my wife would probably give it 0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"After light using aproximately twice a week using it on a very small area (300 sq feet) the motor started overheating heavily and then stopped working after 1 month of use.

Not only is it affordable. It is a great vacuum. I was tired of canister vacuums where you always have to keep replacing bands and bags. This vacuum has worked well consistently for years. The only reason I don't give it a '5' is that the cord is a bit short. All in all it has been the best vacuum I have ever owned far outperforming many more expensive ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Quality","review":"We use this vacuum in the store I work at on the little square of carpet by the door and it probably only took me a month to break many of the components, and not on purpose. See the way the model is holding the vacuum in the 4th picture down? Don't do that, because the handle just completely broke off from the vacuum (resulting the vacuum landing on my foot) and now it won't stay attached if you pull the vacuum back too quickly. Also, the gray button to extend the handle has broken off, I can't remember how that happened. There is a weird smell that emanates from the vacuum while it is being used, like burning rubber, or burning something. The cord is terribly short and we have to use an extension cord for it.It does the job, though. It vacuums everything it needs to and does nothing more. Still, I think even $70 is a little steep for this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK! What Happened?","review":"I used to have a Eureka Optima Vacuum (red) in a slightly different model, that worked beautifully. I have now tried this model (431DX) for the second time and I'm returning it. Why? It cleans well. It looks good. It's compact. It has strong suction. All the things I liked with my first Optima. But this one has a terrible odor when you vacuum. I can see this happening if you've had your vacuum for awhile or fail to clean the filter, but this is brand new out of the box. What is going on here? My son just walked in the house and wanted to know what the awful smell was....needless to say, all the doors are open to air out the house. Thank goodness for Amazon's great customer service on returns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Bought this vacuum six months ago. Easy to put together. Loved it at first. After two months the sucking power started to dwindle. Four months after that the little indicator light that the brush had hair in it came on. I checked the brush and it was hair free but the brush still wouldn't roll. I thought maybe it was the belt and referred to the manual. No mention of a belt. I called customer service and they told me there was no belt and I would have to take it to their service station 200 miles away. In a last ditch effort, I took it apart. They had lied. There IS a belt, but it was intact. I did a little digging and found out that the vacuum has a chip, that when the roller gets stuck, turns off the roller. Well apparently that chip went out and would cost more to replace than replacing the vacuum. Oh yeah, did I mention this happened right when my six month warranty was up? I have also heard of this happening to a lot of other people too."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ENGINEERED FOR HARD-WOOD FLOOR CLEANING!","review":"When you think of a Eureka product, you would normally think about a high-quality engineered product.

It doesn't have the power to pick up anything heavier than a dust bunny, and even those don't get collected because there is a fan in the front of the vacuum which just blows everything out of the path. I end up running over the same piece of debris (small, as in small down feather / seed / pine needle) over and over and over until I finally just bend over and pick it up. I go over the carpets about 4-5 times before I feel like I might have done some good and stopping. Can't wait to find a new vacuum.It is very light, small, and compact and great for vacuuming stairs with the hose feature. For the price, if you want something small to vacuum the stairs that is portable, then this is the right tool for the job. Otherwise, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"design flaw - exhaust blows in the front","review":"The exhaust fan blows in the front of the vacuum.

I love having onboard tools and hose, BUT, this is the second one in less than 2 years, and there is something wrong with a vacuum that breaks that quickly. The first one the roller brushes stopped turning after 3 months, this one has almost stopped working at all. One of the motors is obviously dead. Fortunately because of our experience with the first one we bought the extended warranty. Back it goes.

At first, I loved it! It was small, lightweight and easy for our older sons to use (not that they like vacuuming anymore). My biggest complaint is that you have to empty the canister practically after every use, that is, if you want it to perform at peak. And EWWWWW is it a dusty mess when you go to empty it - I always took it out to the garage straight to the dumpsters - still a dusty MESS!!!!Last night, it completely broke. I got one room and my kitchen done, and when I got to the family room, KERPLUNK! The motor just lost power and suction ceased to exist! :( I know I only paid $60 for this vacuum, so I can't expect gold, but now I'm struggling with what to replace it with - without spending hundreds of dollars on a stupid vacuum cleaner - have I mentioned that I don't like to vacuum? LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who ever hated bags?","review":"When my vacuum died, bagless options were the only ones I found. Every time since, I've hated it. Dumping out the canister spreads dust, the filter gets gunked and clogged up in just one circuit around my small studio apartment, and for a light vacuum, pushing this one takes an inordinate amount of effort.Spend a bit more and get a self propelled one. Better yet, look for an antique with a nice tidy bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE....","review":"I bought this vacuum this past June 2006, and at first, I was thrilled with it. Not only was it nice and compact, but it did a great job of sucking up dust and dog hair. For the price, it was unbeatable deal. Then, just last week, the vacuum died completely. No suction whatsoever. And of course, when I tried to call and have Eureka honor the 1-year warranty, I was unable to get a human voice on the phone. I am throwing this darn thing in the trash and getting another vacuum. Hopefully, I'll have better luck this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't take this if it was free","review":"This has got to be the worst vacuum I've ever owned. It clogs all the time where the dirt enters the chamber and I have to clean the filter between each use. I've had this for over a year and within the first couple of months, it had lost suction. I imagine it would be an ok vacuum for a dorm room where there is very little area to vacuum. As soon as I can afford a new vacuum, I'll be putting this one on the curb. I wouldn't even give this away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost wonderful","review":"It vacuums dog hair like nothing else I've used but you have to clean it every other time you use it. The cord could use 10' or so in additional length. The handle retracts nicely and it's light weight makes it easy to move around. I think the thing I like about it the most is the narrow suction strip or whatever it's called. I think the high power motor coupled with the narrow strip equates to superior suction but a little more time in use.This vacuum is totally worth the $60."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst purchase ever!!!","review":"Just got done vaccuuming one room with my new vaccuum, and went immediately to my computer to order something else! It weighs 11 pounds apparently, but somehow feels like 50 pounds when you are trying to push it around the room. The suction seemed good, which is probably one of the reasons it doesn't want to budge across the floor, it did seem to pick up all the hair and little stuff on the carpet. I'm absolutely exhausted from having done just one room, it is not self-propelled, and I could not push it around without using both hands. One reviewer called it a workout, they weren't kidding! I will probably try to use it for the stairs if the hose attachment works well, but I'm definately buying something else to do the rest of the house!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted About A Month","review":"This machine apparently could not handle fine wood dust.

The suction and functionality is awesome too. If you're tall like myself, the extra long retractable handle is a definitely plus. Like all these new vacuums with removeable filters, it gets clogged after a month or so (I have a medium hair cat so maybe not so much with petless homes) and it never really cleans out all that well. A second filter came in the box and after I popped that in it was like a brand new vacuum all over again. I'm not a fan of emptying this type of vacuum, dust and grossness fly around so I am sure to do this outside by the trash bin..highly recommend this detail. It stores so well and really gets the carpets clean. **UPDATE** Hard to find replacement filters for this vacuum. Minus a star if I could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"think its the coolest","review":"this little thing works great. i love the handle--i love how it goes down and gets so short for easy storage. i love the suction--it is great. the only reason that i give it a 4 and not a 5 is because i don't really like that you have to remember not only to turn the button for the brush off after doing carpet and then using the wand attachment, but you also have to turn the floor/hose knob which is down below and its easy to forget that one until you realize that it isn't sucking as well as it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bagless and Painless","review":"The Eureka 431A is the best gift I bought myself in the last 3 years!

My house is so clean!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aren't vacuum cleaners suppose to suck up dust and not blow it around?","review":"Well.....there is one major design flaw with this vacuum. Yes, it has strong suction, it is light weight, and versatile.However, there is the fan right above the floor....The vacuum ends up blowing air out of this vent with such force, that all of the dust nearby ends up getting shot into the air. No matter how much suction power this vacuum has, most of the dust gets blown into the air. Definitely not good for us allergy sufferers.Maybe this doesn't seem to be a problem for people who only vacuum carpets.....or maybe they just can't see the dust flying as easily as I can with some wood floors.You would think the designers who created this model would have recognized this huge flaw. I don't recommend this product. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Vacuum EVER","review":"Do not buy this vacuum. It has good suction, but it ends there. It was clearly designed by a man who never does housework. The cord is too short, so when you get going, it unplugs from the wall. The hose attachment is faulty and keeps popping out of its holder, so you have to stop and fix it. It has a giant blower on the FRONT of the vacuum, so as you move toward stuff, it blows it all over and away from the actual vacuum. The cord is attached very low on the back of the vacuum, so you constantly step on it, or you have to reach way down to lift it up and out of the way. And for reasons unknown, it also hurts my back, probably because I have to bend over constantly to adjust all the pieces and the cord. It is just awful, and every time I use it I want to take it to the curb for garbage day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless!","review":"I bought this after reading everyone's glowing review...did we use the same vacuum? This cleaner is very powerful for its size...but it sits so low and has such tiny front wheels that it is sucked onto the carpet and can barely be pushed along with two hands! The beater brush has gaps between the tufts that completely miss animal fur and fuzz.

This is the ultimate party album. The music is completely goofy, but irresistable. You can't help but smile and dance.

If you steadfastly refuse to take life seriously, this is the album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"you've never heard \\"Bolero\\" like this!","review":"This contains their typical mix of witty, silly, strange music (whatever you're mood in). My personal favorite is Bolero. Yes, this is the famous classic piece by Ravel! It's done in a 60s-jazz lounge style, with jazzy saxaphones swinging the melody over vibes and drumset. \\"It's a hoot\\" to say the least, but it really works well! Very creative.They do a similar treatment to the \\"Star Treck\\" theme, making it sound like a romantic ballad the first part, then adding odd blips and bleeps on the repeat.Every other song is also a killer (with a lot of tongue-in-cheek), listen to the samples and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks!","review":"Do not buy this awful cheap made in china product.

The plot is weak, (as PKD himself admitted) the characters aren't great and some of the dialogue is absolutely cringe-worthy.If you haven't read them I would suggest: Ubik, The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch or Maze of Death instead, they follow similar themes (with less emphasis on the study of schizophrenia) as Martian Time Slip but are much better, more interesting works."},{"rating":"2","title":"The future is near","review":"I like this book for the great ability of the writer to show real what is absurd or fantastic. Dick is a visionary man that write with basic and semplicity events or people allucinant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"Like I said, ho-hum. A plodding story about some folks living on a Mars that is very much like, say, the Australian outback. The spacey twist revolves around a character who can see through time and influence it, and the efforts of another to use that power for his own selfish interests. Mildly diverting, but I can't understand how it would motivate another reviewer to run out and buy everything by the author. But then, I've read several other of Dick's novels and I can't say that any of them has lived up to the hype. He's definitely got an interesting outlook, but his writing is just average and frequently incoherent (at least to me). Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh","review":"In the beginning there was the book and the book told a story.

Nevertheless, many of these stories surive to this day for had they not they would have failed to.Philip Dick was disinterested in this idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"An existential masterpiece, disguised as sci-fi","review":"Not one of the very well known Philip K. Dick novels, but still, this is a brilliant endeavour into the exploration of the depths of human nature, delivered with exceptional style and intensity. The fact that action takes place on mars, and the sci-fi element in general, are of secondary importance here. Dick talks about his favorite subject - reality and the meaning of it, but it also talks about love, greed, desire, and death.Dick was a giant of the 20th century American literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Novel of ideas succeeds as art","review":"Of course Dick spins a fantastic yarn in lean and efficient prose. But infused into his plot there's a mind-bending metaphysical tension alongside the ringing of a profound alarm bell. What consequences on the psyches of our children this mad mad world we're creating?With this book I think you can find yourself any combination of entertained, puzzled or terrified right down to the whimpering core of your spiritual self.Has science fiction ever aspired to such heights?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Novel Of Ideas","review":"Suspension of disbelief is necessary when reading science fiction - it took a lot for this one. Canals on mars, the odd and inaccurate descriptions of various mental illnesses, etc. But that isn't the point - Philip K Dicks' are novels of ideas and this one is about time travel and more importantly the concept of arriving at truth via mental illness. Very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, and a little creepy","review":"I really enjoyed this one.

I have read early Dick novels, and I have read late Dick novels.

It is emotional and unscientific to such a degree that it is hard to describe. Outrageous claims are made with no explanation or scientific backing what so ever. A quick look at a random page reveals her weird thinking: \\"if we follow our heart and do what we are meant to do with this life, then we become dedicated spiritual beings, and we can be granted an extra portion of energy from the universe.\\"It is very tiring to look for useful information in between all the \\"crazy stuff\\". I still did, and even though I found most of the book to be utterly useless, there were a couple of interesting anecdotes on how trusting your taste buds might lead you to the foods you need, and a few other interesting points.

Also, she makes it seem like a sin that people are \\"addicted\\" to food, well ya, we have to eat or we die, right? She suggests these ridiculously long fasts, describing that when her daughter was fasting she couldnt even hold her arms up any longer. She tells you to avoid places like coffee shops, movie theaters or anywhere else public where you may be tempted to eat \\"forbidden\\" foods, or even smell them!

This is not a book to get if you are just starting to learn about raw foodism.This book is so subjective it kind of turned me off from the raw movement. It's a little creepy actually. It's purely anecdotes of the author's personal experience.

I imagine they skimmed the book becuase it wasn't even FACTUAL. I however, am only half way through the book and I love it. The receipies are a God-sent.

I read that Phil was originally going to use the music from this album for a movie soundtrack, and so accordingly this album has a strong unity to it.A wide variety of emotions are expressed here. \\"Foreshadow\\" and \\"Floating On Ice\\" have a mystical feel to them, \\"Grand Old Man\\" a folk charm, and \\"The Apprentice\\" a reflective happiness. Sadness may be missing, as is true on many Keaggy albums, but I surmise that it true because he intentionally wishes to express the spiritual joy in his life. (He is certianly capable of creating it--just listen to \\"The Survivor\\" once.)Though the other \\"Music to Paint By\\" series are weaker than this one, all four definitely stand out, especially this one.

Hooked up several different video sources and ran and HDMI cable to my Pioneer plasma television. The first problem I had was an annoying hum from all speakers. After trying many debug options I finally debugged it to the HDMI connection. With HDMI connected (several different cables) the hum was there, without it no hum. In addition I had the same video problem listed before as well. There was a scrolling line that went slowly up the screen with all video sources. So I tried to set everything up removing the HDMI cable and just running component video to the plasma. While the sound was now very good it still had that annoying scroll line on all video sources. Given that I had to return it. I just got a Yamaha 661 and am happy with it so far but I had to give up the dream of one HDMI cable to the plasma, too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent incomplete; quit responding to e-mails","review":"The receiver arrived late, after my email question reminded seller to ship.

The digital inputs have to be mapped to sources, but the manual and on-screen guide make it easy.As with any high powered AVR, this unit gets quite hot after several hours of on-time, so make sure your cabinet has good ventilation. I'd suggest letting this unit be the top of the stack (nothing above it) to increase airflow.Overall, a fantastic product."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied","review":"Set up was fairly easy and intuitive. The receiver works well as a pass through for my 2 HDMI connections (cable, DVD). Musically, it has some glitches which are elucidated in other reviews, but most can be worked around. The zone 2 audio can accept a digital source through analog cables (ie my external XM radio plugged in to the tape audio input through red/black cables plays and sounds fine). I imagine an iPOD will do the same but haven't tried yet. But you can't play a CD in your DVD player that's connected through HDMI. You do have to turn up the audio fairly high to hear it on main or zone 2, which I don't think is related to my speakers. It's inaudible below about -30, which begs the question what those first 30 levels are for? It won't rattle the windows, but it's plenty loud for a party.At the price range offered on Amazon w/ free shipping from J&R;, it's hard to beat unless you're a true audio or videofile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs too hot","review":"After 3 or 4 hours of playing, the product is gets incrediblyhot.

I like the auto speaker set up to help your configure the speakers to be more adaptable to your room. The only draw back is the FM Tuner, it states it has an internal FM tuner, picks up nothing, it came with an antenna but I can't find the hook up in the back, the only thing I see is for AM, maybe someone can help me with this one.

This book in particular outlines the buttons, broaches, belt buckles, needle cases (and lots more) that went into the clothing of the time.

Parts of the footage seemed recycled - we heard very similar discussions about ski wax in the separate \\"tuning\\" and \\"equipment primer\\" sections. You cannot watch the DVDs straight through as they dump you back into a main menu after you complete a scene. So you must frequently fiddle with the controls to select scenes to watch.

No wonder she's single. This gal is bitter. Twisted would be a compliment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny...","review":"I wish it was funny. I really did. I stopped watching at 6 minutes in, read the reviews, and figured maybe I judged her too quick. I didn't though, it still sucked. Like you chuckle once or twice every 5 minutes but it still doesn't make up for how bad it is. I really didn't wanna give up, but truth is she just wasn't that funny. Everything I chuckled at, are things guys already joke about. She tries to make a joke out of some of the weird and irrational things some women may do (men are no better though) but it just doesn't work.Save yourself the trouble, it's not that funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello, Silence, My Old Friend . . .","review":"I don't blame Whitney--too much.I blame the people who're \\"managing\\" her, who're exploiting her looks, who're providing her opportunities she's not ready for, who're telling her she's funnier than she actually is. Her accountants, probably.I don't know, maybe someday, if she keeps working at it, she will indeed be funny. But she ain't funny yet. And if her \\"people\\" really cared about her, they'd have told her so. And they'd have reined her in a bit, the way jockeys reign in their horses. And they'd have continued working her, running her around the track till she was good and frothy. And then they'd have mucked out her stall and strapped on her feed bucket and waited for the right time, the right conditions. That's why you gotta love jockeys, even though they're kinda scary in a group of four or more, because they do what's right for their horses.Whitney, if you're reading this, fire your people. Find yourself a jockey. And tally ho, my sweet. Tally ho . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible, terrible","review":"Not funny at all. I watched the first 10 minutes and didn't laugh once. What a waste. I want my 10 minutes back"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was free and I still want a refund.","review":"This is just as good as her tv show, which is painful to watch.

I'm a guy and I thought it was funny. Not laugh out loud funny... but nod your head yes and smile with an occasionaly knowing chuckly funny. As an added bonus... Whitney is super hot. The woman's perspective on sex and guys is pretty spot on too. Enjoy!~"},{"rating":"2","title":"fuuuny!!!","review":"Laughed the whole time we were watching!! Whitney Cummings touches on several issues that are true and makes them humorous =P LOVED IT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitney","review":"I was force-fed this mediocre wretch of a comedian on \\"Chelsea Lately\\" (a show I grew to loathe over time and do not watch any longer). I didn't like her then, like her even less now. Over-exposed (with a TV show of her own on NBC), unoriginal, pedantic, boring, loud, un-funny and lame. The polar opposite of several accomplished female comedians such as Lisa Lampinelli. Lynne Koplitz, Maria Bamford and Jackie Kashian. Proof that mediocrity continues to reign in this day and age.Whitney Cummings: Money Shot"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost turned it off, glad I didn't","review":"Her voice is abrasive, the first 5-10 minutes aren't funny at all... but, then I was too lazy to turn it off and found myself laughing at the jokes. I don't know if she got better, or if my brain just gave in to her screeching yelling voice, but I actually liked it. Who knew?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny when it's been done before but better!","review":"The jokes have been done before, only better. She feels the need to cuss and be vulgar to gain a larger male audience but really all you need to do is be funny and original."},{"rating":"1","title":"This passes for comedy?","review":"I can't imagine how this woman ever moved past \\"open mike night\\" at the local club. Is it because she's pretty (not gorgeous, not \\"hot,\\" just pretty)? Is it because she yells and calls the audience \\"bitches\\"? Is this what passes for comedy in the internet age? Please don't tell me it's what passes for talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past the first 15 minutes","review":"This was horrible. I don't know if it got any better but I wasn't going to try to find out. A good comedian will at least set you up with a few good jokes in the beginning just to get you in the mood. This lady proves she couldn't get a person in the mood unless it was a very short term relationship, which I kept it at.Not really funny... at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I almost made it half way through this","review":"And that was a huuuuuge accomplishment. Maybe about 1 in 10 of her jokes actually made me laugh. She just comes off as a horrible person to be in a relationship with, and it seems like her life view is from the 90s or 80s."},{"rating":"1","title":"that voice...","review":"I decided to watch this because I enjoy her sit com on TV, but lord almighty, this aint the same person at all. First off, she's yelling most of the time for now obvious reason. She seems really ill at ease and most importantly, the jokes just aren't funny. I guess I better enjoy her show while it lasts, since it seems like most people don't like it and this online video ain't cutting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"amusing, not hilarious","review":"I decided to watch this after seeing her on Jimmy Fallon plugging her new show. She seemed funny during her interview but I was disappointed with this performance. Her comedy often comes across as mocking and bitter. Her spiteful humor centers almost exclusively on relationships. As others mention, there are not a lot of original jokes, and none that are laugh out loud. It is amusing, and she certainly puts a lot of energy and effort into the material but fails to deliver innovative and laugh out loud comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT","review":"Don't waste your time. Dreadful and abrasive. Not funny. Probably the worst comedy ever. Raspy and loud. Rent almost anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible!","review":"A little background on why I decided to watch this:I've seen Whitney Cummings on the show \\"Whitney\\" and I thought that show was pretty good. I generally like actors/actresses' standup better than their characters on any shows.Originality aside, right from the start the jokes were crude and patronizing toward men. I thought this was just the first side to her show and at the second half she would point out women's insecurities in an equally condescending fashion, however that never happened. The show never got better and at the end all I can do now is blur it altogether as one giant man hating rant.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a good laugh.Conversely, I would recommend this to any women who just had a bad breakup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"She truly should try a new career; she is not funny at all. This was definately one of the worst stand up routines I've ever seen. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old jokes","review":"Her voice was a little difficult to get used to and most of her jokes were unoriginal. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it just never did. 48 minutes of my life I will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headache","review":"WHY IS SHE YELLING? Holy crap, my head is pounding.Also, not funny. I didn't really laugh at all. A couple of forced giggles every so often, but that's it. Where's the tylenol?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I found myself thinking, \\"Where have I heard that joke before?\\" several times throughout Whitney's performance.Her delivery is mediocre, the jokes are mediocre, and I just didn't enjoy it.I don't think I'm a part of her target audience, though, as a male mid 20something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I had the misfortune of having to sit through this while visiting a couple of friends. Not only is the stand-up not funny, I found Whitney Cummings to be the most horrifying embodiment of female stereotypes imaginable. She rants about how ugly she thinks male genitals are and how audacious a man is for asking her to coffee (rather than paying for an expensive dinner), among many other obnoxious topics. Avoid this unless you are bitter, high maintenance, and man-hating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to Watch...","review":"It's truly painful to watch. Not funny in the slightest bit, I really just feel sorry for her. The live audience doesn't really laugh that much... and when they do it's obviously a forced laugh, like why the hell did I pay money for this kind of laugh... Save yourself the time and money, and find something else to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"I would give her a zero if it were possible.Yelling, angry, misandrist telling same old tired jokes. I sear they paid the audience to laugh.Granted I'm an older guy, but hey-I'm down with a comedian (or comedienne) highlighting the inconsistent foibles between the sexes - it can be funny, regardless of who's being lampooned, *if* it comes from someone who's truly amused at humanity, instead of critical and condescending.This gal ain't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fran Dresher minus the pleasant voice.","review":"I made it twenty minutes in before stopping to review this. This chick represents her hometown well. DC also generates nothing but poorly delivered, re-hashed drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly cliche-ridden hack stuff...","review":"I really wanted her to be funny. I really did.But then she started telling her \\"jokes\\".Not only were they all recycled from every other female comedian's trash bin, but they were usually followed by an \\"am I right, Ladies?\\".\\"Money Shot finds Cummings riffing on a wide range of topics chiefly, the differences between men and women and how both tend to behave in relationships.\\" Just from that description you can tell that you're never going to get anything even remotely original from this woman.Oh yeah, and she told jokes about the difference between Diesel fuel and Unleaded Gasoline...seriously.Her act could not be more hacky and cliche.If she wasn't a tall, thin and (to some...not to me) attractive woman, she would definitely not be a success at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I think she yells too much. I just have no idea how she can yell through the ENTIRE special and not have something wrong with her voice. And her jokes aren't too good either. For most of her act, she has ok jokes but really bad delivery but sometimes it's just all bad. Like a high school joke that someone who isn't your friend would think is extremely stupid and immature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that funny.","review":"FULL DISCLOSURE: I only made it about 13 minutes in.She telegraphs her punchlines, so you already know what they are before she gets to them. Delivery has no personality. It's like SIRI telling jokes up there. Watch the trailer. If you like the trailer, you'll like the whole routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Stuff","review":"I didn't really know her before this, but I think she is hysterical! Not kid friendly but funny! I was disappointed with the length though! Should have been longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously, why is she yelling at me?","review":"Only made it through the first 10 minutes of this, and I'm glad I decided to quit.Her voice is obnoxious, she yells, just terrible. The comedy Defensive Driving class I went to had better material than this. Very glad I didn't actually pay for this (free with Amazon Prime)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa! Amazingly BAD","review":"I got through 5 minutes and had to turn it off. Just really crummy comedy. She forces expletives and sensational language about anatomy to cover up her complete lack of comedic talent. Isn't the whole world tired of penis jokes and the word \\"vagina?\\" It's like a perpetual re-run. This video might be free, but unless you live under a rock, you won't be able to afford this travesty. What junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slow Train Wreck","review":"A slow train wreck would have to be less painful than this awful \\"comedy\\" It should be removed immediately due to the annoying shrill of her voice and the recycled not funny jokes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired old jokes trotted out once more for mediocre laughs.","review":"Whitney Cummings takes comedy in new and interesting directions, exploring topics like the differences between men and women, how much she hates morning sex, and her deep hatred of wrinkly scrotal skin.Oh wait... none of that is new, original or funny.She is a shrill fetid boil on the ass of American comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peurile Vulgarity","review":"Even if it were possible to get by the screechy voice (it's not), this performance is incredibly bad.
