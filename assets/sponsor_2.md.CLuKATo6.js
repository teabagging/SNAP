It does an great job of keeping the wipes warm and the light comes in handy at night.I only had a couple incidents where the wipes dried out.

I don't even add water and the wipes still retain moisture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Wipe Warmer","review":"My husband was very opposed to getting a wipe warmer, we have a 21 month old and are expecting our second child in a couple months. My best friend swears by hers and talked about how much easier it was changing her newborn's diaper when the wipe was warm. We'll see in a few months if it makes a difference, my toddler does seem to squirm a little less when I wipe him now though. Overall, the warmer works really nice. We got a Munchkin organizer rack that it sits on top of so I would also recommend that. It keeps the wipes warm and moist- just be sure to pour a half cup of water over the wipes when you are putting in a new set of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for warming the wipes.","review":"We like this product for many reasons. Our son did not mind when we used cool wipes during the day, so we have not used the warmer as a warmer very much. At night, the warmer is very handy because you can tap the light on and have enough light to work by. Additionally, if you purchase wipes that are in packages like the Kirkland brand, when you start getting to the bottom of the package, the entire package lifts up and you struggle to get just one wipe out. With this warmer, you put the entire package of 100 wipes into it and it easily dispenses wipes one at a time until the last one. When we do use it as a warmer, it works just fine. We do not have a problem with the wipes drying out. All in all, a good product and we would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design Flaw","review":"The top won't stay shut. I hoped we had a defective one, returned it and purchased another. After the first week, it would stay shut again. I found a solution for the wipes that dry out (the more wipes in there, the moister they are). I found that if you add more wipes to the bottom before it's empty, you don't have to throw away the last 5-10 wipes. So many flaws that I worked around, but I refuse to use a paper weight to keep the lid shut. Great concept, bad design. I wonder if the Prince Lionhart brand warmer is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"Love this warmer I have a Munchkin and a Prince lionheart and the munchkin wins hands down. The light is perfect for middle of night changing(as long as level with the little bum) It heats from the top so no burned or dried out wipes. I wish I could trade my PLH in for another munchkin wipes warmer. Having four children I always make this warmer a shower gift must have, changing go so much better for newborns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"Ive had this warmer for almost 2 years and have hated it the whole time! It was fine when my daughter was a small infant. The first time she kicked it tho at about 4 months, the top broke because its just held on by a TINY piece of plastic. So now i take it off every time i get wipes. Also, overnight, the top wipe will dry out. For something that you use 10 times a day-it is very frustrating to work with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps cloth wipes warm","review":"We use this warmer with cloth wipes and it does a great job keeping them warm. It has enough room to fit about 20 cloth wipes which is plenty for a couple of days and doesn't dry out the wipes as it warms from the top, thus the wipes that would dry out first get used first before they dry out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it boasts it will do","review":"This is a handy little device. It doesn't dry out the wipes, and if for some reason they do get dry just add a little water and they will be fine. As a side note, I recommend buying wipes that actually dispense, I bought generic and I have to open up the main container instead of using the little dispenser flap because the wipes wern't folded to dispense.This is great, easy to use and I can confess even though it is a luxury, it sure makes the whole process easier at 3 in the morning when baby is warm from sleeping under the covers, and may not even realize he is wet. Why make him fuss when you can let the neighbors get some sleep right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wipe Warmer","review":"I disliked this warmer because it dried out the wipes.

The wipes tend to fall down often, so you have to open the whole top to get at them instead of them \\"popping-up.\\" The button on the pop-up lid broke so we had to keep it shut with a jar of diaper cream. And in the end, our baby didn't really mind a mildly cold wipe after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dries out the wipes","review":"My review is pretty straight forward. The wipes dry out and they aren't very warm either. I stopped using it after only 3 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's just a box for wipes","review":"the problem with the product is that it takes to long for it to warm up the wipes, as all parents know it's unpredictable when you will be needing them and this thing takes up to 10 to 15 min to warm up. i just can't wait that long to change my baby and i also can't have it plugged and running all day long,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Warm at ALL!!!","review":"Okay so if anybody is buying this for a non-baby DO NOT BUY THIS!!!

The wipe warmer only gets warm on the top lid so it only keeps the very first wipe warm that sticks through the hole. I left it plugged in for a few more hours thinking it just needed more time. Still no luck. I was hoping the whole inside would be warm for all wipes or at least enough to use with one diaper change. I have 2 kids so I would deffinately not recommend this wipe warmer to get both jobs done back to back. I will be returning this and purchasing the Prince Lionheart warmer.

After a few months of use, the plastic lid broke at the point that holds the blue top in place. Now our wipes dry out, the lid regularly falls off, and the product has become a general hassle to use. I'm now trying to go through the process of getting it replaced by Munchkin, but they require sending it back and then waiting weeks for a replacement...probably more time, effort, and shipping costs than the product is worth.My biggest regret is that since buying mine, I've given several of these as gifts to other new parents. POOR QUALITY. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks!","review":"After about 4 weeks of use the warmer began to leak around the blue plastic in front.

Its as good as not having it at all..It only eats up on your electricity charges..the box as such is also not convenient.. Every time i pull a wipe i get 2 or 3 wipes in my hand.. It also wastes your wipes substantially... All in all a very annoying product.. Total waste of money..

I couldn't agree more. It's been great.I made 30 7x7 squares from fleece blankets. I then place them in a tupperware container and pour a solution of Dr. Bronners, Almond Oil, Tea Tree Oil and boiled water. I dump that over the wipes and wait an hour or two. Then I just place them in the warmer and press down a bit so that liquid fills up the bottom just enough to keep things moist. The top wipes are always toasty and our son is a happy camper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find a different warmer","review":"This wipes warmer dries out the upper wipes overnight.

I even use it on my toddler (20 months when my new baby was born) and you can tell they were more comfortable to him warm.

I've had it plugged in for days and the wipes are STILL not dried out (I had one of these - diff. brand - for my first son and the wipes always dried out), they are extremely warm but not hot at all. My little guy loves them. He doesn't squirm or cry when I wipe him with wipes warmed in this. It is VERY well-made, and I love the little light I can use for midnight changes. It also will hold 2+ packs of wipe refills, so it's surprisingly deep for it's size. I could go on and on, but I really love this thing, so does my baby, and so will you! A must buy for any mom or dad. Seriously. And for only 20 bucks... definitely a steal. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"left me cold","review":"i didn't have any issues with this warmer getting mildew or drying out the wipes as some of the other reviewers. however, i still had a couple of complaints. for one, the wipes did not 'pop out' effectively so i would have to open the lid every time to get a wipe. and if it did, i would get a long chain of wipes and have to shove the extras back into the hole. secondly, the disposable wipes did not hold the warmth so by the time it touches my baby's bottom, it's already cold. i could get past the inconvenience of the first part if it did what it's suppose to do. you might have better luck using cloth wipes, but i doubt it - the warmer simply needs to heat at a higher temperature to offset how quickly the heat dissipates. this was a product i thought i just had to have for my nursery, but it was totally unnecessary. save your money for something more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed!","review":"I have a newborn and he hates the feel of cold wipes so this warmer is just what I needed and the nite lite in front is an added bonus.

Unlike Mehta, Bernstein and Klemperer, who all take considerable liberties with the score with sometimes dubious purpose, Jansons' interpretation is rather uncorrupted without ever sacrificing emotional drive and logic. True, the Oslo Philharmonic does not play quite at the level of, say, the Chicago Symphony or the LSO (with Solti), or the Berlin Philharmonic or the Concertgebouw (with Haitink). Nonethelss, it is truly amazing what gorgeous orchestral colors Jansons elicits from this orchestra. Having recently been appointed to the helm of both the Bavarian Radio Symphony and the Royal Concertgebouw--both orchestras with a considerable Mahler heritage and experience--this recording lets us hope that in the not too distant future we will hear even finer accounts of this symphony from the hands of this extraordinarily gifted conductor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Debunked many times over","review":"This book contains nothing but left-wing talking points that have been thoroughly debunked since its writing.

He details the numerous ways UN inspections systematically destroyed Iraq's capability to manufacture WMDs in the 90's, the poor quality and limited shelf-lives of Iraq's WMD's, and the impossiblity that Iraq could reconstitute its programs without obvious detection from satellite and other means.In short, this book correctly refuted all of Bush's claims, correctly predicted there would be no WMD's left in Iraq, and exposed the war-supporters and Neocons as moronic, uneducated fanatics. The traitors and enemies of American values who supported this war against all the evidence have been revealed as uninformed fools and naive dreamers who were shamefully wrong about nearly every aspect of Iraq. They have the blood of our American servicemen on their hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified magazine article","review":"This 'book' is essentially a magazine length interview with Scott Ritter.

It's even often very funny, and the humour is integrated into the work in the most natural way. I felt so full when I finished this novel, I felt it was perfect. Someone in a review I read somewhere (I think it was a poet) described Excessive Joy Injures the Heart as a book for connoisseurs of both language and psychology, and I agree. I have to warn some potential readers, though, that they might not like it. These might be the readers who are expecting something romantic. But then this is so often the case with brilliant novels, it's their fate to be misunderstood. There's no glib pap in this book, it's the real thing.

Thankfully, I didn't receive the Pink one that others have, but I felt like one hard days play with this 'guitar' and it would be broken. The fact that the strings were nylon didn't help its cause.You know the saying 'a penny wise and a pound foolish'? That sums up this experience. I immediately returned this item (thanks Amazon) and went to Ebay and bought another that was only $5 more. I have since received that one and not only was it a few inches longer but had real strings, pick, bridge, the works. This one can be tuned and enjoyed for quite some time.

Unfortunately, they're so poorly made, and the knobs are so loose, that any long-lasting tightening of the strings is completely impossible - to the extent that the strings are so loose, the instrument is nearly unplayable. Any tightening that is possible is quickly lost a few seconds after the ukulele is played.

The boy is musically inclined, but I wasn't prepared to spend a lot of money on a high end instrument. So I tried this one. I didn't expect a high quality tone, but I am shocked at how poor an instrument (toy) it is. It cannot even be tuned to itself. I play a half dozen stringed instruments so I know pretty well how to get around one that's poorly made, but jeez, all I got with this Woodstock Made in China thing was major frustration. I'm taking it back to where bought it & finding a better quality uke elsewhere. At least the old toy pianos were in tune with themselves.

Going back down the other way you have the same problem. I was able to get it reasonably close to in tune but as others mentioned, it wouldn't stay there.It's possible that you just can't get a decent ukulele for this price and in that case I'd spend a few more bucks for something decent. This is really sufficient for pretend or display. Nothing more. Best I can tell, you can get one for around $40 or better yet, get one used.

I say \\"imagine\\" because this DVD is an object lesson in how not to film a ballet. The camera work is frenetic, zooming in and out every few seconds, cutting from one part of the stage to the other without rhyme or reason, destroying all sense of flow and denying the viewer any possibility of appreciating the dancing or the choreography. Half of the shots are only of the dancers' upper bodies. Doesn't the director know that dance involves the feet and the body's line?

As the first review here states, an infant child is found in a barn and the *entire rest of the book centers on the woman who found the child and her desire to adopt him is repeated over and over, ad nauseum. A pseudo romance is sort of written, but only as a reason for the woman to make her quest for adoption more palatable to authorities. The very unlikely conclusion was forced and not believable.

Borderland is a comprehensive overview of Ukraine's complex, misunderstood and often-altered history. Main events and periods have been artfully distilled and interestingly embellished with stories of the author's own experiences living in the country, providing a great deal more than just the facts, but also a taste for the rich culture of the Ukrainian people. Though the book was written several years ago and Ukraine has changed somewhat since that time, the stories are still pertinent if not 100% accurate. In all, Borderlnad is an excellent travel companion and introduction to a fascinating country well-worth exploring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borderland?","review":"Unfortunately the author did not get the basic premise correct. Ukraine does not mean borderland. The oldest use of the word found in written text is in the 10th century chronicle of Slava o Polke Ihoria. The term Ukraine is used as meaning within the kingdom, at the heart of the kingdom. The opposite of what the author writes. Borderland would mean Okraina, this is the difference between in and out. She also missed that Ukraine has the oldest calendar on the planet now dating to 7039. Another significant fact.Maybe the next book could be an new history based on archives from Lutsk and Kyiv that the author did not read. Missing such a basic premise clouds the rest of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Borderland is an Excellent Journey through Ukraine!","review":"\\"Borderland\\" is an excellent book by a very perceptive and knowledgable writer. Volodymyr's points are well taken and certainly valid, but shouldn't become the pitfalls Ukrainians sometimes dig themselves into and fail to see the big picture, the vision and the dream.

Bad art, awful story, tortured writing","review":"I've read a lot of children's books lately, and this is one of the worst. My 6 year old and I were excited to read this book after reading _Dinotopia_. The same production team apparently helped on this book, and the book is clearly patterned on that bestseller. Sadly, this book in no way approaches the quality of Dinotopia. The vocabulary is at the college level, the story is awkward and forced, the dialogue is wholly unnatural, and most of the art is amateurish. I applaud the book's theme of conservation, and its respect for non-human life and intelligence. But beyond that, this book has very little to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid performance!","review":"Truly a magnificent performance by the Athena Ensemble.

I had a few fairly nice knives (each ~$90) but these knives put them to shame- I have easily cut through the skins of cherry tomatoes, which seems to be the ultimate test of any knife. The sharpening tool is also great, and has helped me get a nice edge on my old knives too. The only thing that was a bit odd about this set was that the knife block has more slots than knives. You can purchase a veggie or meat cleaver to go in the top slot, and I think there is one other slot without a knife that goes in it too. I purchased this \\"open box\\" from Amazon, so I'm not sure if I was missing a knife, or if that is the way the set always ships. This wasn't a huge deal- it let me use the same knife block for my older knives too, and I still like them- but if you're looking for a full knife block, you'll have to buy a few more knives on your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Knives","review":"Knives are very high quality and very sharp! However, here is a lot of room for improvement concerning the bamboo block. As others have mentioned, the size of the holes does not really correspond at all to the size of the knives. There are also two extra holes in the block, so I decided to order the 7\\" vegetable cleaver and 7\\" fillet knives to fill it the rest of the way, so it actually looks like a complete knife set. Also, what is advertised in the set as the 4.5\\" vegetable utility knife, is actually just another steak knife (it's the exact same, model # and everything)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set for the price!","review":"Love this set.

For this type of money that is simply plain wrong and shows a totally unprofessional approach to their product.In fairness the knives seem to be as advertized and do look like they will have a good life. But as stated, this is sold as a set, an expensive set at that.Your far better off buying just the knife set and finding a wooden block locally that will accommodate the knives in a better fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Looked like a nice ball to use with the Skilz Mini Hoop as it is 5 inches diameter ( same as Skilz ball).Pros:This is a nice looking ball, even appears well made.Great for displaying an autograph.Cons:-This ball is a brick.

Sidney Blackmer is far more Eisenhower than Kennedy, but is memorable in the dual role of president/Chinese agent.

I dig that. One Hundred Days of the Dragon, however, seems like it was made by completely different people. It scares us with the Yellow Communist Threat, few space aliens were ever portrayed as purely evil in OL as the Chinese in this one. Their plan: to fool the US army to retreat!No punishment is hard enough for the commie desacrating the throne of The President of the United States of America.

The interactive nature of the DVD shines. It meets me where my body is physically. After a solid mountain biking session when I think I don't have the energy for a full yoga class I throw on one of the shortened sequences in this DVD and reboot for the next activity. As a guy who was shying away from namby pamby yoga classes this DVD is beginning to change my views on yoga. This style of yoga is affecting parts of my body previously off limits.

I can burn well over 300 calories with this tape in less than 40 minutes. I love it and have noticed an improvement in my practice. I actually learned more with this tape than I did in class.

I highly recommend it for anyone who has already been practicing yoga for a while and is looking for something more advanced. One of my favorite features of this DVD is its ability to quickly switch between the actual flow and the lesson portion. Can't quite recall how to execute a pose? With a click of the remote you can quickly review it with an instructor and then return to the flow. The lesson chapters are also excellent workouts on their own. There are several options for flow length so that you can progress at your own pace, ability or mood.

Frustrated it was, I found this DVD. Now, I practice Ashtanga through this DVD at home. When I am busy, I chose 40 minutes program. When I have more time, I do 90 minutes practice.

The make-up is........well...standard for this sort of thing. The film is about a doctor who while experimenting with animals, produces a pill that will turn you into a vampire!.....well sort of. While the victims throats all have the customary fang marks on their necks, the doctor really isn't a vampire, but a man who regresses to a primal state of being when he takes these pills(which have an addictive side effect). It's unintentionally funny and worth seeing if you like this sort of thing. I do want to point out that this film is available on a double feature with 'The Return Of Dracula' and the print is far superior, plus you get a two for one price which is always nice.

I read the book and then gave it to my husband to read. It's not well written, spends a lot of time ranking on society and very little time helping someone find their way out of it. It also suggests repeatedly that the majority of people have this syndrome. I believe the majority of people are affected by the stress society places on sexuality, but most people do not suffer the obsessive addiction my husband does.

The result is an exhaustive (and exhausting) compilation of Sidney Reilly's activities and associations over the course of his career. Unfortunately this wealth of information is not really drawn into any themes or any kind of coherent narrative. Some of the \\"Reilly myths\\" are convincingly de-bunked, but there's not much on offer here to replace them.

This was definitely not her best work, as I've thoroughly enjoyed some of her other novels. What's the problem with this stor? Firstly, the plot is a little farfetched. Secondly, Leah is not a believable cahracter. Leah talks like a women from a few centuries back and doesn't act at all like a teenager. Thirdly, this just isn't well written well. It is written with too much biblical content. McDaniel needs to face reality. This isn't going to happen in real life. Her books are supposed to be about life. This contradicts her own statements. This book did have some strong points. The character of Molly was well developed and Leah's feelings about Ethan were well demonstrated. Overall, I would have to say, Come on McDaniel. This just isn't your best."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Sucked!!!","review":"This book was horrible. Save yourself time and DON'T READ IT!!! It was all about angels and visions.

To say that 'Options, Futures and Other Derivatives' is a good book is a great understatement, and can even be considered an insult. Yet, this book, which is targeted at readers who are not as acquainted with derivatives fails to impress. Through out the book you can feel how John Hull struggles to explain things in a simple manner. Sadly, his efforts have failed, and this is most evident when my fellow classmates had a hard time understanding the materials starting from Swaps. When we reached the section on options pricing, the book lacks the rigorous math that is needed for students to fully appreciate the beauty of deriving things like Black-Scholes. Overall, if you are a beginner, go straight to 'Options, Futures, and Derivatives'. This book is not worth wasting time over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used for FIN 4763","review":"Even though my professor didn't use the book as much as I expected, the content of this one were merely boring lectures explained the reason why my school changed the book after this semester."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful and charming work","review":"This is a book that I purchased several years ago and have read and re-read numerous times.

It is reminescent of those \\"how to draw a face\\" tutorials of my childhood: Step 1 - a circle; Step 2 - add two lines for the nose and mouth; Step 3 - Mona Lisa. The example resumes provided were useful, but the text descriptions of how to get there were inane. Moreover, this is useful but not at all the revolutionary concept the authors describe.

It was a pretty simply fit, but I did have to cut off a few of the little black tabs on the edges of the sleeve. After that it fit quite well in the factory-made hole in the dash board, and the stereo fit in right on top, with a little unused slot underneath. Personally, I could live without that last little item, but having it there would be useful if I needed somewhere to put pens or papers or something, or perhaps an Ipod plugged into the stereo would fit there as well.The look overall is respectable, and it blends in fairly well with the surrounding black plastic, although the plastic does have a unique texture.

I had heard previously that this was the leading high school text that is used and had high expectations. I was disappointed to find a plethora of type errors (including math mistakes!) and also very poor descriptions of things like bonding theory, equilibrium constants, reaction rates etc. The book covers a lot but fails to get real advanced in much of anything.

It spends like 2 pages on VSEPR theory, incomplete activity series and solubility rules, and terrible intro in stoichiometry. We only did 15 chapters, but this book didn't help at all. I didn't even read half of it because the problems offer no challenge whatsoever. Not enough application problems. The end of section review Qs only ask for definitions and explanations, no real chemistry. No difficult and tricky questions whatsoever.Honestly, no clue why high schools use this text so much. Pretty sad if this is the best there is."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for the average self learner","review":"This book is fine for students who have no problem manipulating equations anddon't mind doing calculation after calculation after calculation after calculation...Way to many calculations for the student who just wants a basic idea of what chemistry isall about. Probably a good book for students who naturally are good at calculating, selflearning, figuring out problems with little guidance. The assessments always presentproblems in a way that is different than how they were presented in the examples.Very frustrating for this homeschool mom whose high school aged daughter is not interested in the subject.

If this is what you are looking for, it succeeds admirably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Praying with Hildegard of Bingen","review":"Gloria Durka has written other books within the \\"Praying With\\" series which are very good (notably the one on Julian of Norwich), but this effort on Hildegard of Bingen was disappointing.

This game is also powered by The Collective's newest game engine: The Slayer engine, which pushes the XBOX's graphics to the limits.

This game is definately worth a look, even if you aren't into BtVS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buffy disappointment","review":"There is a reason why the price has dropped on this game. It has nice graphics and sound, but moves from being extremely simple to ridiculously difficult. The voice-overs become annoyingly redundant and much of the action occurs in the dark (though reasonably this is where vampires live). The difficulty level increases only because there are no interim saves, and you are forced through mind-numbing repetition. Silly timing jumps negate what otherwise would be a cute juvenile adventure package, and seem much more likely for a Mario Brothers package.I would not recommend this game. You might want to consider Halo, Enclave, or even BloodRayne."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOES BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS !!!","review":"I've always been a big fan of the t.v.show since the start.The reason for getting an x-box is my obbsession with this cult following.The game has challenging stages,all characters from the show and follows events from seasons 1-3.The best feature is the fighting engine.You fight multiple vamps,demons and zombies.Mixing combos and special moves you get along the way is the key.Weapons include garden implements,pool cues and stakes.Watch Buffy go off on enemies when she picks up a shovel.Her main weapons are a crossbow and a supersoaker that can be used to torch enemies with holy water or fire.During gameplay,Buffy interacts with cast,mainly at the school library.I'd love to see a sequel,covering seasons 4-6.The only downfall is the lack of attention to Willow's face.She rocks!The rest of the cast looks good though.You get alot,considering this game is now thirty bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Live The Slayer","review":"Step into the shoes of Buffy Summers.

When you first start the game, you face these really whimpy vamps then as you proceed, they start to get harder and harder. Almost every level has a secret hidden somewhere, so keep an eye out. There is only one word to describe this game... GREAT!! Roughly based on the shows third season, you'll see some friendly, and not so friendly faces.

However when I got into the game, I discovered that there is a thinking process involved. This game is extremely challenging, its not hard to kill people (that part is fun) but it is very hard to know where to go. You have to be very patient. The graphics are XBOX quality and the game is very immersive. The downfall is that it is easy to die and there are only two checkpoints per level so if you complete a hard part be sure to do it again. The vampires need some variety, there are two main types, \\"Brads\\" and \\"Dixie Chicks\\" who always say chick fight. They are pushovers but killing them is fun. There are also skeletons who are just annoying because they physically cant hurt you; they suck your blood and you dont lose any health.

Many of the original actors did their own voices (notable lack: Sarah Michelle Gellar and I think David Boreanaz).The levels of game play are good and allow the novice on up to the experienced gamer to play at a level comfortable for them.I've been waiting impatiently for this game to hit the market, and from what I saw at WW, the Xbox people have done a GREAT job at making this game worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy for game of the year!","review":"I just completed Buffy the Vampire Slayer for the xbox and I have to declare that this game is easily the best release of 2002! Unlike so many other TV knockoffs Buffy stays true to the plot lines of its TV counterpart from friends to foes. If you're not a fan of the TV show you'll still enjoy taking out your frustrations on the many demons and vampires packed into the 13 levels of gameplay. Buffy isn't loaded with difficult puzzles that need figuring before continuing through a level like Resident Evil and Silent Hill but is more like Max Payne without all the guns and humans to kill. (Plus Buffy is way hotter than Max!) I would recommend this game for anyone in the market for a good action/adventure game:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy fan 4 life","review":"This game was the reason I purchased an xbox six months ago over the playstation 2.

If any of you remember the NHL 95 game for Sega, it is very similar to that game execpt that the rosters are updated. But the one downfall to this game is that rosters are still old.

Her techniques and methods are very out of date. Even with current revisions.Also Ms. Miller's book only scratch hes the surface of the job itself.

Then, maybe, I would have avoided this game entirely. I generally like sports games, but this one committed the cardinal sin of gaming: it just wasn't fun.The biggest reason for this is that the gameplay is not that great. As a batter you better swing at everything or else you'll go down looking. As a baserunner, you have the option of getting picked off...err...stealing a base. As a fielder there's next to nothing you can do to prevent stolen bases. And don't expect your pitchers to go a complete game. The sixth inning you'll be fine and in the seventh you'll be throwing up beach balls. I guess that's to simulate tiring out but it's annoying that every single pitcher poops out at the same time.The home run derby is like the rest of the game: fun at first but ultimately dull.I returned this game after only four days.

One, the size is just too friggin small for grown up hands. They're designed for 12 year old hands! Two, the directional pad is horrible! To have a great gamepad, the directional pad has to be ultra-responsive. When are companies going to realize this? I tried this pad out with some console type games on my PC and I couldn't fluidly move my thumb around on the directional pad to move the character on the screen. In order to accurately control my guy, I had to push my thumb on the directional pad as if I were typing on a keyboard!

The layout is fine, but the D-pad has 2 major flaws:1) it is TERRIBLY imprecise. In playing Madden Football it is almost impossible to make your guy run straight. The slightest movement sends him off in a diagonal direction. Can't run in the open field without going left and right or going out of bounds. VERY annoying.2) The 2nd big problem is the screw hole where the worthless joystick screws in.

When Aase, who is the mother of Peer Gynt, is dead, the deep sorrow covered over all people. This CD brings us such an atmosphere, while other interprets differently. I have always listened to and applauded it, whenever this part has begun. Other parts of Peer Gynt resemble different CDs well. It is easy to listen and make us happy. The Lyric Suite and the famous Piano Concerto are so good that I can listen many times.

There is a very small screw which holds the speaker wire in its place. It is not visible at all once you fit the outside wire holder. Very easy to use. It takes about less than 2 minutes for each connection.I dont want to comment on the sound quality as there are too many other variables that decide the quality of a HT system.My only gripe about the plugs is they are too long and so i couldnt fit them on the back on the speaker system i had purchasedPolk Audio RM10 Speaker System (Set of Five, Black). They also protrude out too much on the back of the receiver. So make sure you leave at least 2-3 inches additional space for these plugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice connector, one problem","review":"Good quality. Easy to install.

Easy to install, just unscrew the silver and black/red piece from the gold, slide that onto your wire (I'm using 12 gauge megawire and the casing is pretty thick, it just fit, HINT I trimmed off the edges of the casing with a finger nail clipper so I could get it started into the hole easier), trim the casing back a half inch, insert the bare wire into the gold piece, screw down the set screw using the tool provided, and screw the silver and black/red piece to the gold.

Also i personaly find it kind of dumb that the only cars with boost are the police car's, Which is the only reason these cars can catch high end cars such as the ones listed above. Again let's look at the reality aspect of this. You cant even buy Boost in this game which means that again this game is not realistic, I guess if i was 13 and just learning about cars this would be a great game but sadly thats to late. Go with a more realistic game such as NFSU Or NFSU2 Or NFSMW. Do not waist your time And no before you go looking i can tell you personaly there is not Codes or cheats to fix these problems because i have look all over for them.

The one thing that sucks about the controls is that when you turn it is a little sensitive so try nt to turn so much. The Graphics are desant but they could be better. The sound is probably the best part about this game. I mean when you drive with a Lamborghini the engine sounds just like a realy car would sound and I think thats great.

Cops now have a helicopter that shoots down bombs that really affect your car by making you lose control. They also drop bombs that turn to spike strips(very effective) The enviroment is really nice.

I have always been a fan of the series ever since the original on 3DO(!). I started out buying the XBOX version, but swapped it at the store for the PS2 version (I heard the PS2 version was better, and believe me, it is)!This version of the game brings a lot of great cars and new elements into the game, borrowing from games such as Project Gotham (style points, unlocking cars with points), and Spy Hunter (helicopters firing explosive barrels and missiles at you in Hot Pursuit mode). The PlayStation 2 version is exciting and fast, the XBOX one plays like a beta version, slow and sloppy, and doesn't have as many features or the same level of polish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cars","review":"There are so many ways I could say how great this game is.

But, after playing this game, I am now.Never have I ever played a game with this much sense of speed. The closest I've ever come to it is the Extreme-G series. The lush visuals and perfect car control made this a game every racing fan or PS2 owner should own.The only gripe I have with the game really isn't a gripe at all because I could switch it off. The cam shots to where you could see a half-mile up the road and around your car. They were cool at first but, after the coolness wore off, it became a bother to me. Thank God, there was an option to switch it off.Other than that, Hot Pursuit 2 is awesome. Maybe even the best racing game ever made, next to the Gran Turismo series.

The last great NFS game in my opinion, before they switched to the Underground physics. NFS Underground to NFS Carbon all pretty much drived the same.

In other words, where it takes lots of practice to get decent in Gran Turismo, you're up and cranking on NFS in no time!Need for Speed is so totally addictive it's unbelievable. I can literally play it for hours and have. The cars go wicked fast and it's fun to outrun cops, dodge barracades, do jumps while driving at high speeds.

The quest/exploration aspect of the game is interesting and pretty challenging for a beginner, and I like the detail to the graphics in the sea battle scenes a lot. I'd rather kill giant crabs and banshees (and the occasional pirate) than draw blood and guts in some of the more realistic games.

I have to admit, I'm not an avid XBox game player, but I totally loved this game. It reminds me a lot of the King's Quest and Space Quest type Sierra-brand computer games-- the really good old ones. Pirates Black Kat has great graphics, interesting game play, and totally had me hooked for several weeks. It's hard enough to be really fun but not so hard as to be impossibly frustrating. 5 Stars from me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A golden dubloon","review":"this is a great game! i love it a lot, and all my freinds love it and have bought their own. i highly reccomend it to anyone, at it is a lot of fun, and includes a great scrapbook and exiting sea battles. try it out!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT GAMEPLAY AND GRAFFICS","review":"This game is perfect. It had incredible graffics,a strong storyline was absolutely as stable as they come(doesnt crash) and great gameplay.It took no time at all to get into it. The controls were easy as pie.This game is far and away better than the pirates of the carribean in every aspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"SESEME STREET PIRATES","review":"I rented this game in hopes of finally a good first person game other than halo for xbox but was truly dissapointed. The graphics are amazing but storyline and fluidness of the game was not present much at all. Also a s a pirate i don't expect to be fighting giant crab creatures and gorrillas. Also just over all it was pretty plain. What could have been cool if they had more of an interactive enviorment than just forward, kill bad guy, forward, kill another bad guy , get on boat , shoot bad guy boat, get off boat , kill bad guy , etc... Don't expect much of a challenge with this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even Close to Sea Dogs","review":"I am a huge fan of the pirate game genre, so I was excited to see this game in the XBOX section of the store. I have owned most pirate games for the PC.If you're expecting Sea Dogs or anything close to the old Pirates game on the PC, with Pirates - The Legend of Black Kat, you will be as disappointed as I was with this game.This game might be good for kids learning to play video games, although it is violent. Since I am not a kid, I grew bored of this game after an hour. I will probably never play it again.The game play is extremely linear.It would be a good game for elementary school children, if it didn't have all the violence.Basically it's not kid enough for kids and not adult enough for adults. It's just plain bad.If you need a crummy game fix, buy it at Amazon. They have the lowest price anywhere for this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This game is way too easy. If it weren't for the stacked main character I'd have returned this game on day one.The graphics are weak, very arcade-y and not at all what I expect from an Xbox title. The land-based game play is just mindless button-mashing until everything is dead. The sea-based missions are sort of ok, but only because there's an incredible dearth of sea-based games. Anything even halfway decent would make this game truly forgettable.It is fun to upgrade your ship from a crummy little barque to a lumbering man-o-war. Once you've done that though, forget about challenge. With the big ships, you could sink an island.This game _could_ be ok for young people, beginners, or people who are normally bad at games and want to feel like they're good at games. Not that being good at games is worth anything, it's just that if you are, you'll rip through this game in a couple days and realize it wasn't really that much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel like a different person","review":"I was turned on to Choline many years ago, has always helped me with relaxation and concentration.

The greatest part of this CD consists of musical accompaniment to spoken word; poetry if you like. This is a combination that I dislike, so I suppose responses will depend on taste. But I found relatively little music per se on this CD. It gets better as the CD goes on; there is some music that is there for its own sake, recalling some of the excellence of Beiser's other work. Overall, the execution is excellent, and the sounds are pleasant enough to offer some gratification in listening.

The graphics are fantastic, similar to the original Pac Man games but you can now butt-bounce and more! I'm on the verge of purchasing this item myself. The reason I can tell you that it is good is we just recently rented it from a local chain store and my daughter (9) and I haven't been able to put it down!Again, if you love Pac Man and you want to have fun and relive your childhood but with more umph then you'll enjoy this game! It's also ideal for the whole family not just us big kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT rendition of the classic","review":"this has got the classic and broughten it to another level. the graphics are great, and cute, and there is great play control, short load times, and a fun atmosphere throughout the game. the levels are really cool and the game is worth checking out. it is definately worth your money because since playstation is inteneded for more of a mature audience, there have been a lack of great games for all ages. there is Jak and daxter, an under rated flawless platformer, and now we have pac man world 2 to add to the collection. this one improves upon the original for the PSX, graphics and gameplay wise. try this game out if you even have a hint of love for the original arcade version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Addictive...","review":"When buying it, I wasn't expecting much. Other Pac Man games are fun, but tend to get boring after a while. This one is SO not boring! There are many levels that you go through, and there's cool things to do even after you finish the game.

The game developers took out the elements which made Pac Man World 1 successful. Although the environment was 2D in Pac Man World 1, the game was action packed and challenging with high replay value.For the sequel, they tried to combine elements from other games (such as the free-roaming environment of RayMan and the fast-paced action and timed sequences of Crash Bandicoot). They did not succeed in either attempt.There are 4 games to unlock by completing the levels. Original Pac Man, Ms. Pac Man, Pac Attack and PacMania. If you already have a retro gaming compilation or the Namco Museum then you already have these games. Why didn't they include games such as Super PacMan or PacMan Jr?The camera angles are horrible and this element alone is what destroys the game. There is NO desire to replay levels to collect all the items or to better your time or increase your points.DO NOT buy this game. It is a rental at best..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as easy as it seem.....","review":"I recently purchased this game, thinking that it won't be to complicated to play. Unfortunately, I can't get off the first level. After completing the first level, you fight a boss. In this case the first boss is a frog with a metal tongue, which I can't seem to beat. Also the 360 degree graphics, may cause you to get a headache, if you play for long periods. Not a bad game but may require cheat codes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pac-Man is back and better than ever!","review":"So, Pac-Man is back in a new game Pac-Man World 2. Basically it's the original with a modern kick to it. You have to avoid the ghosts and mcuh more. You get to roll around, ice-skate, bouce off of trampolines, what more could you want in a game? I absolutely love this game. I mean me and my mom can sit there for ever trying to get through the levels to see what's next in the next world. This game isn't very hard, but not too easy so it is the right amount of difficulty.

My thighs are also covered in bruises from pulling boxes off of a conveyor belt, and believe it or not, this soap literally eliminated the time it used to take them to heal.I bruise so easily, and can expect even the most minor of bruises to last for weeks on end, more serious ones will last for months! This soap cut the healing time in half, I don't have to fret anymore when I wear shorts simply because of how well this soap works.Since using the soap, my skin is softer, brighter and overall much healthier.

There's nothing this poet won't write about. Her endings are some of the best endings I have seen in a long time in poetry by a young poet. This was a really refreshing book that didn't seem to fall into the traps of trendiness so prevalent in poetry today. And even though the poet seems to like taking on big political and social topics (which is also unusual for so many younger poets), there's virtually no sense of rhetoric, judgment.

Puzzled by these new symptoms, my physical therapist suggested I get a wrist brace, which I did. Almost immediately the pain increased just at the base of where the brace ended on my arm. I abandoned use of it within less than 24 hours. The pain improved but did not go away. So I bought a night time wrist brace that also immobilizes the fingers to a certain degree and comes up much further on my arm. It is put out by Creative Comfort and is called a crafter's brace. I have been wearing it a minimum of 8 hours out of every 24 and limiting my typing. The pain is all but gone now. Very rarely do I feel it unless I spend too much time on my computer.So I would say, if your pain is in the middle of your forearm rather than closer to elbow or wrist, then you need a brace that is much longer than one of these or you may aggravate your symptoms more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice","review":"My work and study schedule often leaves my hand strained and tired.

Unfortunately, it is a little bit too small for my arms. It fits reasonably well around my hand but just barely closes around my (somewhat muscular, but not extremely large) forearm. Because of this, the whole thing just sits a little bit wrong.The item says that it is \\"designed to fit women\\", but I would alter that to say that it's designed to fit small women.

I was able to bend the center support a little bit to provide just a little more pressure at the heel of my hand, which brought better relief. It's a compromise. More restricted movement provides better relief, but leaves me less comfortable and with less strength to perform my tasks. It is light in color, so it immediately shows dirt and moisture, but it washes nicely. I just put it in a lingerie bag and throw it in with a white load, and let it air dry.

The palmer stay is a cheap piece of plastic (feels like a plastic fork with tines), and not adjustable. I have returned both of these wrist supports and will look for something that actually does provide support"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fit","review":"I tripped and fell in my backyard, and hurt both wrists. My physical therapist suggested I get wrist braces to wear at night that have plastic panels or \\"boning\\" to keep me from over-extending my wrists while I sleep. I went to four different places to find a pair, including medical supply stores and drug stores. Nothing fit. I am 5' 4\\", with smallish hands. Everything I saw was too big or too long, even in the smallest size. These fit perfectly. They don't feel as bulky around the hand and the palm area isn't as tall as the others I had tried, so it's easier to use your fingers. They are comfortable and even attractive. Even though they fit me, there is enough room for wider wrists and hands, with two velcro straps that make it easy to adjust the width, and a fabric panel inside that protects your wrists from the velcro. Nice touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"This wrist brace is really uncomfortable","review":"I would rather not wear anything and bear with the pain. It's stiff and rubs horribly against the top of my thumb pad. I would not recommend this wrist support. It's a torture device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable, even on my large female hands","review":"I ordered the left-hand and right-hand Wellgate for Women Slimfit Wrist Supports and can easily say I will never buy another brand/style of wrist support. Every time I put them on, I am amazed at how comfortable they feel--even on my large female hands. It is like they were custom made for me. Since I type all day at my job, as well as type a lot for my online college classes, I was a bit worried at first that the piece of fabric between my thumb and pointer finger would be a nuisance. However, it was easy getting used to it, and I have had no trouble typing with them on. Any hand/wrist-related pains are gone too.Note: At the same time as I purchased these, I also purchased the PAIR of Thermoskin Carpal Tunnel Braces with Dorsal Stay. However, the construction of the Wellgate Slimfit Wrist Supports is far superior, and they actually cost less (2 x $14.36 + Free Super Saver Shipping VERSUS 1 pair x $34.50 + $4.72 SH)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable","review":"This is more comfortable than the ones you buy at a drug store. It is shorter which is good for ladies. Very happy I purchased"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, for a while","review":"I am a larger woman with very muscular forearms - you are probably safe ordering these in terms of size in general. However... While they seemed great for about a month, my hands/arms began to cramp during the night after using them beyond those first weeks. While I cannot explain why, it is worth mentioning. For that reason, I will return to the Ace TekZone supports - the Velcro gives out after 6 months of nightly use but they work without pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"So comfortable!!","review":"I had been using a brace that my doctor gave me for my carpal tunnel but it just wasn't comfortable. Too scratchy and too much velcro. I saw this brace on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I do have small wrists and hands and liked the fact that it was advertised as being designed for women. Well it arrived today and it's great. So much more comfortable and fits perfectly. No scratchy parts and doesn't make my wrist or hand sweat. I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wellgate Wrist Support","review":"I ordered a pair due to a review about the underside getting dirty quickly, although I have not found that an issue. I co-worker tried it on and it was too tight for her wrist. She is larger boned than I. I have found it to be much more comfortable than any other support I have bought in the past. I definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wrist guard!","review":"Great product for women with small wrists! My wrists hurt from typing, so I wear these while I use the computer which helps tremendously!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pain Relief","review":"After a long day of quilting I used to be in a lot of pain, now I wear this wrist support. It does the job and is very comfortable. Just the right size for a woman's hand and velcro tabs allow adjustment. On very hot days it does get uncomfortable and sweaty but I just take it off for an hour or so and then put it back on. I would recommend this for anyone who uses there hands a lot and have wrist or hand pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pregnancy carpel tunnel syndrome","review":"I purchased two braces. One for pregnancy-induced carpel tunnel syndrome for my left hand, and one for a sore right wrist from a fall. The left brace seems to have nearly cured my carpel tunnel - the tingling/numbness is much better. Not sure if it's the brace or just time that cured it. I wear the right brace at night, and it really stabilizes my wrist. Both braces are lightweight and very comfortable. I can do anything while wearing them, including caring for my newborn son. I definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"great brace, fits really well and comfertable","review":"great brace, fits really well and comfortable will buy more (didnt buy on here, bought at my local pharmacy that sells each single brace for $40 each, now that i see them here i will defiantly get a 2nd set so i can always have a clean pair to be wearing.i wear tham when working on computer as i often do to help with carpel-tunnel, as i sleep often as i have a habit of contorting my hands so waking up in more pain so these prevent that, and as i have Fibro it helps often with my hand/wrist pain.also like that there is a true right hand brace and a left as the universal ones never seem overly effective. Velcro works well but doesnt get stuck to things as it is designed to only attach to the brace (found many other braces the velcro would always be stuck to my hair, clothing and such)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better the the old style I had - and a great price at AMAZON.","review":"Bought a set of these in a major chain store recently as my old ones were very worn. I like the size of these - made more for a womens smaller hands, yet sturdy enough to help my wrist problems. My old set was larger / longer and not as comfortable I only wear them at night but they do make a difference. I wanted a second set to put aside in my travel kit and found that he price on AMAZON was better then what I paid at the discount chain store and is exactly the same product. Very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-made product that works well","review":"I've been using this for about 2-3 weeks now and it is holding up well so far. I only use it at night while sleeping and it does help my wrist be pain-free for the hours after taking it off. (My wrist started hurting about a month after my first baby was born and I'm guessing it's carpal tunnel though I've never discussed it with a doctor.) It's comfortable enough to wear to sleep but I take it off during the day because it feels too restrictive. Con: It does make my wrist clammy on warmer nights. I've washed it twice - on handwash/delicate setting and then air dried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relief from nighttime hand cramps","review":"This wrist support totally stopped the nightly hand cramps I was getting from early carpal tunnel syndrome. very satisfied with the quality and results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps a lot","review":"My wife's been having much pain in her wrist since having our boy and seems to get worse through every breastfeeding session when she has to maneuver his head with her hand. We bought this and put it on every time she's not holding the baby. It probably isn't making the wrist any more better, but it's definitely stopping the wrist from getting any worse. It holds the wrist pretty firm. We're actually thinking of purchasing the same one for her left wrist also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cozy, slender, good device","review":"I occassionally have a \\"tweaky\\" wrist - probably hurt it at some point and now it aches when jammed or flexed a lot (e.g. push ups, yoga). I had an old ACE support like this, but it was unisex and always a little too big & cumbersome. This little device fits perfectly - slim and fitted but comfortable. It is sized for a woman (or a man with slim wrists) and has support on both sides. Roomy around the thumb opening, there's no rubbing. It holds my wrist pretty firmly (but not uncomfortably) and there's no poking by the supports on either side."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful wrist support!","review":"I bought my Wellgate for Women Slimfit Wrist Support for my right wrist and lower thumb which have been in a lot of pain from tendinitis. This is my writing hand, and I was at the point of not even being able to sign my name. After 4 acupuncture treatments and the wonderful support provided by this wrist support, I am able to not only sign my name with minimal pain, but to do grasping tasks as well---something that I hadn't been able to do. I highly recommend this support...it is light in weight and light gray in color (doesn't \\"announce to the world\\" that I have a hand/wrist problem like other supports do), and provides the support I need to avoid a lot of pain when I try to use my hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent wrist support","review":"This is an excellent wrist support and I believe it will work for many different conditions such as carpel tunnel, tendinitis and even lymphadema. It is a very nice looking and comfortable brace that is quite easy to slip on and off. I thought I had carpel tunnel but it turned out to be a thumb injury to the wrist - de Quervain's tenosynovitis. And I also have lymphadema in that arm. This brace truly made a difference in the pain and comfort level both during the day and for sleeping. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great brace.","review":"The Wellgate Slimfit brace is a great brace. It eases my wrist pain while allowing me to do every day things. It did take a little while for me to get used to the brace. The longer I wear the brace, and the tighter I fasten it, the more I have a fabric imprint on my hand/wrist. Occasionally, the fabric imprint areas will feel tender, but I am not sure if it's because the brace was tighter than usual.The only negative thing I can really say about the brace is that the threads started to become loose with only a few hours of wear. I now have threading sticking out in multiple spots and I've had the brace for about a month with light use."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my ladies","review":"My wife has a weak wrists and with all the housework she does, they get painful.I was researching for the wrist support and found this one with great reviews and the looks that my wife may like.When I received the item, I was even more pleased. The build quality was more than adequate and the slimness as it says in the product title, was another plus.Best of all, the product helps my wife to sleep without wrist pains during the night and she also uses it during the day to prevent wrist stress.I would highly recommend it. We bought both right and left pairs for my mother and mother in law as well.Pros:1. This really helps to reduce stress and pain on the wrists.2. slim - it enables her to do light chores with it on.3. looks: it looks much better than others I've seen.4. price: I think it's worth the price and more for my wife's well-being.Cons:You can't do complicated chores, but that's to be expected with such apparatus. So, it's really not a con.Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"So thankful for this support","review":"I have been suffering from wrist pain since I was 15 (over ten years). I have used ace bandages without much success. The doctors put me on a huge dose of naproxen at such a young age that I now have leftover side effects from the years of using them. Not to mention, still more pain. In addition to the wrist pain, I have started to form a ganglion cyst which becomes larger with excessive use of my hand. Sleeping always seems the worst as my hand falls off the pillow I set up to keep the wrist straight. With wearing this guard my wrist is confined and comfortable. The fabric is soft and it has the perfect amount of tension that you can control yourself. I wear it anytime my wrist pain flairs up and also to bed so that things can heal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I bought this as a back-up for the brace I already own- theFuturo For Her Wrist Support, Adj. Right. I wear my Futuro most of the day and also overnight so I needed one to wear while the other was being washed and air-dried. Based on the other reviews I read, I thought this would be a nice brace, but after wearing it for the last few hours I'm pretty disappointed. It's not the worst brace I've ever owned but it doesn't compare to the Futuro. This one doesn't keep my wrist very stable- I still have a lot of mobility. It's also pretty uncomfortable and the upper edge hurts my hand. Think I'll be returning this and getting another Futuro. The Futuro costs more but is WELL worth it- I wear it about 18-20 hours each day and it keeps my wrist very stable and is MUCH more comfortable than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relieved the pain!","review":"I had 90% reduction in pain minutes after putting on the brace. The one drawback is the velcro wraps stretched just enough that they wouldn't tighten the brace as tight as I would have liked. I have very small wrists though so it wouldn't be a problem for most people."},{"rating":"2","title":"right wrist brace","review":"It has a nice fit. Not as bulky as some of the unisex splints.

Unfortunately, these are far outnumbered by the recipes that simply do not work, especially those involving the delicate manufacture of dough. At first I thought I had it wrong, but over the course of repeated failures, I realized that the problem was in the testing and/or proofreading.

It lists nutritional information, and since you're getting all these ingredients from the same market as them, you know it's pretty close to correct (though the numbers might have changed a little over the years). The book distinguishes the vegetarian and vegan meals so you know without having to guess if something is made with animal byproducts, etc. Plus, the cooking descriptions are clear.I do wish that the book had photos of the foods you were cooking, or at the very least a color illustration. I know you can cook a meal without having to see a picture of the finished product, but a lack of real images does take away from this otherwise enjoyable book.Now, you can probably find a lot of great Whole Foods Market recipes on their social media pages for free.

Most of the games are blow outs. I'm practicing on the highest level but I think I've got the level figured out for the season.I've had the game just a couple of weeks and I'm kicking the games tail.

The album veers from cut to cut, exploring different jazz moods and corners of the globe with a dizzying, mind-boggling virtuosity (that sometimes leaves the supporting musicians struggling to keep up). If you DON'T love music that's daring, ambitious, joyfully and broodingly emotional, full of rich textures and complexity, and just a little bit dangerous, then stay away!

I record my sermons when I preach, it works great.6. Files transfer b/w PC and recorder is extremely fast.7.

The quality is excellent, however, there's no usb connection, so I'd have to play back the lecture into the PC to record it.I bought this recorder as a refurbished item, but I assume the recording/playback quality is the same as new.If you use this device for personal memos, it will work just fine. The device needs to be a few inches away from the mouth. However, when recording from a distance (ie for a lecture), the recording quality diminishes greatly. You can still hear the content, but it comes across distant and a bit fuzzy.I'm gonna stick with the MD recorder for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Inadequate for Lectures","review":"If you are looking for a DVR for recording lectures, don't waste your money on this piece of sh**!

So, using my excellent send of frugality, I bought it from Amazon (the 1973 edition).This thing is AMAZING. Diana Kennedy is brilliant, and the collection of recipes are very, very authentic. Things you normally wouldn't find in a traditional cookbook--tripe, tongue, chicharron--it's all here. Outstanding recipes for mole and even traditional authentic tacos.

In 1953 I don't remember many families like that, and for sure today's children are not being reared in that style. I cannot imagine how awful and strange these books must seem to children who now have instant information accessible to them via computers and the Internet. To compare then and now, nowadays children are often (not all school districts) expected to be able to read before they start kindergarten. Back then, when we started kindergarten we were taught to count from one to ten and learn \\"to say our ABC's\\". I was very disappointed to see these books are still around!

If she were an opera singer, she would be a coloratura. She is always on pitch and the phrasing is impeccable. The album itself is not strictly jazz. It's more adult contemporary/pop, what we used to call easy listening.The themes of the album are wistful, longing, looking for love - sometimes in the wrong places.

It has four face buttons and another four shoulder buttons, plus the usual start and select buttons. The directional pad though is very different. The d-pad seems to misread where you are actually moving it, instead of moving straight up, it will read it as a diagonal direction.Pros:Similar in size and layout to the Sony Playstation controller.USB interfaceCons:The directional pad is possibly the worst that I have ever used.Feels a bit flimsyThis gamepad is not too bad if you can overlook the directional pad's flaws.

The booklet shows you the moves with the Hyper-Beast moves. The graphics are splendid, I didn't notice anything wrong with them so far while I've had the game. One more thing that I love about the game, the controls. Bloody Roar's controls are some of the best that I've played so far, even better than most of my PS2 games'.

The footage of Red Rock was especially disappointing, and shot at high tide in the winter with the sand all gone. During warmer months, it's full of sand, and a lot more beach at low tide.

The intentions of Mr. Järvi are at best unclear, and at worst, as in the Milhaud Suite Provenal, utterly inappropriate. The Milhaud is a light and playful work here performed without delicacy or any sense of the folk origins of the tunes first set down by André Campra. The editing, by one Jonathan Cooper, further exacerbates the leaden effect. The saccharin notes by Edward Blakeman and Michael Fleming neither help nor enlighten.

When you fall I think you go way to far and then if you were in 1st place youll be in 6th place (last). I pretty much agree with the amazon[.com] review.

Some dealers have switched to recommending the 303 products as a replacement. As an added benefit, one application of the aerospace protectant took care of an annoying creaking sound that evidently was caused by the door seal rubbing on the frame of the car.The product doesn't leave an annoying glossy residue that causes glare on the dash. It will, however, remove dull greyish deposits on exterior seal materials and plastics, bringing them back to a true black.The 303 website has some pretty amazing examples of protection for rubber, vinyl, and plastics.

I have had this player for almost a year, and have not had any other issues with it, but with at least 5 different DVD formats in common use out there, you really should buy a player that can handle all of them; give this one a miss.

Tennis fans, if you are looking for an excellent tennis game to buy, then I would suggest Tennis 2K2 for the Sega Dreamcast or wait until Tennis 2K2 for the PS2 to be released at the end of this month. Do not spend your money on this JUNK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price for the Fiesta Collector","review":"You really cannot beat this price, even at Homer Laughlin discount sites, for the Fiesta collector you know or yourself.

But beware, this IST10 doesn't come with Dragon Naturally Speaking software (as one reviewer mentioned as I've the same purpose as him) but compactable with it.

It is heavy at five lbs. with a wide base making it very stable. The handgrip is very comfortable and the buttons are well placed. It has worked with every game I have played. The only drawback is the software. It allows you to preset your buttons for every game you play and to save the settings. However it is very complicated and will take some time to figure out. It doesn't twist for rudder control, but I never seen one that did at this price. It has serial and USB connections so thats not a problem either.

There are a number of other books on program management which are much better suited for that purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, But no real practical advice, nothing groundbreaking","review":"Being a successful manager , and being an avid reader, I was expecting this book to go a bit further than it did. I have read a number of project management books, and a number of management books, and I would have to say that this book is at best a rudimentary management book. If you are completely new to management then maybe this book would be useful.

I couldn't finish the game because I got bored of it. one of many downsides is you have to pay to save(aprox. 100 koins). when you die and need to continue, you need to pay a toll and each time you pay it goes up. the sword power-ups only last a short while. the boxers. what's up with the different boxers? they do nothing. the health isn't exactly the best way to go either. in short the game would have been better off on the PS1. if you are of the younger generation of gamers, this one's for you. otherwise rent it if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maximo is dumb","review":"The dumbest game ever to hit the PS2.

It is bad.P.S. Word of advice Don't buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bad bad game","review":"I picked up this game assuming that it would provide at least a littile bit of fun for me. What I found instead was frustration and regret for wasting $... on it. I graphics are pretty good, but that is about the only place Mazimo shines. The dificulty level is so extreamly frustrating that even doing something as simple as saving the game will have you pulling your eyebrows out. The gameplay is plain and simple, not fun. I played it for hours hoping I would start to enjoy it. It never happened though. Hopefully I can still return it. So if you enjoy wasting money and you hate yourself, this is the game for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult","review":"This game is absolutely terrible. I tried it out at the store first then decided to buy it. What a mistake. This game is so dark, it's hard to see where you're going. It's actually a really difficult game and there are very few spots in the game that allow you to save. I don't recommend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review by a serious gamer","review":"I preordered this game but went out to blockbuster to rent it just to give it a try. I have always been a fan of the ghouls and ghosts series so any new addition would have caught my eye. Everything about this game is pretty much right on the money. Graphics, sound, and gameplay are all top-notch. Its not exactly the easiest game out there but if you spend the time to think out your next move you shouldnt have a hard time getting through the game. Its all a matter of acquiring continue coins. You need to collect spirits. 50 spirits will get you a coin. You trade coins with the Grim Reaper to bring you back to life. I found a point in the first level where I could collect spirits and get an extra life.. and repeat the process. I collected a whole bunch of continues in a short period of time. No Problem. If your looking for a solid and challenging gameplay experience you owe it to yourself to pick this game up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as fun as expected","review":"I recently purchased a PS2 and this was the first game I got.

Maybe it was too hyped up for me.I should have got Ico."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to the Max-imo!","review":"This game is so much fun. In order to accuratley describe it, you need to get a big mixing bowl and thow in Ghouls-n-Ghosts, Zelda, Mario Bros and Crash Bandicoot. Whip that all up on high speed for like 20 minutes and you have one of the best games in a long while.This game is great, it provides many hours of challenging gameplay and secrets to uncover. The save/continue system is a nice addition that allows players to \\"earn\\" their merits and saves. The enemies are comical and engaging...but hard to beat, especially when they come at you in droves. The life potions and powerups are spread throughout the levels, but not in abundance. This makes the game challenging, but even so, younger players would still enjoy and appreciate its \\"kid\\" appeal as well.Anyone who is a fan of those 2D action games of yester-year will really like this one. Its a nice additon to any game library for any type of gamer...give a whirl, wack some skeletons and get your girlfriend back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghosts, Goblins, and Glory...","review":"You may not know it, but Maximo is a sort of sequel to Ghosts and Goblins and Super Ghouls and Ghosts. Obviously, gaming has changed much since the days of those titles, so the game has been updated significantly, and yet somehow it still feels like its predecessors, which is an accomplishment worthy of notation. The gameplay is suitably mindless and addictive, and will tax your reflexes at every turn (and sometimes your temper as well - but that is all in the Ghosts and Goblins tradition, is it not?). Unlimited saves or continues would have brought this game up to date and made it more player-friendly (when you've used all your saves and continues, you're going to have to start from scratch), and some of the levels are too similar to one another, but Maximo is a fun ride while it lasts, and comes recommended to fans of platformers and arcade-style action games.Final Score: B- (or 4 stars)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down.","review":"Your gaming skills will be tested here for your health is easily depleated and you have to pay to save your game (100 koins). The graphics are very detailed and bright. The music is even good, but that is where the game goes south. Horrible camera angles = certain death. Unfortunately, the camera creates enough of a problem playing this game that it really does take away about 50% of the enjoyment and you end up just getting a little too frustrated. But you REALLY want to like this game because everything else is very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"Maximo is a fun game. While the plot is cliched, this is not what the game is about. The combat is fun. You fight using a sword and can get armor to improve the amount of hits you can stand. The game can be hard, but it doesn't feel like it is throwing unfair challenges at you. The stages in the game are fun. I would like a larger variety of stages in Maximo than there is. Overall, it is a fun game."},{"rating":"2","title":"maximo","review":"how can you review a game badly because it is hard? maybe you should go back to playing tetris, i've heard it doesn't take much skills to make lines... as for the game i thought it was great its about time i had a game where i actually die a few times, but i honestly didn't think it was that hard to tell you the truth... it gets easier with the skills you learn along the way, i recommend buying this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff's review","review":"This game is a bit repetitive and boring , It is worth renting on a rainy day , the graphics are average , I found myself getting lost and unable to figuer out ware to go in order to finish a level.I say rent it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Very entertaining game.

(Capcom made a deal with Blockbuster and released the game to them a month before the stores get it so their customers could rent before they chose to buy -- great policy as I am a quick buyer.) It is so much fun to play, a little wandering, a little collecting, a little fighting. We laugh as we get from level to level either because his moves are so cool or because the ghosts, zombies or skeletons have just stole our clothes! Great for my boyfriend to play together passing the controller back and forth between us . . . can't wait to play it with his kids!The graphics are great and really capitalize on the platform. Load times are quick.

The game plays like a 3rd person adventure, then when in combat with a zombie or creature, switches to a first person view where you your shots to choose where to shoot them. Overall, for a Resident Evil game, it isn't the best. But for a Game Boy Color game, this is one of the best. So, if for some reason you've never played a handheld more advanced than the original Game Boy or the Game Boy Color or if you're a diehard Resident Evil fan, you'll enjoy it.

Reading it was superfluous. Most of what Kobren covers is cosmetic management of the problem; the advice on diet applies only to the worst lifestyle offenders, and he paints finasteride (Propecia) as a panacea, which it definitely isn't. The book is thin, both physically and in terms of content.The irony is that Kobren claims to be a debunker and \\"consumer advocate\\", and this book is supposed to be his vehicle. To an experienced eye, it just looks like he is joining the rush to make money from male insecurities about hair loss.The answers to male pattern baldness will come, eventually, but they won't be found in this book.

I am currently using the herbal supplements and a DHT blocking shampoo from eBay. I have not noticed hair growth, but slowed hair loss I have noticed.

Of course, maybe a hundred or more other authors make the argument far more cogently. But give Solomon his due, he correctly observes that not all of the reporting on Iraq or White House explanations of the rationales for invading Iraq are entirely factually correct.

Don't buy it, rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"great eye candy, boring game","review":"I sold this after playing it for about 2 hours. Beautiful but boring as can be. I'll take GoldenEye on N64 over this game anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible game","review":"I don't even know where to begin with this game. It was horrible in every aspect I can think of. The best level was the first one, where you are going up the beach. The rest was completely aweful. The AI was horrible and charged me only to get killed. I never had any support. You are all alone in the game and no one is there to help you, unlike BIA and COD. Soldiers rarely were sent on huge missions alone in WW2. This game had no real aspects of the war and was not well made. It is the first game that I couldn't even force myself to finish. I do not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medal of honor frontline","review":"\\"This game is awesome if u like games with alot of [tail] kicking action.\\"u take the idenity of a allied agent name Jimmy Patterson. this game is jammed pack with action that will give u the adrenaline rush of ur life.Awesome game. it is the must have on everybodies wish list"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh No","review":"Please people do not waist your money on this game. i beat it in one day. there is no blood and no profanity. it gets very repetetive after the first couple missions. the only fun part is the first level and thats about it/ the aiming is horrible and the human graphics are VERY VERY weak. even the ending mini movie is boring. the only type of games EA should make are sports games, cause thats about all they can do right. so please, all you people reading this, just go to a blockbuster or hollywood video and rent it for a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about no stars!","review":"Personaly, I didn't like the vantage point of the soldier and you don't have the option to change it.

As with most MoH games, the back story is decent enough to bring in the player and go through missions and get a feel of combat during WWII. Where this fails is the games feels like the development was rushed. A lot of the the art assets and animations do not look good at all. Most of the missions feel like other missions pulled out of the various PC versions and quickly slapped together for the PS2.Did I enjoy this game?: no.Would I recommend this:? nope, unless you are a video game collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"never received","review":"26 days since order placed, have not received. attempted to contact wholesalemart by e mail several times, they will not respond..."},{"rating":"2","title":"im addicted","review":"LIKE HALF AND HALF THIS GAME IS A GREAT SHOOTIN GAME!BUTTHIS GAME WINS BY FAR...THIS GAME RULES IVE PLAYED 8 HOURS NOW AND NOT EVEN CLOSE TO HALF WAY THREW!!I'M HOOKED CANT STOP PLAYIN WIFE TYPIN THIS WHILE IM SHOOTIN BAD GUYS.:)IF YOU HAVE SEEN SAVING PRIVATE RYAN THIS IS JUST LIKE THE MOVIE LOTS OF HEART BEATIN FUN..BUY IT ITS WORTH IT IM 37 AND I LOVE IT HAPPY GAMING FROM TEXAS....OPIE TAYLOR:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Medal of Honor Frontline Review","review":"I love the MoH games. I have every single one so far except for Frontline. I love the way the game was made, FPS, shooting enemies with a large aray of weapons. If you loved the other MoH's, then you'll most likely love this one even more, enhanced graphics, better gameplay, hopefully longer and harder levels. I haven't beaten MoH Underground yet, I'm waiting to get it back from my friend who I let borrow it over a month ago, he truely loves it. I can't wait til June 6th or 7th. I read the review for it in my newly purchased Game Pro magazine, can't wait to play it! If you like FPS's, then this is your game. Taking place in the Nazi owned lands and destroying your enemies with small or large weapons is very fun, I wish you could control a tank in one level. BUY IT IF YOU LIKE THE OTHER MoH'S!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay but..","review":"its ok but i didnt think it was to realistic. it was fun, had a good choice of weapons. but the bloody tanks were rubish. i must tell you, if you war, buy call of duty or moh rising sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game isn't that good.","review":"This game isn't as good as the reviews say it is. The first level especially is horrible. Aiming is a nightmare. Artificial Intelligence ain't that great. No gore. It isn't very realistic. The graphics are okay. If you want a good First Person shooter, you should get a PC and play return to castle Wolfenstein. Now that's an FPS. Now, the good things are, is that there are real events, that's about it. So don't bother, unless you're itching for a mediocre FPS. Enough said. Don't bother!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good / Great?","review":"This game which makes EA's Hall of Fame and Greatest Hits, is a good first person shooter game. This game is the best representation of the DDay invasion, you really can't go wrong with the opening scene of this game. The guns are realistic but hard to shoot. It really depends which game level you play as to how much fun you will have. This game does not stack up against Castle Wolfenstein, but it is a good game.Joseph Dworak"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Multiplayer mode but otherwise a great game","review":"I still haven't figured out why anyone would make a first person shooter game without a multiplayer mode. Despite this huge discreapency, Frontline is still a great game. The graphics and especially the sound are extremely realistic. The game is challenging and will take you some time to play. the replay value is also pretty good. The weapons are authentic from World War II and are varied. The missions are of several different varieties from sniper levels to straight up raiding the beach at Normandy. You can do some sneaking around and not just blasting your way through. Probably one of the best FPS games for one player I just wish there was a multiplayer option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Fantastic","review":"I found this game to be totally awesome. The layout and multilevels make this game a \\"thumbs up\\". The objectives are challenging and quite interesting not to mention the variety of weapons that can be used for each mission. They got it right when they developed this game for PS2 and a Medal of Honor in game design is truly deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy.","review":"If you can pry yourself away from GTA3 you will like this game. I rank it in the top 3 of all the PS2 games I've played, just behind #1 GTA3 and just ahead of Madden 2002. The controls are bit tricky to get used to at first since you have to use the toggle bars instead of the direction pad but I adjusted to it after a few hours. The graphics are very nice and the enemy AI is good as well. My favorite part of the game is the rich sound, empty shells pinging off the ground, and the footsteps of enemy soldiers add to the realism. The soundtrack is great, it really adds to the game. Overall, if you are a fan of the Medal of Honor series or like war games, you will love this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this game","review":"frontline is the best war game that i have ever played.the missions are challinging, but you can use cheats. your guys name is jimmy patterson, for how ever long it takes u to beat the game, you feel like your jim.their is awesome weapons includind a buzzuka. everyonce in a while jim just doesent move forward, i asked my friends if it happend to them, and they said ya. but its no big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece...","review":"This game is truly one of the heavyweights on the PS2 system, it is amazing. I rented it for a week, and I'm desperately trying to wait for the price to come down to buy it, but it's not easy!! I find myself thinking about it all the time!! From the games first scenes, which are incredibly intense, the game just continues to get better. It's a BLAST to play, and the missions are just hard enough to make it fun and not as frustrating as many games can be. I would wholeheartedly recommend this game as one of the best games ever made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gamer","review":"The 1st level where u r on omaha beach is great...its unique and original. However after that it becomes the ususal...you are the only 1 in an area and its all up to you.. No one is ever assisting you and its just the same as other FPS (with exceptions) The graphics are great and so is the sound. I recomend you to buy it if you enjoy games like James Bond. But if you are looking for a game where teamwork is reguired throughout the game i suggest you put down the PS2 and go back on your computer and purchase games like counter-strike...ghost recon....Global Operations ect ect ect"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Jewish and get MUCH satisfaction from this","review":"I just wanted to add that being Jewish, I love being able to sit there mowing down Nazis. I've actually only played the free playable demo I got on a Playstation Magazine sampler back in '02. It takes you right to that French or German street where you can hop on the Jeep and start firing that mounted machine gun. I rented the real game but had major trouble getting off the beach on D-Day. Let me tell you though, as a Jew, it's a sweet, sweet fantasy to blow away Krauts all day long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Except for 2 things","review":"I got a chance to play the Medal of Honor Frontline demo, and there is no doubt this game is no less than a masterpiece, however, the only thing I wasn't happy about was that there is no blood. When you shoot a Natzis or anybody for that matter, there is no blood. If there is no blood it really doesn't complete the whole aspect of what war was about. Also, not that you would want to do this, but, if you accidentally try to shoot one of your fellow soldiers, nothing happens, they don't get hurt or die. I am sure back in WW2 when something like that accidentally happened the bullet would have injured or even killed a fellow soldier. Other than those 2 things, this game is an absolute masterpiece. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sometimes boring","review":"its better than moh rising sun because its more funner to play but it doesnt have save points so when you die on a mission you have to start from the begining"},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD be nice.....","review":"This could be a great game if it werent for a few major flaws.The controls are absolutely awful and counter intuitive, even the menu on choosing a custom controls setup is very user unfriendly. The ridiculous 'rating' system for games, movies and everthing else in this country result in very unrealistic gameplay. I am not interested in gore for the sake of gore but an enemy soldier just falling without any blood effects at all after being hit by a tankshell is just stupid. Again this could be a great game but it is not. Get rid of these stupid ratings and grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to play against walls ?","review":"This game has same old problem as in Medal Of Honor 1 and 2 for PS 1. The control is too slippery and moves very fast which will make you dizzy in less than 30 minutes playing the game. You play most of the game facing and bumping into walls. Due to this flow there is no sense of precision. You can never target your enemy precisely unless you move your joystick very slowly, which is bad because you are vulnerable to enemy fire.There is no sense of reality, you can take 6 to 9 shots from your enemies and still live, while you get to shoot them with just one bullet.The only good thing about this game is the graphics. But there is nothing new and innovative about this since PS2 is supposed to have good graphics.Compared to other first person shooter like the non-dizzy Red Faction this game is lame. Compared to the Rainbow Six series and Operation Flashpoint this game is a joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it, don't buy it","review":"Way too easy. The game is beatable on \\"hardest\\" mode in no time. Decent graphics; but, essentially the exact same game as the original 007 Goldeneye for Nintendo (the older one). Much better to rent. Gets boring, no exciting features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good...","review":"I didn't realize it would be first person or I wouldn't have bought it. It's very difficult to move and aim. If you don't play on the \\"easy\\" setting, your dead before you have a chance to do anything.The enemy is nice though, they stand still and let you shoot them.I would take it back if I had that option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why settle for single player","review":"This game is fun but my question is why did they settle for single player. What I mean is this game like many others could have easily been made a 2 player split screen cooperative game. Then I would say the perfect game. Who agrees with me that this would be the greatest game if it were split screen cooperative. Over all this is a good war game but it would be better if it were 2 player split screen cooperative. Well its just a tip for the next medal of honor game Well click the yes under the review if u think this game should be coop and click no if u think it shouldnt. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Presentation, lame controls...","review":"This game looks great, and evokes imagery from every great WWII movie ever made. The sound is top notch, from yelling German soldiers to the inspiring score. Like a lot of console first person shooters, though, I don't find the controls to be intuitive and responsive enough. That said, on normal difficulty you can take a lot of punishment, so the difficulty aiming doesn't make the game too hard. It just severely cuts down on the realism aspect when you're standing at point blank range, missing your opponent while inexplicably absorbing 2 bullets in the chest without dying. For a WWII game, it plays more like a sci-fi shooter. But again, the total package and presentation make this game worth the price of purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best MOH Games yet!","review":"I've only played up to the seventh mission, but this game is definitly worth buying. The graphics are about a four and a half star rank on a five star scale, but the gameplay and the sound is excellent. The buttons are almost like the older games, and if your a new MOH player it takes about less than 5 minutes to learn them. Instead of going out to buy some [2 star game]... pay the extra ... bucks for this 5 star game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Art Of War!!! A+++","review":"I am not a fan of first person shooter games, as this is one. But with this game, I got hooked as there is action right off the bat. The opening is like playing in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". This game makes you feel like you are actually in the war. The weapons are just what you would have used in WWII. Each mission you have is given to you by the commanding officer, but if you pause the game by hitting start, you can see all the objectives of the mission that you must complete. As I said, I don't like 1st person shooter games, but this one is a must have. Especially if you have a knack for history. Even if you don't, buy this game, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game on ps2","review":"Well medal of honor frontline is the best game out but the only thing wrong about it that it does not have that many missions.

This game is perfect. The music sets the mood for each mission. Also the ambient noises create the tension. You can see and hear bullets whiz by your head. Each level has so much details. Like barrels blowing up and realistic fire bursting out. You can shoot bottles that crack, windows that shatter, and steampipes that burst out steam. Also a great addition is that you have other soldiers that help you out, although you mostly play solo. The enemy A.I. is also challenging, especially on hard. The graphics are sharp and crisp. Lips move, you can see different faces on everyone and facial hair. There are 19 missions overall ranging from a beach scene from Saving Private Ryan and a Nazi submarine. There are about 20 weapons in the game. Ranging from a Colt.45 and hand grenades. The controls are perfect for veterans but a little difficult for beginers. This game is worth [the money]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game and lots of fun!","review":"This is a really cool game. A lot of people are picky about the graphics in games but I'm not. However, the graphics are good enough in this game for anyone to play it. There are a bunch of levels to play. There are plenty of weapons to use to get you through this game. Also, there are a lot of glitches in the game. My friend has this game also and the glitches make us laugh sometimes. -Clark"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just can't AIM!","review":"I played Call of Duty on PC and I was in AWE! So I got this Medal of Honor game for GameCube. I thought playing a game without a keyboard would be best...but I am wrong. Trying to aim in this game is \\"THE\\" challenge. I lose patience and turn it off before I even get deep into a level because it is hard to aim at those who are shooting at you. On the PC you can get the cross hairs between the eyes, but on the former... you kinda' just have to swing the cross hairs while in rapid fire hoping it will strike your target somewhere. Shooter Games will no longer be bought for my game console...I'll just stick with my PC :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing compared to the Computer Version","review":"If you have access to a half decent computer than don't even bother getting the PS2 version of this game. Allied Assault is so much more entertaining than Frontline, it's not even funny. I turned Frontline off in 20 minutes and played Allied Assault instead. Not only does Allied Assault have single player action, but online multiplayer, which the PS2 version does not have. Get Allied Assault on PC, and forget this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"EA Sports has done it!","review":"EA Sports has (in my opinion) broken out of sports games with this game and done so in a spectacular way.

WIN THE WAR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's no call of duty.","review":"let's see, this game was made about 5 years ago.. maybe then, it was considered great, but now? nope! call of duty 1 for PC was way way better than this. no thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT HOT GAME","review":"IM TELLING U GUYS I GOT THE GAME TODAY ITS SO CRAZY AWESOME GAME ONE OF THOSE MUST HAVES PICK IT UP THE SECOND U START TO PLAY YOU'LL KNOW ITS WORT THE $$$"},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY GREAT GAME!!!","review":"I thought this might of not been as good as Allied Assault but trust me it proved me wrong big time!

It is arguably the finest WW2 shooter game I've ever played, and it reincorporates so many key elements from the original Medal of Honor, the 'grandfather of all WW2 games!' The levels are challenging, the weapons are realistic, the objectives are relatively simple, and the graphics are considerably good, in comparison to Medal of Honor Rising Sun. If you want to play a truly wicked shooter game that will actualyl challenge you, play Medal of Honor Frontline!

It has 18 missions with objectives like rescue a soldier to execute a leader. The only bad thing in this game is there arn't really as many lvels as the other medel of honers. Even though the levels are pretty long. But that's only one rong thing and I still love ths game."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!","review":"For someone who doesn't mind playing an action game by themselves for long amounts of time than this is a game for you! This game is a first person shooter but putting you in the era of World War 2 is what it does best. Everything from the beaches to the towns to the barracks looks vintage but renewed for the game and the overall playing of the game is excellent. It took me more than 2 weeks to beat this game and I consider that a good and lengthy game. The missions are cool and never stop, you are constantly on the run and checking every direction and corner for an enemy waiting to witness your demise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed and Unoriginal","review":"I have played the first Metal of Honor and I loved it. However, this game does not improve on the Metal of Honor formula. Let me start off by saying what I love about this game; the sound is fantastic and some of the missions are actually fun. Now let me tell you about the bad:The hit detection for most of the A.I is almost non existent. The controls for your aim is so oversensitve that hitting your enemy is a challenge in itself, especially where there is no auto aim. The computer Nazis have an advantage over you, they can move and aim better than you can. Some missions have you doing the same thing over and over and it gets really old, really fast. Take away all the fancy sound and WWII theme and you have a less than average, not so fun game. Rent it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Video game","review":"Son loved it he said it was a good addtion to his collection, need to buy more of theis type. Good quality great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out for the tank!!!","review":"Nothing less than amazing. Graphics were expected to be good but I had no idea how good. Excellent to say the least. The one thing that is new is that your able to communicated with certain AI which is a plus. There is no two player mode anymore which kind of dissapointing but the over all game is 5 star quality. It is really short, it took me two days to conquer the Nazis and that's after being killed many, many times. Those tanks are so unreasonable. It's always shoot now and ask questions later with them. The panzer squad was no picnic either. You must buy this game you will be very impressed with the overall product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"The game itself is relatively simple but fun to play.I'll admit that it took me a while to get used to it and that's because the game is set in World war 2 and I'm used to more modern weapons instead of just simple handguns and the like. But once you get used to the game, you hardly notice the primitive armaments anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was awesome!","review":"If you want an awesome war game this is the one for you. the graphics were awesome,and so was everything else about it.

I was expecting it to be made in the mold of the first two, and while it was to a degree, it was alot different than I expected it to be. The beginning starts out on 'the Beach' as I like to call it and it's extremely intense getting through. That's how it begins and it doesn't let up...let me tell you. It's intense to the Nth degree.The graphics are awesome and the sound is kickin'. The game itself is very challenging. There's just something about going on these missions in this game that are so cool.I'd like to recommend this game to all FPS fans or action fans in general. Medal of Honor Frontline is an awesome start for the PS2. Can't wait to see the next to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEDAL OF HONOR FRONTLINE IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This game is the best I have played in years.

Two thumbs up for EA Games!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a PAIN!","review":"If you love spending hours to complete a mission only to be killed just before completing it, then having to go through the mission again, and again, and again, you'll love this game. I didn't. Some levels were easy, but others got ridiculous. I hate games without save points within missions. I've also decided I don't like first person shooters. Most of all, I don't like Torture, and that's what this game became. I did, however, enjoy Medal of Honor: Rising Sun. It had save points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decidedly mediocre","review":"Maybe I'm just getting old. But this game seems to have no identity. As a shooter it's pretty bad. Trying to aim the crosshairs to shoot the enemy is an exercise in frustration, it's just not possible to precisely aim using the Playstation 2 analog sticks the way you can using a mouse on a computer. So many times I was in a small room with a German soldier, and I couldn't even put the crosshairs on him, and my character was like 4 feet away! Sometimes it's hard to hit a target just a few feet away even when you have a machine gun! These flaws might be forgivable if the story was any good... which it isn't. Another reviewer raved about the graphics, and I have to ask - were we playing the same game? Definitely nothing special here. This was my first foray into the \\"Medal of Honor\\" series, and I have to say, I was pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I was very disappointed in this game.

You cant even kill your own allies. Thats realistic? You people know nothing about video games. The game is linear and it seems that the allies would have lost the war without you, you end up doing everthing. The history lesson after each mission was boring and should have never been put in the game. The symphony music sounded like you were at a funeral. This game is not as good as everyone claims it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"[Junk]","review":"The DEMO was fun, the game isn't. The aim is bad, you always die, and everyone seems to have a gun. There is no health in some levels. In the U-Boat, a billoin people shoot you and there is no health. I hate this game. ALOT. I have played the other medal of honors and this game is the worst. Don't buy it. THe first mission is almost impossible to beat until you have played it 5,000,000 times and know where and what everything is. The collision detection is also really bad. You can shoot a person ten times in the head when they are standing right next to you, and they still won't die. The bullets seem to go straight through them.

This is the first FPS game that I have played on my new PS2. Unlike a PC version the aiming is difficult on the PS2 as compared to a mouse. In addition there were times when the crosshairs were centered on targets only to have no hits. That being said this game was a lot of fun and challengine. Be prepared to be frustrated with lack of health packs and enemies that seem to anticipate your every move. The last 2 level were a bit disappointing but overall the game was fun and the graphics phenominal. I am sure that there will be a MOH 3 in the near future. Oh, one more thing..if you get killed at any time in the level you have to start the level all over as there is no save like PC games."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best game i have ever played","review":"Frontline is the best and most realistic(except blood)game that I have ever played. First the graphics are amazing. I felt like I was there. Second I cannot beleive the sound. I can tell where gun shots are comming from just by the sound. Third it is very fun. Some people are going to hate me for saying this, but in some ways it is better than GTA3. Actually in a lot of ways. So I would recommend getting this game RIGHT now. This is the #1 game i have ever played, on any system. The only thing I didn't like was there was no 2 player. Other than that it is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"medal of honor gets a medal of honor","review":"Medal of honor is a very exciting game especially if you like role playing games.

The graphics and gameplay are excellent and the weapons and missions are authentic and true to WWII. My favorite mission would have to be D-Day. It really captures the horror of landing on the beach.

There are very few things that are of use to my husband and I in dealing with the stillbirth of our son after the funeral. Most of the advice is centered around dealing with the news itself, the delivery, notifying family and friends. If you enjoy a book that is like reading a personal diary of one woman, this book is for you.

We went out and got it along with others and \\"Empty Arms\\" along with a 2nd book \\"I'll Hold You in Heaven by Jack Hayford\\" were the most helpful. We have been supplying both of these books to our hospitals' OB ward and to anyone we know who needs them for 12 years. These books are both wonderfully helpful and comforting at an unimaginably difficult time.

Josephy describes the Chagui'an massacre site at Yigo where approximately 45 young Chamorro men, who were munitions carriers for the Japanese, were beheaded or shot by Japanese soldiers just days before the end of the war. We are certain they all believed they would have been let go, but no one survived. Josephy's descriptions of the site are all that the people of Guam have regarding the massacre at Chagui'an. Josephy's book memorializes the account and insures that it will not be forgotten.

I'd much rather splurge on something else for my fat. These two-serving bags come to almost 300 calories with very little protein. If the bags truly came in one-serving sizes and were cheaper, I might actually buy a smaller amount of them again someday. But I've had these bags for a few months already, and even though I have more than six months before expiration, I imagine I'll be looking for ways to give some away. This has been my biggest [...] grocery disappointment. I only give them two stars instead of one because for some shoppers the main point really may be adding fiber to your diet with calories and fat counting little.

With that in mind, I will say CUP OF MY BLOOD has an original premise. Too bad the script doesn't live up to its expectations. The acting isn't the worst I've ever seen, but it's not far from it. Filmed on a tight budget, one could have expected lower production values, but they couldn't get much lower. Sex fans may find the heavy breathing simulated sex scenes erotic, although I found them tiresome and oblique. Murky and vague, CUP OF MY BLOOD brings nothing new to an ailing horror genre, and is certainly not worth buying, rent if you can't find something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential, but failed miserably","review":"The movie had interesting potential. It starts with a well framed concept of a box with mystical powers, and how a small group of people are willing to die to protect it, people hunting it, etc. From there, though, the movie spirals into a bunch of nothingness. It drags on and on about a washed up photographer who focuses on porn shots, and his painfully mundane life. The engaging concept shown in the beginning just runs out of steam. Could have been interesting, but is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark & Brooding (Low Budget) Horror","review":"\\"Cup Of My Blood\\" combines a few different genres to create a unique movie experience.Writer/Director Lance Catania uses a gloomy look to present his story, which can best be descibed as \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" meets \\"The Evil Dead\\".And NO, I'm not comparing \\"Cup Of My Blood\\" to those classic films, but story-wise it has that kind of vibe happening.The acting is a mix-mash of talent, some outstanding and others a bit stiff, but over-all effective in this context. The cinematography looks fantastic, and keeps an eerie feeling of dread present at all times.With a mix of politics, porn, love and demonic possesion, you can't go wrong for your Indie dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Phsycological Thiller","review":"Out of all the movies I have seen, Cup of My Blood, really sets a grand standard on what a genre film should be made on. Inconsequence, the film goes beyond its genre. Overall, Cup of My Blood, is a great phsycological thiller/horror movie because it is very down to earth, very real. The use of light as a form of imagery added to the overall atmosphere/mood. Cup of My Blood would not dissopoint anyone who sees it. It is one of the few horror/thiller movies that I have seen that I actually enjoyed. It can be said that this movie surpasses most others made. Great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great, Sweet Story","review":"This is a really simple, short read, but it offers such great insight into the lives of five young Native Americans at a mission school. The stories are sweet, but the meanings are profound. Francis La Flesche offers the reader an opportunity to step into their lives and to see how they live and learn in both cultures. I had to read it for a history class, but I enjoyed every part of it. The story does end abruptly, with an ending story unlike the other stories, but it is still worth reading and I would recommend it to anyone interested in Native American life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, but could be more detailed.","review":"I had to read this book for a Native American Studies course. It was an interesting short read, but I feel that the description that La Flesche gives of boarding schools is too lenient.

I looked into this game quite a bit and thought it was worth buying. What is great about this game is the two different modes to play in: on foot playing as a pirate captain and in your ship sailing the seas. There is really nothing too frustrating about this game so it is a game you really can play for fun and for relaxing. It also has a quick ship on ship multiplayer battle between two people or person vs computer. However, I do not consider this mode to be a whole lot of fun. I would say the reason you should buy this is for the campaign; it is simple enough to enjoy but still has challenges and items to find as well as puzzles and quests."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"I don't think this book has any insights to offer.It's been about three months since I read it, and I will only remember it for one reason: the gimmicky setup.How so gimmicky?There's a university professor who gets addicted to drugs. One lurid night, he kills his brother. After being publicly disgraced, he goes to jail.That's not the plot, no. That's the backstory. In other words, this novel begins where you would expect it to end.But, while I haven't seen that done before, that doesn't necessarily make for a good book: what possible insights can it have to offer?

What happens when a talented singer nearing Medicare age decides to \\"get hip\\" singing the songs \\"the kids are listening to today?\\" Richard Cheese (a bit younger) makes a whole career doing just that, and the results are hilarious. When Paul Anka does it, the results are just as funny. Imagine \\"Eye of the Tiger,\\" \\"Everybody Hurts,\\" amd \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" with a swinging big band. Yes, it's funny. But was Anka being funny intentionally? The world may never know.Still, if you love big band and swing, and you can appreciate irony, you'll enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the *#@$!!","review":"C'mon, give me a break!!

By turning pensive and pain-driven songs like \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", \\"Black Hole Sun\\", and \\"Everybody Hurts\\" into sappy, big-band, senior-citizen cruise tracks, Mr. Anka tries to grant himself a new lease on an already dead career. It is truly astonishing that a man who has so much experience in the music biz would disrespect these artists to such an extent. These time-honored tracks deserve better than that. Isn't there anyway that the original artists can demand the songs be destroyed forever?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad rip-off","review":"It's obvious that Anka stole the whole concept of turning rockclassics into swingsongs.Richard Cheese has been doing this stuff for years, and is simply MUCH much better than Anka.Because Cheese isn't very well-known, Anka saw his chance to simply steal his idea to boost his career.This album is not even half as good as anything Richard Cheese ever did. It's just a very bad rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to rock.","review":"Keep out of my genre, grandpa!This guy thinks he can come in, take respected rock songs and go \\"hey, I can make this soooo much better if I convert this into my genre!\\" Fat chance. He murdered \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" because he knew nothing about the song. He merely read a lyrics sheet. The song is all about teenage angst, anger and depression. It's full of emotion. He takes it and reads the lyrics slowly while a jazz band plays in the background. This means that he turned the song into an empty shell. The lyrics meant nothing because HE didn't know what they meant.Others such as \\"Jump\\" are exactly the same.Don't buy this. Get the actual songs or, if you were looking for a parody, buy Wierd Al Yankovic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb arrangements, classic vocals...","review":"The lush arrangements and top session players make this a superb album. Anka selected songs that were popular in their original genre, and did a great job reharmonizing/arranging them for a swing band. His interpretation is refreshing and brings new life to the original compositions. Anka's vocals are smooth and easy on the ears. In particular, I thought the arrangement and vocals on The Cure's Lovecats was excellent. I don't like the original, but I love Anka's version. I hope he's working on Rock Swings Volume 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looooved it!!","review":"In the era of the mp3s, its nice from time to time to buy a real CD.

Apart from the running order, the the cd is identical. I've always liked Paul Anka, but this album is amazing. The tracks are all outstanding, unlike anything I've ever heard before. There are so many highlights that I wouldn't know where to begin. All I can say is that I've played this every single day for the past month, and it just gets better with every hearing.

But not here...","review":"Maybe it's just the Amazon samples, but all of the tracks sound very much the same. Very bland. The attempt to be original has rendered the songs unrecognizable and I can only recommend this CD for those needing a background soundtrack for sleep.Paul jumps on the Lounge Cover bandwagon and then disses other artists on the radio? I would even recommend the poorly recorded Bud E. Luv covers over this tripe. And, of course, the Richard Cheese CDs are FAR better than ANY of them and carries the edge of recognizable arraingements and lyrics.In short, I'd save your money for the good stuff, and this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"likes nails on a chalkboard....","review":"I heard this CD yesterday as I shopped in a local bookstore.

This is horrible! I am a swing fan. I love Michael Buble. My friend told me about this, and I saw the first track was from my favorite band, Bon Jovi. (I'm going to be 17 on Saturday, and I have been a fan since I was about 13) This band means the world to me. Not to mention, I am a fan of the other rock bands he covered. I listened to It's My Life and it honestly felt like a slap in the face. Some of the other rewievs were VERY harsh to the grunge fans.

Now before you write me off as some kook who refuses to like covers. I love covers. I have many tribute albums and several albums that have covers of other people's bands. But there are times that you change them so much that you might as well have not bothered doing a cover in the first place. That's what this is. Most of these are totally unrecognizable from the original versions. I don't know what the actual point is here.I listened to all the samples, and quite honestly, I can't see how it would make someone want to buy the album - the majority of the music here sounds completely similar, which is not the case if you listened to all of these songs in their original form.Sorry, can't help you with this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm...","review":"One must love Paul Anka and not Rock in order to like this cd. one must HATE rock. or maybe one must just find this cd funny to recommend it.why did you do it? now i can understand the words of kurt cobain! its just not natural!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this \\"album\\"!!!","review":"This album has got to be the worst cover album I've ever heard.Just listen to \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\".. ugh, Kurt must be turning in his grave.

If you want to hear an emasculated, soulless version of Smells Like Teen Spirit, stripped of any actual content and shackled to a sanitized yet oh-so peppy beat, this might be the album for you. I actually had good hopes for this album, as I agree w/ his thesis that there're great songs out there that people'll never hear because they're in the wrong genre.

First of all, people have been doing this stuff since Sinatra covered \\"Mrs. Robinson\\", so it's absurd for anyone to claim authorship for the idea. Also, Cheese does it more as a gag- his singing is self-consciously campy, and his arrangements are usually limited to piano and rhythm section. Anka in comparison tries to interpret the songs seriously and personally, and spares no expense with elaborate arrangements. For the most part he is quite successful; if I weren't already familiar with the songs, I'd think some of them- like \\"True\\", \\"Jump\\", and \\"Eye of the Tiger\\"- were written 50 years ago. Several of his interpretations far surpass the original recordings. Interestingly, the lyrics of heavier rock songs such as \\"Black Hole Sun\\" and \\"Teen Spirit\\", sound trite and incoherent in this context and come across more like spoofs; Anka really doesn't seem to have a feeling for that sort of dark material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a stanka - it's Paul Anka","review":"Well, I grew up listening to Paul Anka in the 70s (I still wish \\"Listen to My Heart\\" was re-released on CD, as well as the song\\" everybody ought to be in love\\"), and I only know some of the original takes of the songs he covers on Rocks Swings. When I heard \\"It's My Life\\", I swear I thought Sinatra was reincarnated. It's great - and I like the original version of that. Some of the other songs echo Sinatra - there's nothing wrong with that. In some ways, this cd reminds me of Sinatra's duets albums -- and on this album Anka sings much much better than Sinatra in winter.Before you bash this as a unnecessary risk for Mr. Anka, let's remember: 1) Sinatra didn't write anything - he COVERED other writer's songs (and was very good at it); 2) Anka has always been an underrated singer; and 3) it don't mean a thing is it ain't got swing.So lighten up and keep an open mind listening to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy it as lounge swing or as a joke. Either one","review":"...But give credit to Anka for having the sense of humor and chutzpah to pull it off. Paul Anka singing Spandau Ballet, Billy Idol, Nirvana, Lionel Richie, Bon Jovi, REM, Soundgarden? What's not to like?I think it is cool that old-school Anka can find a way to embrace grunge!Most vocalists of Anka's generation would never touch this material with a 10-foot pole. But Anka (and his very talented music arrangers) know that one of the great things about great songs is that they can be re-interpreted countless different ways and still keep their musical integrity.This is absolutely worth listening to at least once or twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegas meets CBGB's!!","review":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this record!

What is hoped for - an insight into the real culture - is sadly lacking. The Ostlings have chosen to speak with the \\"in\\" and \\"out\\" Mormons who are obvious choices. A much truer picture would emerge from in-depth interviews with members of the rank and file. Much has already been written and said about the heroes and pariahs of this denomination. Of much greater interest would be the insights of the real people who are the fabric of the church and have earned very strong opinions in favor of or against its policies. Lastly, the book is extremely repetitive and in need of substantial editing. Shame on Harper San Francsico!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's More Reading to Do","review":"The book is authored from the perspective of the \`non-believer' in a kind of journalistic style. There is value in a perspective unaffected by personal and internal considerations, and the writer is able to offer some criticism that could not come unfettered from a Church member's pen.That said, describing a faith without a faith-based appreciation instills its own unavoidable bias, and that bias is apparent in the book - some veiled agenda such as is perhaps ever-present in \`investigative journalism.' Further, an interpretation of the LDS Church with the presumption of humanistic origins is akin to describing the ocean minus the water. You're not going to get it right. Religion is about the divine. Subtract that, and whatever you have left is something other than religion.So, while the book makes a contribution, it falls far short of its 'full truth'claims.

This book also provides information regarding the political and financial power of the church. Most of the critics of this book are likely to be Mormons, who dismiss anything about the LDS which is not written by the church.

I bought Circus Maximus thinking it would be the cool because it was kinda different looking. I must say I'm impressed with the graphics but as far as overall fun goes, it's another story. If you become an expert on the controls in a few hours like I did, you get ahead of everyone else and YOU DO NOTHING BUT DRIVE! And when you do fight there's nothing exciting about it for long.Pros:Great GraphicsGood soundControls could be a challange (for once)Multiplayer mode is almost better than single playerCrashes can be interestingCons:If your good, the whole game will just get boring!Not too many tracksVery limited gameplaySo far the Xbox has no impressive games as far as overall fun goes.

Despite the promising advertising for this title in every game shop, this game stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"a quirky experiment","review":"I'm a Jane Austen freak and devoted to Merchant Ivory movies. This one is early and quirky. It's about art and acting. It's about two quite different ways to bring Jane Austen to life in Manhattan: a traditional, aristocratic way, and an avant garde liberatory way. Watching the two ways interact on the screen (and almost merge at the end) while trying to follow the story of who abducted who and how she felt about it ties your mind in unexpected knots. I think one needs to have read not only Jane Austen's juvenilia, but also Richardson's now-impossible once-best-seller novel Sir Charles Grandison to understand all the allusions and satire. If you happen to have experienced the artistic circles in New York in the 60's and 70's - from the upper class patrons of experimental avant garde art to the struggling young would be actors - then you MAY enjoy the movie. Many people seem to have really disliked it. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dissapointment!","review":"The blurb about this movie made it seem like something I wanted to see, even buy. I rented it yesterday. Thank goodness I did not buy it! It is bizarre' to say the least, and lousy, to say the truth! My husband is a former film maker and even he found nothing good to say about the technique, script, lighting, acting, et al. The whole thing has almost nothing to do with Jane Austen-a lost piece of her work sold at auction to the leader of misguided would-be actors in New York under his spell. He passes himself off as some sort of avant-garde coach, when he is actually creating some kind of cult in which he alone reaps any benefits. He takes everyone's money, practically holds them prisioner, and puts on ridiculous scenes in the name of creating genius. Only Anne Baxter added anything positive to this film as an actress who wants to put on a real production of the Jane Austen works, but even she can not pull this stinker out of the loo. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery in Manhatan","review":"I have read all of Austen, including the juvenilia, can watch almost any Austen (or Austen-related) movie or program. I'm also a big fan of Merchant-Ivory films, so I was excited to see this movie, which I'd never heard of. I was bitterly disappointed! This is one of the most self-involved, badly acted, plotless, and pointless pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"This is the worst Jane Austen adaption, it was based on one of her unknown pieces from her childhood. A young woman is kidnapped by a man who wants to force her to marry him so he can gain control over her fortune. Her story made more sense than this one. Ex lovers and enemies try to get the rights to the play, the man wants to do an extremely modern version and it is horrible. They tried and failed to make a direct correlation between Jane's play and the director stealing another actor's girlfriend. The acting was bad too, the only good parts were the segments of Jane's actually play, but they didn't do the entire play and never showed how it ended and it was not enough to redeem this terrible film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Support Windows 7","review":"Please note this is a reveiew of the bundle not just the tape drive.According to the Quantum web site [...] they are bundling Backup Exec 8 Quick Start Edition which will not install on Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.

It was such a relief to find that some one had so clearly articulated dimensions of the process that I hadn't had the good fortune to find elsewhere. The writing is very clear, accessible and incisive. The concepts put forward: the 3-dimensional inquiry space, the role of temporality and memory -- these are all extremely helpful and I found directly applicable to my own research. This book really provided me with a road map out of thesis despair -- I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slashed and burned","review":"First of all, any game with Cammy in it is worth having. But it's a real shame that all the great storylines from the original version were almost entirely cut out. I was hoping for more (not less!) after Capcom created new storylines for SSF2TR. And some of the best stages were nixed too. The graphics are good, and the gameplay is okay once you get used to the awkward button scheme. The 3 new characters make it kinda interesting, but that wasn't enough to make-up for all that was lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best GBA Game Yet","review":"I like this game because there are many ways to control the fighters, and the fighters look good.

This book is going out at my next yard sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful introductory text","review":"The short answer: Helpful answers to the most commonly asked questions about difficult texts of Scripture. Only Brauch's section on Paul is occasionally unsatisfactory.It may not be a tome of resolutions for those with the a priori commitment to the Bible being inaccurate, but it is helpful in presenting feasible answers to many misunderstood texts of Scripture.Also helpful is the notion that the Bible is largely written to Hebrews and not to linear-reasoned Greco-Roman philosophers. It just doesn't fit many folks grids because it is not necessarily written to the atomistic thinker (i.e., it's not a text on science).All in all, this text is an easy to use reference to commonly misunderstood texts of Scripture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good overview, but many hard sayings unfairly simplified","review":"Overall, a well researched volume which maintains a high regard for scripture. I appreciated many of the insights offered, particularly the treatment of many of the difficult passages in the Old Testament. However, I do have a serious complaint. The book seems to trivialize a number of hard teachings in the Bible either by skirting around the issue, or by interpreting them in such a way as to remove any possible offense, thus making them easy for anyone to accept. For example, whether or not you believe in predestination, the serious reader will find it somewhat suspect that the book deals with the entire issue by demonstrating how one particular passage really does not address predestination at all, then refering back to the commentary on that passage every time the issue reemerges."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the times you're stumped","review":"Even as a holder of a Master of Divinity degree from a prestigious theological school, I'm often stumped by complex passages of the Bible. When I'm looking for a quick answer, I first turn to this book. I keep next to my Bibles for easy access. From there I'll pursue other resources. One of the refreshing aspects of this book is that it presents a few possible interpretations. Some seem more plausible than others, but it's good to have all the options. This is a great addition to any teacher's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quick source!","review":"I often like to engage people in real time debates on the internet. As a Christian, I find that one of the main challenges in such a situation is countering the many supposed Bible \\"contradictions\\" that the non-Christian is able to cut and paste into the conversation.No matter how much you read, at some point they will present to you a supposed \\"contradiction\\" that you've never heard, and in some less civil discussions, such a situation would be seen as a victory for person who is \\"hurling the elephant.\\"This book presents well written articles on all sorts of \\"Hard\\" passages, and provides explanations from a Christian perspective. It's a great quick reference guide if you need a prompt answer, but it is also deep enough to act as a springboard into further study on any of the covered issues!This is a great book that I would recommend to any Christian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watchable","review":"This movie contains almost a child like view of the world. The Americans are somewhat all knowing and wise while the British are naive. It is almost as if the British have done a total reverse of their post ww2 view that the British felt that they were the smart ones in the relationship. It cast doubts as to whether there is a special relationship between Britain and the US, and it also contains the view that Tony Blair was not a progressive which the films sees as a criticism of him.The filming itself was good. There were times, I was stunned how seamlessly, the movie was able to merge the movie into historical films.

On the plus side, the intro movie is pretty nice, and... that's about it. The music for each level doesn't loop -- after one play, it just stops. The sound effects are just terrible, and the graphics really belong on a last generation console. Crazy Taxi is your best bet if you want a taxi driving game.

It will probably entertain you for the most of one afternoon. One of the two main problems (and they are big I might add) is the very short game. It consists of 4 levels, (early bird, ect.)and they are all very short. There are some cool things in this game, like using a sonic horn to blow up cars, but the rest of the game is anoyying. You will beat this game in less then an hour. The second thing is the very irritating music. It is a grunge rock kinda song that no one can understand, and it plays over an over again. The worst choice of music in a game ever. I have to say, namco probably did put a lot of work into publishing this program. But at the price, why waste your money.

I bought the 601 with the optional Smokestop filters and it has decreased residual smoke odors from my downstairs neighbors but with a twist...the machine (with these filters at least) gives off an odd and unpleasant odor of its own.

Reviewers who are praising its \\"GREAT COLOR!\\" and clarity may be confused with Polacolor peel-apart film, which yields extremely high quality. This stuff, on the other hand, is consumer-grade and is worse than 35mm film in these respects.That's why I love it. While it isn't accurate, this film's color reproduction says \\"Polaroid\\" all over it. That really adds a certain dimension to your photos. Especially if you are photographing more \\"serious\\" subjects (i.e., not just family/friends), the polaroid has a way of lightening it up and making your photography look more nonchalant. It also \\"ages\\" your film for you, giving the photographs an old, faded feel right from the start.If you've got an old polaroid camera lying around the house, take it out, by a pack of this stuff, and experiment.

Since then, I raised my family and the years marched on. Nantasket Beach changed... Paragon Park was torn down... the town became rather lethargic... but, lately the town seems to be appreciating it's magnificent location (and the resulting real estate values are appreciating rapidly). I always saw it as a \\"miniature Cape Cod\\"... When my mother passed away, I came across the book and remembered how much she loved it. I've since bought another copy and gave it to one of my sons.

The women are gold-digging prostitutes who want to figure out how to trade sex for money and how to make the most profit doing so. THAT IS THE PLOT. Not a romance. No sexy women or men.

That is where the 68 yr old man comes into the picture. After giving everything emotionally to losers they feel that the only way to get what they wanted(clothes, apartment, living ex) was to go with an rich older married man. Each woman saw this man differently.

Goldberg's sharply honest and insightful verse strips away all illusions masking the true appearance of both physical and mental realities. Notes on the poems explain in-depth nuances of certain translation issues, and an index of poems by first line allows for quick lookup of favorite verses.

I put in 500 stainless steel rivets and by far the worst thing about it was drilling the holes.Since it is so large and the handles are so long you won't be sticking this in any tight spaces. But hey you knew that right? If you need to hold the pieces you are riveting together it is possible to have one handle resting against your torso or leg or anything really for the first pull or two to get it started.

The plastic jar to catch the used stems is a loose fit on its cap, and falls off while in use, spilling them all over.What is it with China and threads?But, it does pull 1/4 rivets, so I will just have to live with its faults.

Tyrrell tries to delve deep into President Clinton's Psyche and tell us what makes him tick.

Triplett II). Anyway, the book besides being a chronicle of Clinton's political beliefs and where they came from, it also chronicles many crimes and misdemeanors that Bill gets away with.

In those few cases where the allegations that he repeats are founded on more then greatly strained circumstantial evidence and shameless innuendo, Tyrrell, like Ken Starr, is quite pleased to pass along, without qualification, the word of paid convicted purjorers as if it were reliable fact.

So when you come to the part in the plant key that says \\"perianth absent or reduced to very minute scales\\" where do you begin looking for the definition of \\"perianth\\"?

This can be very annoying an tedious!. 3rd: The stars are not durable. I have had them on the wall for approx 3 weeks now and they are falling off of the wall! Also there are no refill adhesive stickers included within the packaging to replace them onto the walls. 4th: The amt of time they glow is for about 10-15 mins after that they just fade. :(.

When I got the dashboard apart and got the factory radio out it became obvious to me that the Metra kit was not only unnecessary for the installation but that its light weight plastic parts are far inferior to the sturdy metal bracket that Honda used. The only reason I can imagine for using this kit is if you want to leave out the small storage box, or \\"pocket\\", below the OEM radio; the Metra kit includes a face plate that covers up this area. You can opt to use the Metra kit and keep the pocket by cutting off the bottom of the kit's frame, but this makes the entire installation even flimsier than it already is. So, if your Honda came with a radio in the first place so that it has the OEM bracket, you don't need this bag o' plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"most strategic shooting game","review":"this is a great game. it doesnt matter how good you are at video games your gonna have to have stragety skills.

It's pretty flexible, though, and could be used as a guide for a longer or shorter span of time. The best thing about the book is that it helps weed out all the garbage that the wedding industry tells you is absolutely essential.

Since I intend to use it as a rehearsal aid, I find the lack of tonal accuracy in the Soprano soloist to be a major distraction. Her attempts at coloring the various pasages were woefully inadequate.While the Tenor soloist was at least true to pitch throughout the work, there was a lack of energy and firmness in his presentation that detracted from his delivery.The Baritone soloist saved the trio from a very low rating in my opinion with a confident and convincing rendering.Choral balance was fair, but the recording did seem to suffer from perhaps a lack of understanding of the work by the audio engineer."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unworthy rendition","review":"I was disappointed when I heard this recording of one of my favorite pieces of religious choral music.

It is an excellent text for intermediate students who have had classes, had some working knowledge of Italian, or had finished using a primary test. The book offers vocabulary, dialogues, reading pieces and exercises which showcase Italian culture. It does not, as do some of the other Italian texts, offer inane conversation or translation pieces simply to illustrate the lesson's grammar and vocabulary.

The idea that only felonies that are inherently dangerous in the abstract was part of CJ Bird's agenda is simply wrong. Almost certainly, that was the rule at common law when United States courts first adopted this doctrine. Further, for those who disagree with judges making law, felony murder two (the doctrine invoked by the prosecutor in Burroughs) is a creation of judges (or at least that most courts have recognized -- in 2009, the state supreme court finally found that the doctrine was somehow part of CA's statutory law. )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly formatted Kindle version","review":"Think twice about buying the Kindle version, it was not formatted correctly and is difficult to read.As far as the content goes, it seems sound.

The special FX are ok to good but that is the only redeeming quality this movie has besides the cool DVD art. There is not one likeable character in the movie that you can really attach yourself to, no chemistry between them at all, I felt no sympathy for any of them. The acting is very low grade and some of the camera work is shoddy. There could not have been ANY color correction on this film because some of the scenes were blown out and appear colorless. It's a story that's been told over and over again. I'm glad I only paid 99 cents for this movie.

The characters confused me, because they were new and unheard of. They should have stuck with the ones we're familiar with. All in all, it is a movie that is a complete waste of time!

As a matter of fact, this is one of those films that Mike Nelson and his pals, Tom Servo and Crow, will eventually have fun ripping apart on Science Mystery Theater 3000.However, because I like both Freddy and Jason, I give this film two stars -- one for Jason, and one for Freddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Line never fails, This is the most entertaining sequel of both series","review":"I picked up this blu ray today and it was truly entertaining.

New Line did a good job with reviving the 2 most popular 80's franchises which really lost steam throughout the 1990's. I saw this in the theater my freshman year of high school and I thought it was pretty good then, but I like it more now.

But the movie seems to be kind of like a \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" film it just has Jason in it, wich is soooooo cool.For me personally Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger do an exanlant job, they are both very talented actors. YES, there is plenty of blood, and action. Freddy and Jason do what they do best kill people and still find time to kick each others BUTTS!!

After seeing Jason X, I thought all hope was lost for Freddy Vs Jason to get made, and if it did, to not suck. But when I went to see it finally, I was surprisingly satisfied. The way Freddy and Jason were tied together was perfect, and I can't think of a better way to do it. Jason had some brutal killings in this movie, and I loved it since I've been a huge fan of Friday The 13th. The \\"kids\\" story kind of dragged out a bit, but if the whole movie would have been Freddy fighting Jason, it would have gotten old pretty quick. When the actual fight occurs, it is simply brutal and nasty. The audience was so into this movie, cheering and yelling at all the chaos. It was definitely an experience. The ending was also done well, considering how they need to do each character justice. Can't wait for the DVD, hopefully it's packed with awesome extras and some of the original endings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun to watch","review":"Ronny Yu definately did justice to both of the franchises. Freddy is up to his old tricks, while Jason is as menacing as ever. After witnessing the horrendous \\"Jason X\\", I was worried that this one would follow in the same direction. Thank God; it does not. This film is very modern but still manages to get in lots of the horror movie staples of the 80's - T and A, booze, drugs,ridiculous one liners out of Mr. Kreuger, and of course GORE! There is lots of grue in here folks especially in the final act. This is a film made for Freddy and Jason fans and does not disappoint either set. I'd expect to see more movies set in Elm St. and Crystal Lake in the near future. No, this is not a spoiler. There is an end, but you must know that either of these dudes can come back at any time no matter what if you are reading this.

He brings back Jason. The story is kind of weak, but then again who really watches these movies for the story. Bottom line is its fun. You get to see two horror icons go head to head against each other in a film I would call more of an action-with a little horror-type film that delivers. I only wish that Freddy and Jason would have battled a little longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I grew up with the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th movies. I own every Friday the 13th flick and Jason is my favorite slasher character. I didn't see this movie when it came out in the cinemas because I had low expectations and thought it would suck. Since it came out on DVD I decided to check it out. I must say it is one of the most badass movies I have ever seen. Robert Englund once again gives a great performance of Freddy and Ken gives a great performance as Jason. I loved this movie. The story, killings, and characters were all great. If you are a fan of these two famous slashers, you definitely gotta check this movie out. It kicks ass in almost every aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT Scary - wildly entertaining","review":"Heeeeeee's back! But are we talking about Freddy or Jason? Well, both have returned to chase the unsuspecting oversexed teenagers around the neighborhood, slashing and chopping and spitting out some of the worst dialogue this side of Caligula.All the old plot lines have come together - a psycho ward, dark buildings, squeaky stairs, the gals screaming their heads off (literally), the dumb guys who think they can beat either of the two, the party, the entrapment. It is all done tongue in cheek and despite the sudden swell of music or the punctuated noise, we know that in the end, a few of the brave souls will live to die another day.The girls are still as dumb as ever, entering deeper and deeper into dark rooms that no one with an IQ over 25 would enter in the daytime. And despite all the carnage, things seem to go on almost unperturbed. There is even an attempt at some sympathy for our fallen anti-heroes.

By the time they finish Jason off he will be in a wheelchair what is he like 100 by now. I guess they will be fighting with their canes in the next movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomore Horror!","review":"Slasher movies have never really done anything for me. Not even a sense of sick fascination of seeing people dispatched in various gruesome methods by two undead psychos. Is this fun? What the hell is wrong with you? Yeah it's just a movie, and a stupid one at that with a plot that could've been scripted by a crack-head or a 3yr old, but at the end of the day it's just a movie. The ending is predictable. Freddy is annoying with his villiany and Jason is just some retard with a machete. I was in a theater with a bunch of teenagers cheering everytime somebody got wacked on screen. There's just something terribly twisted about that.This isn't horror, there's no suspense, there's absolutely no plot and the only catharsis comes when someone gets predictably killed. The fight between Jason and Freddy in the end is short and dull. I await the coming of an actual horror film, not this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is in competition with wing commander....sigh.","review":"Aside from Wing Commander this movie is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. When I first saw the previews I thought this was simply a joke but I soon discovered that society was acually serious about this flick. I mean come on freddy and Jason alone is bad enough. I mean I love fictional movies just like anyone else but this kind of fiction is so far fetched. Two dead guys comming back from the dead to kill not so innocent teens. I mean they even kill the hot chicks! Now onto the plot. two words...It Blows. Freddy wants to kill jason so he lures him to elm street. And basically they duel from there on out. The acting was extreamly corny and the characters made so many bad decisions. This angers me so much. I mean producers spend billions of dollors to make crap movies like this when they could be using this money to help the states.

The movie started off with a bang, a very loud one, and ended with a bigger bang.The battle Jason and Freddy had was something that WILL go down in horror movie history! It was awesome! Freddy cracked a lot of jokes, and Jason cracked a lot of bodies. It had everything a good horror movie should have, which is humor, gore, jumpy moments, and many sharp objects!The setting was great, it included some psycho ward, Elm Street, Camp Crystal Lake, the woods, many peoples houses, a corn field, a school, and most importantly of all, peoples nightmares!

Two of the biggest horror icons of our time finally meet in a terrifying clash that will satisfy fans of both title characters. In this modern Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man, Freddy is trapped in hell, his once fearsome name all but forgotten completely. He ressurrects Jason to kill a few kids on Elm Street so people will start to fear that Freddy is back: thus giving Freddy the power to return. However, Jason goes wild, and isn't leaving Freddy his share of victims. So, Freddy drags Jason to the dream world for a duel to the \\"death\\". The second battle takes place at Crysal Lake, giving each monster a home-court advantage. Both are evenly matched; the real advantage depends on where they fight.This was a fun movie to watch. The fights are great, and there are plenty of scares. Enjoy, and welcome to MY NIGHTMARE!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than thought","review":"A typical horror film with gore and breasts.

Freddy's power comes from people's fear of him. Since that fear has waned in recent years, he resurrects Jason to stir up fear. When Jason starts killing Freddy's intended victims it becomes a no-holds-barred battle of the bad guys.Very well done, enjoyable film for fans of these films."},{"rating":"2","title":"freddy vs jason","review":"Since I also purchased The Nightmare on Elm Street collection, and the Friday the 13th collection, this movie can go in between both collections and make it complete"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FAIR!","review":"I DIDN'T LIKE THIS MOVIE AT ALL!ALL THIS MOVIE WAS ABOUT WAS FREDDY THROWING JASON AROUND.IT MADE JASON LOOK LIKE A WIMP-AND JASON'S NO WIMP BY ANY MEANS!FREDDY DID MOST OF THE KILLINGS.JASON SHOULD'VE BEEN THE ONE TO LOOK LIKE A CHAMP-NOT FREDDY!THIS IS JASONS MOVIE LINE-NOT FREDDYS!JASON'S THE REAL MAN-NOT FREDDY!THE ONLY GOOD PART WAS WHEN JASON GOT FREDDY,AND HAD HIM IN A HOLD,AND JASON KNOCKED DOWN A WHOLE SIDE OF A HOUSE USING FREDDY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freddy and Jason went down with this movie!!!","review":"This movie has nothing to do into the horror gender, it doesn't even scare, and the special effects are so obvious and fake that you can even see the trick in the movie!

Also, Freddy's makeup was much better than the makeup job on Jason.What is up with the annoying woman who played Jason's mother? She didn't even look like Betsy Palmer. I had to laugh at the kids with their glowsticks at the rave, and the cheesy dancing to the cheesy music. Also, The blood looks like red syrup. Why is it in all these movies they perceive psychiatric wards as places were people wander around in strait jackets and drooling?When they showed Jason as a child, what was up with the bad sound dubbing?

Why ruin two good franchises?? because Hollywood says SO! To me part 1-5,(with 1 of course being the very best),2 being good,and 5 downright silly.represents the height of the freddy franchise. Wes Craven's New Nightmare was also good, If your like me who grew up on this franchise watching On WBFS-33, or wdzl-39(the most) then NO REMAKE w/o Englund will due."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and fun!","review":"I was skeptical when I first heard they were making a \\"Freddy vs Jason\\" movie. The chances of getting it totally wrong seemed quite high. After viewing the film, however, I was pleasantly surprised. The plot makes a twisted kind of sense, the performances by Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger are inspired and enthusiastic, and the special effects are top-notch.As a Nightmare on Elm Street fan, I was pleased that the movie seemed to fit the tone of previous Nightmare movies. I was, however, intrigued by the Jason backstory and scenes. Since then I have become a fan of the Friday the 13th pictures also.If you like either franchise, you will most likely enjoy Freddy vs Jason. Even though the final battle might not end the way you would prefer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movie Rocked","review":"I thought Freddy Vs. Jason rocked! It made me jump in spots in the movie, which was good cause I loved to be scared. The first Nightmare On Elm Street scared me and so did a bunch of the Friday the 13th movies. I really didn't like it when Jason went to space, that should of never happened. But I really enjoyed Freddy Vs. Jason a must see for all true fans! And even the little fans. It had a great plot, I loved the beginning and the end! I loved it so much when they started to fight. I just hope if they ever decided to put them in a movie again they'll enclude MICHAEL MYERS! That would be so cool to see all three of them in a movie together, cause two of them was awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly horrible","review":"There is nothing to say about this film except that it was a disapointing disaster.

It had a certain mystique that made it seem as if it would revolutionize horror movies and make them enjoyable once again, and not just gore-a-thons. Boy, was I wrong. After the first 15 minutes of this film all my hopes are erased, and I'm treated to another gorefest, with no sense of direction. The only reason I'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the final showdown between Freddy and Jason, which is quite the eyecathcer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best movie ever","review":"All Im gonna say his that this was one of the best movies I've ever seen.I read a couple of bad reviews bout this movie, they just peaple who dont like action, who doesnt like action.Everybody loves this movie,action fans if u didnt see Freddy vs Jason get it and buy the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concepet but poorly acted....","review":"The film has a great concept to it but the acting is a little forced. The story line is strong, the plot is thin and the special effects are corny in some areas. It seems that the CGI department was a bunch of amatuers. Freddy vs. Jason has everything you like about slasher films and a lot that you don't.Now if only we could see Leatherface Vs. Michael."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was there an actual winner?","review":"Who knew? Elm St. is like 10 miles from Camp Crystal Lake, and you thought your neighborhood was bad? Do you think Jason ever wandered into town to just get away from it all? His hockey mask is now considered a throwback so he has the kids cheering for him. Freddy has all the quippy one-liners and that snazzy hat. How can you lose with this one?It has everything you would expect!Gratuitous shower sceneGirl falls down in woods, then just waits to get killed.Bumbling town sheriffYoung whipper-snapper deputy that is all gung-hoNew inventive ways to kill and get killedJason still just walks - you could be a cheetah and he'd still walk and get you.Freddy's make-up is still bad.Yet another culmination on the same pier in Crystal Lake. You would think it would have dry-rotted by now.It is what it is. Not bad. Not good. Fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freddy and Jason kill the CRITICS","review":"This movie is by far the most entertaining movie of 2003. I mean if you are into comical horror this is your movie to own. Although many crtics down it, it remained number one in the box office for weeks on in. Freddy is back and is funny and hysterical as ever, and the fan favorite Jason entertain's with his wit's and silentness. The late John Ritters son (Jason Ritter), makes his film debut as well as the multi-platinum recording artist from the R&B group Destiny's Child (Kelly Rowland). It's a good film to experience, especially for people with a sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"the new titans of terror go head to head","review":"not much to say if you like both series you will love this film, if not you'll find it just another over the horror slasher movie. as you can see by my score i liked this scare fest."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Knew It!","review":"Went into the theater thinking that Jason would win. The movie was excellent because it delved deeper into what made these killing machines tick. The acting could have been better, but horror movies aren't designed for their superb acting. (However, I went to the Hollywood premiere of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and I have to say that it is Oscar-worthy.) Anyway, I just have to say that Jason fans won't be disappointed if you know what I mean. Plus you get the obligatory sex scene that we come to know by heart in the Ft13 movies. Go see it because the hype doesn't do this intense action/horror flick justice. 1,000,000 stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"This dvd looks to be cool","review":"Before I go on, let me state that the movie was awesome and that I've already once wrote a review for the movie and that this review is for the dvd only. It seems that this dvd will turn out to be a great package. Its gonna include lots of extra stuff. It will be a PLATINUM SERIES 2 disc set that features deleted/alternate endings, commentaries, documentaries, and even music videos!!!!! All of that x-tra stuff looks to be x-citing. I bet Freddy and Jason will be proud that they've been put on an awesome disc. This dvd looks to be the best dvd from both series. I am definetly gonna get it when released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Congrats to Ronny Yu!!!","review":"I have to say it's the best Horror movie made since Ginger Snaps (2000).This movie has a new story and a awesome new cast, which makes the great.

How many more damn times you guys have to watch a guy in suite who will not die and wtach him kill stupid teenagers over and over and over and over and over nad over....To make the movie better they should have CHucky make a cameo! Okay The First Nightmare on Elm Street was great, and Friday the 13th was okay! But It has gotten to the point where the movies are plan stupid and their is no point for the past decade!

Freddy vs. Jason is a total gorefest. The battle scenes are brutal and bloody. The story that brings Freddy and Jason together worked well, which was a surprise. Who wins? Well you'll have to see the movie to find out. This new movie really makes you want to watch all the classic \\"Nightmare on elm st.\\", and \\"Friday the 13th\\" movies again. I like this movie, you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Your Classic Horror","review":"This is not your classic horror, or that great of a film. If you like Robert England and are looking for a good laugh than this is your movie if not, then don't buy or rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless terror","review":"You would think that pitting against 2 of the most delightful frightmen known in the history of cinema mano y mano would have in turn created a mega movie yet unseen by man. What we get here is a lot of mindless action in a duel of the monster titans, and although Freddy retains his sarcastic reign, Jason comes across like a broken shell of a man, retaining none of his over power presence. What makes matters worse is the entire cast of onlookers & victims that mindlessly scream into the camera until you want them to shut up. Unlike its predecessors, the cast of young folk here are without charm, and for that matter, without coherence in their babble.The major downfall here is you couldn't care less who survives, which makes the harrowing action around them completely meaninglessness in outcome. Therefore this movie fails at providing any real terror or even concern when putting these undesirables out of their misery could only be a benefit. Absolutely worthless venture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freddy vs Jason Blu Ray","review":"Video was fine, shipped and played well. I didnt notice the clarity on this movie like I have on some others, I have watched 3 blu rays so far and only 1 shocked me in visuals. I wonder why that is ? I will keep reviewing them.

It wasn't scary. I mean Jason and Freddy don't even look the same as in the other series they look older. Stick with the first Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street they are best ones not this one it's the worst out of all my friend and I walked out of the theater after five minutes of the movie.

Come on people, this is going to be such a waste of time. Sequels, let alone a pairing of them, is so ridiculous.

Problem with movie directors today is they are lost with ideas for horror, either they make a completing silly movie or copy a old classic. I was actually looking forward to seeing this film as I thought ok well it's something different, unfortunately it failed to prove itself as a classic.The film itself acts more like a Freddy movie then a Jason, more blood and gore as usual, also there is a number of critical errors with the film. For example Jason throws a bloke like a mile up into the air but when it comes to getting the knife out of the table he can't. Hopefully they won't make a sequel to this but when it comes to horror who knows. If you love a horror with suspense and terror then Freddy VS Jason should be left out of the choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"exactly what the world needed...","review":"Wow. If one elderly Horror-Star doesn't convince people to go to the cinemas so why don't we take TWO OF'EM? As the average bonehead in front of the television consumes anything appraised to him this concept seems to work. MAN... SWITCH ON YOUR BRAINS! This is absolute cheese. (I'm from Switzerland, I know what cheese is). And it lacks of everything except good marketing! Just BOOOOOOOOOORRRRING whit a few quite good special effects. The spirit of BOTH series got completely lost.Why don't the form a \\"all-horror-stars\\" football team (Freddy, Jason, M. Myers, Dracula, Frankenstein, the Mumy...) and let them play against the goog guys (Superman, Batman, Spiderman, Christoph Columbus, etc...)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME","review":"An incredible film with lots of energy and more importantly, lots of blood and gore. This is easily the bloodiest Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. There is never a dull moment in this flick and if you have not seen Freddy vs. Jason then you need to as soon as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridiculous, but awesome","review":"How old is this getting? How many times are Freddy and Jason gonna come back to life? I don't think that the story for this movie is good at all. I mean, let's face it. How many times have we seen these two guys die, and then come back to life. It's getting a little over the top for me. And what makes it worse is that the people in the movie can kill them everytime. But nevertheless, I think it's awesome. I mean, i don't know about you, but i've always dreamed that these two guys could duke it out. And now they've finally done it. A terrible story, but for all the gorey fanatics, it's a dream come true."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not extraordinary","review":"yeah, this is a cool movie... but after all not as much good as I thought. It is beautifully filmed, Freddy and Jason are well made characters but I can't classify it: I mean, this is not Horror (with capital H) is just a goodlooking movie with a (thank god) nice plot and some teens going around and being slaughtered... and sometimes it is even funny. I really don't know what to say, I was waiting for something different. I think a 4 stars is the highest score I can give."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freddy vs Jason II: Hellraised","review":"The movies okay, but what if they made a sequel! It would bring the two most undestroyable horror stars back. This time however, they can add the deadly pinhead to this one. If they added pinhead to a sequel to this motion picture, they could name the movie, Freddy vs Jason: Hellraised. I hope you like this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a Fun Movie to add to your Collection","review":"I don't know what I can really add to all the reviews already written, but I plan on buying the Nightmare on Elm Street collection, because I love The Nightmare on Elm street Series, but I'm going to get the old collection, not the new one as the new one from everything I've read, is not nearly as good. So I bought this movie seperate and going to buy the original series.Anyway, Many people hate this movie, and I mean, if your a die hard fan of Nightmare series, and the character of Freddie, and stories and what not, I guess I see why, but personally I really like this movie. It pits Frikin Freddie vs. Jason. And it really is, if not a great movie, just a really fun movie. Englund may not be scary in this movie, but his character personality and portrayal, is completely fun freddie, cocky stuck up Freddie, and I don't know, it's just really fun.Shipped Fast, Amazon is awesome"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of both series","review":"This movie was awsome. I saw it in theaters and it rocked.This is is basiclay the plot. Freedy cant kill anymore cause no one remembers him. so he wakes up jason again to kill peaple on elm street so they would be scared of the wrong guy. then peaple would remember him. eventuly they meet and its a bloody showdown.I wont tell you who wins though,you have to see the movie yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four stars for the lack of real fright and scares...BUT..","review":"Saw it opening day. Long awaited and scrutinized by every horror/slasher fan in the world. I can't say enough about this film.For the gore-hounds out there...much blood is spilled, alot of blood.For the horror-humour fans...more than enough frightful humour and one liners from victims and FREDDY!!! Of course we all know Jason doesn't talk, he just swings his machete...alot.Plus really cool real time and dream time fight scenes and fright scenes.Not scary...more an action/horror movie...but well worth the price of admission...Now if you haven't seen it yet...quit reading and GO!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Freddy vs. Jason - Not good enough","review":"Freddy vs. Jason felt like an action movie trying to be a horror movie when it should have been a horror movie with elements of action. It's filled with the same old, boring and tired clichés. The story is unoriginal and \\"talks down\\" to its audience. The computer generated effects are cheap and unrealistic. The cinematography is second-rate. (And, Kade Hodder should have been cast as Jason.) The only good things was Freddy's new face make-up (even though it looked rubbery at times.) Truly a disappointing effort for horror fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Meets Dumber","review":"As I watched this movie unfurl, I seriously wondered if the creators were doing a rip-off of \\"Scary Movie,\\" which I really enjoyed. But noooooo. You've got the usual teens doing stupid things like the guy who hears something outside his house and goes out there in the dark yelling, \\"Is somebody there?...Hello, is somebody out there?\\" Then you had the stupid young girl who strips naked and dives into water because she's certain her boyfriend will follow. Naturally, the killer comes after her and...this was such a horrible waste of disc and talent. after 45 minutes, I finally had to call it quits. I loved the Nightmare series but in this horrible botched up junk, Freddie goes out with a burp instead of a bang."},{"rating":"1","title":"attemted.....","review":"I wasted 3 hours wacthing this movie and it was attempted coolness.

And i find this to be a true failier in the horror seris. Its pure stupididy wraped up in a DvD that is pure crap. Im giveing it two stars only because it did give me some small bits of enjoyment and it was better than the monstrousity of pure stupidity they call Jason X. But whatch Freddy and Jason fight for yourself you might like it its OK but the original of both files is way better i meen WAY better."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOPE IT ISN'T ONE SIDED.","review":"I am going to see this movie later tonite at the midnite show and I'm looking forward to it. I just hope the final confrontation between these two horror icons isn't 20 minutes of Freddy kicking Jason's a--. I've always been more of a Jason fan than a fan of Freddy. I always thought Freddy with all his smart a-- comments and zingers was more of a lightweight than Jason. Jason never wasted time with stupid one liners, if you got in his way he'd just tear your head off and move on. Not neat, but it was efficient. The point being that Jason has survived 10 movies and he was made to look like a bad a-- and I hope in this one they don't have Freddy doing stupid stuff like spanking Jason with his own machette. Here's hoping the producers realized there are just as many Jason fans as there are Freddy fans, if they keep it even it should be a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun DVD!","review":"Lots of great extras really make this disc a must own. I especially enjoyed the Bally's Casino weigh-in between the 2 movie maniacs! Freddy really trash talks while Jason uses his huge physical appearance in a funny way. The film itself is pretty amazing and teh last 30 minutes or so make sitting through the Dawson style beginning worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoulda been a Super Bowl halftime show","review":"Okay, first of all, I loved all the old Nightmare on Elm St. movies and Friday the 13th movies. But this movie was a total waste. It's not scary - AT ALL. The story and characters were ridiuculous. Don't waste your time. Even for pure camp value its worthless. What a letdown to what shoulda been a great idea come to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 STARS","review":"I loved this movie but it's not5 stars it's 4 Freddy is great in this film and Jason is to, they have the best fight scenes if there was part2 it would be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?... because it's funny","review":"I found it mentally impossible to take this movie seriously. Maybe I just can't follow along with slasher movie plots but this movie was pretty ridiculous. As far as I can tell the plot is mindless and personality-less teenagers trying to get 2 famous slashers to kill each other before they kil them. This movie is poorly acted, and poorly written. Freddy does get a lot of laughs though, about 50% of them are intentional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible!!!!!","review":"This long awaited confrontation between the preeminent horror icons of the 1980s is an incredible disappointment. The director uses blood and gore in a failed effort to substitute for suspense and terror. The story is a sad effort, even by the standards of the two movie chains this poor excuse for a movie is supposed to be paying tribute to. I mean, for heaven's sake, since when does a forty year old zombie corpse (Jason) bleed?! Even Freddy's usual cleverness and creativity are lacking, once again buried under a load of gore that even fails to create disgust with anything besides this garbage excuse for a horror film. Bad acting, bad story, bad directing, bad EVERYTHING!!!!!!Save your money and pass. In fact, when this one finally makes its way to cable, PASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Nightmare at Camp Crystal Lake!","review":"I saw this opening night at the movies, for I have been anticipating it for some time! It did not dissapoint. At first I was very leery because of Ronny Yu, (The Bride of Chucky, need I say more) so I didn't expect much of it. He pulled out all of the stops. From the first couple of minutes he had you sucked into this world of the supernatural, where he brought two of the most sinister villians of the 80's horror movie generation together on the big screen! And the best part was he kept them as they were supposed to be. He didn't give Jason a good side, or make Freddy lame. Just when you were into what was going on with Freddy he threw Jason in it and was just awesome! Then the fight at the end! SWEET! I just had one complaint and that was Jason's mom but it was very minor. And I still give it 5 stars!Best lines of the movie,\\"Welcome to my World! B!$@h\\"\\"Not strong enough, For now, I'll let Jason have a little fun.\\"\\"That goalie seemed pissed about something!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Freddy vs. Jason","review":"This movie was extremely good and i'd like to see them make another vs. movie.

I should learn to worry less.The movie starts out with Freddy, who is very weak because the kids of Springwood have forgotten about him, and are being force fed a dream depravation drug. So, Freddy recruits Jason to go to Springwood and make the townsfolk remember the murders. Problem is, once Freddy is at full power, Jason won't stop killing! So, Freddy tries to kill Jason!What ensues is a bloody, brutal, savage and wonderfully coriographed fight that pits Freddy agains Jason. I will not say who wins, but the teens that get between them end up slaughtered, messily!Without a doubt, the crossover was everything I hoped it would be, and more. I cannot WAIT for the DVD!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seven,8 don't stay up late...","review":"Not for this hogwash.Really now!!First of all no one wins.What kind of a battle is that??The graphics are so so (And that's all I rented the video for)The storyline?Hmmm...very interesting.The acting is very bland and looks like your 3rd grader's nativity play. All in all, if I could give this a zero rating I would. Lucky enough(Used very loosely) I had rented this crapfest. A total miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a blood store","review":"How can you people like this movie.

Freddy, who has successfully been forgotten by the community he has been terrorizing, uses Jason as a means by which to implicate himself in a series of gruesome murders, hence allowing him to return in people's fears and subsequently their dreams.Things become a little complicated when Jason becomes a tad overzealous and Freddy gets a little bit jealous ...The plot, the setting, the acting, and the dialogues are all very good.Monica Keena is delightful as Lori Campbell and a little \\"exposure\\" would have been pretty nice...In a nutshell, Freddy vs. Jason is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, as long as you're in that kind of a mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"A converted Duke basketball fan","review":"Though never having been a particularly big Duke basketball fan, I picked up a copy of this book upon a friend's advice, and am glad I did.

One of them weighing in at 51 lbs. took off after a bird, hit the end of the leash and popped the D-ring off the harness. As a safety item it should be welded.

It\`s a diversified album with its own distinctive sound, well-produced, with many nice songs, which immediately brings me in a good mood when I listen to them. Blanche is really a band to fall in love with, as someone mentioned earlier.So I\`ve already become a huge fan of this album, despite some mediocre songs, which is the reason I gave 4,5 and not 5 stars. In my opinion, the strongest and most catchy tunes are: \\"I\`m sure of it\\", \\"Last year\`s leaves\\", \\"No matter where you go\\", \\"Little amber bottles\\" and \\"World I used to be afraid of\\".

But the further I got, the more predictable it became, and the worse the writing got. I had the ending figured out before I was even close to halfway through the book. And the writing was so forced, with way too many details, and awkward lines like \\"He gave her an inquisitive look.\\" Ms. Barton broke the cardinal writer's rule of 'show, don't tell,' several times over in this book.

Of course, even then I probably wouldn't have paid much attention since I've loved all the stuff I've read of hers and that was only a few years ago, after all. But this doesn't read like most of Barton's stuff at all. It reads like an old Harlequin category romance or Silhouette Romantic Suspense. [Edited to add: it looks as if this *was* Harlequin SuperRomance or the like.]Completely unbelievable coincidences drive the story, which is full of angst and \\"oh woe is me\\". If you simply must own everything Barton has written, go for it, but if you're not a fan of that kind of thing, skip this one. It was so trite and silly I couldn't finish it.

The smell is just as strong as using a regular trash can. Also, if you want to throw away something other than a diaper, like a diaper wipe, it doesn't fall through the opening on its own. You have to push it down into the pail, which is not sanitary. Don't waste your money.I had previously tried the Diaper Champ. It does mask the odor a lot better and you can use regular trash bags instead of special ones specific to the diaper pail. The only drawback is that the top gets stuck a lot which isn't something you want to deal with when trying to quickly throw away dirty diapers.We are just going to use a regular trash can with a lid until they make something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very effective","review":"I have 2 children--a 3-month old and a 3-year old and I find that when there are soiled diapers from the 3-year old, I can smell them a mile away.

Hopefully I'll have a better experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe for babies","review":"Once babies can pull up to standing, they can lift the lid and reach inside. Yuck! I added an extra latch but that made using the diaper pail more difficult. Also, it is awkward to use the foot pedal because you have to bend over. The flap doors also started to stick. As my baby's diet advanced, it didn't control odors at all. I switched to the Safety 1st and love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much different than a regular garbage can with lid","review":"I am not impressed with the Diaper Dekor...I received it as a shower gift with a box of refill liners (cost of refills - $20).

There is nothing wrong with that, but you would be just as well off using a regular trash can with a lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Diaper Genie","review":"I bought Diaper Dekor after reading lots of reviews on the web:- bigger size- no twisting and turning- foot pedal for easy disposalMy sister uses Diaper Genie and i earlier thought that twisting the cap to dispose a diaper was hasslesome and was motivated to buy Dekor. I bought the Dekor only to regret. The foot pedal mechanism was clumsy and after like 10 tries to open it, it gave way, although my husband fixed it. The smell is also not contained as well as the Genie. It is also not child proof and my 15 month old neice developed a facy to open it and explore...!I would recommend Genie over Dekor because:- genie leaks less odor- genie is child proof- genie is more robust, dekor foot pedal is not as sturdy and doesnt open completely to throw the diaper from top- genie costs lesshope this helps..."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, VERY good","review":"I did extensive research on diaper pails since I'm a little squeamish and very cheap, and this one seemed to have a slight edge among reviewers. I am very happy with it so far.It was very easy to set up. Its large capacity is great - we empty is every 2-3 days or 25-35 diapers. The liner seems like it will last a long time. The foot pedal is a stroke of genius. AND, best of all, NO smell so far. Of course, our daughter is not yet two weeks old, so the true test lies ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't make it for the long haul","review":"I was excited about this diaper pail as I'd heard so many good things about it. However the flip doors in the lid have broken twice (both times a spring seems to be wearing out in the same way). My son is only 16 months old, and I expected to use this diaper pail at least another year. Diaper Dekor has replaced the lid once already, which they did very graciously and expediently. I am going to ask them to replace it again, but am aggravated that I am having to deal with this twice. AND even putting diapers in ziplocs before disposing of them doesn't help this pail contain the smell now that my son is older. I would try another diaper pail if I was buying one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"We got the smaller pail as a shower gift.

I loved the idea of it. When I opened the box, the doors in the top where broken. I called the company and they did send me out a new insert, but when my daughter was 7 weeks old the doors broke again. So, again I called the company and they again mailed me a new insert. All was well for awhile, till my daughter started on baby foods. Now her room stinks! I change it every day sometimes twice a day but the container still smells. I have started bleaching the container and it does help some, but only for a short period of time. I thought I could deal with it for awhile but now the doors have broken again. My daughter is only 8 months old and I am pregnant agian. So needless to say we will be dealing with diapers for a long time. I plan on buying a different diaper pail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trap door breaks and horrible smell","review":"I received this off my registry and loved it, but have to agree with the others; it works until the real poop starts. I have an 8 month old, and there is no containing this smell. Even with air fresheners, Lysol, etc its awful. It doesn't help that my springs on the trap door broke, which means it does not contain any smell. We had to move it out into the hallway and finally I have given up and now use doggy poo bags to wrap my dirty diapers in to throw away in out outside can. Much easier. I really wished this would have worked because it was wonderful to just step and throw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wait till your kid starts eating table food...stinky!!","review":"I am not sure how there are reviews on here saying that the odor is contained. This is simply not the case for us. Perhaps when your kid is still on breastmilk or formula. But when he/she really starts eating solids, let me tell you, every time you have to put a dirty diaper in this diaper pail, it will release a very foul odor into your child's room. I am pretty disappointed in this product for that reason alone. Sure, it's easy to use and the refills are simple to insert. But, who cares when your kid's room smells like poop??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonexistent Odor Control","review":"I'll say one good thing about this product: it's easy to use.

I've had enough, and am moving on to another product."},{"rating":"2","title":"how to change the bag","review":"Just as many other parents, I love this product. It is frustrating that general stores don't carry refills like they do for the diaper Genie; however, that doesn't make it inferior!I've read a lot of minor complaints on oder at times of changing the bag. It's not bad if you follow these steps:1)open the front door of the unit.2)grab bag just above diapers and scrunch down the diapers a little to get the excess air out3)while twisting diaper bag, pull diapers out of unit. Newbag will be pulling down into place.4)Using the cutting tool in unit cut enough twisted bag to tie in a knot.5)I think you can figure out what to do from here.good luck and have a great day."},{"rating":"1","title":"dekor diaper-----smelly","review":"this product does not keep the odor of dirty diapers contained!!!when baby was newborn it was ok, as we all know when baby gets bigger so does diaper odor. with my first baby we had diaper genie it did keep in the odor."},{"rating":"1","title":"It STINKS!","review":"After much research, I decided on the Diaper Dekor Plus and wish I hadn't. Everything I read said it wouldn't stink, but it does!! The baby's room smells aweful all the time and even the upstairs of my house smells.

I would suggest everyone to look past this product and choose another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend","review":"I purchased this product because I had heard and read good reviews however, I must say that I now disagree with all good reviews I had read. This product does not do well in the smell department. The second you open up the dekor to put another dirty diaper in the smell could knock you over. It spreads to the room and leaves a horrible odor in the room. I've tried air fresheners to put in the dekor to help with this issue but I have had no luck. I can't decide to either keep spraying febreeze in my son's room each time I enter or buy the diaper genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!!!","review":"Broke just after the 6th month warranty, so can't get it replaced.

I've tried every de-odorizer, baking soda, coffee grounds, airing it out outside for weeks at a time, cleaning it. I now only put wet diapers in it, but it still smells horrible after one day of wet diapers.This is basically a trash can with a lid.

I like the design, but the smell is so bad that the nice design doesn't matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of space","review":"This item is completely unnecessary. I'd heard mom friends mention it and thought it would be a good addition to our nursery. But it's pointless if you live in an apartment since you're probably tossing your trash down a chute every day or so. And turns out that it's equally pointless in a house. No one wants stinky diapers accumulating, but this gizmo is nothing more than a glorified trash can. Save yourself the money and just use a regular garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Diaper System is the Worst","review":"I really did not like the Diaper Dekor Plus. I bought it based on the good reviews I've read. My baby was a breastfed baby who only had 1-2 dirty diapers/day. The container became stinky fast! My husband kept it cleaned out, but it was still smelly. I think this thing was like a breeding ground for germs, not to mention the refills are ridiculously expensive. I now just put my dirty diapers in a plastic grocery bag, tie them up, and put them in the regular garbage. My husband takes it out every other day, and we have no problems. It's so nice going into my daughter's bedroom without the smell of dirty diapers. This unused contraption now just sits in her closet--what a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks!","review":"This diaper pail really stinks. The problem is that, because it holds so much, the diapers sit in it for a long time. Especially as my daughter is in daycare away from home during the day and so it takes us a long time to fill this pail. When you go to put in another diaper, the stink that wafts out of this diaper dekor would knock you out. The worse part is emptying it. Yikes! I manage to pass that onto my husband most of the time. We ended up moving it out of our daughter's room, away from her changing table which was very inconvenient for us. But we couldn't have her sleeping in such a smelly environment. We have just today bought the diaper genie which is highly recommended by our friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"This diaper system works great. I have never smelled any foul odor. It is very easy to use without any twisting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not One Complaint","review":"This diaper pail is great. We've been using it for over 5 months now & couldn't be happier. It's easy to use, easy to refill once you understand how it works (I couldn't believe I really just had to tie a knot at the bottom, I kept expecting individual bags). Most importantly, it keeps odors in check! My son has started solids & his poops now get so stinky that the whole room will smell for a while after a changing but I've left several bad diapers in the pail & haven't had an odor problem yet. And, unlike the diaper genie which some of my friends have, you never have to wonder how this pail works. Just step on the lever. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blows away diaper geanie in cost!","review":"Ok, before we all complain about a 3 pack of refills costing $2.00 more than the diaper geanie refills, take into account that 1 refill for the diaper dekor wraps 220 large diapers to the diaper geanie's 95, and it wraps an amazing 480 newborn diapers to the geanie's measely 140. After calculating the cost of a 3 pack, and the amount of diapers able to be wrapped I have found that the costs differ greately in favor of the diaper dekor. Following is the cost (based on figures I pulled from this webpage) to wrap 100 diapers with each system.Diaper Geanie- .52 (medium diapers) .03 1/2 (newborn diapers)Diaper Dekor- .25 (medium diapers) .01 1/10 (newborn diapers)Once the math is all done out for you it is easy to see that the \\"more expensive\\" diaper dekor refills actually cost less than half than half of the more popular diaper geanie's. Sorry, baby is napping, and I have WAY too much time on my hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the purpose is to control diaper smell, then it doesn't work at all.","review":"I admit that my review should really be broken into two parts -- before the biodegradable refill bags and after. Before the new biodegradable refill bags we were perfectly happy with the Dekor Plus. It worked well in controlling smells, was easy to operate, and was simple to change bags. The reason we wanted it was, of course, to control the smells of used diapers. However, Diaper Dekor recently introduced a new refill that is biodegradable. It does not work well in controlling diaper smells. Unfortunately, the biodegradable refills are the only option available. As such, I would recommend another diaper system. Also, I would question wether a biodegradable bag filled with non-biodegradable diapers really serves any benefit."},{"rating":"2","title":"This beats the Diaper Genie!","review":"I tried the Diaper Genie because all my friends used it. My husband and I hated it!! Too much to do.. I really liked the look of the Diaper Dekor Plus and it works great. No bad smell, and you just toss the diaper in the bin and that's it! We change the bag about once a week and it holds a ton of diapers. Changing the refil is very simple. I highly recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not keep the stink in!","review":"I bought this product based on the reviews I read about a year ago. My daughter is now 11 months old and the entire room STINKS whenever we have to dispose of a soiled diaper! I have to change the bag every time she has a BM.

I had one with my first two children and it may be more of a hassle to use but I do not recall it omitting as much odor as the Diaper Dekor Plus. Save your money, don't buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine until baby starts solid foods at 4-6 mos; can't keep up with \\"real\\" poop odors","review":"I really liked this product when my baby was an infant. We changed a lot of not-too-stinky diapers, and the foot pedal disposal system was convenient and controlled odors (which are not bad with an infant, anyway). However, once my infant turned into a solids-eating older baby, the poop got a lot stinkier, and the diaper decor simply couldn't keep up. Not only do the diapers smell, but the diaper stink seems to live in the decor, even after thorough cleanings (with bleach). I continue to use this device only because I have a stock of refill bags and don't want to waste the money already spent. Like a fellow reviewer, I'm going to chuck this thing and replace it with a garbage can outside, and/or just do my best to flush the poop into the toilet before putting diapers into the decor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first, but can't handle solid food smells at all.","review":"I loved my Diaper Dekor for the first six months while my son was exclusively breastfed. But once we started solids, it didn't seem to work at all. Now I have to either put dirty daipers in a plastic bag before putting them in the pail, or throw them away somewhere else. I still like the ease of the system, but a trashcan with a lid would be just as easy and work just as well.Also, my 13 month old son can take things out and throw things into the Diaper Dekor by himself. That's great for him to feel like he is helping after his diaper is changed, but it means I can't leave the thing out, which makes it pretty inconvienient to use. Other models I've seen don't have that problem, so in the end, I wish I'd gone with something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds a week's worth of size 3 diapers and never smells!","review":"This is an excellent diaper pail! It looks and works like a regular trash can - just step on the foot pedal and drop the diaper in. No twisting or other fancy maneuvers necessary. The refills are very simple to replace and when it's time to empty the pail, all you do is cut the bag, tie a knot and you're done! Although it is small, it holds a ton of diapers -- so far we only have to empty it about once a week. The refills are a little pricey, but a 3-pack lasts several months. You definitely want this one on your registry!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dekor stinks","review":"Although simple to use, the Diaper Dekor doesn't prevent the smell from escaping especially during the summer months. And then one of the (smell preventing) flaps broke after 13 months. Also, the refills are not that easy to install and are almost as expensive as the Dekor. We just bought the Diaper Champ which uses medium trash bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"no smell, easy to use","review":"good product. only issue is that the door tends to come off easily during bag removal...otherwise no smells, convenient bag refill, and nice design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty much perfect","review":"We purchased two of these diaper pails in preparation for our son's arrival. We love that there is a foot pedal for throwing the diaper in so you don't have to open the lid with your hand. Unless the diaper is really light, we can usually just throw the diaper in, and the inner flap will open with the weight of the diaper. The inner flap can be locked if you have nosy toddlers or pets. Our 18-month-old son does lift the lid up sometime and opens the flap, but never tries to put his hands in. The refills are easy to install, and the bags are pretty easy to tie off and change. There is a built-in blade for cutting the bag when taking a full bag of diapers out. We generally don't have any problems with odor, and we take the accumulated diapers out twice a week. Sometimes I'll notice an odor on the day that we will be taking the bag out, but other than that, I think it does a great job of keeping the odor in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well and most economical","review":"Works perfectly well - keeps smells out. Also much cheaper than the Diaper Genie option. Doesn't take up much floor space and very easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, but spendy","review":"The only problem I have with this pail is after owning it for 2 1/2 years the inner flap insert broke 3 or four times. (I lost count) Regal Lager replaced it free of charge for the first 6 months, but after that it costed $10 each time. I could have had a brand new pail for what I spent on inserts. Other than that It was convenient and my husband and I both liked it. We are having another baby and are debating on getting a new one. (insert and step are broken on old one.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great but trap doors are an issue to be aware of","review":"It does a great job of containing the odor and is easy to operate it. Our son is now two and it is still doing a great job. Some people have mentioned about having problems with the trap doors, and we did as well at around the one year mark. We called customer service and they sent us a new trap door. The lid is getting a little weak now at the two year mark, but we will happily buy a new one for the next bundle of joy, because it has worked so well and we think two years is a reasonable life for a product that sees so much use. It's easy to change the bags, and they are afforably priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the Diaper Genie!","review":"With my first child, we used a Diaper Genie. While it worked well enough, changing the bags was not the easiest thing in the world. When my second child came along, we opted to try the Diaper Dekor Plus, and we were impressed. This disposal system works very well to control odors, is very easy to use, very easy to empty, and changing the bags is not difficult at all.I would recommend this product to any new parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trap Door Breaks and Does Not Contain the Smell","review":"For our first two kids we went with the Diaper Genie. Moved to the Dekor with kid three ... the baby's room smells, it does not contain the odor. The lid system is clumsy and the trap door hardly remains closed. With kid four we are now switching to the Diaper Genie 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smell comes out","review":"The smell is not as well contained as they promise, and the refills bags are really too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"easy to use but smells leak","review":"it leaks smells. The baby's room always has a smell. Triple seal? Maybe 3 seals in 3 different places, not 3 layers of protection. I sniffed around--the smell goes right through the bag and leaks out the front door (for changing bags). This door has NO SEAL just the door butting against the case, with a visible gap.Refills are also expensive.Our baby is just on milk. Don't know if anything else is better, but I would look."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best you have to purchase it!!","review":"This is the best pail out there, do not waste your money on the Diaper Genie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"I bought this hoping it would be easier to use than another diaper pail system I had, which it was, but it does not hold the smell in it, and it makes the nursery wing of my house smell like dirty diapers, and I empty it every day. I have two babies, and it is easy to open and throw the diapers into, but this is also a problem because my 14 month old likes to throw toys into it because it is easily accessible. The refill cartridge keeps falling down into the pail making the diapers just sit on top of it not holding the diapers. I also just spent a fortune on medical bills after tripping over the large foot pedal that sticks out, and I broke a bone in my foot. I am tired of the smell, and after just a few months of owning the system, I just threw it out for the garbage man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be wise","review":"A diaper without a bag or wrap takes about 75 years to biodegrade. With a bag or wrap you are looking at closer to 250. Smells don't seem so important. Just take your diaper straight outside & avoid the cost"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of hygiene","review":"What is the deal with people waiting weeks and more than a month(!) to clean out their dirty diapers?! That is so awful. Sure the diapers aren't smelling bad (as some claim) but to essentially STORE human waste in your home for weeks on end is unsanitary and bizarre. It's simple to change the bag out, so why not do it more frequently?I suppose some of these folks should just get a big 50-gallon drum and wait to take out the dirty diapers once the kid is old enough to help you lug the thing to the curb.Disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleek and SMELLY","review":"We were given this as a gift. We didn't really want one having tried both the Diaper Genie and the Diaper Champ with our last child. This thing looks ok and should for the price, but like both of the other diaper pail systems it still SMELLS! It is also small and has to be changed almost daily even with newborn diapers and the refills are not cheap. Expect to go through a refill roll every other week. In my opinion putting the diapers in the garbage and taking that out frequently is far more effective then this expensive piece of plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Choice","review":"I was really sad when I realized the diaper champ of four years ago was no more, or at least according to the awful reviews. I went with the dekor system, even though what I dislike is the specialty bag refills. It's a solid diaper disposal system-- keeps the odors in check and that's priority #1. I just wish it held a little more. The trap door swings down to seal out the odor, and it starts to hit the dirty diapers fairly quickly. I've began to make tightly sealed \\"diaper torpedos\\" for fear of getting debris on the trap door. Other than that, I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive but stinky","review":"The Dekor is easy to use and attractive, but the design does not keep the stink at bay. Every time I toss a new diaper in, the stink of all the old diaps wafts up BIG TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't control odor, hinges rust","review":"Loved this for first 6 months. Held more than Diaper Genie (I have both). However at about 8 months I noticed that it started to really stink. We clorox it, spray it, clean in constantly - but still reeks. I took apart this week and noticed that the metal springs that hold the door flap \\"closed\\" were totally rusted out. Thus keeping the flap open all the time. So that's part of the smell - but the whole inside of it just stinks. Diaper Genie better - had same amount of time and no change in smell, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of TONS of money!","review":"I registered for this item based on the reviews from this sight. I am very disappointed. This Diaper Pail STINKS! Literally! Forget poopie diapers, those have to go directly outside to the garbage. Only 2 or 3 slightly soiled can go in before you have to change the bag because your entire house smells. Now, after spending over $100 on refill bags, I wish I would have got the Diaper Champ everyone raves about. In fact, I think I'll go order it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me!","review":"Sorry to the Diaper Dekkor lovers out there...but this system DOES NOT do it for me! Stinky, doesn't hold many diapers, and a pain in the behind to change the bags. I STILL prefer my Diaper Genie to this thing. I read the reviews before I bought it, and I'm sorry to say they are misleading. My recommendation is DO NOT BUY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE PRODUCT","review":"I bought this product because of the reviews I read about it. However it DOES NOT keep out the smell of dirty diapers. I have used it for 7 months now and had to go buy a different one. If you are like me, you want the products you buy to do the intended job. This is not what you want. Get the Diaper Champ or use a regular trash can and put it out of the way (extra bathroom, laundry room, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wet diapers only!","review":"This can fit a lot of diapers in it and the bags last a long time. It is horrible with stinky diapers. You can always smell them even when it is shut. My child is now one and we use it as a trash can that he constantly gets into. Thank goodness we don't use it for diapers anymore. The Neat disposal system is far superior! Do not buy the diaper dekor. It is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly!!!!!!!!!","review":"Since baby number two is on the way, I thought we should have a diaper pail for downstairs as well as upstairs. I started using it for our 2 year old, because it said it was odorless. At first I put in our powder room. The smell was aweful, but I thought it was because the room was so small. I then put it in the kitchen. It smells worse than the garbage. I wish I kept the box so I could return it. Not worth the money at all!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Customer Support","review":"I purchased the Dekor Plus back in Jan of this year. After 7 months, the right spring of the flap failed. I contacted customer support and we received a replacement top in less than a week. The system works great: easy to load and take out. It doesn't totally cut out all the smell but it does a good job. It can hold a large number of diapers too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!!!!","review":"I've read some of the reviews for this product and decided to try it. I loved it!! Simple to use: only one hand needed; no twisting and it really eliminates odors. The refills are quick and easy to install. And the best part is that I can use it for regular trash such as empty wipe bags, paper, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy yourself another Diaper pail","review":"I received this item at my baby shower (11/03) and we still have it. The doors keep falling off, it fills up fast. My daughter who's into everything have learned how to open the top and remove all the diapers. She know that the door doesn't close and falls apart, so she's always where the plastic bag is. We had to put kidco locks on the top to keep the top from opening and another lock on the door, because when we would open it, it would come out of it's holders. Sure this is a nice pail to keep after the diapers are gone. But, when it has some stinky diapers in it, it stinks and so does her room. I have to put air freshners inside it to help with the odor.Not a great pail, it doesn't cost cheap, but it's made cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was excited about this product for the looks, price and initital reviews. We have a 6 month old, thus using this system for 6 months now. It was great the first 4 months of use. No real smell and easy to dispose of the bag. However, now the interior door is broke and it really stinks. These doors are hinged, but are not manufactured in a way that it can be fixed. I agree that when your baby begins to have really stinky diapers then this system doesn't stand up fully to the challenge. Maybe we need to buy freshners for the inside. All in all I am disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't understand the negative reviews","review":"I really don't understand the negative reviews, saying things like \\"when you open it, it smells bad!\\"Uh...of course it smells bad when you open it. YOU'RE OPENING A CONTAINER OF POOP. IT'S GOING TO SMELL BAD.Where this product does well, though, is the 99.8% of the time when it is not open. It contains the odor well. Only when it gets super-full do you maybe get a whiff that things aren't going well and it's time to change the insert.Unlike the Diaper Genie, this does not use individual plastic bags for each diaper, so it is a little more environmentally friendly. Of course, that does mean that for the tenth of a second it's open, it might smell a little bit. But again. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POOP. POOP SMELLS BAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Beats the Diaper Genie!","review":"I tried the Diaper Genie because all of my friends had one and suggested it. My hubsband and I hated it. The twisting and all the to do, it was a pain. I really liked the look of the Diaper Dekor Plus and the price was about the same as the Genie. It really works great and it holds a ton of diapers and there is no bad smell. It works wonders in our daughters room.. We highly recommend this item. The refils are easy to change too. When we no longer need a diaper pail, it converts to a trash bin that we can use in the bathroom.. How convenient!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby gets older, smell gets worse","review":"I really liked this Diaper Dekor when my baby was younger and her poops did not really smell that bad. But trust me, when they get older (she is now 17 months) and start eating food that makes you know from a room away that they need their diaper changed, you do not want this disposal system. Be prepared to get a different one which is what I have to do. Every time that you open it to throw in a dirty diaper the smell hits you in the face like a ton of bricks.........it does not keep the smell away as it is just like opening a regular bin. So I agree that it is great in the beginning but now I have to go out and buy a different one now that she is older so feel that it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Diaper System EVER","review":"I have a multi-handicapped daughter in diapers, she is 22 years old. I have owned almost ever type of diaper pail, system in the past 22 years. I bought the Diaper Dekor last year and it is FANTASTIC. If you thing an infants diapers smell, a 22 years olds are 1000 times worse. The diaper pail is in a small bath and since I bought this diaper pail the smell is no longer noticable!!! He brother loves the way this one empties you never smell the diapers when removing the bag. Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"This product is too small to handle diapers larger than a size 2. Now that my daughter is in a size 3 diaper, I find I can only fit 6-7 diapers in there before it overflows and I have to empty it. Since I am still changing her 7-8 times a day, I am emptying this once a day. At that rate, I might as well just put a regular trash can in her room. I plan on buying a different diaper pail this weekend. Plus it does not elimnate odor well at all. I have washed it and added baking soda to the bottom but there is still an odor. This one just did not meet my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Diaper Dekor Stinks and I don't like it!!","review":"After reading several online reviews, including the ones here, I opted for the Diaper Dekor. What a mistake. It was able to contain the smell of infant diapers well, however, now that my daughter is 5 months the Dekor does nothing to contain odors. In addition, the flap door on the inside completely broke off. We do not mishandle items and have always been gentle putting diapers in. I do not believe the plastic door should break in 5 months. I know many people love this item. I recently checked the claim of three odor seals and discovered the \\"seals\\" are simply 3 plastic doors that close on one another. There is one rubber seal however the trap doors do not completely seal. Do not waste your time and money as I must now find another diaper pail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"This is a must have for a nursery or anywhere in the house. We had a diaper genie for the first child (5 years) and thought we would try something different. The Dekor+ is great. There is no stink and I have it in my bedroom. It is very easy to use. I wanted something that didn't take any hands and is clean. I would recomend this for any new mom over any other product. The nice thing is that you can use it for other things than just diapers. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"being a somewhat mecahnically challenged, frazzled new mom, the Diaper Dekor has turned out to be one the easiest things to use. I previously had a Diaper Genie that I used for disposing of cat litter and hated it, but the Diaper Dekor is beyond easy to use and the refills last a long time; besides the fact there's 3 in a box. So, if you're like me and need ease of use in your baby equipment, definitely buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"$22 for a box of refill bags?!","review":"Give me a break, $22 for plastic bags? Seems to me this company is taking advantage of the fact that once someone has already purchased their product or received it as a gift they have no choice but to buy the expensive refills. In 18 months I've gone through at least 4 boxes, and let me tell you it is painful to put that $22 box in my shopping cart every time. Unfortunately the design is such that you are not able to use any other kind of plastic bag. I've been relatively happy with the product itself (although it definitely does not mask odor, especially as a child gets older... I think some of the more glowing reviews must be from those with newborns!) but due to the expense I now regret putting this product on my registry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold in odors.","review":"Silly idea. Everytime you put in a dirty diaper, all the odors from the other diapers are allowed to escape. We are getting rid of ours before our next child is due and replacing it with a different brand. Would not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"used to like...now I don't","review":"I really liked this for the first 11 months. Now that my son is older, he loves to play with it. The problem is that he gets his fingers caught in the lid, which seems to really hurt him. He can lift the lid which makes the lid fall down on his hand causing him to cry until I can unlatch his finger. He also can stick his arm inside and touch the contents making his arm smell like dirty diapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cloth diapers!","review":"This pail is not only good for disposable diapers but cloth diapers as well! It's great that it doesn't require any special type of bag. You can put in a regular trash bag if you want or you can buy their refill bags. I use it with a pail liner for my cloth diapers.It does a great job of keeping the smells in. The only time I notice a smell is when I'm opening it up to throw in a diaper or to change the pail liner.I like this product so much that I recommend it to anyone I know who's having a baby whether they are using disposables or cloth diapers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worked for awhile...","review":"Initially I liked this product, but after about 9 months the hinges rusted and eventually broke off. Now there is no inner lid to keep the smell out and it is stinking up the house. I tried contacting the company for a replacement, but was never able to get a response. Finally broke down and bought a Diaper Genie II to replace the Diaper Dekor. I bought the Dekor originally because of its hands-free use, but now the Genie is also hands-free so hopefully it will work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy - not worth the price!","review":"I was glad to see that others had experienced the same thing I did with the trap door. This product worked great for the first 9 months. But recently one of the trap doors broke and it doesn't spring back up, which means it can get really stinky in the room, really fast! I'm disappointed and now I see this looks like it might be a design flaw since others have had the same problem. I will be purchasing a different model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks. Literally!","review":"I am soo disappointed in this product! Especially for the cost of the unit and the refills. I've had the Diaper Dekor Plus for 3 months now and I hate it!

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly","review":"I am the type of person who really does her research and after researching diaper disposal systems, this is the one that won out! It is stylish and nice looking and all that, and we never smelled anything out of it until now.....we have used it since he came home from the hospital and I was really impressed with the way we never smelled anything, except when we were disposing of a diaper. It is the strangest thing that now that he is 8 months old, it is the stinkiest thing, I feel bad for him leaving it in the room with him while he sleeps. I spray it down with disinfectant spray and wipe it with disinfectant wipes all the time and it still smells.It is very expensive as are the refills, I shall continue researching disposal systems for our next baby.I just hope this helps someone else who is doing research. I don't think there is a diaper disposal system that doesn't smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby's Room Reeks","review":"Having read many favorable reviews, we purchased the Diaper Dekor Plus. Maybe we got a dud, but from day one, it did not trap any odors. Its foot operation was very convenient, but the smell was appalling. Whether open or closed, our Diaper Dekor Plus made the entire nursery reek. We followed all of the instructions, yet, I cannot overemphasize how awful it was at containing smells. Maybe ours was a dud, but I urge you not to spend your hard-earned money on this diaper pail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contains Odor","review":"This keeps the odor at bay nicely, but unfortunately, when you add another dirty diaper you end up smelling all the old ones. However, besides the smell that hangs around the nursery for a little while after changing, the Diaper Dekor has kept the poopy smell at bay throughout the summer, with minimal air conditioning in our home. It's nice that the bag can be changed at any time since there isn't a pre-set size; so if you get a stinky bunch of diapers and the pail isn't full, you can still empty without wasting extra plastic. This is very user friendly: refills are easy to insert, bags are easy to remove when full, and you can even use it as a regular trash can when that glorious day arrives when your little one is potty trained. When taking out a full bag just remember to leave enough plastic to tie it off with!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky-Cheese!","review":"When I first purchased this item I thought it was an A+. There were no unpleasant odors, the specials bags were a bit expensive but who cares if it doesnt smell, right? Then my son started eating more solids and he is now 14 months old and the odors that eminate and fill his room are hazardous. The flap on the top broke off and so now there is no way to try and hide the smells. It seems a very cheap product, my friend has had the same door break on the top as well. I am going to try the Diaper Champ and see how that goes. I would not recommend this product unless you plan on potty training your baby when they start to eat solid foods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified Trash Can","review":"I worked as a Nanny for 11 years before having my own baby. I have seen many diaper pails, and found the Diaper Genie to be the best at controlling odors --but was not fond of the cost of the unit and the constant refills. It is also not the easiest product to use. So I decided to get the Diaper Dekor Plus. It had great reviews and, although the refills are expensive, they were said to go a long way in comparison.The DDP worked well for a while. ...That is until my little pooper started eating solids! When his diapers became more stinky, so did the diaper pail! I had to empty it every day, even if it only had two or three diapers in it! It is just plastic --there is nothing sealing in the odors other than the thin, scented liners it uses.

It is worth the extra hassle and initial expe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't contain the smell!","review":"This was great in the beginning, but once my daughter hit about 6 months of age (eating baby food and cereal), the diaper smell could not be contained anymore.

So, I don't even use it anymore because it is completley useless. Wish I bought the Diaper Genie! So don't buy this for the long haul it does not work so well. It is nasty!

We have now purchased the new Safety 1st Neat pail...hope it is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Diaper Disposal System!","review":"We have twins, so this pail gets used A LOT. We started out with a Diaper Genie and had three problems with it. First, we had to let go of the baby to use the Genie. Second, the diapers have to be pushed down so far for it to work-not fun with messy diapers! Third, we were running through those refills like crazy!The Diaper Dekor Plus solved all of these issues. It is hands free, the diapers drop right in, and we are still on the bag that came with the pail two months ago!So far it is keeping smells out of the room-but our babies are not on solids yet.The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that one trap door broke. This however was taken care of with a phone call to the manufacturer. They sent out a replacement insert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective after baby is year old!","review":"I thought this was a great product...that was until my son started on solids. Pew! This product does NOTHING to contain the smell! We have tried everything. Lysol, emptying more often, etc. But the liners get VERY expensive...and it doesn't help! I steered away from the Diaper Genie, but everyone I know who has toddlers still swear it contains the stink. I went out and got one this morning. It can't be any worse than the Diaper Dekor!

However, I do find that the fact that Babies R Us will no longer stock the Diaper Dekor system and its refills, REALLY ANNOYING! So I am dropping it to 4 stars because of this.I have said my peace to the manufacturer and hopefully they will get another retailer to stock the refills. I just spent an extra $8 bucks to get them shipped to me----this system beats Diaper Genie and the like products, HANDS DOWN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!!","review":"I recently bought this diaper pail for my 9 month old and it's terrible, it started smelling in a few days! I saw it got good reviews here and decided to buy it because of that. Once I looked at the reviews closer, I noticed that most of the reviewers had very young babies which, of course, don't have diapers as stinky as older ones, which is probably why the reviews are so good. When my son was first born, I went to Wal-Mart and bought a Rubbermaid trash can that has a lid you can press and it opens. I used that with scented bags (I got mine at Big Lots) and didn't have a problem until recently,when it started to give off a little smell. Well, it was much better than this product and I'm going back to my cheap system. I'd say don't waste your money. I know many people who never even bought a diaper pail but just used something similar to my Wal-Mart trash can and said it worked out just fine. Luckily, I bought my Diaper Dekor Plus at Babies R Us and they said I can return it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved It, but Now HATE It","review":"We bought this diaper pail when our son was first born. We loved it! We liked how it looked and how easy it was to use, especially the foot pedal. Didn't like that it cost a bit more and the refills were pretty expensive. But it held in the odors and we loved it! Now that our son is 16 months old, I can't stand this thing! His whole room just stinks! Now matter how I clean it, change it, or add air freshners to it, nothing helps. Everytime we open it to put in another diaper the smell escapes and slaps you in the face. Would not recommend this one to anyone. It worked great till my son started eating everything in sight! I'd recommend the diaper champ now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This diaper pail STINKS!!!!!!","review":"After it was time for the diaper genie to be replaced due to odors, I was looking for something else that might work better. So I bought the Diaper Dekor with hope that it would at least block out some odors. It was horrible. After the first day, my 15 month old daughter's room smelled of dirty diapers- after just one dirty one put into it ever. So now we have it in the garage and it stinks everytime we walk past it. At least the diaper genie didn't smell until you opened it, but this was horrible. I really do not recommend wasting your money on this Diaper Dekor at all- it is useless!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Convenient but stinks","review":"I have to admit that this pail is very convenient, easy to use and empty, but the smell is unbearable. I have 2 air fresheners in my daughters room to help with the stank. Maybe if you empty it every day or every other day it wouldn't be bad, but then why have a diaper pail that holds 40 diapers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturing defect","review":"I registered for this item back and receiveed it when my son was born in January, 2006. About 2 1/2 months later, the spring on one side of the insert broke and when I tossed in a diaper, the trap door didn't spring back closed. I contacted the company, and after about 2 weeks of emails and phone calls, I received an email back advising me that they had a problem with a batch of them and would send me out another insert. Well...after another 3 months or so, I once again find myself with the same problem. I don't even use it that frequently (maybe 3x a day) because my son is in daycare full time. I have once again contacted the company but I am very annoyed that I have had the same problem twice within 6 months. At this point, I will hopefully receive another insert but I would not be too quick to rush out and purchase this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"should've kept my diaper champ","review":"I had the diaper champ for 20 months and then I bought the diaper decor plus. What a huge huge mistake. I gave it 2 stars because it's nicer than the diaper champ and it does look like we can use it after we're done using it for diapers but it's much smaller than I anticipated. I don't know what type of diapers they were counting when they said that this thing can hold as many large diapers as they say it holds. No way. The diaper champ used regular trash bags and therefore it's gotta be much cheaper than this. What a mistake. I got rid of the diaper champ based on the great reviews on this item. Boy am I sorry!UPDATE: 1/06I still miss the old diaper pail, however, I've found a very inexpensive way to use this item. I use regular kitchen sized draw-string garbage bags. At least it saves me the money on buying the refills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Researched this product and it is GREAT!","review":"I read about a thousand reviews on diaper pails before buying this one. It is so nice. It is easy to use, it hasn't ever let out oder into our baby's room and best of all - hands free! You just step on the pedal and throw the dirty diaper through the trap door. It's extremely easy to change too! You pull out the bag with the dirties in it and there's a SAFE slicer on the door that you cut the bag away with. Then tie a knot on the bag that still hanging and start filling it with more dirties! There are not perforations on the bags, so you can cut them to any size...therefore, if your baby did a real stinky, throw it in and tie it off even if there were only one or two diapers in there. Or keep filling it till there up to the trap door! Perfect system. You do have to buy particular refills which are $19.99 for three, unlike Diaper Champ, but this is soooo convenient!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go back to Diaper Genie","review":"I heard great reviews about this product. I loved it at first. It was great that I didn't have to bend down to do any twisting. After about a month of opening and shutting the lid, it started to smell really bad. My son (13 months old) is the typical curious toddler. He constantly opened and shut the lid (there is no lock like the Diaper Genie). I always found toys, pacifiers, etc. in the bag when I had to dump it. So I had to tear the bag open to retrieve these items. The smell is the worst. I can smell it walking down the hall. I went back and purchased the Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not cost effective, not worth it.","review":"As with printers, it's not the equipment that makes up most of the cost, it's the refills. I'd estimate that you spend at least three or four times as much as you would on equivalent capacity regular garbage bags, and I don't find the supposed \\"odor control\\" to be better than regular odor control garbage bags, possibly worse because they're so thin. Just get a good step can and use odor control garbage bags instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORKS FINE WHILE BABY IS STILL LITTLE, BUT THEN STINKS!","review":"The Diaper Dekor Plus system works fine while you baby is still small and really not eating a lot of solid foods yet.My son's room began to permanetly smell like a dirty diaper because of this system.I decided to find a new dipaer disposal system and I decided to go with the Diaper Champ, and all I can says is that I wish I had gone with the Diaper Champ from the beginning. My son's room is finally free of the dirty diaper smell thanks to the Diaper Champ! I DO NOT recommend buying the Diaper Dekor Plus system at all! Save your money and buy the DIAPER CHAMP, it's cheaper AND you don't have to buy special replacement bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"We have had this product for 16 months and have had the door with flaps replaced twice! The same piece has just broken for the 3rd time and the bucket itself really smells. We only put \\"wet\\" diapers in it and change it very often. I've tried bleaching the entire unit...have used baking soda...lavender oil and cannot get rid of the odor. The company is very nice and quick to replace the broken units, but it isn't worth the money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what any mother needs","review":"I purchased the Diaper Dekor Plus back in September based on reviews and good pricing (online at Target for only $29.99), unfortunately this pail did not live up to expectations. Once arrived I used the pail for all sorts of diaper disasters (#1 and #2) and immediately I noticed the horrible smell that wafted from the Diaper Dekor Plus. Resigned, I began using only for #1 diapers, hoping this would cut down on the smell. However, this was not the case. I don't even have to be in the same room as the diaper pail to smell the pungent odor. I've finally given up on the Diaper Dekor system and hope that after a month outside, empty, I might be able to use this thing as a stupidly expensive trash can for office trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smell, Smell, Smell","review":"I received the Diaper Dekor Plus as a shower gift and was so excited, as I had read the great reviews. Withing 2 weeks of using the system it was apparent that it simply cannot contain the odor. I had to resort to baggin the really messy diapers and then using the Dekor Plus and there is still a smell. I'm going to have to search for a new diaper system. And, I'm just so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"We liked it a lot for the first few months","review":"We received the Diaper Dekor over a year ago as a shower gift, yes I registered for it. It looked and sounded great. We loved it at first, it was easy to use and change. Once the heat went on in our son's room we noticed it didn't hold the odor in. Then as our son started to walk a few months ago, we have been missing a few items (ie the remote, cordless phone) I keep finding them in the Diaper Dekor. Also, I have found a few diapers outside the Diaper Dekor that I know were at one point inside it. My next concern is when our son learns how to open the front door and finds the cutter. I plan to go buy a different diaper pail before that happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer holds in the smell","review":"This was a great system when I first got it. Maybe it was because newborn diapers don't smell as bad, but now it doesn't hold in the smell at all. I have a 1050 sq.ft home and the bedroom is at one end of the house and I can smell it all the way at the other end. . My son is 8 months old. I heard that Diaper Dekor changed the bags that they sold and the new ones don't work as well. Not sure what the problem is, but I'm now looking at spending more money on a new diaper containment system. Also, my husband complained that it's too short. He has to lean way down to make sure the diaper goes in the hole while trying to wrangle an 8 month old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Idea: Carboard Box and Large Plastic Bag","review":"One would be better served to use a tall cardboard box and long plastic bag, than to invest in the over-priced DIAPER DEKER XL. The left side of the double-door push-lid does not function; it is continually open, which does not help odor control. What else is this expensive thing supposed to do? Reviews were outstanding, but it came with no instructions. Intuitive? Turn the only dial, and nothing happens. The bag is not twisted at the top of the last deposit, to further trap in the odor. I cannot return because the THREE-DAYlimit is over! I'm not a machine, nor on a time-table. Most returns are do-able within 30 days, which is satisfactory. I am very, very sorry that I went through the expense of getting this to 'help' my husband with PD. Think twice about laying out hard-earned money for the Diaper Deker. If you bought one, KEEP THE BOX!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First time Mom","review":"I just bought this product after using the Diaper Champ for my 17 month old. I noticed that it does not completely eliminate odors, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. However, I'm convinced that while there are babies on solid foods and messy diapers, odors are going to exist. I put a couple of air fresheners in the system and that seems to be helping. I would still recommend this product because it is MUCH more sanitary than the Diaper Champ, since you never have to come in contact with a dirty diaper again once you put it down the chute. Also, from reading some of the Diaper Genie reviews, this one seems much easier to use. You just open the door, cut the refill off, tie and dispose. You automatically have a new bag to start with. VERY EASY. Also, the refills seem to go a long way with this system. I'm glad I chose this system over some others out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tried the rest; this is the best","review":"I bought the Diaper Genie and a cheaper ... brand. The Diaper Genie was complicated and unattractive. The [cheaper] brand broke (the foot pedal) after a few days. I saw the diaper dekor at a ...store and was impressed by its sleek design. It's all white, compact, and blends into any room. I have been very impressed with its performance. It is very easy to use and the bags are scented. There is a foot pedal and the diaper drops through an inside compartment and there is never a bad smell. I HIGHLY recommend this product. It is quite expensive due to the refill bags, but I have found it to be worth the extra expense. Great for apartments and homes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't contain odors and the bags are strongly fragranced","review":"I've been using this diaper pail for a year and a half and the only good thing I can say about it is that I enjoy not having to bend down to dispose of a diaper thanks to the handy foot pedal. However that is the only good thing about this diaper pail. The Diaper Dekor does not contain diaper odors well; even when the pail is empty, the scent of the perfumed-liners permeates the room. In fact the liners for the Diaper Dekor are so heavily perfumed that I moved the pail out of my son's bedroom. The smell of poopy diapers also escapes from the device, even when the lid is closed. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it at first but now it STINKS!","review":"We loved our Dekor for about the first 9-10 months, but now I can't stand it. It was great at first. I loved the ease and convenience of just throwing the dirty diaper in there. It holds a lot of diapers and refills last forever. In the beginning there was no smell. But now that my son is eating all solids and his diapers are stinky, it just doesn't contain the odors anymore. Even after 1/2 a day or so sometimes I'll have to change it. I've found that the whole Dekor actually has an odor to it. I've tried washing it and disinfecting but no luck. Right now, it's in the backyard. I thought maybe some fresh air might help it. We'll see. We may resort to just putting the stinky diapers in a plastic grocery bag and taking it outside (which is a pain since the baby's room is upstairs). I haven't tried any other disposal systems, but my friend has her genie outside too for the same reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than The Diaper Genie","review":"I had a Diaper Genie with my first son and stopped using it within a few months because I just couldnt hack the smell in the nursery (even though it's supposed to contain odor!). The Diaper Dekor does what Diaper Genie is supposed to do and it easier to use to boot! The other nice thing is that you can use those plastic grocery bags in a pinch, if you run out of the liners that go with the Diaper Dekor. The one disadvantage is that you dont know when your liner is going to run out (hence the reason I know you can use plastic grocery bags in it!), so make sure you have refills on hand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly, smelly, smelly","review":"We had this diaper pail for 5 months and threw it out yesterday. We emptied it twice a week and wiped it down each time with a disinfecting cloth. My daughter's room always smelled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to use, but stinky!!","review":"Our first diaper disposal system had a part that broke so I decided to try this one. It is definitely easy to use, but my son's whole room smelled like dirty diapers. The Safety First Neat Diaper Disposal system keeps his room odor free and is much better than this product. If you are looking for odor free, then this is not the product for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"smells after awhile","review":"beware, as your child ages, this system does not hide the odors. We have twins thus, two bins and the rooms that the bins are in STINK! I am replacing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"After reading reviews of the Diaper Genie and the Diaper Champ, I chose this pail. It is incredibly easy to use and I liked it so much that I bought a second one for the downstairs. The diapers were so small that I only had to empty them once a week, so the refills lasted for almost 3 months on each pail. My son is now 5 months old and I have had no problems with smell so far. Definitely a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better alternatives","review":"I found the diaper dekor to be easy to use but it did not contain odor the way it claims. I had to remove the diapers every day and spray the entire thing with lysol just to decrease the odor. The refills do last a long time but to keep the odor down you do have remove the diapers often. I eventually threw it away and got a diaper champ which I love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Diaper Pail Out There!!","review":"This diaper pail does not stink and is so easy to use!! Our church uses the diaper genie, and it stinks like crazy! But this one smells nice all the time. The refills are so easy to put in. They come 3 to a box, and they last a long time. Our son just turned 2 months old yesterday, and we just had to replace the refill for the first time! That means that if we keep this rate up, we won't have to buy another box of refills until he is 8 months old, since the pail comes with the first set already installed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste the extra money on this one!","review":"I purchased the Diaper Dekor Plus before my baby was born. The first night home with my baby, I placed one dirty diaper in it. The next day I would have like to died when I walked into the room. The smell was horrible. I can't believe I paid extra money for this system. I read all the good reviews thinking I would get my money's worth, but was I wrong. Now, I do not put dirty (poopy) diapers in it and there is still a smell. I think I am going to get one of the other diaper systems and give this one to someone without such a sensitive nose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Dekor is Dinamite!","review":"I received this at my shower...I registered for this after doing comparisons with alternative diaper systems. I love this buket...I have not had an odor problem in the nursery with this item either and I find it so very simple to unload a full bucket! Very user friendly system...and it holds many diaper changes...they lose a star, however, for the expensive refills!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Dekor Disposal System is a Joke","review":"After all the on-line reviews I read, I thought for sure this was the diaper disposal system for me.

This system doesn't even deserve one star..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too expensive","review":"We are preparing for our first child, and after so many great reviews we thought we might get this product. But after serious persistence from 1st time grandma,(lol, had to mention that as anyone knows how giddy grandparents can get.)Our local Walmart carries this same brand for 25 dollars, 4 free refills, and no waiting to be delivered. Extra credit for Mommy and Daddy that do their research."},{"rating":"1","title":"this thing stinks -- literally","review":"A friend reccomended this to me for our first baby. She said the pail had hardly any odor. I didn't realize at the time her kid is in childcare every day and leaves it's poopies in another pail. Since my son is home most of the time his poops end up in the pail once or twice a day. I was just changing the bag every time but that is wasteful because you need to pull out extra bag every time to tie the ends. I have now been double bagging the poos and that seems to have solved my problem. Too bad my kids poo doesn't smell like roses like I'd hoped it would!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stttiiiiinnnnnkkkky","review":"I'm so tired of my 19 month old dd's room smelling like poop!

It works"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be.","review":"I thought this thing would be \\"the bomb,\\" and it was -- but in a bad way. The smell of my 16 month old's poopy diapers is not well contained, the foot pedal doesn't open the lid very far when it sits on a carpeted floor, and my daughter loves to open the lid and stuff her toys, shoes and anything else down in there when I'm not looking. I wouldn't care about the expense, if I was happy with it's performance -- but I wouldn't recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great.","review":"Originally my husband and I really enjoyed this product. It seemed to hold in the smell and was very easy to use. Then one of the doors broke (only after having it 9 months) and it just couldn't hold in the smell any more. I tried using a stick on freshener, but it just didn't do it for me.After talking with friends who also have babies they recommended the Diaper Champ. I have recently purchased one and love it! You don't have to buy special bags, just normal garbage will do (one of the other complaints of the Dekor is the bags are so expensive), and now her room smells like a baby, not dirty diapers.Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky Is as Stinky Does","review":"I am so very disappointed with this diaper system. At first (3 weeks) it contained the smells wonderfully... but not anymore! My daughter is currently 5 weeks and I had to put the dekor out of the house - AFTER changing the bags. I hope I don't have to throw it out nad replace it with the diaper genie... we should have done that from the start!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Dekor Plus Diapers = STINKY!","review":"Read the reviews and thought why not. Cost $40.00 and they couldn't even give directions. (Not that it is difficult to figure out- just add diapers and wait for the smell). The plastic insert absorbs odors and retains odors. So even when it is empty, the Dekor still smells. This could be because the odors seep out the big cracks on either side of the door. I tried to empty it every day, still smelled. I even went as far as to put the stinky diapers in smaller scented bags, spray Lysol on the bags, and THEN put the diaper in the Dekor...still smelly. The whole thing is prety flimsy, and my son managed to stand up at it, and pinch his fingers in the top. When I went to kiss his little boo-boo- guess what smelled! Not worth the price, I paid less for the Diaper Genie- and got less of an odor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised by other reviews - had odor problem","review":"I was surprised when I read the other reviews of the Diaper Dekor. I bought this after being unsatisfied with the Diaper Genie and although it is easy to use, it did not contain the odor at all. Even after 1 day of diapers, I found it hard to walk into my 11 month old son's room because the smell was so bad. After returning this, I bought the Safety 1st diaper disposal system which contains the smell completely, but it does require 2 hands to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"dont like stink","review":"My husband and I purchased and returned the diaper genie after we went to visit our friends. Besides having to twist your diapers in. The smell was strong with the lid shut. Then what do you do with it when you are done. We read the reviews and thought that we would try the Diaper dekor plus (because it was bigger). Everyone that we talk to that is having a baby now gets this as one of the MUST HAVES. This diaper dekor system is the greatest. The only thing that I would think to improve is when you do drop in the diaper you can smell just a little bit, why not make the bags scented. Solving that problem we put a stick up inside the pail on the bottom. It helps especially when you child starts on solid foods. The other recommendation is don't wait till it is full- the price of the refills are not that much change it more often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled !!","review":"I bought this because it had less steps than the Diaper Genie and it could be used as a regular trashcan later. It was a huge waste of money. My son is only 5 months old and I am already looking for a new diaper can. With only 1 or 2 \\"dirty\\" diapers the entire nursery smells.I have even dumped baby powder in it to try to keep the odor under control but that didn't work.The door that \\"locks\\" pops open when the bag is half way full. The bags are too thin to really hold anything so I have to put it in another bag just to empty it, for fear the bag will break. The Diaper Genie may be more trouble but it may just be worth it, the Diaper Dekor certainly isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets worse as baby gets older","review":"I wrote a previous review on this about the stench. A lot of people say it's great and has no smells but many of them have young kids. Remember, the older your baby gets, the worse the diaper pail stinks. I did want to ad that this diaper pail is horrible when babies get older. We had to put ours in the hall because one night my son (age 2) got into the pail and pulled everything he could out! It was terrible! There is a foot pedal to open the lid but it can also be very easily lifted open by a toddler. Maybe an OK choice for an infant but watch out when they get older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Diaper Pail","review":"I got this for my baby shower and it's been great. We haven't had to refill it as of yet and it's been 2.5 months. No smell and easy to use. I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"We have enjoyed the use of this product for our son. The foot pedal is the main reason we chose this product. With a squirming child, being able to use one hand for diaper disposal is a plus! We have had no issues with odor. I also love the economical practicality of the refills. The fact that you can choose how much of the bag to tie up makes it user friendly and saves money. In the nursery, it looks like just a waste basket instead of a \\"poop disposal unit\\" as my husband calls it. I can't say enough about how easy it is to change the refills and empty the bags. The double doors are easy to push the diaper through and keeps your hands and the unit clean. Do yourself a favor and give this one a try, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pee-Euwh!!!!","review":"We had to replace our Diaper Genie recently because the top had broken off. We decided to buy a Diaper Dekor. We thought it would be a great product due to the favorable reviews and the idea that you could use it as a trash can later. The cheaper refills was also a key selling point as we have a toddler who goes through a toddler film refill every week and a half.This is one of the worse baby products we have ever used. Even with diligent dumping and cleaning our daughter's room smelled like a toilet! We even stuck a couple of stick ups in the pail. Nothing helped. The people at our local Babies R Us store were generous enough to exchange the Dekor for a new Diaper Genie with the twist away feature (way easier than the old model)and poof no more skink!Maybe this product was meant for infants under 1. I'd given it no stars if it were an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traded in Diaper Genie, and are very pleased!!!","review":"We originally received the Diaper Genie. We didn't like the fact you had to use a hand to get the diaper into it, so we exchanged it for the Diaper Dekor Plus. We absolutely love it. Our son is 8 weeks old and we have NEVER smelled a dirty diaper. Even better, you can deposit a diaper with only a foot on the lever. And, a nice bonus- changing the bag of dirty diapers is VERY quick and VERY neat. It's a brilliant item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous product !!!","review":"I bought the diaper dekor after reading several rave reviews about it at websites including this one. I have been sooo pleased with it! I did not have to put in a refill until my daughter was almost 8 weeks old, and we went through a ton of diapers the first few weeks. My daughter is in a co-sleeper so we have moved her changing station and the diaper dekor into our bedroom for now. I never smell diapers when I walk into my bedroom. I only smell it a little when depositing a diaper or changing out the bags. We also use about one bag a week. I would recommend this product to any new parent. It was well worth every penny!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"The Diaper Dekor is good for 1 child 1 year of age or less. Once the diapers get really smelly, the plastic bag is NOT thick enough to contain the smell. We switched to a Diaper Genie and solved the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold the oder at all","review":"I picked this one out because I felt that it looked the best out of all them, what a mistake that was. It does look pretty but I have to put each poopy diaper in a separate Albertson's bag to keep the oder, hence a big waste.I don't recommend this one at all. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed","review":"Originally, I thought the Diaper Dekor was satisfactory. However, as my (now 18 month old) daughter grew, so did the odor of her diapers. The Diaper Dekor does a terrible job of containing the odor of diapers once a child starts eating solid foods. I have two other friends who purchased this disposal system, and they are of the same opinion.I do not recommend the Diaper Dekor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Mine broke the first week I had it. (One of the inner flap's spring broke.) It does not contain odors very well.However, I do like the foot pedal for opening and it does hold a lot of diapers.

It was horrible, my son's room smelled like a garbage dump! I changed the bag often and even deodorized the pail 2-3 times a week. I am not at all satisfied and will try a different one for my next baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product, easy to use","review":"We have a 10 week old baby and have used the Diaper Dekor Plus from day one. The product is easy to use and does a good job of controlling odor. Our Dekor is located right next to the changing table. It opens easily by stepping on the lifter and is easy to deposit the soiled diapers inside. The bags are slightly scented to control the odor but for when heavier odors arrive, if necessary, we'll install a stick-on deodorizer inside the hinged doors upside down to keep the odor in check. One word of caution-make sure you order/buy the right refills. The refills for the Plus look very similar to the non-Plus version and trying to put the smaller refills on the larger unit is impossible. Some stores don't sell both refills but sell both units. Also, the stores will NOT take back the incorrect refills once opened even though their staff recommended the refills when purchased. The unit performs its job well. A strong recommendation to anyone having a baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks pretty cool","review":"I really liked this product at first, looks cool, easy to use, etc. However, once my baby became a toddler, my opinion quickly changed. He's ALWAYS opening the lid and digging into it to grab used wipies. Yuck! And he easily figured out how to open the front door.

I'm not impressed with the triple sealing lid at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Different Than An Open Trash Can","review":"My husband and I bought the Diaper Dekor Plus for our son after his Diaper Champ was simply not usable after 13 months (it stunk even if it was empty). We have now had the Diaper Dekor for 2 months and I wish we still had the box to return it. It is no different than having an open trash can in your child's room. I bought it after reading the reviews of all the systems and this one sounded like the best. Now I know what the thing holds and not very pleasant smells are involved, but even though we empty it daily and spray it with disinfectant his room smells like a farm. We should of just bought another Diaper Champ. I wish I could give this no stars, it is the worst baby product we have bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY!","review":"I'd give this zero stars if I could. I bought this product, as I had read quite a few reviews about it, claiming how good it was. But after a few months, I saw one of my girlfriends had gotten a Diaper Champ. I noticed that it keeps smell out just as well as the Diaper Dekor, but, it's CHEAPER, and you don't have to buy the stupid, expensive refills for it! It uses any bag, and STILL keeps out the smell. I went through so many packages of refills for the Diaper Dekor, it was such a waste of money. The next day I went out and bought a Diaper Champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"We were very disappointed with this!

I originally had a diaper genie, however my son broke the top off of it and I decided to try the diaper dekor because it seemed a little easier to use. The design is a nice idea, but boy does this thing STINK!!! We change this every couple of days before it's even full and it still stinks. I've tried deodorizers, baking soda, lysol, etc and it still takes your breath away!! We never experienced any odor problems with the diaper genie....I'm kicking myself for wasting the money on this thing. I actually went out and bought another diaper genie because we couldn't take the stench of the diaper dekor anymore. Do yourself a favor and don't waste the money!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it!","review":"We love this diaper dekor. It doesn't smell a bit! However our son is breastfed and the diaper doesn't smell as much. The diaper dekor holds a week (5 days) worth of diapers for our son. It is very easy to change the bag.

We love this diaper dekor and would recommend it to all new parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be great, the new bags are awful...","review":"I've been using the Diaper Dekor Plus for over a year and a half. The old bags used to work perfectly, and the product deserved 5 stars then. But with the new bio-degradable bags the nursery stinks.... I'm on the market for a new product, the Diaper Dekor is going to the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Waste\\" of Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"We bought this diaper pail when our newest baby arrived. We had previously used a Diaper Genie, that we no longer had - it worked fine, but was expensive. We decided to buy the Diaper Dekor because of the Odor Free Guarantee. Don't buy it. The guarantee or the pail!It stinks up the whole house with just one or two diapers in it. We have kept it in the garage, and also outside. Not convenient. Refills are expensive. And worse yet - my one year old can get DIRTY DIAPERS out of it through the top - or get the bag through the door in the front!!! Who designed this thing????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it","review":"We purchased this product for our baby born in March. We love it. It is now the middle of November and we are still in our first box of refills. I was a little concerned at first but we've found that they go on forever. The smell is well contained compared to others I've experienced and it is compact and inconspicuous. My husband even agrees that it's worth the price and the refills. Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not for Toddlers","review":"With the birth of my second child, I wanted another solution besides the Diaper Genie - I hated twisting the bags. This one works great. The only drawback is that my 2 year old can easily open this pail and drop toys (or whatever else) into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better diaper pails!","review":"This was the third diaper pail I have purchased in a little over a year. I have to say, I think that it is my favorite so far. Both of the others I had purchased were not worth the money... they were either not easily cleaned, or did not block enough of the smell! This one is a better combination of both. I like that there is a lever on the bottom you can step on so you dont even have to touch anything if you don't want to. It is also nice because there is really no chance of making a mess, the top opens and goes right into the bag. The refills last FOREVER... and I also feel like these bags take a while to fill up. You can cram a lot in there until it's time to cut off the bag and tie it up. I would definitely recommend this over the rest of the pails!"},{"rating":"2","title":"15+ months and still works great","review":"This diaper pail is great. The refills are continuous rolls that you tie off and remove with an attached safety cutter, and they seem to last forever. They come three to a pack and I think we've only bought two refill packs in 15 months. The pail is really easy to use - just step on the pedal and drop the diaper in. Given how stinky our toddler's diapers have been lately, it's amazing how well it contains the odors. You might smell a little something if it the bag is full, but that's about it. When she was on breastmilk or formula, we never smelled a thing. I'm giving the pail 4 stars instead of 5 because it looks like she might be able to get the pail open (with difficulty). So far, we've been able to distract her before she got it open. But we may have to move it to the closet soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker Dekor","review":"I bought this item after reading sucn good reviews. It worked fine until my now one year old daughter started eating solids. I used to have the pail next to the changing table in her room but couldn't bare the smell anymore so now it's stationed in our second bathroom. Six months ago I would have given this item a better review but if it can't handle extra load of food, it's not worth getting a good review. Now I'm hunting for a new diaper pail. What a waste of money this was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Diaper Genie & Diaper Champ........","review":"The Diaper Dekor is great. I had the Diaper Genie for my first child and hated it. All the twisting made me crazy. It didn't hold nearly as much as the Diaper Dekor. Also, the smell does not escape when you open the lid as did with the Genie.My only complaint with the Diaper Dekor is that the petal does not lift the lid very easily. I am not sure if it is because I have it on carpet, but the lid seems too heavy for the petal to lift. It's not that big of a deal, I just lift the lid up with my hand rather than using the petal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Dekor no match for Diaper Genie","review":"When I found out I was having twins I purchased the Diaper Dekor thinking that it could hold more diapers between changes and that it would save time. (So sorry I gave away my Diaper Genie) Well I was wrong. It does not hold significantly more diapers than the Diaper Genie and more importantly it does nothing to contain the odor from the diapers. We have to put it outside if we want to contain any of the poopie diaper smell. All in all it is a waste on money and the refills are quite expensie. Save your $$ and buy the diaper genie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was nice until....","review":"My son is 13 monthes old and up until this time i would have recommended this product to anyone. I even bought one as a shower gift. Since my son has started solid foods, it has been horrible. I have had to move it out of the babies room and into the hall. I have even started empting it everyday. Now that it is in the hall my living room smells. I keep this thing clean and frequently spray it with lysol. Up until this point I guess because my son was breastfeed and solids weren't his main source of food it wasn't that bad. I have used a diaper genie before and found it a lot of effort but if it means no smell, i will get it. You can't but a price on having a freash smelling house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy To Use But Not On Smell","review":"I bought this product because of the reviews I saw here. While the Diaper Dekor is very easy to use, my experience found that it does not keep the smell contained very well at all! The diaper genie does a much better job with containing the smell and I can get the refill for the genie at most convenient stores near me. I'm very disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic Fumes","review":"We bought this thinking that (mistakenly) it would be useful as a wastebasket later. Not only did a clip break (can't use the footpedal anymore) but today we went and bought a diaper genie. The smells from this are horrible. I spray with lysol, wipe with antibacterial wipes, used baking soda; and switched to charcoal. Nothing seems to keep the odors in. I would advise EVERYONE to search for another product. Not recommended, it's overpriced and doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not better than Diaper Genie","review":"Our Diaper Genie broke and we thought we'd try this after reading the great reviews. Not only was the smell unbearable - I couldn't stand to be in the baby's room in the morning when the door had been shut all night - it's not child proof! Within days our 17 month old was opening the top and sticking his arm down into the dirty diapers before we could stop him. Then he figured out how to open the very easy turn lock for the bottom compartment. If your child a)doesn't poop and b) isn't curious in the least, this is the product for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Money","review":"I have owned two diaper genies... which totally blocked the smell from escaping. I purchased the diaper dekor for my third child due to the great reviews, and the simple use. Yes, it is simple to use, however, it does not block the smell at all. This is the worst diaper pail I have ever used. The smell is horrific, and the refills are ridiculously overpriced.It is now used as a trash barrel in my house with a regular kitchen trash bag. Do not buy this for your diaper pail."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!!","review":"I bought the Diaper Dekor Plus and the Diaper Dekor when my daughter was born. She is now 2 years old and it is still a wonderful product. Since she is still in diapers and my second is due in a few weeks, I will be purchasing another one. There are never any smells coming from it and it is so easy to use. I've never tried another diaper pail, but I have many friends and family who have and they have lots of complaints. I highly recommend this product!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKY and impractical","review":"Get the Diaper Genie Elite II, the one with a foot pedal. This one is gross. After you push down the pedal, there's a piece of white plastic that you have to push down to put the diaper in = unsanitary over time. This system also stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odorous","review":"After a year of use, I finally gave up on the bathroom trash can with a flip open lid that I used plastic shopping bags in because diaper smells had permeated the plastic. I then researched reviews on several diaper pails. It seems that as many people like a brand a whole lot dislike it. I finally went with Dekor due to the easy of use. It indeed it very easy to use and doesn't require two hands, which is why it got two stars instead of one. However, it does not contain smells. Just one or two diapers and a horrible stench escapes the hatch when putting another in. Plus, when I open the bedroom door after my child's nap, the whole room will stink. This is just not acceptable. I shouldn't have to change the bag daily. At least it can be used as a normal trash can, which is what I'll be doing and trying another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks, literally.","review":"This diaper pail does NOT keep odors in. We used it for less than a month than got rid of it. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky, stinky, stinky!!","review":"We have 16 month old twins and for the first few months it worked great! Then about the time they turned 6 months I noticed an awful smell as soon as I entered their nursery. I've tried everything from bleaching it to cleaning it with toilet bowl cleaner- nothing works. It stinks even if it's empty! Every time I drop a diaper in it I get nauseous from the smell. I'm really disappointed in it and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Contain the Stink!","review":"I have 4 kids 5 and under and this is my third diaper disposal system. I switched from the Diaper Genie two because I thought the refills would be a little cheaper and with two in diapers, I'm all about cheap. After 3 months of trying to pretend it was working, I'm going to have to end this relationship. It just stinks, folks. Even with an air freshener in the container, my whole bathroom and room smells like dirty diapers. I am smelling them in my sleep. I cannot figure out how this pail is any different than a regular trashcan with a foot petal. Bottom line is, it's not. The Diaper Genie contained the smell AND I was able to shove in way more diapers. I'm sad I wasted my money on this. And I hate admitting I'm wrong. But this product is goin' in the garage sale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"With my first child we had a Diaper Genie, and that lasted pretty well, but eventually broke after about 18 months of use...then we bought the Diaper Dekor...and wow, it's so much better! I love the fact that we won't have to toss it out once we're done with the diaper stage, and it holds so many more dirty diapers than the DG. Plus, if you can't get to the store to buy the refills, just use a regular garbage bag (with odour shield!) and they work great too! So much cheaper to use than the DG, and much more sanitary...no shoving the diaper in and twisting, just use your foot pedal to lift the lid and then drop the diaper through the top. It's more expensive to buy than the DG, but well worth the extra cost, and in the long run you save money by not having to change the refills so often."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best diaper system out there","review":"I love this product. It looks great in a room. The refills last forever. It keeps smells out. highly recommed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky.","review":"The Diaper Dekor Plus stinks, literally and figuratively. I had a friend who liked it so I bought one w/o reading reviews... bad move. Well, I still haven't read the reviews, but I am writing this one. IT will be short - this diaper stink containment system DOES NOT WORK. After a few days, the babies room smells like a dirty diaper. The refill does not indicate when it is nearing the end, so when it does, you open the Dekor and all the diapers are falling all over, not nicely contained in a bag, like they should be, ready to be tied off. This product looks great in theory, but in my experience, doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk my house smells like dirty diapers","review":"I am so disappointed in this product, I will admit it's easy to use by using the foot pedal to open the top; but my house smells like dirty diapers!! I had the same Diaper Genie for 4 years and with the birth of the most recent babies thought it was time for a fresh diaper pale. I saw the convenient design of the Diaper Dekor and purchased 2, what a mistake. The bags are not scented and it is no way near air tight so it makes the room/house smell like soiled diapers.

Donald himself looks, and acts really cool. When he gets hit watch out, cause he's going to get mad. But, what else is new? My cousin and I found this game to be more fun than we expected it to be. However, I think that if your not a big Donald Duck fan, you might not like the game too much. It's not super hard, but it can be fun.

The later recordings lack force and forward momentum and unfortunately replacing that with weird phrasing, inappropriate dynamic changes, and focusing on creating certain effects. I read a lot of good reviews of this recording, but I am disappointed after listening to it once. I probably won't listen to it again. The Prokofiev concerto is better than the Rachmaninoff.

Either the first season or second season (can't remember which) has a skit with Ruby Romaine being abducted by aliens and one has the Rosenthals buying ostriches, hilarious. Some of her humor is a little racist and risque but if you keep an open mind and don't take any of her characters too seriously, you will laugh your head off.

Lown's writing is straightforward, elegant, and charming. What I especially appreciated is the fact that her heroine isn't a fool. Instead, although she sometimes reaches the wrong conclusions based on the information available to her, she doesn't do the typical romance-heroine thing of acting foolishly on her assumptions. Instead, she thinks things through, deals with her love interest openly and honestly, and generally is a very likable person, and one with whom you feel sympathy throughout the book.If you're looking for an intelligent, wholesome romance novel, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jarvi is the master of the Prokofiev symphonies","review":"Sergey Sergeyevich ProkofievSymphony No. 6 in E flat minor, op. 111Waltz Suite op. 110Neeme JarviScottish National OrchestraEdwin Paling(Chandos - DDD - 1986)Jarvi and the Scottish National Orchestra made a fantastic series of CDs of various Prokofiev symphonies and every one of them is a near definitive recording. This version of the Symphony Number 6 is one of the three best even within that series. The Waltz Suite are from three larger pieces: Track 4 is \\"In the palace\\" from Cinderella, Track 5 is \\"New Year's Eve Ball\\" from War and Peace, and Track 6 \\"happiness\\" is from Cinderella.

There is also one song on this album 'HANGIN' OUT AND HANGIN' IN' that is worth the purchase price on it's own. This is a timeless masterpiece that could be a number one hit TODAY.

Although Paul didn't write \\"Seven Little Girls,\\" Paul's singing was what made it one of my all-time favorites of the 50's. This CD is a great resource of all his songs, and reveals Paul's endless talent as a songwriter and a singer who deserves more recognition in the new millennium.

You could walk into her room and it was awful. (and yes, I would change the dekor often) Which was another issue - having to purchase their refills got to be pretty pricey.

Very easy one-hand use--step on the pedal, drop the diaper through the flap, very easy to tie off a bag when it became full. In the beginning, it handled odors well too; even smelly diapers didn't cause problems. But as soon as I started feeding solid foods, things changed. It proved completely incapable of containing the ghastly stench of those diapers. My daughter's room is at the top of our stairs, and the stench didn't just fill the room, it flowed out her door and down the stairwell, so we were treated to a powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs. I took to leaving her window open and the fan on to air out the room during the day and emptying the pail before bedtime at night in order to prevent it from stinking up the house. That lasted a week -- I just bought a new pail (a Diaper Genie 2) and I hope that works better."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"So far our new Diaper Dekor has done the job.

Yundi Li has incredible technique, but the Liszt is easily one of the worst recordings in the repertoire, and one of the worst of any major work for the piano. Bombastic chords, no sense of structure or emotion, and without the slightest idea of tempo relationships. But all of the \\"lesser\\" pieces are extremely well played! Go figure. No stars for the Lizst, 4-5 for the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not really enough depth.","review":"I'm rather surprised at the profusion of accolades given to this young pianist's rendering of the sonata, which I also happened to hear 'live', in Singapore. For a twenty-something, I would call it an dazzling virtuosic achievement. But it does not belong to the same class as the renditions by Zimerman, Pollini or Brendel. Hearing these giants play the work leaves me deeply affected, but not Yundi. I personally believe that young pianists should steer clear of this towering, monumental work until they've gathered enough of life's experiences so necessary to bring meaning into the music. I would like to hear Yundi playing this sonata in 10 or even 20 years' time. To his credit, Yundi avoids the empty displays of Lang Lang. But like one viewer said, he should be careful to avoid mannerisms."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent Liszt recording","review":"Bought this cd based upon a favorable review in the NYT and am quite pleasantly surprised. While the better part of the recording is devoted to the b-minor sonata, Li's playing of the shorter works shows off a surprising maturity and originality for an artist that's not 25. While he possesses an absolutely pyrotechnic talent (the finale in La campenella is exhilarting), he shows true artistry in the love songs and the rigoletto paraphrase. The sonata is well-conceived with some extremely well conceived and varied phrasing. However, the finale is less spiritual and fulfilling than my preferred interpretation, Arrau. Altogether a great album that should be in any Liszt collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive and utterly exhausting.","review":"I don't know if these people giving 5 star reviews are listening to the same recording that I am listening to. I'll preface this review by saying that I own 8 recordings of the Liszt Sonata (Argerich, Gilels, Richter, Zimmerman, Horowitz, Arrau, Pogorelich, and Stephen Hough).I feel that the Liszt sonata should take the listener to the extremes of emotion, from the lightest delicate tenderness to fiery passion. I felt absolutely unmoved by this rendition. Yundi Li lacks the light touch for the delicate pianissimo required of this piece. And when I expect the pianist to attack with thunderous force, not much comes out. Something really is missing!Although it's not as horrid as Richter's live recording, it ranks among the worst. Save yourself some money and buy Martha Argerich's sublime recording. Once you hear Argerich's Liszt, nothing else will sound adequate."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest Liszt recitals","review":"I think, with time, we will be able to recognize this recital as one of the greatest and most eloquently balanced on disc, due to the extraordinary i) musicianship and (ii) pianism of this artist. In contrast to (say) Pollini or Pogorelich, the Sonata is played as a humanistic work of art, with far greater heart than Pollini, and without the self-serving showmanship and 'watch me-ism' of Pogo. I should cite, in addition to the infallible but unshowy technique, the superb naturalness and inevitability of the tempo choices, the strong underlying pulse (never fragmenting into a sequence of mechanical effects), the singing line in the dominant melodic pattern as well as the inner voices, and the splendidly weighted chording which is not only powerful but beautifully even at pianissimo levels. While the Sonata is a masterpiece that can accept a variety of interpretations, this is truly a classic which will be difficult to surpass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening Book Excellent For Today's Kids","review":"At first, I didn't care to read about the the Nuremburg trials.

I don't know why schools have to use such texts when there are so many other wonderful books. The problems at the back of the chapters are many times unrelated to the formulas in the chapters. On many occasions the author skips crucial details, and jumps on to something else. He seems to be in some sort of a big rush to get over it. It gives a student the sense that he is either forced to write the book or is just too bored of teaching signals. I doubt if he even has any patience in real life, let alone writing books. I had to buy another signals book from amazon.com to understand the material. This book alone is a disaster and can never be understood by a beginner in signals, even if he's very good in differential equations and basic EE concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good engineering reference","review":"This is an EE topic so why not relate the problems to EE? I understand that EE relies heavily on math, however this book seems to be designed more for a math class with all the proofs. The material gets very caught up in trying to prove every single equation instead of getting to the point and showing some real world applications or examples. In 5 years after taking the course do you think the majority of EE's remember anything about the proofs? I would say not because in general EE's apply general knowledge of transforms to problems not prove every mathematical nuance of them. I think the author should provide more answers to the chapter problems so students know if what they are doing is correct. What good are problems with no answers?? In the real world there are no solutions manual but at least provide something to reinforce the students work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice Stravinsky ballet piece. Pricy","review":"This disc, featuring a perfomance of 'Le Baiser de la Fee', one of Stravinsky's less famous ballets, confirms in my mind that music for the stage (and chorus) was by far Stravinsky's strong suit, as it join's his three greatest works, the ballets 'The Rites of Spring', 'Petroushka', and 'The Firebird'. It also seems to link him more closely with other modern Russian composers, as I hear in it similarities to Prokofiev, especially his film score for 'Alexander Nevsky'.The one problem with the CD is that it is being offered a a full price for a bare 50 minutes of material. I like Jarvi's rendintion, but you may be able to find a comparable performance on a fuller disc.

I had concluded that the symphony wasn't for me. I also have the Bernstein on DG which is better but nowhere as awesome as this recording by Boulez. One reviewer stated that this recording is great for the sound effects achieved by the conductor. While I agree with that assessment, this recording is so much more. Boulez knows how to handle the enormity and complexity of this symphony like perhaps only a few conductors on the planet. The result is a very focused, tight, amazing sounding recording. And there is NOTHING cold or sterile about this performance. The last movement has all the requisite emotion you could ask for without going overboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mahler 3rd Sound Spectacular","review":"The sound is absolutely gorgeous. Listening on the ole iPod while lying in bed with everything quiet around me and no distractions I've heard remarkable details that may have passed by in other recordings, not necessarily because of Boulez famous transparency but simply the quality of sound bringing out so much. As to Boulez' interpretation I would say it is unbelievably similar to that of Jesus Lobos Corbos and the Cincinnati orchestra. They both seem to be on spot on tempi and dynamics. I find Boulez just as exciting an interpreter as anyone else although he stands back from syrupy portamento in the strings that pulls my heart strings but the strings get pulled anyway. Conducting from the same score one is bound to get similar results. Boulez delivers the sweetness of the skittering strings in the tempo di minuetto with great elan. So much for dryness.

I think its program in Vietnamese is also a great introduction to the language.However, this audiofy chip is very bad. The biggest problem is that you cannot use it on MP3 players or iPod. It is designed so that you cannot transfer the files onto MP3 players, so you have to use it on SDcard-capable pocket PCs or your computers. I should have bought the program in regular CDs because it would have been possible to listen to them on my iPod as well as transfer the program onto SD or CF card.The other problem is that this audiofy program is awkward when I need to rewind or fast-forward the lesson. It is very hard to manipulate.Therefore, I highly recommend you stay away from Aufiofy versions of Pimsleur. Instead, go for regular CDs even though it may take up some space and you may need 30minutes to transfer the program to your mp3 players or SD/CF card."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CLASSICS WILL NEVER DIE","review":"This book was mandatory reading in 7th grade back home along with Jules Verne.

To use and sharpen this knife, one would think the blade was pretty ductile. It did not hold an edge very well, but did sharpen up quickly. I was rather surprised to see this blade break. The force was not great, and it didn't bend much.

This CD is probably my 2nd favorite of theirs (after their latest) and I think I love it more every time I hear it. The sound quality is amazing and flawless, and the music is totally unique and moving. Yes, okay, certain songs could possibly be cut down, like the 15 minute-plus \\"Cop shoot cop\\", but overall, the quality of the songwriting and musicianship is stellar. The versions on here of certain songs far outshine their studio counterparts, and the album is both mellow and rocking at the same time. I'd have to say that this is one of the great live albums I've ever heard. A good introduction to this bizzare yet completely compelling band.

These live versions are so over-produced that they sound anemic, not to mention terribly forced. This album actually suffers much like the previous \\"F***ed Up Inside\\" live album does. It's as if, live, he's trying to flaunt his genius, as if anything he does is brilliant, adding instruments in places that they simply don't fit. Jason's singing sounds totally overblown as well--his emotion sounds phony. There is some great live Spiritualized stuff out there, like on the 2 \\"Electricity\\" singles, but here, the sterile sound & overly mannered perfomances render the album, especially compared to the originals versions, lifeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbiage","review":"Brooks' overall theme of Americans' optimistic spirit and continual striving is great, if not exactly novel. However, I take umbrage with his utter wordiness and agree with other reviewers who say this seemed like one long essay or article. Brooks' uses quotations excessively and his hyperbolic \\"examples\\" are irritating. I am especially disappointed with his use of \\"blonde bimbo\\" in chapter three.

This book contained some interesting ideas, but I would say that you can capture all the good points by skimming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown and Pointless","review":"What exactly is Brooks' point?

Brooks is the affected old uncle from the city who visits his family in the suburb, full of unfunny pronouncements and prejudiced opinions, which he thinks are hilarious or brilliant, about suburban life.Guided by his fanatical neoconservatism, Brooks imposes a goofy theoretically framework on a culture he desperately wants to conform to his beliefs. Brooks, who grew up in Manhattan, has lots of fun with surburban restaurant chains, home improvement stores and malls, ignoring the fact, that these stores respond to economic neccessities, and when given a choice, an American suburbanite enjoys a fancy city restaurant where the tab works out to $100 a person instead of $8 and knows how to appreciate the work of a professional carpenter instead of doing it himself.

Sure enough, I went to Home Depot for the Saturday morning run, the cleaners, Home Depot, and Costco, and checked out the Genesis Grill. No one making burnt offerings there, however.Brooks is a DC guy, which is a peculiar subset of the East Coast guys. I have been to all of the 'burbs he pokes fun at- Highlands Ranch, CO, et al (nope, don't want to live there. Prefer a university town Northwest of Denver).There are small towns all over the west, which are more complete cities than the one in which he lives.His view of the 'burbs is well written and amusing, but relects shallow thought, like a dumb blonde joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Book!","review":"This is just simply a terrific book!

If you want to refer to a particular item, this one will refer to 2 other items that will refer to some more items and so on to the point where if you would like to close the open loop, you would need to consult all the items.Except for this small annoyance, this book is very good.

If you have never been taught to build fiber cables you can learn how from this book. However, you should note that building good fiber cables takes practice no matter how you learned to build them.

I learned quite a bit about CSS from Eric Meyer's books so when I saw he wrote the foreword, it showed promise. That dwindled after the many typo's that were riddled throughout the book. I have a totally marked up copy of this book due to careless editing.Editing this type of book is CRUCIAL since CSS is such a detail oriented process. When you forget to add a number or a semicolon, it simply will not work. This was the case time and time again.Also, the accompanying Web site's downloads varied from what was presented in the book so even if you did as instructed to do, it will not match what was available on the Web site. The Web site files were consistently correct and should have mirrored what was written in the book, but this was NOT the case.Overall, the book presents great information on CSS in a clear fashion, BUT it looses all credibility since the editorial staff failed to do their job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) By Example","review":"Do you want a book which teaches you CSS by examples and also have an author who is willing to help you with questions? Then, BE SURE to purchase this book. I purchased it only a few days after its publication and am very pleased with it. There are example files which you download from the book's website (This eliminates alot of unnecessary typing). A concept is explained and then you are given an example to type in the style sheet and then check in your browser to see what the affect is. This makes it very easy to understand and see the results. In addition, there are 3 appendix which give further valuable information. One in particular lists all the CSS1 properties and descriptions.

This album flows from track to track with more melody and well written songs than most albums have in their pinky finger. I would recommend this for fans of Grade and Glasseater. Screaming vocals often interlayed with clean vocals and songs ranging from punk to what most would define as post-hardcore. This album is dark overall but some songs shine through with poppy harmonies and guitars but revert back to their old rather dark self. If you're a fan of intelligent music, this is a record for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tasteful, warm guitar/organ trio","review":"Vic Juris' tasty, agile, imaginative guitar lines will appeal to fans of Jim Hall and John Abercrombie, and this album finds him in a warm and swinging setting with organist Jesse Chandler and drummer Tim Horner.

At last, an organizing book just for the garage. The paper pointed out an amazing statistic: Only 15 % of homes with two-car or larger garages actually use them for storing the car. That tells quite a bit about how Americans overload their garages.Moving to an area where homes don't have basements, it was essential for us to make the most of our garage space. I appreciate the tips and the array of fancy organizing systems shown in the book. We ended up putting in some shelves hanging from the rafters, plus open steel shelving for more convenient access. Maybe not as picture perfect as some shown, but works for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a catalog...","review":"The book has some pretty pictures but not a ton of substance. A lot of product reviews in here and advertising for various companies and services but not a lot about actual organizational ideas. If you want to treat this as more of a catalog to see what kind of organizational products are out there then great, I recommend. But otherwise I found the plans and ideas not practical for the everyday user, especially one with a budget. Therefore only 2 stars for the title which I found misleading: \\"Innovative Ideas for the Garage\\" .... really should say \\"Innovative Products for the Garage\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"INFOMERCIAL as a a book","review":"This book is just an infomercial without the TV!

It gets off to a great start, but that's as far as it goes. For example, it says that when the garage is a mess, you cannot find things and have to go out and buy replacements - all too true. It also says that you must throw things away - of course.The problem is, when it comes to making the garage nicer, it refers the reader to sources for expensive storage cabinets and floor coverings. I do not want to spend $10,000 re-doing my garage, nor do I want to install thousands of dollars worth of cabinets.The \\"ideas\\" presented in this book consist mainly of lists of expensive suppliers. I would have preferred plans and ideas for do-it-yourself storage and shelving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a catalog?","review":"This so called \\"book\\" on garage organization is little more than a catalog of garage organizing products. The authors \\"commentary\\" reads like ad copy for the manufacturers. Little original thinking. A few anecdotes sprinkled in amongst the \\"advertisments\\".

It was wordy at times, but I could live with that because Wagner can be so witty and has such a facility with word play. What made me dislike this novel is that while the characters lead interesting lives, at least the children do, they are not just unsympathetic, they are boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"I found this book annoyingly, excessively wordy. It read as if the author wrote it while as stoned (or whacked out on Red Bull)as one of his characters and spent way too much time googling references. There were so many television references that will be obsolete in about 2 more years and in 10 will make no sense at all to anyone. I can't believe Ryan Seacrest didn't make a cameo (spoiler alert, the Dog Whisperer has a role). And every urban myth that comes out of incredably minor characters mouths, ahhhhhhhh.

He already at that time was a complete artist. This is violin playing of the highest caliber. In the shorter salon works, Kennedy plays with a sumptuousness of tone and emotional identification that is totally winning. One is reminded here of Fritz Kreisler's playing, which for all I know may have been an influence on Kennedy. In the Sonata, a late work, the thorniness of the writing is overcome with playing that is absolutely magnetic. The performance has power and brains aplenty. It makes me regret deeply that Kennedy has not recorded much chamber music. The sound engineering is glorious, too. This is a wonderful addition to anybody's Elgar collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even close.....","review":"Nigel Kennedy is deemed by many people to be a talented violinist. He is technically brilliant but has not got the important feeling for music to make him a good virtuoso. He certainly misunderstood Elgar. The elgar pieces played on this CD is pieces with a lot of feeling, which Nigel Kennedy completely ignored and turned the whole performance into a violin-bashing exercise. Different violinists have different talents for different composers. Kennedy should leave Elgar, and for that matter Bach alone. He just does not connect with these composers at all. There is more to playing classical music than tecnique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to withstand water damage","review":"For a 110 dollar scale this product is not made to last.

There are scale with the same features for at least half the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tanita scale","review":"Tons of features & works great. I just wish it was as easy to use as the Tanita I bought 12 years ago. You cannot simply activate the scale with your foot.

At only 43'57\\" it can hardy be recommended at full price. Bernstein, Karajan, and Markevitch have all produced highly praised versions - available with generous couplings.I bought this disc for $4, which is well worth it, but at $19, one must wonder what Chandos was thinking. (Of course, 24 years ago, discs did not have to be full to compete.)If you are interested in Jansons' performances of Tchaikovsky's symphonies, I recommend the complete set (Tchaikovsky: Complete Symphonies). Investing in them separately is simply bad economics. I have heard five of the seven symphonies Jansons and his Oslo forces have recorded: all are fabulous, giving persuasion without curious idiosyncracies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb book.","review":"Being an avid baker I have just about all decent dessert cookbooks.I recently took a class given by Ms. Dodge and purchased the book, it's outstanding.

Spend time with your guests, not in the kitchen.Just an all-around terrific book. I strongly recommend it.July 2007 I initially posted over a year ago0: After using this book for quite some time now, I had to come back and tell you... it's the best.

The recipes I've sampled from this book to date have all been superb. My 11-year old daughter made her angel food cake yesterday, and it was a hit. Though she had a bit of supervision from her Mom, most of the recipes in this book are not only straightforward, but supplemented with a good amount of extra guidance, virtually guaranteeing a perfect result. I thought I could do no better than her \\"Prescription Strength Brownies,\\" which are the Platonic ideal of moistness combined with chocolatey richness...then I had her \\"Butterscotch Congos\\" and achieved a state of Zen-like ecstasy..Other faves have been the Classic Crumb Cake, Glazed Cinammon Rolls, and her Mousse Cake.

But adults this is just not a gift you would feel proud giving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyed book.","review":"I read this after reading Weir's Six Wives of Henry the VIII. It added addition information about him and was very interesting. While it got a little too detailed with names at times, overall I thought it was great! I especially like how when she talks about how much something costs that she also noted what that would equate in today's terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Disappointing.","review":"I approached this book with great anticipation as it seemed to have all the necessary prerequisites for a great biography: superbly interesting characters and times, and an intimate, personal feel. It was ultimately frustrating as Weir becomes consumed with petty details, such as exhausting accounts of all of Henry's real estate transactions year by year, and the price paid for each. This is accompanied by mundane and repetitive descriptions of the art, architecture and furnishings of each one. There are only so many times a person can read about cloth of gold and diamond broaches before one just doesn't give a damn anymore.Weir devotes little if any time to the politics and events of the day in favor for minute and tiring descriptions. The book had the feel of a high school term paper in that it was haphazard and barely coherent. I would highly recommend this book to an expert in Tudor era art and architecture, but to the general reader STAY AWAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"Finally, an exploration of Henry VIII and his wives that does not read like a cheap romance novel. Ms. Weir makes history exciting. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Goes On For Days","review":"I am a big Alison Weir fan, but this book is probably the most boring, and confusing I have ever read. In fact, Its hard to even pick it up. She has VERY meticulously researched King Henry's Court, and the Time Period , but it all seems to run in together. I would read this book for the well documented research, but I would check it out at your local Library, or through a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much detail, not enough interest","review":"Most of the author Alison Weir's books set out to tell a story, and are riveting reads which take you easily through history. They are page turners, even though you know what is going to happen in the end. However Henry and his court is page after page and chapter after chapter of detail, with very little narrative thread. Turgid and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Henry VIII: a disgrace for a crown","review":"This book looks like a fairy tale to me. Are we thinking about the same despotic ruler, good for nothing, remarkable only for his irresponsible rupture with the Church to satisfy his lust and his greed on the lands of the Church? He wasn't even a legitimate king, since his father had been an usurper, and all his children, except Mary, the daughter of Catherine of Aragon, bastards.A humanist? For God's sake, he was totally unbalanced, a mediocrity turned into a bloodthirsty savage who claimed the heads of those who served him well and who actually ruled England, like Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas More.

Despite his aversion for court life, Wyatt now made a career of diplomacy ...\\" Sir Wyatt never remarried after Elizabeth Brooke; I don't believe they were allowed to divorce. (She remarried after his death.) After Sir Wyatt realized Anne Boleyn could never be his, he fell in love with Elizabeth Darrell, one of Queen Katherine of Aragon's most faithful ladies. They openly lived together until his death.

She's very thorough and to say she knows her Tudor Dynasty is a gross understatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good historical read.","review":"This is a well researched and highly documented look at the court intrigues surrounding Henry VIII's court and the King himself. It begins with his ascension and moves forward through is reign which changed the course of European history.That having been said, the version I got from my local library was the first edition of the hardback and the editing on it was horrible. There were multiple misspellings. (And I'm not confusing US spelling with English spelling.) I don't know if they were pushing to get this out because of the demand for the Tudor information in 2001-2002 after Gregory's books became bestsellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Henry's court was not for the faint of heart","review":"Weir is one of the better English popular historians working today, and certainly one of the most successful. While this social biography of Henry recycles much of the research from her earlier books, it's a very readable overview of the machinations of the king among the noble families who surrounded him, and of the jockeying of the Boleyns, Seymours, Courtenays, Parrs, Howards, Brandons, Douglases, Poles, and Cromwells among themselves. One's position - literally and physically - within the court indicated one's importance and, as the author shows, Henry deftly orchestrated the relative ranks of his courtiers. Most of all, Weir details the organizational and bureaucratic context within which the king moved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vicky Hunnings has done it again!","review":"Vicky Hunnings has done it again. In book #3, Hunnings weaves another intriguing tale of murder and deception in the SC lowcountry. From the opening line to the last paragraph, readers are held captive by the trail of blood leading from Paris to Belize to the southern coast. Marissa Langford, a main character from Hunnings' first book, reappears on Hilton Head Island, assuring additional conflict for Shark and Dell. The reader will be amazed at the surprising twists and turns as the story unfolds, but nothing can prepare for the startling ending.

There are solid facts about old Volkswagen's safety shortcomings. However, some of these appear to be missing exact facts(which worked in favor of Mr. Nader) The handling characteristics seem a bit exaggerated to me. I love how he goes on and on for pages about a defective gas cap. I think it is worthwhile for an aircooled Volkswagen owner to read this. I would advise, however, to take it with a grain of salt. As I think it is one-sided in many places and maybe some factors are not explained.Plus how can a man hate cars so much yet never have been behind the wheel of one? :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOOD, VERY LITTLE CLOUDING...","review":"I have had fish for around 10+ years.

Ideas are not clearly explained and problems are not worked out in detail with a descriptive process of how to solve the problem.

I usually love all springer books specially for their top quality presentation. This book is an exception. You pay nearly [...] bucks for a book to get a fac-simile of the original with less margin space, larger fonts, and less line-to-line space making it overly populated of characters and ugly to the eye. Not even Dover books are like this, despite their lower prices.I am definitely contacting springer on this and I am seriously thinking of returning the book to amazon and getting a used one with better presentation quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate It When Books Lie About Mathematical Requriements","review":"The book says that its only prerequisites are calculus and probability. This is not true. To be able to understand everything that's going on, you'll need to have a very good grasp of subjects like measure-theoretic probability, Hilbert spaces, and functional analysis. I quit reading the book in the early chapters, when Steele starts talking about things like \\"spans\\" and \\"denseness\\" for function spaces. I don't know where you went to school, but at my school, I didn't learn these subjects in my intro calculus and probability classes. To summarize, don't buy this book if you don't know measure theory.If you want to learn quant finance at an elementary level, Baxter and Rennie is much, much better. Moreover, if you're comfortable with measure theory,and you want to learn the math that's necessary for option pricing, you'd be better off buying Oksendal's excellent book, which is at least as rigorous as Steele's book but much more clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too mathematically involved, low in applicability","review":"Sorry to disagree with my esteemed \\"colleagues\\", but this book is not the best choice if you are (aspiring) financial market professional.

Quite interesting. But make no mistake, this is clearly a PRO-RELIGION book and as such, is not capable of moving you past a certain point spiritually. At the end of the day, if the goal is to know truth, all religions, with their illusions, colorful gods, dogmas, mantras, rituals, and their underlying egoistic concepts need to be set aside.This is a book on religion, NOT a book on spirituality. The two words on NOT interchangeable.

I could even apply it after a run and I'd smell fine until I can get home to shower.

After 9/11 he saw the liberal-bashing bandwagon take off and decided that it was a good way to lift his career out of the quagmire it had become. The problem is that his new target audience is generally undereducated and incapable of understanding his love of obscure references... so his career stays stuck in the same place it was, touring casinos. Within the next few years, expect him to take the next step down in career hell and start performing the county fair circuit."},{"rating":"1","title":"lyndon larouche of comedy","review":"Never liked that Miller guy.

I consider \\"Church Windows\\" and \\"Brazilian Impressions\\" to be pretty weak.

It gives me great pleasure knowing that I am helping out in my own way. My admiration for the Keisers and their animal hero will always be strong, even when I no longer work for them, and Pelican Pete will always have a place of honor on my bookshelves and in my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"The book does offer some good information but that particular information is so basic and just plain common sense it wasn't much help.The biggest problem I have with the book is how \\"dated\\" the information is.

You don't get racism, trashy 'journalism' or ads to become a secret private investigator (well, actually, you do on the last one - some things are universal).Yes, it's in French, and it's somewhat expensive.

It's about two young people falling in love while testing their own and each others' limits, researching and writing \\"The Exonerated,\\" an excellent (and very influential) play about the fascinating, tragic, and ordinary people exonerated and released from death row. Erik and Jessica don't stumble down the rabbit-hole of the American criminal justice system. They climb down it step by step, confessing their fear and confusion, and insecurity that they have no idea what they're doing, and probably have no business doing it anyway. The book takes the reader along for the cross-country trip visiting with and interviewing the people whose stories became The Exonerated. There's lots of captivating background on the subjects of the play, and the authors write passionatley, but also honestly and insightfully, about the politics of the death penalty in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough Woody!","review":"Too much Andy Panda and not enough Woody Woodpecker.

I am writing a game based on Risk (the board game) that runs on all these machines. I decided I liked PVM better than MPI, because PVM doesn't require any special compilers and also it worked easier with SSH. Also it was easier to setup and use than MPI (IMHO).This book is a good tutorial and introduction to PVM but the problem is it talks alot about strange computers and things you will most likely never heard of (HIPPI,bit-vector computers). While it is cool stuff, it's pretty old now. But, PVM is still alot easier (IMHO) to get into than MPI.Or you can just roll your message passing code by hand using TCP/IP too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more for the money","review":"My boyfriend got me this rack for xmas. I have used this rack on 4 long ski trips in New England. Each time we were only carrying 2 pairs of skis and could barely close the rack to lock it, I practically had to hang from it to pull it closed. Also, the rack is extremely noisy at speeds above 45mph when both full and empty. The closure is flimsy plastic and looks rather cheep. All in all I expected a lot more from a product of this price. The only thing I like about this product is how the bolts to remove the rack are covered when installed to help prevent theft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy & Long Lasting Material","review":"This rack is very sturdy and fits my Toyota Tacoma perfectly. I highly suggest you have a manufacturer install it properly (REI did mine for about $200, but it was worth not having the hassle). Also the bars are easily taken off with the hex wrench during non-winter seasons, so UV rays don't deteriorate the rubber. It is noisy in the wind, so that takes some getting used to. This ski rack also comes in a 2-pair model. Extra keys are included. Yakima and Thule have great reputations for racks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I love my job again","review":"I've always known I had a great job as a sales consultant for a publishing company, but the sheer volume of clients, and therefore related \\"to-dos\\", travel assignments and meetings were becoming increasingly overwhelming, making the job seem impossible.

I was skeptical, but read it from cover to cover that night, captivated by the concrete ideas I knew I could apply.

The standards include \\"From This Moment On\\", \\"Heart and Soul\\", and an up-tempo \\"Cry Me a River\\". The CD also features a few songs written by the artist.

And, after all, these arias were recorded as early as 1912 and we're just lucky to have de Muro in whatever condition we find him. For anyone who finds today's tenors acceptable, it's good to have something - even recorded - with which to compare (and that's true for all singers, I hasten to add). While I'm not crazy about de Muro's sound, he IS an Italian tenor and a Verdian. I don't believe I can name one Verdian tenor for today (or any other Verdians, for that matter)."},{"rating":"1","title":"E for effort","review":"I am agreeing to the comment of \\"E for effort\\" on this book.This book describes the author's attemps to improve his condition and how he suceeded.

My main concern is what worked for him probably won't work for someone reading this book.This book does not really provide a clear picture on what to do. He made so many changes on the medications and supplements, it is hard to say what worked.One can find the general imformation presented in this book on \\"Diet\\", \\"Exercise\\" and \\"Stress management\\" (relating to clog arteries & heart diseases) through the internet.

Particularly entertaining are the \\"Fantasy-Waltzes,\\" whose tone and direction are most definitely twentieth century, but whose winks and nods surely go to Lizst, Chopin and Schubert, however disguised. The 12 Preludes are tougher nuts to crack, the language a bit less subtle, the modernism a tad more acute. However, Ogdon has the full measure of each and plays them with authority and panache. (The recording sessions, it should be noted, were attended by Alwyn, himself; obviously, he enjoyed what he heard.) The sound (at Maltings, Snape) is first-rate: full, warm, dynamically-charged. For those of you who enjoy the piano music of such British composers as Frank Bridge, Lennox Berkeley or Arnold Bax, this CD is most definitely worth a listen.[Running time: 58:02]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.....","review":"I expected so much more from Cheryl Dunye...this movie is just what the title of the subject I chose is..\\"blah\\"..The best part of the movie was the END.overall, I am not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I got the game after seeing my friend get the game, I was doing fine but I never realized the full potential breeding possibilites for my monster untill I saw this guide.

This book has taught me to be a little more careful when I speculate about things yet unknown. What the author saw as most probable turned out to be not so.

He also associates ogam with the druids, which is a bit strained since he acknowledges that ogam is a post-christian invention, after the Latins and Christians finished destroying druidism. He also makes the error of fixating on tree ogam, even though he knows that the letter names are unrelated to trees, and dismisses all the other types of ogam (listed in the Auraicept na n-Eces) as encyclopediac lists (page 26), but the tree list is one of these.

Although it needs to be used carefully (it is plastic) the gun can still function properly as long as you don't drop it all the time, etc. This may be a rifle, but it probably isn't as accurate as you would want, you can still hit a pop can from about ten feet away easily. If you are willing to pay at least fifty bucks for a rifle, go ahead. If you want to get a rifle for an amount that doesn't leave you broke, than this is not a bad rifle for 35 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good far range gun","review":"Its a good gun my friend has it and hes ok with it ....remeber its not the gun but the person using it, I would say start out with some friends with just pistols then move up you will learn yourself \\"if the guns are fare\\". anyway be carefull because it is plastic \\"be very carefull loading it\\" [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T BUY THIS GUN","review":"This Gun Sucks.

When i got home and opened the shipping box, i was boiling with anticipation. But it was an M16A3, not a M16A1. It was also missing pieces. My gun looks cool, but the bottom of the box was missing and there was scratches on the back of the gun. The gun was able to hold allot of bbs but the barrel was kinda bent. In a slight breeze, the bbs went way off and missed but it is pretty accurate on a calm day. the gun has a lot of reality to it but it weighs about 1 pound."},{"rating":"1","title":"ChinaTown PLASTIC.

Samsung did!!","review":"The most illogical operation of any universal remote I've seen. I've got a ProntoNG, a Pronto, a Neo, 3 OneForAll, & quite a few others. I bought this for its clean looks but the device is so poorly designed that it's useless to me. For instance, on the Satellite screen, there is no \\"Guide\\" button. Duh! When you program codes for a device, the ratio of actual buttons that work for that device is maybe 3 out of 10. The rest you have to \\"learn\\" from the original remote & this SAM2000 runs out of memory very quickly. I tried to get additional help from Samsung online, but they don't even list it as a product they made or support. I'm sure they're trying to forget they even made this POS.

Please save your time and money and don't buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was advertised as having Macros. NOPE.","review":"This device was advertised as having 12 macros with 10 layers of 10 functions. Regarding V.Bells review, the \\"extensive catalog\\" doesn't refer to the macro functions at all. I believe this was a marketing error and await a response from Samsung. The manual is poorly written as well (poor Japanese translation). I cannot get this unit to \\"learn\\" hardly anything from the other remotes. I too have had many remotes. Some of the more sophisticated were Pronto, Neo, OFA, etc. The sam2000 isn't even near this league of remotes. This remote just wasn't planned out very well. The programmable remote codes don't work for my very mainstream Pioneer dvd player and Sony reciever. Do yourself a favor and buy the cheapest learning remote you can for $12.00 and you've done much better than this remote can do for you. You will be disappointed with this remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutly no support, can not prgm+learn 1 key","review":"Program a device and then try to make a key to learn and it losses the programed code.

After teaching many codes, it worked reasonably well, though at the time of buying I did not expect I would have to push many buttons before I could get to the desired device.Then, it lasted roughly 2 weeks. Afterwards, no matter what I did it locked up with a 0999 message for a few seconds, and did not take any new codes until a removed and reinserted the batteries.SAVE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's cheap because it doesn't work.","review":"Like another reviewer here, I wish 0 stars were an option. This remote can't learn! I followed the instructions precisely and it could not learn a single button. I wasn't able to get the code scanning option to work either (it supposedly scans for built-in remote codes that work with your gear). It's not that the codes didn't work. There was just no way to get to the scanning option. Lame, lame and yes, lame.

Only when this device was discontinued did somebody (obviously a Samsung suckup) update the product description to include things like \\"wont work with every model\\" and crap like that. They deleted the \\"has macros\\" business, but a little too late. Many people, like myself, purchased this remote because it promised macros. I've emailed Samsung over 20 times now without a response. Bitter? You bet. And I AM NOT gonna let this go!! The positive (5-star) feedback also is from Samsung shill. Hell, 2 of the five star ratings were from people who don't even own the thing. I dare anyone to find a manufacturers website for product specs on this remote. It doesn't exist.

The unit simply does not work. It's really that bad.I bought this hoping to use it with my TiVo. Some of the basic functions (Play, Pause, Record) work, but the menu button will not -- and it won't learn new commands. The learn function literally does nothing but flash an \\"ERR\\" message (and chirp an annoying BUZZ).I would doubt very seriously that this unit was tested at all by its manufacturer. I figured the other reviewers were exaggerating (or not technically inclined). They were right; and man, was I wrong.ZERO stars. Do not buy this product.Amazon staff - you should remove the SAM2000 from your inventory and sue its distributor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This remote isn't worth a wooden nickle!!!","review":"I ordered this remote in the hopes that I can remove all other remotes from service since I have a pile of them for many devices. No such luck! The TV was a simple setup. PIP didn't want to configure and the buttons all scrambled as to which one did what, but I could work with that. Cable...that's another story. Almost NONE of the controls worked with it even though I reprogramed the buttons to try to get more functions. Learning remote is not the case for what you would need. It learns terribly! It wouldn't control my surround sound any at all! DVD worked at first for most functions, but then started loosing functions and I kept having to reprogram them into it over and over. I'll not go into the VCR as it was another nightmare. So, basicly what I'm saying is the only way I would give this remote 5 stars is if I was rating it for a patience practicing device. WORTHLESS.

The only improvement, that I wouldhave liked, is to make the background black, so that the high qualityaspects would be emphasized vs. white, which tends to show a plastic,cheapness to it, when it's actually everything but cheap. It appears,however, that the many details (day, month, moon phase, day of the week,etc.)would have been very difficult to be visible to the eye, had thebackground been in black.An import from the USA will definitively have you save over 30% fromthe price paid in Canada."},{"rating":"2","title":"Told A Story from A Different Angle. Not Bad.","review":"This is actually a very good story. The only problem is with too many wisecracking sentences, really too much, Mr. Kerr. Those unnecessary wisecrackings had made the reading a bit tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shot Missed","review":"This book, along with The Grid, is a miss for Phillip Kerr. The Bernie Gunther novels are excellent, gritty, realistic portrayals of a flawed investigator in pre-war, during the war, and post-war Germany. In The Shot he tries to create a plausible scenario for a Cuban/CIA/KGB/whatever assassination of JFK. There is no character in this book to sympathize with, with the possible exception of the college boys whose room is used for the assassination attempt, or the prostitute named Summer. All of the other characters are despicable beings. I finished the book, but had to drag myself through."},{"rating":"1","title":"When did Kerr lose his imagination?","review":"His latest effort is a poor combination of 'American Tabloid' and 'Libra'.

The Kennedy/CIA/FBI conspiracy and Cuba/Castro/CIA themes have been done so may times it was hard to pick up this book, however I was really glad I did.

That said, there is a plot twist which is ludicrous and breaks the entire mood and flow of the piece. Then, in the last few pages, the book regains its composure. The plot twist I refer to, without giving anything away, would be more fitting in one of those horrible B-movies you see.Want true Eastern writing? Go with The Old Capital.

They stood around singing all the time with a harp with their buddy Mizushima wondering where in the world he is almost throught the entire story.

Totally worth your time!","review":"I think this is the best movie I've seen in years. The plot keeps you on your toes till the end of each episode and one can't help but look forward to the next one. Very intruiging and the special effects are a plus! The series is beautifully written, the characters are well-developed and the actors did a terrific job. I especially love the character of Jesse Keys who is played by Desmond Harrington. I've only seen him in this movie but I think he's a pretty talented actor. I hope to see more of him soon because he's hot!I think getting the dvd is going to be worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Overrated","review":"First off I must preface this by saying I only watched the first two Episodes. That being said, they were a huge disappointment. The story was mediocre at best and the acting was also sub par. The special effects and the aliens were lackluster as well. The visual effects team should watch Farscape and Stargate SG-1 and try not to get too embarassed.There must have been at least four times during the first episode where something so ridiculous happened that it completely drew me out of the experience. I like to call these \\"what the hell?!\\" moments. Four in one hour is bad news.After the first episode I didn't really have much interest in the show, but I watched the second episode just be sure. My disappointment was confirmed. :-/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterpiece of lies","review":"At the beginning all seem perfect, so perfect. The cast, the music the story, but later all become the brick of a wall of contradictions.I like the work of Spielberg, but if there is something I hate it's when someone try to make me believe in something with a bunch of bad facts.Taken its a miniseries about to stories: The first one: the tragedy of the people who were abducted, and the hunt of the alines who maken it. The second (and the worst): The kindness of the aliens agains't the evil forces of the agency who are hunting them.But what it's worst of these show: in the end the story tell nothing new about the abductions (except of course the chance of the aliens after all what they did, they could be a good race). There's no new and good theory about these theme, just an story were the good people are almost saints and the bad people seems to be sons of the devil, and in a show who try to be something serious about a theme like this, this is a big and unforgiven sin."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be kidding!","review":"...I watched it twice, hoping the second time around all of it would make more sense, but all the whiskey in the world couldn't make it much more enjoyable. AI was the same way, at first, sure it was enjoyable, but as it all progressed, it seemed like Spielberg was just trying to cram in every old scifi cliche into the ending. You want quality science fiction? Save your money, don't buy this DVD and invest in getting the entire Farscape Series..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Taken","review":"I tried to watch this series, but I found it to be long, slow, heavy-handed and lacking in any climax. The characters were not well developed, and continued to remain two-dimensional throughout. I finally gave up caring about any of the heroes in this story. Although it is a fantasy, it was so heavily played, that it was unrealistic, and my imagination never was peaked by the saga of this incredibly stupid family. I truly did not like this mini series and would never waste my time on it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short & Sweet (unlike this mini-series)","review":"I will never watch another Spielberg movie again. This was the longest, most boring, and most cliched alien abduction feature EVER!

Cheers still deserve to be awarded to this miniseries for attempting to encompass more than staid UFO abduction story drizzled with government conspiracies. Yes, both of these elements are included in the series, but when packaged with multigenerational character arcs, impressive special effects, and slight twists on the expected elements of alien stories, the result is a riveting story.Oh, and stay away from the novelization. It's juvenile and contrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series!!!","review":"This was an excellent tale told by one of my favorite directors. Spielberg knows how to reach into the imagination and deliver exactly what you want to see. The story is narrated by one of the best young actresses today (Dakota Fanning.) Her voice is calm but yet powerful enough to be heard.This miniseries has won many awards and has been nominated for many more. A good addition to any sci-fi collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts strong, ends with a wimper","review":"I watched the entire series on SciFi when it originally came on. It started very strongly with the WWII setting and on into the 50's. From there, however, it went downhill. I liked the early characters, and I liked the idea of tracing the families throughout the years. After the beginning, however, it went downhill. The later characters are not as sympathetic, and the ending is completely anti-climactical. Nothing is explained, and nothing is settled. Some may say that this is to provoke thought...I say it's bad story telling. I believe that the only reason that this series won awards is because of the name behind it. That, or a lack of competition in the mini series category."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had potential...","review":"At the start, this ten-part miniseries showed promise especially with the Spielberg name attached to the title. Unfortunately it wasn't long before promise faded leaving behind about 13 hours (without commercials) of boredom which offered nothing new in terms of storylines or ideas regarding the \`alien abduction' theme.Perhaps \\"Stephen Spielberg Presents Taken\\" wouldn't have been so dull had it been reduced to 7.5 hours (or less) instead of the final 14.75 hour product. It seems as though the miniseries was flushed out to fit the original two-week scheduled run and to make room for all of the commercial advertisement spots.Throughout the two-week run I was optimistic that the story would get better and that the pace would increase. When the credits began rolling at the end of part 10, I realized that I had been mistaken. I also realized that I had wasted 20 hours of my young life on this miniseries. In short, I had been taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn. Is it Over Yet?","review":"Taken (aka T-person-ken) is a fairly lengthy sci-fi miniseries which originally aired on the Sci-Fi channel. Besides being about alien abduction, it carries the imprimatur of Stephen Spielberg! What could be better? Unfortunately, the series suffers from one fatal flaw: NOTHING EVER HAPPENS! Thats right, after dutifully punching in night after night, waiting for the good stuff to kick in, the series finally ends leaving the viewer with nothing but occasional glimpses of interesting alien stuff. On the upside, Matt Frewer is pretty good in this series. (Oh I just remembered, Matt Frewer's good performance was exactly cancelled out by the chick from \\"The Blair Witch Project\\", so never mind.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Booring!","review":"So booring! no alien technology could take away my boreness. They are abusing of the Steven Spielberg name as publicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring peripheral drama overdose","review":"I love sci-fi and badly wanted to enjoy Taken but there is so much boring, unrelated drama that it's unbearable! People are loving it so maybe it was just me, BUT PLEASE TRY TO CATCH SOME ON TV BEFORE BUYING!!In addition, I must say that this mini-series is in many ways, an abomination. Spielberg, or whoever was spoonfeeding him, took legitimate stories from historical sources and twisted them into attributing all ufo's to aliens. \\"Yes, everything is clear to me now- the government really IS trying to protect me from the terrible secret of space\\". Too much propaganda and not enough storytelling/entertainment.

This is the TV version.When you think of the greatest dramatic television shows and movies of all-time, you think of very few. This is one of them, maybe THE best. You just become entranched, mesmerized by the story, characters, and plots as you watch how the family members from four different generations become entwined in one another.It gets better exponentially. If I would recommend one thing for a person to watch, it would be this series.A tip: write down everything the little girl says at the beginning of each series, sometimes at the end. They are such meaningful and true quotes about life and the nature of people. I wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed when it first came on and do on the second viewing.","review":"I'm fond of sci-fi and I enjoyed this multi-generational story when it first came on. Unfortunately SyFy has not re-aired it as they often do so I wanted it for my DVD library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I was hooked - could not stop watching. When this film came out I became a slave to my TV for two weeks! This is by far the best, all inclusive, modern myth movie ever made. Dakota is adorable and the best decision casting directors made.

Four the next fourteen hours, sit back, relax, and let yourself believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"watched it multple times","review":"the only sink hole in the whole thing is when it shows that Lubbock, Texas has mountains in the background!!!

And I really believe it hits the nail right on the head. It's VERY well done, and the acting is nothing short of amazing. Each actor played his or her role to perfection. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it, even people who don't necessarily like sci-fi or don't believe in aliens. I've been waiting a long time for the prices to come down so I could finally own it. LOVE IT!!!UPDATE: I finally had the chance to sit down and watch all the episodes, and I'm disappointed to say that there are several very important scenes that have been cut out. I hate it when they do that to DVDs, because if you haven't seen it before, then there are parts that make no sense. maybe that's why some people have given this bad reviews. I wish I could have afforded the old DVDs when they first came out, because when I got those from the library, those scenes were in there. Bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly good television","review":"I love sci-fi and this is an engrossing story. Actors performances are great and I like the way the mini-series gives us time to watch the characters develop and find out what makes them tick. There are some parts of this story that seem a bit long, but overall I found this to be a very interesting and and well made mini-series. I find story and character development much more important than a bunch of splashy special effects, but this series delivers on both counts. The special effects are believable and the characters draw you into the story. I would recommend this mini-series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was Taken by surprise","review":"Steven Spielberg's was both interesting and worth while. Hearing stories my grandpa told me about being in the army at the time of WW2 during the Roswell crash, i took an intrest in hearing other stories on the alien encounter.

Also, just bought the diamond edition of Cinderella. Another good find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Portrayal of The Pirate King","review":"James Purfoy's ( Ironclad ) portrayal of Edward Teach is exceptional. For those person's interested in Blackbeard - neither Angus MacFadyen ( Blackbeard ) nor Ian McShane ( On Stranger Tides ) were able to convince with such integrity. The documentary is narrated similar to a feature film, and the locations, ships, weapons, costumes are as impressive as anyone should expect from National Geographic. For those interested in Blackbeard, and wish that there were more film depictions of his exploits - then this documentary should thoroughly impress you enough to watch repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackbeard: As Close As We Will Get!","review":"I bought this because I am presently obsessed with pirates. I expected the usual workmanlike documentary on Blackbeard, the most notorious pirate. What a surprise! It's almost a real movie! Most of the film is a drama, very movie-like, surprisingly well cast and wonderfully produced with high quality sets, costumes. It was so much better than I expected. While many docu-dramas splice in some dialogue, this runs for many minutes of dramatic scenes that are as good as or better than many made to the purpose dramatic movies. Blackbeard is very beleivable, has real menacing but human presence and the use of the Mate's character as the narrator works very well indeed. The acting is not the wooden line speaking so often found in these sorts of things but beleivable dialogue. This could have actually been expanded to be a feature length historical drama! Blackbeard's portrayal rang true for me and the treatment of his last wife is decidedly adult-cable TV! I want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackbeard- Terroribly fun!","review":"Blackbeard is a action filled historical picture of pirates on the high seas. It strikes a good balance of fact and action that entertained myself as well as my main audience: My 7th grade students. It is always a bonus when my students are entertained while they learn, and Blackbeard does just that. The movie gives a nice depiction of how difficult sea life was, as well as the irony of how these hated \\"sea monsters\\" were products of the government that despised them. Light, fun, and educational \\"Blackbeard - Terror at Sea\\" is great for the classroom or just watching on a Friday night."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Bad Things Happen to Good People","review":"In Perfect Light, Benjamin Alire Saenz. On the edge of US and Mexico sit El Paso and Juarez. Saenz considers this intersection as well as the intersections between the lives and deaths of people living there. Grace, the social worker with cancer, Mister (I never could figure out why anyone would name their child 'Mister' -- she did not otherwise seem like a weirdo) her son, who wants to adopt a child, Andres Segovia, the orphan in his twenties, and Dave Duncan, the criminal lawyer who wants to fix the world, are some of the characters put to the test. How they survive (or don't) and grow is the theme of this novel, which is well written but certainly not upbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"All things new are not always better.","review":"Interesting to see how exercise has progressed over the years.

In fact, I often hear him reciting phrases from this story at random times throughout the day!

I quick gobble up the book and was fascinated by the author's new approach to reinterpret the vectors with geometrical intuition, particularly the approach of topologically invariants. If one has problem to understand Berbard Schutz's Geometrical Methods of Mathematical Physics Chapter 2 and 4, this book can certainly fill in the gap. I appreciate the author's intention to keep this book affordable. (I paid $16.) It is my belief that a good book got to be a short one like E.B. White's the Elements of Style. No doubt in my mind this book fits into that caliber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try \\"Gravitation\\" by Misner-Thorne-Wheeler instead","review":"Very interesting stuff but there is little consideration, if any, on how to tie this rather unorthodox presentation with almost every and any other book in or out of print. In contrast, \\"Gravitation\\" by Misner-Thorne-Wheeler offers the same geometrical insights in a way that ties nicely with whatever else one is likely to read about tensors and differential forms (two concepts about which Weinreich is mysteriously silent). So if you own Misner-Thorne-Wheeler you do not need Weinreich, and if you don't then you should, in which case you'll avoid Weinreich and learn some relativity theory too. However, after you read Misner-Thorne-Wheeler you may want to check your understanding of some concepts by seeing if you can find their equivalents in Weinreich's idiosyncratic treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality issues, front focusing problem","review":"i got two lens before i gave up on this, both lens front focused. couldn't get it to focus on what i wanted it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the money","review":"Bought this lens last year and love it.

I found, as others have said, that this lens has issues with the autofocus and the shots I took just weren't that sharp, even at f/2.0 and above. I love the Olympus Zuiko 50mm Macro, but the focal length was just too high for what I want to use it for, but boy was it sharp! This lens is also VERY heavy, even heavier than the Zuiko 50mm macro. I would really love to see Olympus come out with a fast prime (think the Canon 50mm f/1.8), macro or not, for the E-Series cameras. I'll stick with my 14-54 f/2.8 for now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I love this lens. The only time it comes off my D80 is when I need a zoom lens.

Produces great bokeh at 1.8"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have never really felt the need to leave a review for an item because I've never been as disappointed as I am now. I decided to go with the Sigma because I had seen some videos comparing to Canon and they sure were wrong. As like most other people, I bought this lens for the wide angle but mostly for the speed and bokeh you get with a 1.8. I cannot expect a sharp picture until I dial up to at least a 2.5 but usually a 2.8. I will occasionally get a \\"usable\\" photo at 1.8 but that's only if I take about ten shots and get lucky. And even then it's incredibly soft. I did some micro-adjusting in my camera which help a little but still having to take multiple images to ensure I get a sharp one. And if I back up to get a wide shot and try to focus in on one subject you can forget it after about 15 feet. It just won't focus. Complete waste of money and terrible lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Becoming My Favorite Lens","review":"I bought this lens for no special reason other than because i wanted a prime lens with a bit of wide angle view. I didn't use it that much for the first year. But when i started shooting Stock Photography...this became my go-to lens! It's fast, tack sharp and give you a great control when shooting different scenes.It doesn't blow your subject out of proportion like a real wide angle lens.

But hang in there, a mystery develops, there is a wonderful inspirational salvation experience, oh and of course a love story begins to unfold later as well. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful series","review":"I read this series of books years ago.

Instead, I found myself immersed in Mitford, its characters, and activities! I could hardly put it down! I love how Ms Karon weaves a magic spell of mystery and intrigue in every day activities...and especially how these are not far fetched and actually are believable! I love Father Tim.

In the tradition of Woody Allen, where neuroses rule but it's okay because they're funny, the author spins a weird love story narrated in the style of stand-up routine. You don't have to wait for laughs; they're in practically every paragraph. The plot is clever, the characters not very nuanced, but who cares? They serve their various purposes as foils or rivals or comrades of the central, engaging character of Emily Jacobsen, a neurotic personality obsessed (what else?) with her psychiatrist. Beneath Emily's neurotic surface is a just-as-neurotic core, but with a warm heart that makes you hope for the best for her. Her adventures in pursuit of normalcy are hilarious, but there's also something touching and universal about her search for answers and need to connect.

The Smokestop filter doesn't stop the smoke. It stops air flow, period. After inserting the filters, it astounded me to see the output of a 600 series purifier (apparently their best one) reduced to a trickle.

Eventually, BlueAir sent me a replacement set of filters because the first set I had were supposedly defective. The odor from the set of replacement filters was even worse. All subsequent attempts to contact BlueAir customer service regarding this issue have gone unanswered.I have no idea if these filters are at all effective in removing odors because they have introduced a much stronger, equally offensive smell into the room where the filter is.

Only on fan speed 4 does it seem to be moving any air, but fan speed 4 is far too loud for me. The top filter that lies flat, doesn't seem to have any air coming out even at the highest fan speed.

It's interesting.The VOD is of good quality but as this VOD stuff goes on I hope the films begin to approach true HD quality they are capable to reach on Amazon. This program was not bad but I saw an early 80's movie that should have been at least native mode look like it was recorded from the original standard DVD and had artifacts all over the screen. This however looks much better than that. I won't comment on the audio since I don't have my receiver and speakers hooked up to the TV at the moment. But my Toshiba 42\\" sounded pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdramatized and not much helpful information","review":"This documentary was something on par with the crappy History Channel \\"documentaries\\" of religious material. It is over-dramatized and contains very little information that is helpful. Producers spent most of their money on the crappy actors and special effects. There was even a portion of the movie talking about the Holocaust because, well, that deals with Jews and so does the Gospel of Judas. REALLY? There was nothing in this documentary that couldn't be learned in a quick read through Wikipedia. It would save an hour and a half."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Nonsense from National Geographic","review":"National Geographic is amazing when it comes to documentaries on the natural world, however they fail miserably when they approach anything having to do with religion.

The author does too much telling and not enough showing."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAIRLY TRUE TO THE NOVEL","review":"A bleak setting with a depressing tale which is exactly how it was supposed to be if you read the novel. Small roles by Charlize Theron and Robert Duvall. As the father struggles to get his son to the southern coast (where it will be safer) they come across a number of conflicts and we see that the father has lost a great deal of his humanity which is balanced (at times) by his son. I was going to give this picture a lower rating until I realized that it's supposed to be a downer. It kept me engaged enough for a couple of hours and I had originally planned to watch this one over three of four days. Fairly true to the novel which I read last year. After seeing this movie you might be grateful for the life that you have even if there are problems in it. WHEN WATCHED: 10/01/2010; MY GRADE: B plus (C plus to B minus if you don't get this is supposed to be a downer tale)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful movie (and bluray)","review":"Movie is about a father and son in what seems a post apocalyptic america.

This movie seemed to be right up my alley. Boy, was I wrong. I learned in elementary school that stories should include: Introduction, Climax, and Resolution. This movie has none of this. All you know is they need to go down the road to the coast, but when they get there they do not even acknowledge what they expected to be there or their next course of action. Soon after, the movie ends. Soon after that, the story is forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Post-Apocalyptic Snoozer","review":"If you are an ardent fan of this genre, maybe you'll like it. There is nothing new or different or creative about this film from countless post-apocolypse movies that have gone before. I must confess I watched only the first half of this movie. I was falling asleep and couldn't take any more. It is drab and dull. The characters spend the daytimes wandering through abandoned buildings in a sort of gray, dismal twilight. They spend their evenings in firelight or near darkness engaged in endless, meaningless conversations. There is no action, no adventure, no story, no message, nothing to make this film intersting or entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably unrealistic","review":"Bogus. The plot in this movie is totally unrealistic, and an unbelievable waste of the creative talents of Viggio Mortenson. In addition, in a post apocalyptic world, the weak would be the first to die, and the kid in that movie is not only weak, but can't even keeps it mouth shut. Even assuming that a kid like the one portrayed in the movie were protected (Impossible in the situation described!)in that type of world, anyone that went around crying, whining, and making noise all of the time like that stupid kid would never survive in a conventional war zone, let alone a post apocalyptic world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Story","review":"The worst part of the story is leaving the bunker with all that food so you can sleep in the friggin rain...yea I would do that in a sec...wow!It not really worth the rent at all maybe $1 just to see if you personally like it but its really a terrible story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy film","review":"The Road is a lousy unengaging film.

It is filmed in such low light it might as well be a radio show. The screen is sometimes completely black for minutes at a time. I can't speak for other viewers but squinting at shadows for two hours gives me a headache. As for the story, I didn't find a lot here. It's relentlessly bleak and simple. Perhaps if I'd been able to see it I would have appreciated it more. As it is, I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugggggggghhh","review":"This film is beyond a doubt the most grim, bleak, and depressing movie I have ever seen. I am an avid fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, but this was far and away the most hopeless and gut-wrenching portrayal of any of them.During a flashback scene, a character commits suicide saying that 'she doesn't want to just survive' By the end of the film, the story has done nothing to make me believe she didn't have the right idea - that's how bleak this is.If you want a movie that makes you grateful for what you have (because things can be much, much worse), this is the movie for you. I'll give it that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-made, but hard to love","review":"This movie is certainly done to perfection, but given the nature of the plot, there's no way to make this movie heart-warming or loved. It's bleak and depressing as hell. Like at the end of the book, however, you're given a glimmer of hope so you don't walk away completely dejected.Viggo Mortensen is fast becoming one of my favorite actors. He doesn't have Johnny Depp looks or an air about him, but he is a superb actor. In this role and every other I've seen him in.The movie is graphic, gray, and at times terrifying...but the acting, sceenplay, and effects were all still phenomenal. I would watch this movie if you want food for thought and deep-set emotional drama, not if you want something happy and fulfilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the better movies I've sen lately","review":"Mad max with a dose of reality minus the nra is the formula for this film. one of the few movies me and the mrs both enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"It is a great concept for a post-apocolyptic themed movie.

Really, really bad! I kept waiting for the story to do something and it never did. No, I didn't read the book and I never will.

While it has a good story and what I mean by that was the BOOK, this film was dreadful. The trailer was promising but the boy simply cannot act, Viggo looks as if he would rather be somewhere, anywhere other than doing this film and it just crawls. The lame cart dragging scene will draw a few laughs. I was almost asleep 20 minutes in! If you want post apocalyptic Book of Eli was much better. Also please note the trailer makes this seem like an action film...There are maybe TWO MINUTES tops of action in this entire film.

The movie is very long and depressing and I never could follow the plot. All I could figure out was a family where the wife died and the father and son tries to stay alive and that's about it. They run into some weird people but that's about it. No gory stuff, walking dead or anything like that. Maybe the book fills in parts that are needed to understand it.If you are looking for a action movie this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road","review":"Cant say anything about the movie really, what I got to see was pretty good. I have satellite internet and I was not impressed in the manner in which amazon downloads the movies, small bits at a time. their signal kept getting lost, even though my satellite was fine, not sure what the problem was, but I really dont care to watch a movie in 15 minute intervals-download the whole freaking movie geeeez-doubt I ever use amazon video again, was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, repetitive, depressing. Who really cares?","review":"Haven't read the book. But the film is so boring. Managed to endure it through the end. I think the whole thing plays on the human rejection, fear and fascination with a post apocalyptic world. Honestly who really cares? Sure some people will resort to anything to survive, e.g. cannabilism. But big deal it's just a reversal to our primal instincts. Man is civilized only when civilization exists. I find this whole exercise of asking what if, pretty pointless. Waste of 2 hours.The only good scene was with Viggo putting his hand up Charlize's skirt while they were watching a concert. Typical Hollywood, had to stick some sort of sex scene even when the world was coming to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Time","review":"Being a fan of post-apocalypic genre, I would have bought the DVD, even if I had known how bad it is. Anyway, that's $16.00 and a hour fifty one minutes, down the drain. Too many screenplay, story line glitches, and nonsensical scene scenarios. The basic story line about the man's relationship with his son was intact. But, the rest of the film was \\"out of sync\\" with reality, given the conditions portrayed in the film. (Now, tell me you didn't think, the black guy would appear at the end.)I'm sure Guy Pierce and Robert Duvall got paid, for their five minutes each in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A How Not To Behave In A Doomsday Scenario.","review":"A worthless wife and mother who gives up on life when the hard times come...and adds the finishing touch of the cowardly--suicide.A weak maudlin husband and father who has nothing to teach to his son.A weak wimpy and worthless son--an albatross around his father's neck.I stopped watching after he tells his son to pray to the people who stored up the food they foundin some underground bunker or basement instead of praying and thanking God.I then I threw the base movie away.I don't recommend this doomsday, give-up, flick to anyone--you might as well watch \\"Leaving Las Vegas.\\" Even that hopeless movie has more hope than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viggo Mortensen Wasted","review":"I think the idea here was to turn Cormac McCarthy's novel into a film which was more similar to ROAD WARRIOR, however with more literary value and somberness. Somber they got down. This is so somber that I had trouble sitting still. I was getting bored. The pacing was off too. I really like Viggo Mortensen and I am thinking of the many splendid movies he has made. My favorite of his was HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. There sure was nothing somber or leadenly paced about that film!So this is a film about a man and his son who keep living and trudging about in a post apocalyptic world even though they don't have a moment's enjoyment in the lives they are living. The father teaches the son how to commit suicide. They come across some suicides in a barn. They also come across a band of marauders.Viggo Mortensen can't save this film and that is saying a lot. This idea was done much better decades ago. In addition to ROAD WARRIOR, I would also recommend Jane Alexander in TESTAMENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever made!","review":"I saw this movie in the theater and I should have walked out 15 minutes in.

As far as a film adaptation of a powerful book, it is equaled only by John Boorman's 1972 classic \\"Deliverance\\". When my wife and I finished watching this wrenching movie we tearfully called up our 26 year old daughter, who lives on her own , and asked her over to our house so that we could put our arms around her, kiss her, and tell her that we love her. Why this film was not nominated for an Academy Award as \\"Best Picture\\" is a total mystery to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clueless","review":"I love a good suspense movie but \\"The Road,\\" had no actual plot, the father goes to what ever extreme to keep his son alive but there is no story line to maintain someones interest in the movie.

Beware of THE ROAD in Blue Ray bd format."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Videos","review":"After receiving two of these Blue-ray discs back to back and both defective, I won't be buying any videos from Amazon again. It's happened to me before and I know it can happen regardless of where you buy them but it's not the worth the headache you have to go through dealing with Amazon. They where cool with the replacing the original and finally giving me a refund after the second one pulled up lame but I'm still out $2 because I had to buy packaging to ship the original back to Amazon. That's a net loss of 20% overall. On top of that, I came across the same disc in a local \\"big box' discount retailer for less. In the long run I guess it doesn't pay to make these low cost purchases from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Faithful a Film Adaptation as You Could Hope For","review":"The Film of \\"The Road\\" shares a lot with the novel \\"The Road\\" by Cormac McCarthy. Both are dark, quiet and brutal. Like science, their simple elegance and unceasing truth are exultant. This film is the best of last year, but snubbed by most major awards, altough an overall winner with critics. Hollywood is afraid of films like this; a film with honesty and no sentimentality. Moments of violence that are not stylized but horrible.It seems that the film industry has finally learned how to film McCarthy: let outsiders do it, and let it be close to the book. The Coens are auters of the highest order and nailed \\"No Country\\". Hillcoat nails \\"The Road\\". Only time will tell if Hollywood (and the film ratings board) allows Todd Field to nail \\"Blood Meridian\\". Somehow I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing annoying and irrational","review":"This movie was slow and at times boring. The little boy whined the whole time.

Viggo is an amazing actor in everything he does, but unfortunately even he couldnt pull this movie out of the muck. The movie left me with many questions. How did they survive? Where are they going? Why would they leave a super stockpile of supplies behind? Why did that kid have to be so repetitive and annoying ;(Papa, papa?, are we still the good guys?). You would think that he would have had a much better vocabulary for a kid of atleast 12, and be much less of a sissy boy. Where are the books? Why arent they evolving? We must have fast-forwarded over an an hour of the movie, and still wanted our time back for the bit we did see."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreary crap","review":"I am a big fan of apocalyptic stories and movies and I must sadly report that this one is not worth the time. There is no clue as to what disaster has befallen the protagonists. There is no semblance of survival beyond walking to the coast in hopes that the ocean is \\"still blue\\" (like on the map) and avoiding cannibals. The only color you will see in this bleak tale is the bloody chopping blocks of what is presumably a cannibal's kitchen. I found myself wishing it would end after about the first five minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie has nothing","review":"I think that there had to have been a meeting in Hollywood where they said \\" You know,with the economy, jobs, natural and man made disasters, people are downtrodden and depressed, but they arent depressed enough, lets make a movie that will almost certainly make them feel worse. \\" This is that film.I watched about the first hour of it, then turned it off. It is the most depressing, bleak, pointless film I have ever seen. The actors are not at fault, its just a harrowing depressing TERRIBLE story. I could watch a film with a story, something you could take away from it. But this was just suffering and anguish. The only reason I even got half way through it was morbid curiosity, but I turned it off when the father finds a basement larder filled with half dead people destined for canabalism. This movie is about as enjoyable as walking on broken glass.

Of all the millions of guns in this country, all the Dad has is a six shot revolver with 2 rounds of ammo... The best mode of transporting their stuff is in a shopping cart... When they finally get a new cart it has two wheels so they drag it around like some third world farmer. This is the best they can find...The kid (some of the WORST acting I've ever seen) grew up in a post apocalyptic world. That is his reality, he knows nothing else. Why the heck does EVERYTHING horrify him... stop your whining!!They are starving. They magically find a fully stocked bomb shelter--let's leave it after just a few days...

Didn't care for the additional scenes for the wife (Charlize Theron); not that they were bad in and of themselves - just felt like they were added out of a sense of \\"we need a female character\\" or \\"we need some degree of love story\\" rather than a story-driven need.One caveat in terms of purchasing the movie - I doubt many people would want to see this multiple times just due to the dark subject matter. No mark against the movie itself - I just don't believe there's a lot more taken from it over repeated viewings and it is fairly depressing.The picture and sound quality were very good to my eyes and ears (much better than in the theatre, actually)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Triple-Prozac rating","review":"This is the most depressing movie I have ever watched. 5 minutes into it I felt like I wanted to kill myself and from there on it only got worse.

He also wrote \\"No Country for Old Men,\\" which was made into a movie starring Tommy Lee Jones about a ruthless sociopath who works for a drug cartel. So I started watching \\"The Road\\" knowing that this movie was likely to be fairly dark, but also worth my time. I was right. Viggo Mortenson did a fantastic job, as did the young boy who played his son, Kodi Smit-McPhee. It was remarkable to me how much the boy looked like his film mother, Charlize Theron who lights up the screen and always picks outstanding movies.In short, a hauntingly beautiful movie that shows grit and dreariness but also love.

Viggo Mortensen is a very good actor, I assumed that he died of some sort of aftermath of an N.B.C. attack.

The film was well made the cast was outstanding. The scenes were unbelievable but that is where it ends. I watched the whole DVD and was left wanting something more. I did not read the book and probably will not and it may have lost something in the book to movie translation. If you like happy endings this is not your movie. That may be why I didn't like it and do no recommend it. I wanted a happier ending. I wanted and end! I know full well that not every story has a happy ending. But even in movies as depressing as \\"Schindler's List\\" you got to see the good as well as the bad. Also it doesn't really end which I hate and you never know what caused all of that.

While the directors remained largely faithful to the events in the novel, interestingly enough, with just a bit more on the cannibalistic \\"bad people,\\" the film comes off as something more in the realm of horror than simple speculative fiction. Stunningly bleak cinematography, with excellent use of flashbacks to better times. Fine, fine acting by Viggo Mortenssen and virtually all of the supporting cast. Best of all is Kodi Smit-McPhee as \\"the Boy.\\"Like the novel, the movie is bleak, sobering, and sadly uplifting. Regardless of what catastrophic event (nuclear exchange? meterorite?) brought about its ravaged world, \\"The Road\\" leaves you thinking, \\"This is what it would really be like.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreary & Depressing... But Well Done","review":"The Road is so dreary and depressing. You will not walk away feeling good, but you will walk away feeling like you've just seen a well done, sad story about a post apocalyptic scenario where a man does everything in his power to keep both himself and his son alive against sickening odds.You may want to watch something funny after watching this... lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad Max meets The Kid....","review":"It was probably wrong of me, but I was giggling a lot during this adventure!That said, I should point out that I also thought this film was no joke.What I actually thought was this: what a waste of time, why don't I justturn it off and water the tomatoes instead, or clean out the litter tray?I'm sure other good folk who saw this oddity can claim to some sort of pointto all this (please don't respond - I'm really not interested) but it reallyescaped my attention.After the 17th father-son kiss and hug I couldn't take anymore save for one final and futileattempt to decipher Mortenson's words. I think they went something like this:\\"mumble, grumble, mumble, mumble, protect you, mumble, love, mumble and mumble.\\"It would have been a brilliant vehicle for Chaplin - as a silent movie of course.One star for the effects and one star for the unintended comedy.Oh, and the kid was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like the book","review":"The movie is faithful to the book, which is a real shame because the book was overlong and tedious. The book should have been a short story and this film need not have been made.For those who think this movie is great because it gives us a more realistic take on the apocalypse than all those silly Hollywood blockbusters, all I have to say is \\"who cares?\\" I mean do we really not know that this is what it would really be like? Yes, it would be hard and depressing. Do we really need a novel or a full-length movie to tell us that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"arrived quickly, but Im not sure it was new. The disc looked fine but the shrink wrap was strangely looser than what you might see if you bought it from a store. Hmmmm. I guess I'll never know. This is a great movie, but depressing as hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"Movie moves from one depressing scene to another. Not much character development. The scenes were choppy like the camera guy was actually there but had to run before he finished filming the scene because he thought they were going to eat him. T he book was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Good Cinematography","review":"I'd heard that this was an awesome movie, so I sat back and gave it time to become awesome. And more time. And more. In fact, I kept hoping right up until the end that it would become awesome. Sadly, it never did.This is a (depressingly) beautiful film, despite its largely grey palette. The actors gave creditable performances, especially Viggo Mortensen, whom I've not been this impressed with in any other film. The pervading sense of horror is well done.But the plot/theme--like the whole trip to the coast itself--goes absolutely nowhere. There isn't even a thematically useful sense of despair upon their arrival at...just more of the same. The uncertain deus-ex-machina ending, while *marginally* believable, also seems only marginally related, thematically, to the rest of the story. I get the sense that maybe somehow it was all *supposed* to click. But it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'll keep it simple: I didn't like it. Due either to the printing or the original photogaphs, the quality of the images was terrible. The content was boring and unprofessional.

The pied pipers sound like the chipmumks. I paid 15.61 for a tape that is awful and I cannot return it because I opened it and played a couple of tracks.

Easy to use. Easy for travel.Inexpensive.Cons: Does Not Get Hot.Got tired of putting cold lather on my face in the morning (especially in the winter). Thought this would solve that problem. Instructions warn of steam escaping from the unit. Instructions say it heats up in minutes. It gets to it's maximum temp in 12 seconds. It heats up to just above room temp. I thought I bought a bad unit, so I had it exchanged. Same result with new unit.If you are looking for a Hot lather shave, then I suggest you pay for a more expensive product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"This Hot Gel Dispenser by Conair at $19.99 may give \\"A Better Shave\\" as advertised, IF one could actually get it on the can! We've had several dispensers before, but this one is impossible. I'm not wasting my money to even send it back, it's going in the trash. Buyer Beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Shave!","review":"I recently started shaving my head. By the time you dry off from the shower and get ready to shave your head and face, your hair and skin has cooled off and gets harder to shave. This product has help a lot with that. It takes less than a minute to heat up. The only thing you'd want to watch out for is there is normally some pressure built up. If you don't hold a hand in front of it a glob of gel will shoot across your bathroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.....","review":"I purchased this heater because I have never been able to get a truly close shave. I usually get skin irritation regardless of the type of shaver I use or the type of gel I use. So during a beer conversation with a few of my friends, the topic of heating the shaving gel in order to get a closer and smoother shave was talked about and this particular product was mentioned and dissected. I was excited to try this product in order to get a close comfortable shave every time any time. But alas, that was not the case. From the get go I realized this product was cheap and did not do the one thing it was created for: get the shaving gel hot. I tried every setting and the gel would not get hot or even warm. This was a waste of time and money. I am better off keeping the saving gel in hot water for a few minutes and warming it that way. I do not think I will buy another gel warmer, and if I do, I will buy in store so that way I can return it when it doesn't work. Try at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Luke Warm Gel Dispenser","review":"I purchased this yesterday. It states \\"Hot Gel\\", states that gel comes out as gel, has warnings about getting it too hot.I found that at the full setting the gel came out as luke warm foam. At low setting (tried this just in case the labels were backwards) the gel came out same temp as the can.A lot of trouble to get nothing but a can with a 120 vac cord attached.I had read a review a few years ago about the shaving cream product and that it was too hot. Well they more than made up for it here.DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS PRODUCT."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"this was awesome while it lasted.unfortunately it broke on me but it was because i was using it full time at the barbershop as a temporary solution to my lather machine breaking on me. i have another stored away at home and i only use it for myself and it is perfect for that but definitely for commercial use.it can make the cream/gel the perfect temp.for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't heat","review":"This should have been a better hot lather machine then the last Conair I had but this one sucks. It does not get hot enough to even warm the gel. Would not recommend this one at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kresics Tight 'n' Easy Workout","review":"WOW...unique and fantastic!!

So many natty pics, tips, anecdotes and stories: not to mention the recipes. It's a great read and makes vegansim hip and trendy. After 17 years of veganism, I am more than ready for a culinary shake up. Most of the recipes I tried were very good: loved the cream recipe especially. Easy to do and needed no speical ingredients. Yes, there were a couple of recipes that didn't quite pan out: don't know if it was me or the recipe but considering how many great dishes I've had from this book, I'm not complaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy and Cruelty-free!","review":"I received this book as a gift when I made the switch from lazy vegetarian to hardcore vegan warrior! This book is overflowing with amazing recipes, and contrary to what other people have felt I really don't think this book pushes the scare tactics. In fact all it has is a short section contaning letters by the authors talking about their love of the earth and its animals. Certaintly there are a lot scarier things to do than say I don't consume animal products because I don't think it's an environmentally or animal-friendly thing to do?! This book is my cooking bible. In fact I have been giving it as gifts to my non-veg friends to introduce them to yummy and healthy alternatives. This book gets a hug thumbs-up!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great...","review":"I've used a lot of the recipes in this book, and I've come to the conclusion that it's not that great. I followed everything to exact specifications, so has my girlfriend, and there's always a problem with it. The breads come out too hard or flaky, the chili is REALLY bland (I ended up adding my own ingredients and cooking it much, much longer than instructed, and it came out great) the \\"easy breezy cheese sauce\\" is nasty, the pancakes aren't that good, the sauces/dressings aren't good. The only thing I actually think came out good is the whip cream.I've gone online and found much better recipes for free. So, there's really no reason to buy this book, unless you need some ideas or reference to create your own meals."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome recipes!","review":"every recipe in this book is awesome. i've made a bunch so far, and so far all winners. also really great forwards by each of the authors at the beginning of this cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"The kindle version is disappointing","review":"I bought the kindle version of this book thinking that it might be handy. It's not. It is impossible to navigate to any recipe without clicking page by page. I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"Honestly, I don't understand all the positive reviews on this book. I've been a vegan for about 4 years, and this book really lacks substance! The only people I would recommend this book for would be teenagers starting out on veganism. If you know your way around the kitchen, and have been vegan for awhile...you will be completely BORED with this book!!!The only positive thing I can say about this book, is that it has a relatively interesting chapter on making your own safe household cleaners, basically by using vinegar and baking soda.I don't even want this one in my cookbook repertoire. I'd like to get rid of it. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good recipes, needs an index","review":"A good selection of recipes that generally work. I rated the book a 2 because it does not have an index (now, I'm sure there was a recipe for Stuffed Red Peppers but where is it?) and because the baking recipes do not indicate size of pan (is a \\"lightly oiled cake pan an 8\\", a 9\\", or a 13 x 9\\" pan?). The appendix has a wonderful chart of ingredients that contain animal products."},{"rating":"1","title":"So HARD to reference!","review":"I love cookbooks. I use them all the time. My major gripe with this book (and its sucessor) is the fact that there is NO index! The recipes aren't even indexed on a main front page! How do you say \\"I want to make that cool blueberry muffin recipe\\" without going through half of the book looking for it?I never use these 2. Ever. They could have excellent recipes, but I can't find them in a reasonable amount of time. I just can't get my thumbs around them when I'm ready to cook. Very bad UI design."},{"rating":"2","title":"The vegan cookbook you'll use most","review":"This is definitely one of the most accessible and basic vegan cookbooks out there. The key to this book is that it's pretty normal food. Casseroles, basic breads, good soups. There are a lot of vegan cook books that are full of recipes with agave nectar and quinoa flour but this is not one of them. With the exception of the authors' use of vegan cheese (I too wish there was less emphasis on soy), there aren't many expensive or hard to find substitutes. You can almost always make at least one dish in here out of the stuff from your pantry. (My favorite \\"out of food\\" fall-back is the Spicy Garlic Noodle Toss.) Worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the 3","review":"I have The Garden of Vegan and La Dolce Vegan in addition to this one and this one is the most used in my house. This book has the best entree section compared to other vegan books because they are all great and easy to make. This also contains my favorite vegan sloppy joe recipe and black bean burgers that actually stay together and don't crumble. Harvest herb bread, rhubarb bread, and cinnamon raisin bread are also favorites. Brownie and cookie recipes *** YEAH!!!!!! I have been a vegetarian my entire life and enjoy using vegan recipes, though I am not a vegan. This is the best vegan cookbook I have used and may even be the best cookbook I have, which includes the vegetarian ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great....","review":"This is one of the first books I bought about Vegan Cooking. I like that the authors are local but I have to admit that the recipes were boring and bland. Sorry! Try the Vegetarian Manifesto by Jay Fothergill!!! It's the best!! Simple and tasty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly disappointed...","review":"not for the strict and true vegan. i was very disappointed. i love trying new recipes, but i gave up honey a long time ago. i find the title to have been extraordinarily misleading. i am not impressed...very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - Why bother?","review":"Nice cover, but what about the food?

It may be a tiny lie to tell them that you're allergic, but allergies make resturants stop and listen.\\"While I clearly support veganism - I find this advice offensive and dangerous.I'd like to return the book.I'm writing the publisher.BTW - I have the 2007 version - 13th printing. There is now an index."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent vegan cookbook!","review":"All the recipes I have tried so far have been really tasty and relatively easy to prepare. The \\"substitutions\\" section is very helpful and the directions are clear and easy to follow. This book is educational in addition to containing many delicious recipes and it makes you feel really good about eating vegan. I would recommend this book for anyone trying the vegan thing for the first time. Don't be turned off by combinations that sound odd, these girls really know how to make a variety of flavorful, healthy vegan food. Make sure you have a blender or food processor before choosing this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiffy.","review":"This is the first vegetarian book I've bought. It's cool and helpful and all that, but the appendix is the scariest thing I've ever read. I'm afraid to move, quite frankly, without fear of killing a cow or two. Fortunately, the writers list alternatives for just about everything, so I think I'll be all right. For conscience-stricken vegetarians terrified of veganism, like me, this book totally works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is a fantastic cookbook. After reading some other review, I realize that it does use honey and therefore cannot be called completely vegan. I forgive them. It is one of the best vegan cookbooks ever printed. The receipes are delicious and I can substitute other ingredients for the honey. Only complaint. NO INDEX! I know there was a receipe for peanut butter cups but where! I have to say thank you for this book and I will definitely be recommending it to friends and family! Thanks again girls! What is there website address anybody?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhh..","review":"While this is a pretty neat cook book.. I was some what disappointed at how unhealthy the recipes were. I was trying to find something moderately healthy one night and ended up putting this book down. While it's fun to make some comfort food every now and then...I feel like one of the main reasons of being vegan (health concerns) is somewhat lost in this book. I would suggest so many other books over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please stop saying vegan diets are problematic!","review":"... My review. This book is quite good. We've made a \\"cheese\\" sauce, lasagne, and a salad dressing from the book and really enjoyed them. They were fairly easy recipes with not too many weird ingredients. They also have a great section to help you make some kid projects and household cleaners. Fun and easy. Worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, excellent vegan recipes and information","review":"The recipes in this book contain relatively few ingredients and are easy to follow. I have enjoyed MANY items from this book and haven't been disappointed yet. I have several other vegan cookbooks, and they are filled with unusual ingredients or recipes that take too long to be practical. This one is definitely user-friendly and well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nutritious, meat-free dining ideal for daily family fare","review":"Vegetarians and culinary experts Tanya Barnard and Sarah Kramer collaboratively compiled an impressive compendium of vegan recipes that would grace any meal and please any palate in How It All Vegan!: Irresistible Recipes For An Animal-free Diet.

It is good for staples and great when you don't make a list and have lots of random veggies hanging around with some tofu and you don't know what to do with it. One of the best things about this book though, is that they list things in the back that perhaps you didn't know involved animals, but does, very helpful for those who go for soy cheese at conventional grocery stores and don't realize sodium caseinate is from cows! I enjoy pictures with my recipe books, and this doesn't have any, which was dissapointing, but I was won over anyway. Every meal I have made has been delicious.

It's more of the 'Llamas inventive blend of breezy pop/open field folk/light electronica. The lyrics are delightfully nonsensical, the harmonies soar gently, the melodies stay in your head . . . Yet, despits its similarity to other Llamas records, this one stands out from the last few, maybe just because the songs are a little better this time. This gets better with each listen. It is not Hawaii, but it is as good as or better than any High Llamas album besides that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great place to start","review":"Excellent practical advice.

Her agenda quickly becomes clear in the first chapter, and while she is entitled to her opinion, she should not misrepresent it as unbiased source of information. Additionally, I have never found a piece of writing more insensitive and plainly cruel to those of us who are reproductively challenged.

Cleary began the Jackie and Jake series with a warm feel for Jackie's character and her abilities to deal with her trials and tribulations. She,also,was able to reasonably convey Jake's character as an adopted canine family member. However,as the series has progressed,it has been more and more difficult to concentrate on the author's marvelous plots as Jake's character has become more and more ridiculous. It has always seemed that Ms. Cleary's knowledge of dog behavior was somewhat limited but Jake has become a comic book character that even a non-doglover would have a hard time believing. This novel had great potential as a good mystery but the distraction of Jake's ludicrous behavior made it a labor to read. Perhaps it's time for MS. Cleary and Jackie to put Jake and Maury up for adoption.

If it were a cookbook, I could accept on faith that baking powder should cause my cake to be fluffy. But this is not a cookbook.

Thus in my mind some element of proof is required to show why these cures are supposed to work. None such is offered.I don't believe Rector-Page really understands the subject to the depth I require.

Based on a true story, the author adds rich details and imagery, bringing the reader back to a time long ago during the 1930's and 40's in Louisiana. Creating realistic and appropriate dialogue for her characters, Ledgerwood lets the reader alternately feel the very different lives that white and black boys and girls, and men and women lived. I especially enjoyed the author's rich descriptions of the sights, sounds, smells and feelings of the environment. I felt like I was right there with the character. For those that wish to reminisce about a time long ago, or for the reader who has never visited the South, this book is a wonderful tale to enjoy, and provides inspiration for all to reflect on their own personal values and beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb","review":"I am not a musician, but appreciate excellent Classical music.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this version-you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun!","review":"This is a great movie and a 1930's classic! While the plot may be a bit complex to describe, it's easy to get into and understand once the film starts. To make a long story short, a newspaper accidentally prints a false story involving an heiress (Myrna Loy) who then slaps the paper with a five million-dollar lawsuit. The editor of the paper (Spencer Tracy) concocts an elaborate scheme involving his fiancée (Jean Harlow) and former colleague (William Powell) in hopes of having the lawsuit dropped. Everything seems to go according to plan, but romantic entanglements soon abound and everything spins hilariously out of control. This is a great film that's held neatly together with witty dialogue and fueled by the first rate performances of its lead stars Spencer Tracy, Myrna Loy, William Powell and Jean Harlow. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster treatment for a great comedy classic","review":"Warner Brothers brought this great screwball comedy to DVD with much fanfare, but did absolutely nothing to clean or restore the battered print that has been used for the VHS for nearly 20 years.

William Powell, Spencer Tracy, Jean Harlow and Myrna Loy star in a crazy comedy resulting from a woman's libel suit against a newspaper. The newspaper is unethical, the lady is above reproach and all bets are off as the newspaper tries to sully her reputation in order to win the suit. Spencer Tracy plays the unethical newspaper man who libels Myrna Loy. William Powell plays a playboy writer who writes books and for newspapers but always runs into trouble because of ladies. Myrna Lay is of course the impeccable heiress and one of the most entertaining performances comes from Jean Harlow who plays Spencer Tracy's fiance who is forced to marry William Powell and who is wooed and rejected by him. Difficult to figure out who cares about whom at times and that is part of the fun. A Swell film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good production, but I was expecting more","review":"The production is very well done, they explain very clear. But frankly, I was expecting a bit more.

What I would like to see improved on is that the words aren't always the best translation for example: gafas tranlates to goggles while should be glasses at least that is what they called them in Spain.

Jarvi and the Scottish National Orchestra make this abundantly clear in this atmospheric, almost mystical recording of it. When in top form (and he certainly is in top form here) Jarvi is a master of the Russian romantic idiom. He imparts a passion to these proceedings which has rarely been matched. It is almost a sin to compare this excellent recording with others. The only one in the same league would be Dutoit's with Philadelphia. Yet for all of the Dutoit's icy beauty, there is something to be said for the warmth and space brought by Jarvi and his team.

On the other twelve songs Tony Sheridan is the lead vocalist and only half fo those song feature the Beatles on backing. The 'Beat Brothers' are not the Beatles. Oh, by the way, Birth of a legend is an early 1962 LP that they cut for Decca, who didn't sign them, and the BBC didn't sign them on the strength of 'Yellow Matter Custard', which it wasn't originally called.

I came away with a lot less than I hoped. The book largely uses an informal, chatty, opinionated approach, but throws in a few more rigorous dribs and drabs at irregular intervals. The informal parts, although they present hard-won knowledge and good practice, don't provide a satisfyingly strong foundation. The occasion paragraph or two with real technical rigor doesn't fill the gap. Those moments stand isolated, not really part of the narrative flow, and generally lack the formal notation that could have made their meanings precise.Date advertises his other books heavily throughout this one - perhaps one of them has the kind of detail I was hoping for.

Throughout the book, there is a sense that the author is trying to impose her own romantic social views on a neighborhood whose depth and complexity clearly eclipses her own narrow and recent experiences there. Certainly her own experiences in the community bring some merit to the work, yet the reader cannot help but sense a tone of urbane arrogance as she observes with museum-like scrutiny the social habits of long-term residents who, ironically, are continually forced out by professionals like her."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little flimsy and short","review":"These triangular cages can also be set up un-folded in a zig-zag pattern that would be good for shorter peas, or folded, for non-vining plants like peppers or eggplants.However, for tomatoes, these cages are really low quality.

I will be stacking two together to make them taller, which I've done before successfully with square folding cages.

The better ones are in Chinese, complete with chants, talismans, etc.It it extremely weak on the workings of Chinese black magic and the author keeps rattling about myths and legends. It is especially lacking in practical details. There aren't good examples of talismans being illustrated, there is no information about the details of setting up the altar, constructing the straw man, days of the year which one should not draw the talismans, etc.This book is more on myths and legends than throwing light on the practical details of Chinese black magic that still survives today.

Perhaps its delight stems from being more a psychological portrait of Germaine and Benjamin Constant.

What's up with that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting from other reviews...","review":"I read other reviews and bought the ring based on them. I did not like it. There was a weird smudge-like mark in the ring that was there for good. It was too big too (my fault entirely) so in the end it didn't work on any account. Even if it had fit I doubt i would have kept it though. In the reviews people said that it matched their white gold well but the it sure didn't match mine. It wasn't the same color or shine."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little thinner than I'd like, but otherwise great","review":"no complaints, I just wish I'd ordered a thicker one. Fits true to size, seems durable, great backup ring for travelling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice ring","review":"This ring is nice, the comfort fit means you don't even feel it on your finger when wearing it. In hindsight I probably would have bought a thicker size as 3mm is very thin and doesn't really look like much on my finger, but this is my issue and nothing to do with the ring. It's great considering the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"AFI's Sing the Sorrow could quite possibly be the best album to be released this year. From the first song it pulls you in, and it doesn't let go. I wasn't really sure what to expect when I bought it, but what I got was amazing. Vocalist Davey Havok really out does himself, his voice is powerful, and his lyrics are heartfelt. The band is tighter than ever. This is definetly the best album they have done"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I keep reading people saying this cd is a downstep for AFI but i see it as nothing but a great band simply maturing, you cannot constantly continue with the same stlye of music for years and years, after a while you need to change and mix it up if not for the fans then for yourself. This cd is a great example of this. I think this is easily one of their best cd's from opening to closing. I highly recomend it to anyone out their who is undecisive. I have had this cd for a little over a month and every time i listen to Miseria Cantare and that is just the first song. well ant any rate give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"i bought this cd hearing from a friend how cool they were.We usually agree on punk music, but not this time.I have listened to this cd 1 time through and i barely made it, it is that bad.

I didn't like half the songs and the others were just to boring to get into. AFI seems like one of those bands that are trying to make a point or something like that but really I didn't get that message. I guess some of the song are catchy and I only bought it during that phase where I was just getting into Rock and punk was a new thing to me so I didn't know what to get.If you want a cool punk Rock band I reccomend all of the follwoing bands:1. The Ramones2. The Clash3. The Sex PistolsWell, actually what I said before (about not having any feeling about this album) was not 100% true. The one feeling I did get was that they were trying to hard to mix punk and there own type of hard Rock, it just didn't work for me. Thumbs Down!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorrow Sells as AFI proves","review":"After I found Black Sails in the Sunset I became an instant AFI fan, its by far the best of its kind, dark, fast, focused and pretty! Now more about image and glamor then ever AFI takes the jump to big money, fame and DREAMWORKS (what the hell?) This album has none of the feeling of what the older stuff did, all I can feel in it now is big money and glamor.

This new cd is a dissapointing mainstream cope out. They still are good, but they will never be the same band as they were before.

This cd is so over produced i cant stand listning to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"AFI is no longer punk or original","review":"this was one of the biggest disappointments ever. I'm not going to say i didn't see it coming, because i did. back when it was announced that afi had signed to dreamworks because they wanted a bigger \\"Sound\\", they actually ment a bigger \\"budget\\". so they blow some idiots money on some lame studio affects and they call it an album. ugh......

If you buy this cd thinking it is miraculous You wont be disappointed one bit it trully is as incredible as it sounds. I recommend it to EVERYBODY who likes fantastic music . Sing the sorrow is RAD to the MAX. I have 2 copies so im never without one. WARNING it is highly addictive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever Sing The Sorrow","review":"This CD is awesome. A must buy for any Die Hard AFI fans our there. And seeing as I can't find the words to describe the music AFI plays, I would also recommend this to people who have never listened to AFI. It's something new for them. And honestly, I cannot name a band that sounds anything like them. So get online, or go to a record store, and buy the CD! it's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A musical masterpiece","review":"Sing the Sorrow combines the dark sounds of Black Sails and Combines them with the raw power found on Art of Drowning.

If you enjoy AFI you will also like Thursday, Thrice, and My Chemical Romance"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing your sorrow","review":"What to write about a trully stunning band/album?AFI's 6th full lenght studio album, and their 1st major label debut comes after 11 years. During this time the band have come a long way.Sing The Sorrow, follows up from the bands 2000 release of Art Of Drowning, where the band already gave a warning for what is to come and what they are capable of. The dynamics of the music are absolutelly amazing. The production really takes AFI to a new level. Hotly hyped in the media as the realease of the album made atleast my self verry suspicious about the record. Was it going to be 10 \\"morning stars\\" all over again. To best of my luck it was not!Sing the Sorrow is deffinatelly one of the albums of 2003. This album is trully an album that defines AFI as a band and their carreer."},{"rating":"2","title":"AFI is definitly still growing and changing","review":"not at all like any of the older AFI stuff. A lot more old school hardcore sounding almost like 80's metal at times. Alot of weird sounds and just tons of different changes in each and every song. Some crazy influences must have inspired this album. If you are looking for something good and different this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW! this album is [weak]","review":"When i first recieved this album from a friend of mine, i was so happy for i had been a fan of AFI for years, since Shut your Mouth Open your eyes, and a fire inside. But this cd is such a damn dissapointment.Darvey's singing is great but i don't want to hear throughout the whole entire album without any decent instruments being played. This Album is literally focused on ALL EMO, too much emo my friends, is not a good thing. this is definilatey not the same group as it was 2 years ago.Rest Assure AFI fans, i know for a fact this is not the end for AFI, their next album will be awesome.SIng the Sorrow, has made me a lesser fan of AFI, but i still love them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Afi's new change...............is GREAT!","review":"Afi has changed thats the truth but..... they have changed in the greatest way possible. The new change has brought new listeners but then again they have lost many of the 1st listeners that liked them. Anyway you dont need to be a fan of the group to buy this new cd.

And to the people that disliked them in the past.....i dare them to pick it up because, you will like what u hear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"... Not that good","review":"It seems kind of funny to me whats happened to this band. It really seems like davey isturning into a younger version of glenn danzig in the sense that they both used to be good; then they were not that good; then they grew their hair out to shoulder length.Most all the songs on this cd are pretty bad (despite the fact that i had girls not grey stuck in my head for weeks ), but in my opinion some aret that bad. I would give this a 2 and a half, cos the songs can be very catchy, but thi sband has disapointed many people, so i rated down.I was watching MTV2 a while ago and saw afi live, and i'll tell you this : Its kind of a dead give-away that a bands sold out when the lead singer stands on top of a big MTV logo and sings a radio hit. (that was just for the kids that say \\"they have not sold out!\\") Bye"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"worshippable\\" may be underestimating","review":"well all i have to say is thank god for this band. i've had this album for like maybe a month or two, i don't know. i liked it then, and didn't realize how amazing it was til after buying two of my other favorite bands cds, deftones and third eye blind. theyre all right, but then i come back to afi and realize how much i love them- their old stuff, and their new stuff. i love number nine and ten. and seven.

The reviewers who gave 'Sing the Sorrow' one or two stars have compared AFI with bands like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan, but yet, AFI has been here for quite some time now. Things change, people change, and tastes change.I am not an AFI fanatic or anywhere near the likes of that, but I can say that I enjoy their music enough to give it four stars. Songs like \\"Girl's Not Grey\\" have this eccentric (sp?) beat to it, which makes the C.D. much more enjoyable. Songs like \\"Bleed Black\\" is more slow, but the lyrics are just as enjoyable.In my opinion (big word there), AFI doesn't have to prove themselves with their latest album, they already rock. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest cd ever!!!","review":"Sing the Sorrow is abolutly amazing and so beautiful. I have never heard anything like it. If you don't go and get it you will be missing out big time. Nothing else even comes close in comparison. You will regret missing out on such an amazing band. AFI forever!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A band thats changed alot","review":"It all depends on what kind of music you like but this is an alright cd.

Oh well I think there getting a litte too popular for my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screw AFI","review":"Very Proud of Ya, Shut your Mouth..., Black Sails in the Sunset -All fantastic albums.

What the hell happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone listen to this garbage?","review":"I am almost positive that the AFI faithful will blast me for writing a review trashing Sing the Sorrow, but I can't sit back and listen to the hype machine tout this as the new face of rock, as if Bad Religion is handing the punk rock baton to these guys. This is not new. It is not the future of rock and it downright fails to entertain the listener. Havocs falsetto could not be more out of sync with this cartoon theater. Go pick up the Clash's first record or some early Misfits. This is Tim Burton light. And unfortunately it is less filling, and it doesn't taste that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"i wish i could give this 0 stars, because this record is such a major label sell out. why would afi sell out? not enough money? try their older stuff, its much better. the only people who seem to like this stuff is teenage girls and emo kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY WHY WHY!!!","review":"I don't know how anyone can like this so called punk band. I have tryed to lission to them. I have herd this whole cd and few other ones and I can't staind these guys. I also download a song and it said MIsfits but no it was these guys. If you want real punk then go with The Misfits, DK, Bad Religon, etc etc anyone but this. I would rather lission to Blink 182 then these guys. All I have to say is AFI needs to die!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst cd i ever bought","review":"I bought this cd because i wanted to try something different and my friend likes them and said if you like the smiths then you would like them. Boy was she wrong this lead signer makes geddy lee sound like pavoritti. It cost alot of money to do this cd and it also has butch vig producing it then does why it sounds like crap. Which proves my point you can have all the money and good producers you want and the cd sounds like crap if the band or singer sucks at songwriting, singing and playing there instruments."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Second Coming of Christ","review":"I hate my generation. They just cannot let punk rock go, can they. 25 years ago, punk was a fresh and exciting genre. Now it is old and tired, very old and tired. It has become a type of music to be heard in a skate park. By the way, if you really want to be part of the excitement, pick some punk band concerned with style over substance (but that is extremely popular anyway) and worship them like they are the second coming of Christ, like AFI. Pretty Vacant."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE AFI!!","review":"Some of my friends used to like afi and bought some of their cds. I never liked them and after listening to a lot of their stuff(old and new)my mind had not changed. AFI is a terrible terrible band in every aspect. You can just tell by looking at them they suck. Goth punk? Please. Davey's ghastly voice combined with 3 other losers who obviously don't know what they're doing leads to some of the worst music of our generation.Probably my least favorite part is the lyrics.Girls not grey and Silver and cold are good examples of it.Your sins into me? What the hell is this? Needless to say I don't recommend any AFI music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without doubt the worst new band ..ever!!!","review":"Who ever sunk money into this bunch of fakersneed their heads lookin at.....and guess what...even a killer shot videowith the \\"so mo\\" jump work tryin to vibe up a bad songwill not sell shiitelock me up in a cell and blast Celine Dionfor a month....i'd be happier"},{"rating":"2","title":"AFI - Sing the Sorrow","review":"This is probably, AFI's best yet. It has taken the progression that all the album take... they get less punk-rock, more goth and better written as time goes on. Saying this they never forget there punk rock roots, just listen to Dancing Through Sunday (track 5). AFI's writing is at its deepest, all the songs on this album are lyrically and musically stunning, HAVOK and PUDGET are at the top of their game! We see AFI blend there usual goth and punk and hardcore, with even some darkwave/industrial bits on Death of Seasons! The singles from the CD: Girl's Not Grey and The Leaving Song Pt. II are probably the weakest songs although they are still great fun. Try and get the UK bonus tracks Now The World and Synthesthesa with the CD! Then are classic, maybe the highlight of the record. In short a true classic, the natural progression from Art of Drowning! I cant wait to see what AFI do next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"AFI has been, to me, one of the few bands who actually improve with each successive album. Until now.The musicianship is good, but the songs are not nearly as good as on Black Sails in the Sunset and The Art of Drowning. It seems like they didn't have many ideas.Davey Havok's lyrics have reverted to the way he was writing when they made Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes. Everything is about hatred and anger and being poisoned and betrayed, blah blah blah. Apparently he still isn't over that. The negativity and hate is enough of a reason alone to not buy the album. There is very little that makes you feel good when listening to this CD. I could tolerate some questionable lyrics/messages with the last two albums, but this one opens with \\"Love Your Hate!\\" being repeated on the first track. Sorry, but I'm not a hateful person and do not associate with those who are. I don't think I'll be listening to AFI anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"this cd is amazing in every way. whenever i am depressed or feeling down, i put this on and it helps me deal with everything. afi has always been my fav band, and this is a giant step for them. great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to Sing The Sorrow","review":"Sing the sorrow is a great cd from A.F.I .Although, many of their true fans would call this the worst A.F.I cd , I still think it\`s a great cd. Yes , this cd is missing the more hard upbeat punk songs,but this cd shows their versatility and their great songwriting .A great cd for any A.F.I fans who are opened minded and who want to hear a great cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly their best cd yet.","review":"In my opinion this cd is great. Before you get it you should know that it is a lot different from their previous work. It seems like the album was more thought over. Also, if you have just heard Girl's Not Grey on the radio im not sure how much you will like this album. Its a lot different than that song. Basically that song is the single for this album. If you are a long time fan i think you should get the album even though i dont know if youll like it. It really depends on what other kinds of music you like. So if you are thinking about gettting this album, you should think hard about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't get any better that this","review":"Any AFI fan knows that they create the best music out there- creative, original and full of emotion. This album is no different. Though it steers in the direction of being more of alternative record, it loses none of the energy of the previous records. It is innovative, it is creative, but best of all, it's something to listen to over and over. The plain simple truth is there is nothing out there right now that even compares to this. They are the greatest and this album proves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys shouldn't have made this cd","review":"... I bought this album thinking it would be their best yet. i listened it once and decided that i wasted my money and sold it the next day. The band has changed too much. They are not a screemo band like Thursday, they are a hardcore punk band with a straight edge lead singer. ... This album is not worth the money or the time it takes to download. I love AFI, just their old stuff. If this CD sounded like \\"Black Sails In The Sunset\\" or even \\"All Hallows EP\\" then i would have kept it. My suggestion, buy one of their older CD's and you will be alot happier. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype","review":"This album had a lot of hype behind it, at one point i read an article somparing it to Nevermind. There are a lot of good songs on here but Girls not Grey is a terrible pop song thats couldve been penned by Blink 182. The rest of the album is a mixed bag of gothic goop or some decent rock songs. Let's just say this is not an uplifting record. The art work reminds me of Smashing Pumpkins' Adore album."},{"rating":"1","title":"AFI's worst yet","review":"This is the worst cd I have ever heard. The vocals have not changed much, but pretty much everything else did. The fast paced guitars and deep growling bass's have been replaced with something that youd probably hear from bands like Saves the Day. Their music has gone from complex to simplistic, and thats what seperates the men from the boys. AFI has let all their former fans down with this cd, and I have high hopes for their next cd, if one ever comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"AFI CORPORATE ...","review":"In AFI's new album everything is slower and more repetitive. The song that is played constantly Girl on Grey has repetitive three or four word lyrics which is similiar to most corporate [stuff] that comes out. If you like waterdown punk music that is sugary sweet this is your album."},{"rating":"1","title":"its a shame","review":"i really thought afi was one of the bands i could count on to stay faithful to punk rock and all it idealizes. they may have more complex songs, but they didn't have to side with the enemy to be able to do that. it's like being in an army, watching the enemy come charging toward you, and realizing that, when they get up close, they used to be fighting along side you. go make the big bucks playing to the mtv crowd, afi. we don't need you anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated by half","review":"i bought the album on the strength of several solid reviews. mediocre at best. are they rock/punk? goth? industrial? not that the amalgamation matters as much as the fact they really have no sound of their own, and the songs are never particularily strong... you want this, go to sisters of mercy and rosetta stone first...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Downward Spiral","review":"AFI was never hardcore, and they are no longer punk. What started as a wonderful musical growth up until Art Of Drowning has now crossed the line into mainstream Hot Topic and MTV .... Here we've got Metallica basslines and campfire sing-a-longs. The backgroud vocals are weak, and the whole CD is overly programmed. For the first time in 6 releases, AFI has decided to DOUBLE-TRACK the guitars, and yet another great live band puts out a CD that they can't even play live. Also note, Sing the Sorrow is AFI's first CD off of Nitro Records, but where did they go? Sony. Give me a break. I'll take an Asking For It CD over anything A Fire Inside any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD","review":"If you like AFI, you'll love this CD. There is not one bad song on this CD. And the two added songs are awesome. I highly recommend this CD, whether you buy the regular version or the England version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best AFI yet?","review":"I think that Sing the Sorrow is quite possibly the best AFI cd ever made. Even though it is slightly more mellow then most of the previouis cds, the lyrics and music are much more haunting and powerful. Perhaps the best song on the cd is the \\"hidden\\" track at the end. I have heard a lot of people say that AFI has sold out by signing on to Dreamworks and all i have to say is that if this is selling out more bands should do it. Thats how great the album is."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS WAS BAD","review":"This was probabaly the worst album I'v ever bought. This isn't punk, it's like some kind of crappy gothic kind of music. It doesn't even evoke any emotion because of its extreme over production... So it doesn't even come off as gothic, just boring and deppressed. The leaving song pt. 2 would have been good, but it has that dumb spanish part that you can't even hear unless you turn the volume up. As far as the guitars go, they're bad too, I was expecting big chunky punk riffs, but instead there's, mostly annoying highpitched little licks that aren't evenlistenable. The singer is definitely selling himself shorthe has a great voice but he's backed up by crappy riffs and he's written crappy lyrics. I don't have anything against AFI (I look over my shoulder to make certain a crazed AFI fan isn't watching me write this) but they're making bad music, i just wanted to warn people. This isn't punk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked Black Sails....","review":"If you like Black Sails in the Sunset, you will hate this album.

Now signed on with a major label, DreamWorks, many people have called band 'sellouts' and that they're going too 'mainstream', but AFI remains as gold as ever. With the lyrical talents of Davey Havok (Lead Vocals) and Jade Puget (Guitar), this album remains priceless. 'Death of Seasons' is creative and passionate, while 'This Celluloid Dream' is upbeat, making you want to jump around the room, singing along with Davey. For every true fan, and all the rest who watch the band on MTV, scoop up this album and be in bliss for a long time to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AFI at their best","review":"It can be their 6th full-lenght album, but its the first time punk-rockers AFI record with a major label, Dreamworks.If you pay attention to the release dates of the AFI's cds, they did pretty quick, but now, they had 3 years to write the songs, so the songs are more complex, far more darker or epic...This album really reflect the musical structure they adopted when guitarist Jade Puget Joined the band,in 1999.This is a f@%&in good album maybe AFI's greatest, and i strongly recommend it to everyone who likes complexe punk-rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"gotta love it just coz its davey","review":"for the idiot who said davey is a heavy metal singer- ur an freakin idiot. his voice is old school hardcore at best (best being on shut ur mouth... and black sails, i suppose). I cant stand these ppl who think they are so good coz they can put metal in a sentence as if they know aobut the genre. Go listen to avril u idiot.anyway... sing the sorrow is a beautiful and sad album that makes me smile and makes me cry..... davey has some brilliant moments but its not the best album they've ever done...if u like blink 182 then stay away from afi..... trust me u wont like them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very annoying and depressing!","review":"I bought this CD because I heard AFI was a cool band and I had heard the song Days of the Phoenix on the radio and thought it was cool. One day I heard Girl's Not Grey and I loved it. Another thing that attracted me was the price it was very cheap for some reason, now I know why. This CD isn't even worth purchasing. It's got nothing good to it. If you want a good CD pick up Finch's \\"What It Is To Burn\\" or Coheed and Cambria's \\"In Keeping the Secrets of Silent Earth: 3\\" those are two CDs that are well worth your money. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the great disappointment","review":"this album, with exception of \\"death of seasons,\\" is garbage. it's boring, generic, commercial, and nearly every other adjective required to make a successful commercial album. i'm not sure i could live with myself if i were responsible for releasing such swill into this world.what happened to these guys?"},{"rating":"1","title":"title of review","review":"Ok, firstly, if you think this band has any artistic depth in their music you are kidding yourself. Whatever darkness they supposedly exude is entirely visual, and possibly lyrical (I wouldn't really know, can't understand a word he's saying). It in no way comes through in their music. This is throwaway pop, and bad throwaway pop at that. I had a pretty dim view of this band before hearing this album, but I actually turned myself around to the mindset of thinking this album might be something I could get into based on what I read about it, but wow, so disappointing. This band isn't even of the calibre of Fat Wreck Chords label throwaway pop punk bands, it's beneath even that. This is just bad music. Comparable to Britney Spears in its extreme level of style over substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something went horribly wrong","review":"I went into this CD with a really positive outlook. I loved AFI and still do. I popped Sing the Sorrow into my CD player and began listening. I listened to it all the way through. I seriously tried to like the CD but just couldn't. Compared to 'Art of Drowning', 'All Hallow's' and 'Black Sails in the Sunset' this was just awful. I hope AFI can pull it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"AFI is DONE","review":"Sing The Soorow is an over produced album that ruins everything they stand for. I am ashamed to own such an aweful CD. Davey voice was such an amzing thing they really helped them stand out against other bands but his screams have now been compared to the guy from Creed. AFI compared to Creed? That blows but its true. As a long time fan i am so dissapointed it really sounds like AFI at thi point are no longer doing it for the love of the music but the love of the money. For those who listen to AFI because its \\"cool\\" or if you like \\"pop\\" music this cd is for you. for old time AFI fans dont waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And the mainstream claims another punk band....","review":"Let me get this out of the way first - the old AFI is gone. And, it is very likely that they will never come back. No more Black Sails At Sunset, no more All Hallow's E.P. The goth has finally taken over, and obscured almost every trace of punk and hardcore. The majority of this album sounds like a cross between bad-Cure imitation and watered-down Misfits. Every once in a while, a faint trace of the old AFI shines through, such as on \\"This Celluloid Dream\\" or \\"Dancing Through Sunday\\" but for the most part, Sing The Sorrow consists of a predictible combination of emo-goth wallowing and radio-friendly poppiness. If you're depressed and it's raining outside, this isn't a bad album to listen to, but otherwise, the content here is summed up by one of the song titles - \\"The Great Disappointment.\\" Goodbye, AFI. I'll miss you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Although most people buy this cd, including me, to listen to the hit singles \\"silver and cold,\\" \\"girl's not grey,\\" and \\"the leaving song part II\\" the rest of the songs on this album are enough alone to make me want to buy any future a.f.i cds. Most punk rock bands release one hit single and sell hundreds of thousands of albums based on that single, even though the rest of the songs suck. Obviously A.F.I isnt just another punk band, they are living legends, but nevertheless, their cd is amazing from the first track to the last. i especially think that the songs \\"dancing through sunday\\" and \\"bleed black\\" are quality singles and should be played on the radio in the near future. truely a must buy for any fan of rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd!...kinda dissapointing limited edition though","review":"i cant deny that i absolutely love the cd (though i still miss afi's older sound....check out answer that and stay fashionable or very proud of ya to see what i mean) but the dvd is kinda lame. And the book is just a hardcover lyrics book, pretty much. Not exactly worth [the money] than the cd itself (depends on where u buy it). I would stick with the normal cd, which u can easily pick up for like [less money].So yeah, this is pretty much just a dumb 8 minute movie (clandestine, a cool yet overhyped book, and the same cd we all know and (should) love.I'd say just get the cd itself, but if you want to waste some cash on some afi merch that should be worth some money one day, go right ahead. nobody's stoppin ya."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting even better","review":"This is a big step up for AFI. They've matured their more indie/punk sound from years ago, the culmination of which is this album. It is a CD that I can listen all the way through (which is saying a lot these days, with so many \\"filler\\" songs out there). Although it isn't quite as punk as before, they definitely haven't sold out. Long time fans may find it too \\"pop\\" or \\"emo,\\" but they're stuck in the past. AFI is definitely moving forward. This sound is a little more mainstream than past albums (i.e., black sails into the sunset), but they still know how to rock. Davey's vocals are great and he has amazing range. I love the shifts in tempo throughout the album, and the instrumentals are impressive. I thoroughly enjoyed this follow-up to their last album \\"The Art of Drowning.\\" The band is maturing their sound and becoming confident in their talent. I saw AFI live this past November. Wow. Davey really knows how to get crowd going. Good show."},{"rating":"2","title":"definatly worth your time","review":"wow is this cd good. i recommend this cd to anyone. when you buy it though make sure you listen to the bonus track it is really good as well. great job afi"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never a dull moment.","review":"AFI'S CD Sing the Sorrow is one of the best CD's I own. Every song is beautifully written, from the haunting lyrics to the inspiring melodies. Davey Havoc's voice has a wide range which is stunning from beginning to end. This CD is a must for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 stars, and very disappointing","review":"After two lightning fast and super albums, we were all expecting another speedster, another great album. Instead, we get this depressing music, i.e, The Leaving Song Pt. 2. The album does have a few high points, in that their riffs are more complex, but the songs are far slower and not all that good. Sure, Bleed Black may be more upbeat, but it lacks everything a good AFI song has. Silver and Cold has a decent chorus, but thats it. Now then, the one amazing song on the album, is DANCING THROUGH SUNDAY. AFI's best song in my opinion, and one of my favorite songs of all time. The riffs are just great, and more complex than ever before, and the highlight of course, comes with the stellar solo, a great solo. The rest album is generally the same thing except for Paper Airplanes, another good song. Don't get this album unless you are a diehard AFI fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"If you only buy one cd this year make sure it is Sing The Sorrow. This is AFI's first major record label album and it has been worth the wait!Every song is great and they all fit together greatly. I heartily recommend this album to anyone. Whether you are an AFI virgin or veteran you are bound to love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fire Inside","review":"This album by far transcends any work A.F.I. has done in the past. It has brought new meaning to my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I love this cd, I cant tell you how much. it has a hardcore edge at times, beautiful harmonies, a choir and chanting all in one. The songs are performed beautifully and the song lyrics put me in complete awe. I can't wait for their show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Darkness calms your soul","review":"This by far is the greatest cd that AFI has ever made,.. so far...it has everything from flyng guitar solo's to powerful chorus's...the overall power of this cd is un heard of....if your into afi..get this cd....and let the darkness calm your soul"},{"rating":"2","title":"AFI?","review":"This CD is softer than all of their others. It still comes through, however, with its great words, chorus, and a wicked pissa guitar solo. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"STS is worth it, believe me","review":"This is easily AFI's greatest album yet. I honestly cannot think of a single lyric or riff that I don't like. All at the same time, I am completely pumped up by the music and floored by the lyrics. It is an awesome album, put out by one of the greatest bands in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"new but great","review":"This is definetly a new sound for AFI. They've shed their restraining skins and tried something new that they like, and its seriously an excellent result. Mixing some punk, goth, and metal, they come up with a new sound that not only is new and great, but somehow pays homage to their previous works.I've had this CD for about 12 hours and I'm completely addicted to it. Listen to the secret track on track 12.. after track 12 ends just let it keep playing and playing. It's haunting.They were great already, but AFI has made a great change. Note--for diehard fans, it might take a little getting used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENDED","review":"All real hardcore AFI fans will probably hate this album. I don't even now what to say. ... I still personally love their old stuff way better. Its to bad that another one of my favorite bands has left the underground to try to make it big, with so much [bad] music coming out of the so called punk scene,now that punk is in style. Dreamworks deos kill good music as one reveiwer said."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CD!","review":"I never had heard AFI till about 2 years and then I saw the\\"Days of the Phoenix\\" video and LOVED it. So i looked em up on the internet and ended up adoring all their albums. I bought this album the week it came out and ITS GREAT! They are great to be able to come up with new things to add on each album and they just did the sweetest job on Sing The Sorrow. My advice to anyone would be to buy this AWESOME album. Its majorly worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay New AFI","review":"Great cd. Very Different from their older stuff but still awesome. Davey's lyrics are as always amazing. I've listend to this cd for days straight and I'm still not sick of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not my kind of music","review":"I think that it is funny that whenever a band gets talent and starts doing something elseand gets some talent somehow they have sold out and suck. This music is ok 4 stars just for being differnt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Album","review":"i heard the song girl's not grey on mtv, and i thought it was a pretty good song. i picked up the album and found the other songs were as good or better than that song. I find myself listening to this cd all the time because all of the songs are good except wierd poetry. best songs:1. The leaving song: i cant get this one out of my head. i love it.2. Bleed Black: well put together song.3. Silver And cold: excellent second single.4. Girl's not grey: Good first single, catchy riffs.5. The leaving song prt. 2: Good second part, comes before first one on cd?overall its a very good album. you can tell they really care about the music they are making, and that is the most importand part of being a musician. you all should buy this piece of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer punk","review":"For their first three full length album, AFI were an up and rising punk band. They started off as high school students that formed a garage band as a Misfits tribute. Now, they have landed their music onto mainstream radio and have drastically changed their style of music. I admit that a few of the songs, such as: Dancing through Sunday, Paper Airplanes, and This Celluloid Dream, are catchy, but they don't sound anything like classics such as: Rizzo in the Box, File 13, or This Secret Ninja. Sadly, they are now just another band that sold out."},{"rating":"2","title":"They didn't sell out!!","review":"When I heard AFI had gone from Nitro to Dreamworks I became very worried. Now that their on a major label doesn't that mean they will sell out? Apparently not! Sing the Sorrow is the next logical step after the great album Art of Drowning. I love punk and have been one of AFI's fan for along time. I am still a little upset about the move but the music only sacraficed a little so, all and all I am very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a punk fan, buy this cd.","review":"This cd is by far one of AFI's best. I cant stop listening to it. I guess if your really set on only liking old AFI then you might consider not buying this cd. But if you want to hear something new and amazing by my opinion buy this cd. The hidden track is so good. I cant stop listening to it. I am currently listening to it as i type this. If you have a brain in your head buy this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"My friend showed me this album, when i first heard it i didn't even like this style of music but after a couple listens every single track absolutely blew me away.It's hard to pick favorites but i really loved tracks 2,4,6,8,10,11,12 and the hidden track. You have to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If u dont like this cd ,keep on listening to it. TRUST ME!!!","review":"This cd is really amazing.I wouldn't say it was their best but it is still good. At first i was like what is this because this isn't really their punk roots. After listening to it for awhile, i was really in to it. For u older AFI fans, give this cd a chance.If your new to AFI, buy it.Then buy their other cd's like The Art of Drowning\\" and so and so until u have them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD from a great band","review":"In the U.K, it is hard for people to find bands. Until we had satellite tv installed recently, i thought punk bands were blink 182 and greenday. However, music channels on Sky introduced me to AFI. When I first saw their video for girls not grey I was impressed. Then I bought the Transplants album, and Davey does guest vocals on the track \\"Quick Death,\\" so i decided this may be some good punk rock that i was missing out on.It truly was. Since buying sing the sorrow i have listened to it almost religiously every day. The band display a lot more maturity than most of the mainstream punk bands, and there sound is different. There are some great guitar riffs and solo's, and Davey Havocks voice seems to sound great over about 3 octave's and even when he's doing his screaming.A great rock CD from a great Rock Band, I have already purchased another 2 of AFI's albums since hearing this and am looking forward to future albums and gigs by them"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I've listened to AFi in passing for a number of years, I liked most of their stuff but never bothered to buy an album. I recieved Sing the Sorrow as a gift and for the most part it doesn't come out of my CD player, I consider myself a picky person and i don't usually buy cd's prefering to borrow from people and mix my own from songs I like, but I like every single song on this album, something that's only happened one other time (Orgy's Candyass) all in all this is a really awesome album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing the Sorrow","review":"Sing the Sorrow was the first AFI album I have ever purchased, and I am thoroughly impressed. The boys mix driven guitars with screaming (and sometimes chanting) vocals and beautiful lyrics. Standouts on the album are \\"Miseria Cantare\\", \\"Bleed Black\\", and \\"Girl's Not Grey\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic AFI CD","review":"This CD will blow you away...very different compared to previous AFI albums but definitely one of their best albums EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Few Bands can Create Music Like this","review":"All I have to say is that this cd is great. The only reason why it gets bad reviews is because AFI don't play punk like they used to and are playing more alternative and heavy stuff. They are turning into more of an art rock band. We need more bands out there that make music as poetic and amazing as Sing The Sorrow. Good stuff, no matter what anyone says... BUY IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical pop-punk album","review":"This is a unique sounding pop-punk album not like anything i've heard before (and i mean that, ive read some reviews calling simple plan unique for crying out loud). It's one of those albums that take me a long time to realise how good it actually was. I got it after hearing Girl's not Grey on the radio, listened to it maybe twice, then not again for months. Every now and again i would put it, but never did it strike me as being a masterpiece. That was until i went through a phase with nofx. I started gathering nofx albums and albums from similar bands and again i put sing the sorrow into my stereo. To my disbelief i was listening to some of the greatest music i had ever heard, i can't understand why it never struck me earlier as being a classic. My fav songs are 2,3,4,6,10 and 12 (these ones are more melodic). The album also has a couple of songs which sound like they are from previous albums (5 and 9 in particular). I love the eerie intro as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SUCKS!!!","review":"What ... happened to these guys? ... Thev've obviously signed with a major label, and made a much more SOFT, radio friendly album to get airplay so they can alienate their old fans in favor of screaming 14 year old girls! I heard a new song on the radio and didn't even realize it was my beloved AFI until the DJ said so, I just thought it was more generic radio rock. i've checked out the album and it sucks too! Hey kids who think AFI is a \\"new\\" band, go back and get their old punk/hardcore stuff and throw this ...in the garbage.... thanks for letting your fans of almost 10 years down guys!! SELLOUTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally, it hath arrived...","review":"another boring \\"underground\\" rock album. I guess A.F.I. got tired of ripping off the Misfits so they decided to rip off every other 'screamo' band out there. These guys wear suits, they MUST be hip and different, and they have X's on their hands, like they just got back from a show. Wow, that means they have a wide range of influences.Jesus, at least that goth chick that's their lead singer is hot...Oh crap, that's a dude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves no stars. Contrived nonsense.","review":"The fact that these guys are compared to the Misfits is outrageous. This stuff is on par with Yellowcard, New Found Glory, or any other pop punk emo crappola that is currently so popular. Davy Havok is an androgenous homo who whines about stuff that appeals to wussie thirteen year old kids. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together should know better than to listen to this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"No.","review":"Don't listen to any review claiming these guys didn't sell out, because they did. If you define \\"selling out\\" as signing to a major label and going from a hardcore punk sound to a completely boring, overdone, trendy \\"dark\\" pop sound, then yes, they did sell out. Anyone that likes this album is only convincing themselves that they do so they can go out and wear a studded belt and black t-shirt. If you want hard punk with great yelling, chanting, and driving guitars and drums (real AFI) listen to The Art of Drowning. If you want a lame excuse to wear eyeliner and convince your high school friends that you have an \\"edgy\\" musical taste, then by all means listen to Sing the Sorrow. Just don't lie about it on amazon and tell anyone that its actually good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better with age","review":"AFI has always been my favorite band. I couldn't wait for there new album. When i got it for chritmass i couldn't wait to listen to. I poped it in and I thought...\\"WHAT HAPPEND\\"? There older music was so much better. The fast pasted signing and the rebelious lyrics mand them awsome. But Sing the Sorrow was slow and stupid. They need to go back to what made them great."},{"rating":"2","title":"AFI r0cks!!","review":"AFI has been though so much together..they started in there teens and mnmade it up to teh topi recommened this band if u love punk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage...","review":"I've tried to like this band, with all the air play they get, I thought maybey it was just me. So, I listened some more and I just can't stand the singer at all. The band sounds decent, but I can't get past thier singer.Do yourself a favor and look else where for music. These guys are just plain horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"sux","review":"AFI sux, the lead singer sounds like a chick thats 9.....they attempted to be dark and misterious,but sound like wining little 10 year olds that sing about killing themselfs.....and my dog can rite better lyrics"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Produced Garbage","review":"Back when A.F.I. was just a punk band they had some decent songs. Then they decided to learn all about goth lyrics, and they went downhill. How does a band who's written great punk anthems like \\"I Wanna Get A Mowhawk (But My Mom Won't Let Me)\\" end up writing sappy feel-sorry-for-yourself junk like \\"The Great Disappointment\\"? If you want good music, buy Rancid, I hear they've got a new cd comming out soon. And their singer doesn't look like a chick."},{"rating":"2","title":"AFI Freak'n rocks!","review":"This is by far their best album yet. AFI is such a talented group and has the potential to be the best punk band ever. These guys have a passion for music and it's obvious by every track. \\"This Time Imperfect\\" is one of the best. Great c.d. I'd recommend it to anyone who is open minded to music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Glow Till MOrning Comes...","review":"I was worried that this record was not going to be very good. Leaving Nitro and signing to DreamwWorks might be the best thing they ever AFI ever did. With a obviously larger budget to work with AFI creates very well produced sounds and effects making Sing The Sorrow there best record to date!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This ROCKS!!!","review":"After waiting quite a long time for a descent rock album to come out, finally A.F.I. delivered!!! This is one of the best rock album's ever. I have listened to the whole thing many times, it gets better every time you listen to it. Can't wait until they come out with new material. My thoughts go out to the band and the lead singer. Get well and continue to keep us rockin'!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD - much better than the crap of their past","review":"Sounds like AFI have finally learned how to write songs and play their instruments. Not great but damn good. If you liked their retarded, UNORIGINAL punk crap of yesteryear, look elsewhere, there's many crappy punk bands for you out there. AFI have really come into their own and taken a big step forward here. I look forward to their next cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album this year","review":"After listening to the two singles released off this album, I was hooked immediately. As soon as I bought the album, I ran through the entire thing and was amazed at the different angle AFI have come from. It is one of the few albums I can actually listen to the whole of without skipping and the lyrics are excellent. The bands style and genre may be undetermined, but one thing's for sure...these guys make infectious music that hooks you immediately. I definitely recommend this album to those willing to hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different sound..","review":"\\"Sing the sorrow\\" Seems softer than any of the other AFI albums, But no matter what, AFI Has always done a beautiful job at everything they do. Daveys words on this album are magnificent! Everyone has progressed so much. Jades guitar playing, Hunters bass playing, And of course adam on drums... All sound awesome!, Like always. I have been a fan for years, Despite what others say about this album, Its a work of art, And I insist you buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh...","review":"Now, eye myself am a personal fan of more thrashy punk, like AFI's older cd - Shut Your Mouth And Open Your Eyes, therefore this album, to me, was absolutely horrid. The only reason that it, to me, deserved even 2 stars was because of Davey Havok's amazingly poetic lyrics, though their style has definately changed for the worst, in my opinion. This cd would be great for more of an emo fan because of Davey Havok's AMAZING voice, but if you are more of a fan of hardcore punk, eye would recommend Shut Your Mouth And Open Your Eyes, or The Art Of Drowning."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Next Offspring, Only Worse","review":"Okay, what happened. AFI was one of the great hardcore bands of the nineties and they went down this path. Say it isn't so! (...). The album's not that great either. From the song \\"Girl's Not Gray\\" which borders the line between pop-punk/pop (don't ask me to explain), and the rest of the album follows in its footsteps.I H-A-T-E this album. Its the worst thing that could happen to an old school fan like me. It saddens me that AFI could go down this path. So drop this album and buy Very Proud of You or Answer That and Stay Fashionable. You'll be happier, trust me (unless you like Good Charollote, then you'll probably love this friggin' album!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this turgid mess","review":"An album rating of a half star generally denotes a retaliatory rating with no thought. And if there is a review, it will generally be: \\"THIS BAND SUXORS YEA BLACK SABBATH.\\" But in this case, I am serious in declaring AFI's Sing the Sorrow one of the most sonically offensive listening experiences I have ever had the pleasure of enduring. Perhaps what is most infuriating about this group is how they are portrayed as hardcore saviors, punk-rawk machines who can and will save modern music - because really, this is sub-sub-sub-sub-everything else poor pop-punk with mascara on. I understand and appreciate that this stuff appeals to some, but if you think like me you should avoid this record like the clap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Hollow","review":"Don't get me worng. I love afi, they have been my favorite band for many years, but after listening to their \\"old school\\" releases, sing the sorrow just seems hollow, empty..like it's missing something.Still a wonderfull addition to the library of a wonderfull band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing The Sorrow","review":"Finally, after 3 years AFI has a new album, and i can honestly say that it was worth the wait. Hopefully in a year or 2, AFI will start a new album. One thing is for sure, after Sing The Sorrow, AFI is going nowhere but up in the punk rock music industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"big label, good choice","review":"Being a huge a.f.i. fan for years now i was very hesitant to hear thier first major label debut,but i should have known better cause these guys just dont dissapoint. Sing the sorrow has all the qualities of old a.f.i. stuff but with a more cleaned up sound.Killer vocals, awesome musicians, and really really wicked lyrics. This album just really kicks and it retails cheap so everyone should go out and grab a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"best possible way to start on a new label!","review":"From the introduction to the last bit of the hidden track, \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" is a revelation for the band. I have been influenced more by AFI than any other band since i heard \\"Shut Your Mouth...\\" and so on. But I must say they truely went all out for this album. In the firts 24 hours of owning it I listened to it, in it's entirity, 9 times. It is beautifully written, terrificaly recorded, and just all out amazing. I recomend this to every die hard AFI fan, and/or anyone who happens to be looking for tasteful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"afi sing for sorrow WIKID!","review":"i got sing the sorrow as a birthday present and got it the day after it came out ...since then i have played it to death even my mum's listened to it! i love AFI although i havent been a fan for long but since i first heard them i havent stopped. i now own all their albums and up until sing the sorrow The art of drowning was the best so it just shows that AFI are always improving! they are amazin n thay will b around till the end of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Album","review":"The new album is great! I highly anticipated album for AFI fans, that doesn't disappoint. AFI has really improved every aspect of their music which is clearly seen on Sing the Sorrow. I haven't been able to stop listening to it since I got it. If your an AFI fan and haven't pick this up, then your missing out. And definitly try to go see them live. Awsome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why don't you have this CD?","review":"Once again, AFI has amazed me with a release that out-shines all of their previous albums. An hour of beautiful, heartfelt, and powerful music. A great mix of punk, hardcore, and goth- a perfect combination! Beginning with spine-chilling and thought provoking tracks such as Miseria Cantare and Silver And Cold, and ending with slower, truly inspired songs like ...But Home Is Nowhere. Mind-blowing bass lines, exquisitely melodic guitar, excellent rhythm, vocals too breahttaking to even be described, and lyrics tHat flow smoother than the best poetry.AFI'S BEST ALBUM YET!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dancing from the record store","review":"AFI have done it again.any old fan would know that they change and progress with each new album, and sing the sorrow is no different my frineds. pushing musically and vocally to new levels, AFI have embraced their old hardcore stomping grounds once more but this time with a more melodic twist thats sure to ensnare any hardcore kid into the afi web. anthematic chants and symphonic breakdowns, with even the tiniest bit of techno in The Great Dissappointment. wonderful job boys, keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"AFi-Sing The Sorrow","review":"It's the best CD I have heard since their release of the Art of Drowning. Everyone should listen to it. Their music is differs from anything anyone has ever heard before. They have added new beats and guitar chords to make you want to get up and move around. Its energy is amazing and powerful. Get it and you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow Perfect Cd Buy It Now It's Great","review":"This cd is great David adds his vocals to great guitar and drum parts in the songs. The Best Songs (by a small amount) are \\"Leaving Song Part II\\", \\"Girls Not Grey\\", \\"Leaving Song\\", and \\"...But Home Is Nowhere\\". If you like hardcore, great screaming vocals, or just plain like AFI, you'll love this cd. Buy It. Perfect composition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prelude to a classic","review":"I own over 400 CDs and over 3000 LP and believe it or not, it is the best CD I have purchased in my short 25 years life span. The heavy parts on Leaving Song pt 2 kick butts, the punk-rock parts in paper airplanes make me speed, the 80s glam rock style in dancing throught sunday give me chills while the melancholy transcending the whole production make me break into tears in the crowded trains of Tokyo. Seriously! And let's not discuss Death of Season cuz there're no words to describle this avant-garde masterpiece.Your best buy if you are crunchy outside but tender inside...-- Those who call them sellout, repent because this CD is the prelude to a new classic in music history. Their next CD will probably be a milestone in punk, alternative and industrial music. --"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Wow this is definatly one of A.F.I. better albums. They got away from the cheap punk sound and went into better sounding music. Davey's vocals are absoulty amazing on these songs. Im hoping afi puts out another ablum soon"},{"rating":"2","title":"EAST BAY HARDCORE!!","review":"this album is one of the greatest afi albums ever from davey havoks screaming vocals to jade pugets excellent guitar and the pounding drums of adam carson with the great bass of hunter its no wonder these guys are going to the top the best song is this celluloid dream but if you like any type of music then youll like this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars + 5 more","review":"I love this album first off. Their making better music, better guitaring, better singing, I'm tired of all these ooh lets joke around and be stupid bands like Good Charlotte, and other crap like that. Afi's lyrics are nice I must say. (How does that dude sing long words oh so fast?!?!?!). Don't trash this bands Sing the Sorrow CD!!!! There starting to get much better than their old stuff. I was sick of the singing all fast junk from their older CDs. This one is more emotional, which isn't bad. If you Listen to as much music as I do you'll realize that difference is good. Too many bands sound the same. Dave sings much better in this, even though he still goes a little fast, and the shouting is a little annoying at times but they make it cool, he needs to keep his voice deep in some parts like in &quot;The Great Dissapointment&quot; or &quot;Silver and Cold.&quot; Great CD, GET IT I recommend it very very highly too bad theres only 1 to 5 stars.."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Band On The Planet","review":"To put it simply the new AFI album rocks.This is without a shadow of a doubt the best rock record I have ever possessed.It is melodic and beautiful but at the same time harsh and energetic blending Davey Havok's heartbreaking vocals with some of the best riffs since Nirvana.Adam (Carson,Drums)is an amazing drummer and this really shines through on the album.Hunters bass skills are magnificent.These guys have gone without the respect they deserve for a long time . This record will change that.AFI are one of the only true rock bands ever.Beneath the churning energy of the music what you find is love,anger,hate,and just about every other emotion any human being has ever before felt.Changed my life, for the better.A classic.EMMAxxxx"},{"rating":"1","title":"A shameful CD in a stack of classics!","review":"AFI was without a doubt one of the greatest bands of the 90's. They even continued their saga into the year 2000 win they released one of their best records, The Art Of Drowning. But when Sing The Sorrow was released it completely changed the bands image. Apparently they'd rather have preteen girls listening to their music now rather than people who actually know good punk rock. The switch from hardcore to alternative really un-inspired my friends and I. I believe this CD is horrible. DONT BUY IT! You know in AFI's first music video Davey Havok said, \\"As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be in a hardcore band.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite","review":"I'm not sure what to say about this album. I don't hate it. I don't love it. It's still AFI, but it's different. I don't even care about the \\"major label\\", but now I think that did affect their music. It's AFI with a twist. They added stuff to make their music fit on the radio and on MTV. I bet I'd love the CD if they stayed original. In \\"Death Of Seasons\\" they added a techno beat in the middle! Whats up with that? AFI is not a pop-techno band. At least they didn't used to be. Can't they see that they're selling out?My advice to you is to listen to AFI. All the time. But don't buy this CD. Listen to the other stuff. Their other CDs. I love this band. I don't love what they're doing now. I'm really sad they're doing this. Offspring did it too with Conspiracy Of One. The bands don't sound like they used to. It's sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"AFI's best","review":"I tried so hard to go on without purchasing this special edition, but just couldn't! I am so glad I was able to get this brilliant album/DVD. Not only do you get Sing the Sorrow, AFI's best album to date, but a totally sweet short film done in 2 different soundtracks *Jade's and Hunter's* You also get 5 songs done in 5.1 surround. But, the best part is the 60+ page hardcover book. It's so lovely. If you have the cash, I suggest you buy it the second you can. It is without a doubt rad. <3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaking Awesome","review":"Have you ever listened to a cd and it has just sent chills of astonishment down your spine? Well, in my opinion this does. STS is so amazing its unbelievable. I am not sure what you want to call this album...I don't think you could quite say its punk and at the same time you couldn't say that it is metal. I think that this AFI album is their most deverse and reaches out to so many musical tastes...Davey Havoks voice is absolutely amazing, the range he has shows how good he is, plus the poors his heart and soul into every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelieveably Amazing","review":"This cd is amazing. AFI is truly one of the best bands out there today, and even though a lot of people say they are sell outs (which they aren't) I am proud of them for getting the attention they deserve. Ok now about Sing The Sorrow. From the first track to the end it doesn't get boring. You know, most of the time when you listen to a cd you get bored after a while and you skip around the tracks, but this cd has so much variation that you just can't stop in the middle of it. I just love the dark and mysterious sound AFI puts out, it's awesome. This is a must buy, if you don't like it on the first listen (like i did) give it another chance because i am sure you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"I'm not a long time fan of AFI but I have all of their albums and love every single one. When I heard of the label change I thought, \\"Well, AFI is AFI and nothing will ever change that. I'm certain their music will still be good.\\" And I was right. Though I must confess, Sing the Sorrow is definitely a big change for AFI. They've done a lot of exploring (which isn't a bad thing at all). In fact it's good to have a band that you can listen to no matter what mood you're in. If you feel like rocking out you can listen to their older stuff. If you want to listen to something that's thought-provoking and that has some nice melodies that you can sing a long to then the newer stuff is what you can listen to. AFI fits your every mood. So don't be afraid to buy this new album of theirs as well as their old. I suggest you go out and buy Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes if you don't have that already. That album is sure to bring you some good times! So go out there and buy any AFI album...NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"A.F.I.'s Sing the Sorrow is a great album. I would describe their music as a new and intersting hybrid: goth-punk. I bought this CD because I heard their song 'Girl's Not Grey' on the radio and I liked their sound. If you like that song you will like the rest of the album becuase they maintain the same atmosphere. Their music is crisp, memorable and interesting. They have a real sense of music instead of mindless axe grinding like other bands. Thier lead singer has a haunting, tragic and angst-ridden voice that goes well with their origional music."},{"rating":"1","title":"sing the sorrow=sad story","review":"i was a big fan of AFI prior to the release of 'sing the sorrow'. their jump to mainstream has totally influenced their music in an MTV sort of way. one song even has a techno-ish interlude. i'd say there are two, maybe three songs worth listening to for the true AFI fan. if you wanna catch them in their prime, go buy 'black sails' or 'art of drowning'. 'shut your mouth' is really good too. but 'sing the sorrow'? all i can say is they shoulda stuck it out with Nitro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh..","review":"I got this CD from my friend for my birthday, but I really don't like it that much. I've given it a chance and I think it's boring. All of the songs just drown together. I could be listening to this CD for 20 minutes and be thinking, \\"This is a really long song. When will the 2nd song start..?\\" The only time I can hear a difference between the songs are if it is a song I have heard on the radio like \\"Girls Not Grey\\" or \\"Silver and Cold.\\" Sing the Sorrow hasn't been in my CD player for months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is AFI","review":"After hearing some of the said album claimed to be made by AFI. I have come to beleive that the real AFI was kidnapped and replaced by another band. So where is the real AFI people?Oh, the album blew and reminded me of the crap major \\"punk\\" bands like Good Charolote would make. Do yourself and save your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"This album is truly sad...I then heard this CD. The sound is so tailored to appeal to the masses that it's pathetic. Where's the edge and intensity of the old AFI? You won't find it here. I haven't even been a longtime fan and I can recognize that they sold out. Before, their style was unique, and now they are becoming just like all of the other...bands that you hear on the radio and see on MTV. It really is a shame, and they'll likely alienate most of their true (original) fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good CD, but its just not AFI.","review":"This is a good CD, many great songs that are dark and mysterious in their own cool little ways. AFI after Shut your mouth and open your eyes became much more serious. If you listen to Decemberunderground and than to Answer that. You couldnt really tell any similarities between the two. Not even Havok's voice sounds the same. But whatever it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOD!","review":"I was never a huge AFI fan until warped tour '03. they had main stage, and it was beyond amazing! they stole the tour with a little 30 minute performance! the next day i ran and got this cd, and i was just as impressed as the day before. it starts out so good and you can sit through this listening to every song again and again and it never gets old! beyond amazing! if you ever have the chance to see AFI, do it and you will love them that much mroe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AFI in general","review":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!! i was shocked when i heard this cd after i bought it. i saved up all my money and i was excited for afi's new cd. and i was [ticked] off. this cd was terrible. i knew change was coming with afi like all bands, but this was unexpected. songs like \\"girls not grey\\" are just boring radio-tunes. and this cd just doesn't compare to afi's older work...dreamworks records, is it all for the money. your not a big name band, do it for the fans. i suggest that afi go rediscover their former selves, cause sing the sorrow isn't acceptable to go along with all of their older work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing the Sorrow Review","review":"This AFI cd was awesome. Not only did it have great lyrics, but also a really cool mood to it. Davey Havok's voice really stood out on this CD, and many of the songs are alot darker than their past albums. I reccomend this CD to anyone who is either new or a long time fan of AFI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing the Sorrow, sings greatness","review":"5 STARS *****Alright guys, after listening to the new A.F.I album, \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" for several hours, i have come to the conclusion that A.F.I is getting better by age. \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" surpasses anything else they've done in the past. Musically they have gotten amazing. The new guitar sounds, the bass riffs and the drum beats compliment each other on every song. The incorporation of different styles of rock and even a hint of techno beats on the track \\" Death of Seasons\\" is nothing short of awesome. On this album they continue reavealing their soft side as they did with \\"Morning Star\\" on their previous album \\" The Art Of Drowning.\\" They just bring out the acoustic guitar and just do what they do best... make great music.I recommend this album to all rock fans out there. You guys have to go pick up this masterpiece. It really shows why music is an art form"},{"rating":"2","title":"another masterpiece","review":"it is really disappointing when people always look for negatives to point out. if this exact album was released on nitro records instead of dreamworks everyone's reviews would say this is a.f.i's best album yet. i have been listening to a.f.i. for quite some time, and i don't hear anything in this album that leads me to think that they have changed their philosophy or style since moving to a larger label. the songs are still upbeat and have very memorable chorus'. the reason that i am only giving the album 4 stars is because it is not quite as good as \\"the art of drowning\\". instead of being so critical of these guys try being proud of them for getting some long overdue exposure.standout songs: leaving song pt. II, dancing through sunday, and girl's not grey"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"The major label debut from AFI, Sing the Sorrow, is absolutely amazing.I would highly recommend this album to not only any new or old AFI fan, but anyone who is a fan of great music. Sing The Sorrow, with upbeat tracks such as \\"Girls not Grey\\", which is currently a radio hit, the old forever immortal AFI sound is brought up through tracks such as \\"Paper Airplanes (makeshift wings)\\" and \\"Death of Seasons\\" these are all amazing songs. on a scale of 1-10 i would give this album a 100. It is truly up-liftng and beautiful and filled with inspirational music and messages...."},{"rating":"2","title":"ha, first review","review":"this album kills all. get it, for god's sake!!! I swear, you won't be disappointed.standout tracks include The Leaving Song Part II, death of Seasons, and ...but home is nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good evolution","review":"I know this album has been under the spotlight for a good while, with high expectations. It does, in all ways, live up to that. It isn't the same AFI as previous albums, but the evolution of the band's sound, gets better and better, as time goes by. Gone, are the days of street-punk sounding very proud of ya, and answer that and stay fashionable. Davey Havok's vocals have gotten better and better. If you're the \\"old school\\" fan of the early stuff and aren't open to change, then this album definately isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT NOW","review":"This cd is more than WHat I expected. I liked afi alrerady and had all their old stuff butthis one stands alone. Its not your avaerage record what so ever, and if you like afi already you will be pleasantly surprised. I haven't taken it out of my cd player yet and doubt I will anytime soon. Plus all the extras hiddent and stufftoo make it worth the money by far. If you are going to buy one album in the near future Sing the Sorrow should be that album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"$ing the $orrow","review":"Even though AFI appears to have sold out,one needs to look past that and appreciate the awesomeness of this record. There is not a single weak track on this album, from the Skinny Puppy-like opening track to catchy sing-a-long anthems like \\"Girls not Grey\\" and \\"Bleed Black\\". So while many AFI purists will no doubt be dissapointed, fans of Blink-182, Sum-41, Good Charlotte and New Found Glory will rejoice.The only thing that keeps this record from getting 5 stars is that it is still a notch below AFI classics like \\"Black Sails in the Sunset\\" and \\"AllHallows e.p.\\". Those records get 5 stars, this one gets 4.My advice: Just buy this album. It somehow manages to be atmospheric, dark, gloomy, and upbeat all at once and is chock-full of catchy songs that will stick in your head for weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take A Look At History","review":"\\"Sing the Sorrow\\" was a bold new step for this once little known band. You can tell alot of hard work was put into this album. I know thas it is differrent. I know it doesn't sound like old AFI but if you really take a look they have progressively been changing with each new album. I am very impressed with the direction they are going and can't wait to hear more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Rock!!","review":"From this CD you can see what AFI is all about. This are awsome in the CD. This is better than their perivous ones. You might not like it when you first listen to it...but the second time you listen to it. It gets better and better. This is what happened to me. The CD starts out with \\"Miseria Cantare (The Beginning)\\" My favorite is \\"Girl's Not Grey.\\" \\"Bleed Black\\" has a catchy choruses. This is CD Rock!!! Go get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"i usually don't listen to punk..but this was great!","review":"A friend of mine just recently introduced me to A.F.I. and i loved what i heard!this cd is great and i'd recommend it to anyone who loves any form of rock.take a listen for yourself..get this album!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacularly Cool","review":"the album is so cool i couldn't stop listening to it... it forms an entire new way of listening to music..."},{"rating":"2","title":"afi Rocks!","review":"this is an album that everyone should get.The lead singer expresses himself with such miraculous words,that your inspired by him.I think everyone should get this cd cause it has awesome songs.This band been around for such a long time that i think everyone shoud just listen to one song at least.I bet you'll all feel the way i do bout them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing the Sorrow the Best of AFI","review":"To start things off, AFI has been around for sometime. I agree that this is very different from their last few albums but its a good different. They are the same style of lyrics but a different beat. They have a 5 sec part of techno but thats a just a little, so I don't know what the heck that guy was thinking. If you like Emo and little hardcore you can read the lyrics and tell what Davy Havok is talking about. The vocals are the best I have heard since the lead singer of Queen. Don't get me wrong the lead singer of Queen is the best. This is hard punk it isn't \\"goth\\" it isn't \\"goth rock\\" (whatever that it is). If you are going to buy on Cd for the year this is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A more pleasant type of 'sorrow'","review":"Although this isn't an album I would proclaim to be one of my all-time favorites, it's nice to listen to. Two-and-a-half stars would be more accurate, but I do not have the liberties to give albums halves. :) At times, Davey Havoc is difficult to understand because his voice can get extremely nasaly. As far as standouts, I especially like the intro track along with the singles: \\"Girl's Gone Grey\\", \\"The Leaving Song Part II\\", and \\"Silver And Cold\\". Many of the others are unmemorable and just boring. I wouldn't recommend this entire album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"This album is just alright. There are a few good songs, but most of the songs sound too much alike. The vocals can get annoying after listening to them for a while. In my opinion the best song on this CD is probably Silver and Cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"sing the sorrow","review":"this album is amazing. After all the brilliant music that AFI have brought us up until now, i was expecting the vary best, and that is what i got. The album is intense from start to finish and completely satisfies your musical needs. This album should be in EVERYONES collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album is a little dark","review":"I have been an AFI fan for several years now, and I really didnt know what to think when I learned they were about to make their major label debut. On the plus side, more people do get to hear their music through avenues such as the radio and the dreaded MTV. If this CD is any indication, the band sticks to their roots while still evolving into a deeper, and although i dont like to say it, gothic sound. It is refreshing to hear more vocal range at times, something that I thought was missing on \\"The Art of Drowning\\". If you already own the album, check out \\"Black Sails at Sunset\\" to hear what I believe to be AFI at their best. This album does rock however, and now cements AFI into mainstream rotation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing the Sorrow","review":"This Album is one of the greatest of all time, Davey sings in this cd, it is not just screaming like in the cd's such as very proud of ya, and those earlier ones. I mean i cried when i first heard it, it is so emotional and cool, i like dr dre too, that is a good punk musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing The Sorrow","review":"Alright ... This CD was pretty good ... The lyrics really have meaning and they're really deep . In this CD , they've returned with a new style . They're not as fast and not as hard anymore . Instead , the lead vocalist has slowed down a little bit and lowered his voice . The band hasn't changed that much either . My favorites are \\" Girls Not Grey \\" and \\"Paper Airplanes\\" . I am a new fan and I was expecting most of the tracks to be similar to the first single off the album \\"Girls Not Grey \\" , but only a portion of the albums songs had the same vibe . The rest of the tracks were a mix of their old sound and their new sound . Just buy this album , and you won't be dissapointed ."},{"rating":"2","title":"AFI's Sing the Sorrow","review":"A.F.I.'s Sing the Sorrow is great!! If you haven't even heard of A.F.I. and then read this review, I strongly recommend checking out this cd! Once you hear it you'll be hooked! The boys are great and they put on a good show. I promise that if you check out this cd you will not be disappointed. They have great songs from This Celluloid Dream to Death of Seasons, and the secret song is great too! So what are you waiting for? Go check out A.F.I.'s Sing the Sorrow! You'll also wanna check out some of their other cds. One great song by them is God Called In Sick Today. They are so worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"This album was prodded to me as this hard piece of prog rock and I was ultimately disappointed based on that description.This, at best, would be considered experimental. I've listened to some of AFI's older stuff and this sounds far more matured than anything else, and they seem to embrace different stylings.\\"Death of Seasons\\" comes to mind first and foremost. How many post-punk bands pull off that level of industrial dabbling so succesfully?Anyone who appreciates punk, rock, and experimental music should pick themselves up this album. It will get plenty of spins, trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Record In Many Years","review":"This record is the best album I have heard in more than 3+ years (since the The Living End's, Roll On). Almost every song makes you feel good about music and what music is supposed to be; uplifting, inspirational and it makes you want to drive fast. The song writing is excellent and the dynamics are fascinating. The production quality is very interesting; it is muddy and sounds squashed keeping true to the band's roots but considering Butch Vig's (Smashing Pumpkins: Gish, Siamese Dream) prowess for clean drum sounds, punchy bass and crescendo guitar riffs, it reminds me of the difference between Robert \\"Mutt\\" Lang's production differences between AC/DC's Highway to Hell and Def Leppard's High and Dry. This is certainly a great rock and roll record. If you don't like this record you truly don't understand what punk, rock or metal is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD but not that great","review":"This is easily one of the best cd's of 2003 if not the best.But compared to other great AFI hits like The Art of Drowning and Black Sails into the Sunset.Some songs in this cd are very weak.Like This Celluloid Dream and Silver and Cold. The only reason you know its afi is becuase of Davey's voice.I recomend getting the UK version with the bonus track Synthesthesia and Now the World.Those songs are pretty good.Summary:Good cd but compared to othe afi cd's, not that good.but still go out and get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sellout society","review":"Its strange.

Not so with 'Why Did the Underwear Cross the Road', and other attempts to chronicle pre-adolescent life.Even at their age I found it difficult to identify with any of the characters in such books, and now, several years since, I am still decidedly reluctent to re-read these books, although I routinely re-read such classics as 'Losing Joe's Place' or 'This Can't be Happening at MacDonald Hall'. Do yourself a favor. Buy one of his better books, or if you are in the situation where I was when I read this book, having already read just about all of the rest of Gordon Korman's stuff, find another author. Might I suggest Jules Verne? Very good stuff, and quite timeless I might add."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent listening","review":"This intermezzo collection is an outstanding selection for someone looking to listen to quiet, restful and relaxing piano music.

It is inaccurate, and in my opinion, another hollywood flop in the serial killer genre. I've read quite a bit about BTK and this movie omits the beginning of his career as a serial killer. The movie starts way after the original killings that occured in the 70's, and doesn't touch on his days at ADT or his beginnings.

I totally did not see that coming. The twist near the end of this book totally surprised me -- something that doesn't happen too often, and even less so in kids' books. Adventure, excitement, and some sneakily wrapped in morality lessons -- all in all a great, fun series especially good for reluctant readers -- mostly boys, but great for adventure-loving girls, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic! love it!","review":"i read the first book and wouldn't stop nagging my mom to get the second one! i am so glad i did because this book is phenomenal!i am not done yet but, holy cow, this book is AWESOME! i found the first one in a book club and thought it was just another book, but is wasn't! i love these books and for an author who doesn't usually write for kids, she sure knows what they like!if you are looking for a book for a book report or your kids report tell them about it (they might want you to get the series, just so you know!). you have to, have to read it (but read the 1st book before this one it will make more sense!)! i would most definately recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane","review":"Perfect follow up to the previous book.

This would make a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by Suzanne Collins!","review":"This is another great book in the Underland Chronicles. This one is about the Prophecy of Bane. Gregor is sent to kill The Bane, but that's when everyone thaught that the Bane was an over-sized rat that doomed the Underland. So, Gregor is sent on a long, dangerous journey to drain its light. Gregor does not kill the Bane, and he gives it to Ripred. Since I do not want to give away what happens, I will not say anymore. If you've read the last book, you will probaly remember the mentioning of another prophecy. Well, that was the Prophecy of Bane. I wish that the author would write more than 5 of these wonderful books. I would recommend for you to read Gregor the Overlander before reading this one. If this reveiw hasn't encouraged you to buy this, read the other reveiws! This book is one of my favorite books and always will be. I can't wait for the fifth Gregor book to come out.

I was reading to review for my children and am loving the series for myself. Interesting characters, intriguing concept, action-packed adventure. I think the book has even caused me to be a little less hateful towards cockroaches...but not rats. Love it for adults and children - mine are 8 and I think I will they will enjoy the series as well, although I would probably not recommend it for younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragedy","review":"This book was great. It had adventure and action beyond belief. Warning: Contents contain extreme violence. But it was also a tragedy. Some charatcters you may have loved from Gregor the Overlander are killed off, not to mention charaters who were created in this book die. Suzane Colins didn't go as heavy on the tragedy portion in the last book. Characters died and all but all of them were either minor, unintresting or the bad guy. In The Prophecy of Bane a bat is killed along with a roach and a human and her bat. It is great but a real tragedy.

I was bored of watching television in my spare time, so I decided to take a chance on Circle at Center. I'm glad I did. This book did take some time getting used to with all the moving around, and fast paced plots, but once over that hurdle, it gets quite good. I have finished the whole series, and I believe that by far it is the best series that I have read- so far... I think it was a good blend of romance, action, lust, disgust, and a little bit of comedy. Sufficed to say, it will remain on my bookshelf for all to see and inquire about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never rises above a cliche","review":"In addition to other criticisms about the book, I'd like to add that the world that Niles has created really doesn't make any sense. He has slapped to together a bunch of fantasy staples such as elves, druids, dwarves, etc. without much regard to how they arrived or fit in his world. Things are exist because he wrote it -- no internal logic is necessary.Terry Pratchett's Discworld books make much more sense -- and we're talking about a parody where that world rests on the back of a giant space-faring turtle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky Prose","review":"I did not care for Nile's style of writing. I felt like the prose was a huge distraction, and I kept \\"tripping\\" over his writing voice. It wasn't as bad as the Ill Made Mute, but just as annoying. Basically, it was not fun to read. things that usually is a staple in books I do not finish reading is noticing the writing style more than the story. I did so with this book. I will probably never read another Niles book because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Having read Niles' Watershed Trilogy many years ago, I was more than sure that Circle at Center would be just as good. The whole concept behind the seven circle realm was good, not excellent, but good. However, the concept of \\"bad Christian vs. good Goddess\\" was a little too melodramatic for my taste. I liked it, but he could have not made it so expected.Even though the plot tends to wander off at some points, Niles still pulls it all together, leaving the reader wanting more.However, I was slightly disappointed in the ending, which did not make too much sense. Still, I do think that it is a good read and one that I shall want to finish with the two remaining books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The shallow circle","review":"Niles' concept of the different realms layered around each other is an interesting one. And his portrayal of the different beings (elves, drwarves, airies, etc.) is also good. However his character development is far to shallow and his imagry poor. He did not exploit the full potential of this story; it could have been much more. In addition, Niles seems to have a fixation on gore and sex which are used inappropriately (in my opinion) in the book. His use of sex in the beginning of the book added no value. His dwelling of the gore of the arcane Delver is as close to deep character development that he gets (which isn't very deep)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best books eva!","review":"This book was one of the most interesting books that I've eva read b4!

Being able to see the actual cars is hardly exciting after 5 minutes and it hogs system performance. I was really hoping for an intellegent game not just pretty graphics. Also this game is not a challenge. It is so easy to make money espeacially on full speed.

Trust me you will like SC4 better. You can import your sims and the game has a whole new 3D engine.This game needs a bit of improvement. The fires are a bit yuck. And the buildings need some help.

Sure, Simcity 3000 is good for a while with it's catchy graphics and innovative approach to buidling a city, but a few hours later, you'll either want to fall asleep or put your fist through the monitor, depending upon whether the income for your city is positive or negative for each game year. I turned out to be one of the latter people. No matter how hard I tried, I could never get the income to come out positive. So, I did what any distraught and stuck person would do...go online for cheat codes! An hour later, I was bored. If you're a thinker, by all means try Simcity 3000 out.
