I can't believe how much it picked up - especially dog fur. It's easy to empty the bagless chamber, and the vacuum cleans up to the edge of the vacuum on baseboards. Really works well.The only downside is that the onboard tools don't extend very far from the vacuum - I would like an add-on hose to allow you to clean more than 4 feet from the vacuum. Otherwise, it's great!I was concerned about the pushing weight since it's not self-propelled, but it wasn't a problem for me at all.If you want a good, basic vacuum that's easy to put together and use, but has the bagless feature, I recommend this unit.NOTE: added 1 year later - we go through a belt about every 6 months or so. If you start to smell burning and it's not picking up well, it's time for a new belt. Fortunately, they're inexpensive and easy to replace."},{"rating":"2","title":"What did my last vacuum do?","review":"We didn't know if we really needed a new vacuum cleaner, but we grew tired of buying replacement bags ( that we had to special order cause the vacuum was so old). After using our new Hoover for the first time we realized what we were missing. What had our old vacuum cleaner been picking up? It picked up so much more dirt than our old vacuum and you can tell when it needs to be emptied. A very good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really good at first, then it became the worst vacuum ever","review":"I had one of these until yesterday. When I first got it, I thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. But after a while the thing started to suck, not the way vacuums should. Basically to sum it up this vac is poorly designed. The dirt cup slides in and locks into place, but it never fits tight enough to prevent all the dirt from escaping. As a result a lot of dirt and dust goes everywhere. I returned it and got a bag one...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hoover disappointment","review":"We bought this vacuum after getting married and getting our new house. Although it picked up a lot of dirt (the thing was full after vacuuming our 2 bedroom apartment!), it was an absolute pain to empty. The filter was always dirty, and the canister was not easy to empty. There was always remaining residue, and we generally ended up getting the dirt everywhere.The kicker was that the belt broke, and we have only had the vacuum for seven months. We are planning on returning this one and getting a different, cheaper vacuum that is hopefully less trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs repair after a year","review":"A little more than a year after I purchased this vacuum, it's eating the belts. I was offered the extended warranty by the salesperson, who commented, \\"I've seen the repair rates on these.\\" Alas, I declined. As another reviewer has mentioned, this vacuum is always covered in dust. Given a choice now, I'd waste a bit of paper and buy a bag model. Finally, I regret not looking for a vacuum without a HEPA filter since it's another thing to clean and buy. I'm not so obsessed with what's in my carpet that I need one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Yourself!!!","review":"Today the vacuum cleaner started smelling of burnt rubber. I discovered the belt was broken. After reading the reviews below I guess this will be a common problem. The bagless design is a terrible mess when it comes to emptying the chamber.

I bought it because I thought there would be a real advantage to having a bagless vacuum with a HEPA filter. Having allergies, less exposure to dust is very important. I quickly realised that using this vacuum actually makes exposure to dust much more a problem! When I use it, I can actually see dust collecting outside the lid rim of the canister. Just to be sure that I wasn't doing anything wrong, I checked and rechecked how I had the placement of the lid and the canister after an emptying (it really is a straight forward proceedure). Even changing the canister every vacuum session has not stopped this problem. And don't bother trying to pick up the vacuum by the handle if it's running. Dust will really shoot out into the air. Emptying the canister is just plain awful. You have to hold your breath while you are doing it. Save your money and don't buy this vacuum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it for a Hoover","review":"Very surprised at how disappointed we are with this machine. After reading other reviews, I have the same exact complaints. Terrible on hard floors (spits dust and particles back out), horrendous to empty (be sure you are outside, it is truly a mess.) There is a layer of dirt/dust on the outside of the machine constantly (even after you empty and wipe it down, after the next vacuuming-it is filthy again). My real issue lies with the \\"Hepa filter\\" selling point of this machine, it actually causes MORE dirt and dust to release into the air than a \\"Non-hepa\\" filter machine, so whats the point? I expected this machine to be very good, not the best as I know Hoover has better models. But, I would take my old \\"bag of dirt\\" vacuum over this bagless model anyday. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like it","review":"I bought mine last week and so far so good. I also have [another]bagless and the dirt clings around the filter in the canister I had to use a chop stick to get into the canister to clean it out, the Hoover I just take the top off and all the dirt falls into the garbage the mess from the Hoover is nothing compared to the [other one]. The only thing in comparing the two that I like about the [other one] better was that when I an going around furniture the Hoover does not turn as easily, except for that I like the Hoover alot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"near worthless","review":"It's amazing that a company whose rep is based on it's vacuums would sell such a unit. When I had to go over the areas I vacuumed in order to pick up what was remaining on the floor, what use was it except for the possible dust that was found in the container? When approaching Hoover about this, their recommendation was to return the unit. So I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design","review":"Once i used mine for a while i notice it had a lot of design problems. The Hepa filter is not where it should be. It is inside the canister where it serves no purpose. It should be attached to the exaust where all the air comes out. The filter hoover has put on there is a small mesh type screen. You can wash it out but it is not going to stop any pollen or dust mites. Also beware, if it doesn't say TRUE Hepa then its not the same thing. The height adjustment nob is quite flimsy and has broken off a few times. The drive belt has also broken 3 times and i had to replace it. There are better choices out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"No suction power, makes a mess","review":"I've had this vacuum for over a year because I spent $200 on it, but I've had enough and will finally give it the boot. It's a mess to empty, a pain to clean the filter's 100 crevices. On a bare floor you can just see the dirt being pushed in front of the vac or coming out the back. I've held up the hose one inch from a single dog hair, it will not pick it up. On top of that it's heavy and loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality unlike Hoover~","review":"We purchased this vacuum based on the performance in the store. We liked the idea of seeing what was being picked up. However we did notice in the store the display model was covered with a layer of dirt/dust. When we questioned wether this was normal we were assured it wasn't. Well lets say this was extremely common and we found our cleaner looking just like the display within a very short time. Because of it's power and suction we decided to live with it and wipe the cleaner down often. We also find that if you go down a small step while the cleaner is running it blows dust everywhere. The filter and the canister are disasterous to clean as well. It seems as though we handle dirt more with the bagless then we ever did with our previous cleaners. Unfortunatly this is one vacuum I'd never reccomend and regret purchasing it. Needless to say we are now looking for a less hassle cleaner vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea if you only vacuum up marbles...","review":"This vacuum is awful. We recieved it as a wedding gift and have used it for a while. Bagless vacuums are a bad, bad idea. If you have pet hair or dust in your home it will all fly back out at you when you empty the canister.I've found that this vacuum does not adequately pick up pet hair, even when I go over the same spot many times.

However, it covers a lot of ground and does it in a way that is easy to read. It introduces key concepts right at the beginning then it goes into assessment, indications and formulation. The next two chapters cover the nuts and bolts of psychotherapy and the role of the therapist. As a whole, the text does a great job of covering the end-to-end therapeutic process.There are a lot of books on this topic, but this one is very clear, well-organized and covers the most important topics in just enough detail.

In the case of both math and science, it is easy to become mired in the use of formulas, endless equations and memorization, and to lose sight of the big picture, and how facinating the subject matter can be. The cartoon guides in general cover a lot of material but keep things relatively simple, illustrate (literally) concepts with pictures and utilize a good deal of humor to hold your interest. This particular book has been quite enjoyable and funny at times. It is not always easy. It took me a while to feel I had a grasp of meiosis.

You certainly won't agree with all the selections but most of the films are either potential or acknowledged classics. The writers generally present easy to read assessments of each film, and only on the odd occasion do there reviews drift towards the highbrow.This is a much nicer volume to own than say a Halliwells film guide as the reviews are longer and better to read and the quality of the printing/paper is of an equally high standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"high quality","review":"This sumpwell cover is very high quality and is heavy duty the way it is constructed.

Hugely influenced by Dizzy Gillespie and to a large extent still playing very much like his mentor would have played (and indeed did as he also recorded for the same series of albums with Peterson).Oscar Peterson of course in the mid 70's was still in his prime, and his playing on this album is as good as you will hear, outside of a few other exceptional albums (like Tracks to name but one). This album was recorded in June 1975 and has a running time of 46:29 over its 6 tracks.You can tell from this that the musicians have plenty of time to stretch out.

What would happen if there had been a kidnapping of a young scion of a very wealthy family in Venice where the victim was never recovered? What would happen if years later his body was discovered by a farmer tilling a field far away from where the kidnapping took place? How would the mystery be solved?It's a terrific premise for a novel. Unfortunately, Leon takes the book down the path to a resolution that stretches credulity, something very unusual for her. Additionally, there are a few 'tells' early which are out of place enough to really catch the reader's eye.However, the book does have Venice, Guido Brunetti and his wonderful family, and the constant duality of Venice; beautiful on the surface (and thus the book's title) and corrupt to its core. Leon handles them with her usual aplomb.So while this is a bit of a slip for her, it's still an enjoyable book.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I remember being a kid and seeing this record in Sears and wanting it so much--the cover looked really neat, and I did like the Beatles and all the solo projects.

Also, the versions of \\"Letting Go,\\" which appears as track 3 (why?) and \\"Rock Show\\" sound like remixes or something. They're not the album versions, that's for sue. FOr all of that, the album's triumph, the linked pair of \\"Listen to What the Man Said\\" and \\"Treat Her Gently,\\" sounds positively magnificent. The latter track particularly benefits from the 5.1 mix: the orchestra plays throughout here, with luscious harps and cellos buried in the original mix.

The same mess happened with the so called dts for Band on the Run. This never should have been released with such a poor remix. Now we know why quadraphonic never caught on and I believe Paul doesn't even know this crappy sound even exists because heads would roll if he heard this.For the record I would rate Venus and Mars 5 stars for the normal stereo mix.

It didn't have much of a plot and no offense, but I can't say I found it too interesting. The only reason I'm reading it right now is because I have to do a science-fiction book report and it's due soon so I can't really get another book. As you can see, I'm not a big fan of science-fiction. I was reading it and I'd gotton into the middle of the of the third part, when I was like,\\"oh my god, I have no clue what the story is about!\\" and so I ended up starting all over again from the beginning.

This ball is gentle to the dogs teeth, bounces so the person throwing it doesn't have to throw as far, and he loves to catch it in the air on a bounce. The ball also floats which has saved us a couple of times. The blue color is easy to see in the outdoors, so it's easy to find if the dog gets distracted and puts it down. Ramsey chews on the ball and it is the ONLY dog toy that he can't destroy. I was told by our local pet rep that ORKA discontinued this model, and I was crushed.

An orphan, he was conscripted into marriage and into Rasputia's organized crime-like family. It seems there is no escape for Norbit, until a fellow orphan returns to purchase the orphanage. She and Norbit were childhood sweethearts, and her appearance revitalizes him. But will Rasputia stand for the interloper? To what lengths will she go to keep her hold on her husband?Murphy really understands each one of his characters, so much so that it is scary. How can he have the p.o.v. of an obese, abusive woman? An eccentric Chinese man? (Yes, he plays the orphanage caretaker as well). But he does. The film is not just funny, but even somewhat inspiring.

Eddie Murphy does it again by performing as multiple characters in one movie.

I have never seen anything more disturbing, more disgusting than this movie. The portrayal of obesse women is sickening. Most of the jokes in the film are horrifying. There is the dreadful scene where Rasputia attempts to run the neighbor's dog over, resulting with the dog being crippled. Rasputia also threatens to burn kate with acid. The movie is not funny but an ugly portrayal of society. The only good parts in the movie were Kate and Norbit playing wedding as kids and actually getting married as adults. Never watch this movie.

It's just the way each character is played that gives me doubts about what was Murphy thinking!?!?There were so many ways to play a \\"dumb\\" main role and they chose the most annoying one.It's difficult to follow the dialogs.

Norbit is an endearing charicature that you immediately fall in love with and root for thoughout the film. Norbit is the ultimate underdog so there has to be adversity, albeit stereotypical to some viewers at times, to show us that no matter how great the odds are stacked, that being true to yourself is the only way to true happiness.

As usual, my wife was correct. This movie stunk. It is not funny or interesting. The characters play to all the same stereotypes.

Can't the writers come up with new material???The emphasis and where they went wrong with this movie is simple - it all comes down to makeup and fat suits. No substance, all makeup.The script is lame, the jokes can be seen coming a mile away. It just doesn't work. The commercials/trailers show the best scenes and make it seem like it is hilarious.

You can predict every fat black woman stereotype a minute before it actually occurs on screen. And as for those who are wowwed by the whole multiple-character thing Murphy does, it's really not that novel of an idea. He's done it many times before, and really it's not that impressive. The man's an actor, he should be able to play different characters! It's kind of the definition of his job.More reminiscent of \\"Pluto Nash\\" than any of Eddie Murphy's good movies, Norbit is a dismal failure that I am embarrassed to have seen.

I works wonderfully well, 'refreshing' worn portions of heavy traffic carpet areas as well as removing virtually all spots. Our puppy got a hold of a paint pen one day, and punctured it. When I got home, there was silver paint all over the couch and the floors. Within 15 minutes, after using the handheld part of the steamcleaner, 95% of the paint had disappeared! I went over the same areas again the next day and ALMOST ALL of the paint is now gone.

The problem was that that dirt and hair (that the vacuum cleaner missed) would clog the machine in multiple locations, some of which could be disassembled and cleaned by the consumer. Thankfully, we now have hardwoods. I would recommend researching area dealers to find out if these can be professionally serviced (cleaned out) by someone in your area. I can't even detect where all the gunk lies that causes the carpet cleaner to stop sucking up the water it discharges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great carpet cleaner","review":"Only reason I gave it 4 in stead of 5 stars is due to the size of the dirty water container. Seems like you have to unloadthe dirty water quite often for the size area that you are cleaning. Other than that note the carpet cleaner is fantastic.If you have a dog coming in and out from the dirty winter snow this machine is a must. I have had my carpets cleaned professionally for years and for the price of one cleaning you can get this cleaner and it does just about as good of a job as the profesionals.The quality of the cleaner is very good, it feels very solid and well built. For anyone with light colored carpets that have pet(s) and often paid a lot to have the carpets cleaned by someone else, I would highly recommend this cleaner. Don't be fooled however that the cleaning is effortless.

It took out stains that had been in my rug for a while! After using it a few times it stopped distributing water. Still under waranty we took it back to the store. We waited about 2 weeks to get it back and used it again. It seemed to work well again. After a few more times of using it I noticed that it is not sucking the water out of the carpet anymore. When I empty the tank it is still full of clean water and hardly any dirty water is around the bladder. Of course several of the plastic handles broke off just as stated in the other reviews. I am so furious at Bissel for ripping off its customers like that. This is NOT a cheap machine and there are obviously too many problems with the engineering of this product. This should almost be treated like factory defects with cars where they pay for all the costs associated with repairs because these are not isolated incidents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny","review":"In the past I have paid to have my carpets cleaned, but I thought for the price I pay for a professional cleaning I could buy one of these.

I have spent over $300 before to have my whole house cleaned and treated for stains. I spent less than that on this machine and I can clean whenever I want and still have Scotchguard protection by using Bissell's chemicals and the special accessory tools.

I called Bissell and they said I did everything right and that if it happened again take it to a service center. After getting that fixed, I tried to open the top of one of the little tools and the cheap plastic also broke, another $. I can't believe this product hasn't been recalled. A very poor product. I should have rented a rug doctor for only $ and I would be ahead $. It cleans good, but it is of poor quailty. I would not suggest this product to anyone.

The machine has stopped working completely. Does not spray water, does not heat and handle lock has broken off. I wasted over $200.00 on this machine and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Bissell needs to recall this machine and take responsibility for their mistake. IF YOU ARE IN THE MARKET TO PURCHASE A CARPET CLEANER, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ONE!!! I was told by a vacume repairman of over 48 years that had seen his share of Bissells come through his shop - go with HOOVER instead, because (1) they have a much better track record and (2) they are much easier to find parts for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"It worked great for 2 years.

From the other reviews, it sounds like the customer service over at Bissell leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly prone to failure","review":"We purchased one of these units a couple years ago now. We used it all of 5 times over the last 2 years and it broke down 3 of those 5 times. Two of those breakdowns required us to go out and rent a unit to finish the job.The main problem with them is the cheap plastic parts used for the beater bar mechanism. This is the major mechanical work area and is subject to stress, heat and friction that is simply incompatible with plastic parts.The very first time we used it, the plastic gear that meshes with the belt stripped and it had to be replaced (under the warranty fortunately). The 3rd time we used it, the belt broke and we replaced it ourselves with the included spare. The 5th and last time we used it, the swing arm that holds the beater bar melted and welded itself to the beater bar. Both had to be replaced. This is a 60% failure rate! So I highly advise you look elsewhere for a carpet cleaner. I wouldn't recommend this thing to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time...go with the Hoover!","review":"We bought the Bissell ProHeat thinking it would be great. The first problem is the tank in tank storage. The seal on the bottom broke within the first month we had it. After contacting Bissell they informed me that I could buy a new tank for $17. I bought that and it was leaking after 2 months. Not to mention that the tank is hard to empty and get fully clean. There was always dirt and junk left in the tank!! About that time I started noticing that the machine was leaving pieces of black plastic on the carpet. The machine was chewing up it's own gears and not doing a thing for my carpet. We have white carpet, a naughty dog, and a one year old child so we are very dependant on our steam cleaner. We ditched the Bissell and purchased a Hoover. I am more than pleased with the new machine. It is easy to use, easy to clean, stays clean, and gets our carpet cleaner than the Bissell ProHeat ever did. I would never consider a Bissell product again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great until cheap plastic parts break","review":"I was thrilled with this machine for about 10 uses, - it cleans great and the carpet was almost completely dry when I was finished. Today, after vacuuming the whole house and moving furniture in preparation for carpet cleaning, I discovered that a chintzy little plastic part that holds the belt that drives the brush broke. You can't replace just that part, even though it is easily removed. The entire machine has to be disassembled to replace the entire pump assembly! Bissell says it has to go to a service center to get the work done. That is 1.5 hours away from me! I talked to the service center, and they will sell me the parts for $40, but assured me that disasembling the entire machine will drive me crazy. The service center's advice was never buy a Bissell, buy a Hoover instead! That is what I plan to do, because this machine is full of other plastic parts just waiting to break."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy drive gear on brush","review":"The drive gear for the brush is very small and plastic.

The spinning brush broke away from its support and the pin and brush support bracket self destructed. The brush stopped spinning. And we returned the cleaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"More trouble than helpful","review":"I bought this machine in hopes of being able to clean my carpets without the hassle of renting a machine or paying someone to clean my carpets. What I got was a machine that completed two rooms, then quit working. By the time, I would have paid for the labor and the parts to repair it, the cost of the machine would have doubled. I'm giving it to a friend that likes to tinker. Maybe he will have better luck with it. I could have had my whole house cleaned twice by a professional for the price of repairing the machine. However, when the machine did work, it did an excellent job. For the kind of money you are paying for a machine, it should be dependable for a much longer period of time.

There were numerous problems I encountered including leaking on the unit when I tried to refill the tank and not being able dispense the cleaning solution.

Into the shop again. I used it once with no issues. Then, on it's third use the same problem came up. Back in the shop. The shop took care of getting me a new vac. On it's first use water came pouring out of the vacuum and wouldn't stop. Back to the shop with the new vac. I used it correctly a couple of times and then the suction stopped. I was furious. I spent hours on the phone with Bissel and they kept telling me they could do nothing. Eventually they gave me a 7920 and assured me the 7920 was less complicated so it should have fewer issues. After it's 7th use (today) the suction stopped working. Please don't waste your money. Even if it costs more, invest in something with higher quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the other reviews - not reliable!","review":"I agree with many of the other reviews -- when this machine works, it does the job fairly well. However, it is not well-built and mine failed just after the warranty ran out, after only 4 uses. Repair is $50 per hour in our area and I don't want to invest more in a machine that I think is not well-engineered or well-made. Consumer Reports rates the Hoover ahead of the Bissell, but just slightly. I'm not sure they have perfected this technology!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"I read all the reviews about how the thing stops working right or breaks after using a few times so I went and bought one at Cost Co where I could take it right back if it didn't work out. I figured that if it cleaned my whole house well more than 3 times it paid for itself and if it lasted longer, great! I was very careful to follow instructions as the reviewers recommend, and I am the only one allowed to use it. Well, it's lasted over a year - I don't know how many times I've cleaned the carpets in that time. I have dogs so it's been plenty. I've done spot cleans and whole rooms and even used it to clean my car upholstery. Works great! I am always amazed at how well it cleans and dries within a reasonable time. The only downside is that I now have no excuse for not getting out the shampooer and cleaning the carpet anytime anyone gets anything on it. Ho, hum, it's TOO useful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did OK then Broke","review":"I originally purchased this machine to keep my new home carpet looking new. We do not have any pets nor do we wear our shoes in the house, but I do live in an area where there is a lot of dust.The Bissell Pro-Tech did an ok job except it left the floor wet and the unit leaked on my tile floor while I was picking up all the cruddy material that it left on my carpet. It has been about a year and my carpets still looks new but the machine has given out-one of the small plastic attachments inside that switches from floor to tools broke off leaving the machine useless. I am now looking to replace it with one of the Hoover cleaner-lots of neighbors have them and their carpets look almost as good as mine except they wear their shoes in the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea ruined by cheap Plastic parts","review":"The first time I used the machine it was GREAT. Then the splastic sprocket that rolls the roller brush broke. Under warranty, no problem. Drove 60 miles to have it fixed, picked it up the following week. Once again, it worked great for the next three uses. Then the same plastic part broke again. No longer under warranty. I think the people who are giving this machine good reviews haven't owned it long enough for the plastic to wear out. Bissell could have a great machine if they wouldn't use such cheap parts. They might find people are willing to pay the higher price for a dependable machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine to own if you have light carpet and kids!","review":"We recently built our first home, and the only carpet color I liked was a very light beige color. Everyone told me I would be sorry because it would be trashed (we have 6 kids). But now whenever someone comes to our door they say, \\"How do you keep your carpet so clean?\\" I open the closet and show them the Bissell. It is a very good cleaner. I like the hose attachment for cleaning up small, localized messes when the whole room doesn't need cleaning. The turbo brush is very good at lifting out many different spills, drips and shoeprints. I like the carpet protectant applicator option, too. It protects the carpet and makes it clean up better the next time. Some of the other reviews talk about how they broke little parts off of the cleaner. I avoided this by reaading the instructions before I used it. It seems to be very durable to me. The cleaner fluid is easy to find at any store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Great until it broke!","review":"First a belt broke after about a dozen uses, which was only the beginning of troubles to come.

It started with leaks from the detergent take, progressed into a cracked plastic housing such that the handle wouldn't stand on its own, and ended with multiple plastic bits on the carpet suction end breaking so as to make it basically unusable. I'm disappointed it only lasted 3 years with maybe 5-6 major usages per year.

Alas, I have fallen into the category of \\"it worked for awhile.\\" For two years I was satisfied with this carpet cleaner. Admittedly, I never loved it. It is very heavy. While you are cleaning a single room that is fine, but if you have to move it up stairs or pick it up to move it around, it is burdensome. Anyway, after two years of \\"it's better than a rental and I don't have to call somebody\\" it stopped working. It no longer sprays.

I was unimpressed with it from the start. The Rug Doctor machines that you can rent at the grocery store are far better. This machine can only get light dirt off the carpet. To get a real stain out you have to use the attachment and scrub. And forget about using the spinning attachment, it all show. You would have better results with a squirt gun and a pin wheel. I've had numerous problems with it from band breaking to the water bladder collapsing. Currently my machine isn't working. It stopped spraying.

I took it back to the service center (now I have driven 60+ miles). The service center said that it was issues with the heater and it couldn't be repaired.

It's no problem getting it out. I do find that I do use alot of cleaner and replace the water often when the carpet is very soiled. As for it being made of plastic...it's a very heavy machine.

Now that \\"Armaghetto\\" has hit the shelves, they are comin' to represent. Their beats are a little more towards the head bounce type, and thier flow goes perfect. They remain with their East Coast style, but bring bouncin beats, and it's a nice change. It's close to commercial sounding, but their lyrics are sweet, not like that Nelly crap, it's a nice mix. 4 stars because of a couple week songs, but overall it's a great LP. Some of my favorites are \\"Respect This\\", \\"Wild Horse\\", \\"F.C.C. Alert\\", \\"Lies and Rumors\\", and the ever so Rocky-ish \\"Wild Out 2K\\".

It is, in my view, one of the best Xanth books ever written, and it gives you a lot of information on the history of Xanth and how Humphry lived it.

He tries to KILL his brother, shows no remorse for his actions, and tries to bring an evil dragon back to life so he would be more powerful, even though it would mean the end of everyone else.

The other ones offer him great power.Now he has a choice: help his family or bring the evil dragon up on a field in England.

This book was a let down. I just couldn't get into the plot. I even found the story somewhat disturbing and eerie, especially for young children to read. There are very evil characters in this book who would be much better suited for an adult sci-fi novel, rather than a book marketed for children and young teens. The characters were unlikeable, and the plot just never seemed to grab my attention. I was very dissapointed that this is from the same author who wrote the amazing Bartimeus trilogy books!

As if that wasn't strange enough, Anne's wearing a fur coat with a leather mini skirt underneath, pumps and spiked hair! Who was she trying to be? Tina Turner?The style and image makeover clearly didn't work and surely didn't last. After this album, Anne went to recording AC music with her next album, \\"As I Am\\".

I was disappointed when I opened the box (which was in good shape, no tears or bent in corners) to find the middle rack 'broken'. It was packed with the cutting board on top, then cardboard, followed by the middle rack and then more cardboard, and the other shelf. It was packed well but the rack was poorly assembled. Winsome had used wood glue and tiny, almost worthless nails to hold the wooden slats to the end support boards, which had come unglued/separated. I question whether the shelf would be able to support anything heavy, such as pots and pans, if this is the way it was constructed. I would not recommend this product if you are going to be using it to hold plates/pots/anything heavy as it may just snap.

I've been borrowing and renting cleaners for the past few years and this one got up stains that have been on the carpet for over a year. I'm in a rental with very cheap carpet that looked absolutely horrible no matter how many times we cleaned it - now it almost looks new.I was very pleased with how easy to use it is. My box was missing the user manual but I was very relieved to find it on [the manufacturers website]along with a lot of cleaning tips in the faq section of their website. The bucket is so easy to refill and replace and I love that you don't have to mix your solution and water. It also does a very good job at sucking up the water - took almost no time to dry after cleaning. I was also glad that it doesn't take a lot of strength to run. I'd say it's comparable to vacuuming - although the unit is heavy compared to a vacuum, it moves nicely on the wheels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with the Hoover Steam Vac instead. . .","review":"I bought this to replace my old Hoover Steam Vac. Big mistake. It is not as sturdy as the Hoover. The latch that keeps the unit in the upright position broke after using only once. The machine leaks water from the tank when first starting it, as well as when you stop it and turn it off. It did have good suction for picking up water, but this machine only had suction when you pulled it towards you (the Hoover's suction works when both pushing and pulling the machine.) The Bissell's heating feature for the water is a nice option, however the \\"tank-in-tank\\" is awkward to use and I had to empty it more often than I did with the Hoover. Additionally, the hard floor attachment is flimsy and almost worthless--it kept falling off and eventually the rubber squeege came off. Needless to say I returned it and purchased a new Hoover.

Rather than attempting to fix it, I bypassed the heater with a piece of my own tubing. It works great now, minus the \\"extra-hot\\" water. If you buy this, use ONLY distilled water in the one gallon tank. The manufacturer should have thought of this.

First the battery will run out fast since the LCD never turns off. I just got this rope so I don't know how long the battery actually lasts but if it never turns off so I suppose it will be dead soon. Second the rope tangles easily. The jelly-ish rope has to be laid out and put books on to make it straight and not tangle. I put books on it and it still tangles on one spot. Third when setting your weight for the counter it starts around 50 and goes up to 360. If you skip your weight you have to press it about 200 times. The numbers only go one way... once it hits 360 then it starts back at 50. I haven't tried to adjust the rope to my size (I've only had it for a day) so I'm not sure if it works easy or not. The plus side is that it counts the number of times you spin the rope and calories you are burning. It's not the best. A regular rope would be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!!!","review":"I love my healthy jump digital jump rope. It gives you a great workout. I felt better after my first jump.

The counter works great so I can progress more and more each time wether I want to do more jumps or burn off more calories. That's where I find the challenge. The only negative I've found with this jump rope is that there's no way to turn it off after you have finished jumping. I've had it a little over 4-weeks and it's been on the whole time.

I have spent 15 minutes looking it over and will probably return it. There is such an incredible amount of information that can be used to optimize using the FS2002 that I expect a legitimate handbook to be produced soon.

In particular, I was looking for detailed information on how to master the Boing aircraft so that I could create a proper flight plan that included climb and descent information that I could then execute in a realistic simulation of a commercial flight. However, I found the book contained very little information that was beneficial to me in this area. A significant portion of the book is spent covering topics already covered in the FS2002 documentation. Very little information is given on how to really use the flight planner and navigation log.

For any experienced flight simmer, it is contains pretty routine information and talks more in generalities than specifics. I was looking more for an \\"extended manual\\" which would offer specific examples how to use each of the features offered with FS2002. For example, ATC, which is virtually left out of this book entirely. Also, there is no index for looking up a quick reference and no keyboard command reference. For my purposes, I was very disappointed in its content.

In particular, I need to find out more info on GPS navigation and using Air Traffic Control (ATC). This book fails miserably to help in these areas. It would have been nice to just include a Gate-to-Gate tutorial flying from say Los Angeles to San Francisco on a large jet and telling you how to set the NAV radios, tell you the correct speed, etc.Nothing like that in this book!

In retrospect, I can see that the B/W at the end of the the serial number-esque title \\"SPECO CVC-57PH/HR B/W\\" probably stands for Black and White. But seriously, in the entire 5 paragraph description, this is _not_ mentioned! In the technical details list it is _not_ mentioned.

Suction power is great, brush picks up a lot of loose fibers and the vaccum is pretty light compared to a Eureka. It is not quiet as advertised but it isn't loud either. The noise is sort of a low pitched whine. The only negative about it is the rubber bumper marks up my walls (I'm a guy so I tend to just push it into the furniture and walls).

This book is written for the woman who truly wants God's will in her life more than she wants her own. Reading it will give you a fresh vision of what it looks like when you choose to trust God.Deb's insights have come from applying these truths in her own life. Through perseverance and dependence on God she models what it means to say forever. Her road was not easy. Her journey was long. Her commitment was found in continually seeking God as the answer to her needs and in doing so she was not disappointed.If you are a woman who finds herself trapped in an seemingly hopeless marriage, then this book is a must read.

His light-hearted turn as the ghostly George Kirby, other-wordly pal and helpmate to banker Cosmo Topper, proved to be a box-office hit and Grant was shortly thereafter working with directors of the caliber of Howard Hawks, George Marshall and Alfred Hitchcock.

If you remember the Mummy films from Universal's 40's series you know what I mean(RIGHT CB? :-D), but at least in those films the Mummy would kind of sneak up to his victims and then grab them. In this film I laughed out loud as this creature movie at a glacier's pace across the room as a woman droped to the ground in horror waiting to be murdered. Hysterical!

Since then I've collected several of his CD's. Now, I feel like I have to get all of them. This one in particular was of interest to me because I'm a guitarist and a huge fan of Pat Martino. It's a fabulous piece of work. Even Martino, who hasn't played particularly well over the last decade, has some bright moments (though his overall performance is uneven, at best). By far, however, this is Eric's show. He'll rip your heart out, and it seems there's no end to his melodic ideas. He makes EVERY song interesting, fresh, and memorable. Harold Mabern is also outstanding, as are Peter Washington and Joe Farnsworth. Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"The First song I heard on this CD was #34 was Sweetness. It has a fairly simple melody, but it is very cool.

Not to mention KRS-one (an emcee worth about 999,999,999,999 Chingy's) is still on Nelly's case.

No matter how I clean it stinks so bad I have to keep it in the garage. The sprayer now just makes litle piddles on the carpet (have owned about 1 yr.) as hardly any water comes out. The suction head always got clogged with dog hair and was a pain to clean.

This one worked, but it leaks and the sprayer gets clogged everytie I use the thing. I have already had to contact warrenty department twice on this item. They were helpful, but still frustrating.

They are extremely salty and aside from that have no other taste. I would not re order these again. I do admit that I do not care for salty foods but if salt is used the taste of it should not be so overwhelming. Some foods are understandably noted for being salty, anchovies, pretzels etc. I do eat pretzels and like them as long as I don't feel as if I put several tablespoons of salt in my mouth.

Have you ever wondered what kind of men we send into harm's way, what they're like and where they come from? Are they different from the rest of us? What's it like to fly and fight a Naval aircraft in a real shooting war? Sherman Baldwin has your answers. Rather than the bravado common to other first-person combat stories, Baldwin's account is told with a great deal of humanity. Certainly there are the accounts of combat and carrier operations that will have you on the edge of your seat. But this is really the story of a man (not a machine) in an extraordinary situation doing extraordinary things on behalf of his country. I know men like this. They are my heroes, and Sherman Baldwin captures their lives and experiences as well as his. If you want to feel proud about America, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of info about being a Navy pilot but dull in spots","review":"Oddly, the book starts to flounder when the Gulf War begins - the \\"war stories\\" he tells are actually quite uneventful. The best parts of the book are when he describes the people he works with on the ship. He does a good job of bringing these people to life, and telling about his difficulties dealing with the higher-ups onboard and their intimidating leadership styles. That was very honest of him, but he didn't reveal much about why he decided to leave the Navy and go into business just a few years later. Overall, it's a good book. I recommend Bogeys and Bandits as the best Navy pilot book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was hooked on the very first page of the book.","review":"A spellbinding autobiography of a Navy pilot's experiences during the Gulf War.

Anyone who has looked closely at Calvin and Hobbes, Doonesbury, or Peanuts can see that the drawings are deceptive; they seems simple, but are very complex graphically. At last, here's a book that shows the craft of cartooning in an utterly unassuming way. This book breaks down drawing cartoons to there barest elements, and by building on these elements, new artists can put together cartoons that can totally amaze. The tone is so conversational (and tongue in cheek) that the reader gets the feeling that Mr. Mayne is at their elbow, helping them to laugh at their mistakes and cherish their successes. The book refuses to take itself too seriously, at one point stating that cartoon characters routinely have four fingers because \\"Cartoonists are basically lazy.\\" Although it at no point hypes itself as the \\"ultimate cartoon book for beginners\\", it is exactly that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cartooning for Kids","review":"I was disappointed when my grandson opened the shrink-wrapped book we received in the mail.

Okay, well, that's not a problem for me, but in general you don't want to have audio sources mixed like that & better to normalize it all together. I'll have a look at my 5.1 setup again, but I think it's coming off the disc in a somewhat not great way.That's the only gripe I have. The rest is really amazing stuff.

A friend of mine (also an atheist) said that Bach and Stravinsky made him want to go to church; well, Marie Keyrouz makes me want to go to church.This is not music that you listen to while folding your laundry. It is too powerful for that; you stop doing what you're doing and you're pulled into the world of the music, into the liturgy, with the icons and incense and prostrations and processions.

There are some wildly imaginative elements in this story, but the author failed to fully exploit them. Instead she focuses on the same unremarkable characters from the first book. And again we see the \\"Double Barreled Pump Action Shotgun\\", the thing must be heavy. There is so much more that could have been done with her idea of the \\"Light Zone, Grey Zone, and Dark Zone\\".

I have used this product twice and both times the battery charge died before I was done and it was on a full charge both times.

When I couldn't find the replacement battery, it was time to buy a new trimmer. On the plus side, it will trim light grass fairly well, but that's about it. The shaft is too short, so you have to stoop a little to use it. I'm average height (5'10\\"), so anyone over 5'7\\" will likely find it too short. Also, the guard kept coming off every time I barely bumped into something. Tried various things, nothing worked. I have a fairly large lot with several trees, so this just didn't work for me. I'm on Amazon at this time looking for a new trimmer.This is fine if a) you're on the short side, and b) you have a small lawn with few items you might bump into.

The battery doesn't hold enough power and won't last you 20 minutes of continuous use, so basically it's useless under normal circumstances. I wanted to save money, but I ended up with a cheap useless product. Next time I need one I'll spend the money and get something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible quality...unsafe!","review":"Very disappointed with the quality of this product...Toro used to be a name for quality products, but it's obvious that they have sold their name to be used on cheap junk.The safety release broke the first time I used it (!!!), so I have to be super careful around the trigger. The whole thing feels chinzy like it was made in a communist era factory in China. :(I would return it, but the shipping back to Amazon would be half as much as I paid for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"I have owned two other older Toro String Trimmers but the latest model imported from China is of unusually poor quality. Those who have experience with other string trimmers including Toro are likely to be quite disappointed with this one. It is advertised as a plastic 'snap-together' with no tools design.....true enough but not mentioned is the unusual vibration causing the unit to 'snap-apart' while in use. As a battery powered unit that is about as noisy as a gas powered model but lots more vibration with a fall apart in use design that trims poorly. It took less than 5 minutes to decide this would be going back.Save your time, money and frustration, -look for other models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performance","review":"l needed a trimmer and just purchased Toro cordless for trial and found it was amazingi've used for 7yrs till the battery run down thats awesome so l dont need to know anythingas i've used one before i just went ahead and bought one to replace the old one"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS TRIMMER!","review":"I looked at all the reviews, pros and cons, etc. and decided to buy it.

Four days later, I used it for less than 5 minutes and it wouldn't hold a charge. Tried to charge it again and NOTHING! I'm soooo frustrated.

Then the 2nd spool wouldn't even feed out by hand, you have to unscrew it and unwind it every time it needs more string. The spring that goes with the spool gets lost, too, making this necessary.Then if you don't keep it charging, or the ac/dc charger wire gets cut and the trimmer doesn't get charge, it won't recharge. So you then have to replace the charger (if cut) for $30 and/or the lead acid battery (old technology and makes item heavier), for $??Just get a corded model or gas powered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, very convenient","review":"This trimmer works great.

I grabbed it to use to wack fast-growing weeds between weekly trims (our HOA is horrible and would fine me if I didn't) while I try different herbicides to see if I can permanently kill them.It's a little too short-handled for comfort. I am 5'8\\" and have to stoop a bit to use it, which is uncomfortable after about 10-15 minutes.It is wimpy and I think I could hear the bigger weeds laughing at it. It gets them - but takes a couple of passes, and it's pretty fussy at eating cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Weak","review":"I had the previous model since 2005 and bought this \\"REPLACEMENT\\" because this cost about the same as replacement batteries. I found this to be much lighter, outsourced to China, and looks like it will not last the 7 years the old one did, just on build quality. The line breaks easily and often (thinking outsourced again). I will try some American line. It works fine, just looks weak and not the lasting power of their earlier one, which was fantastic. The old one was heavy and harder to handle, but was always there for me. This one looks limited on duty life. Too early to say, but I will be amazed if it lasts long.2 MONTHS LATER:It is weak. It is a stupid toy and I am very disappointed with it. It will not finish the season, the line will not come out and easily breaks, it's underpowered, the guard comes off and will not stay on. I am ordering something else, not Toro."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good cordless trimmer.","review":"The Toro weed trimmer is a nice light weight trimmer.

Assembled it and charged it according to directions. It worked fine the first day when I used it till the charge ran out in about 45 minutes. Plugged it back in to recharge it and after two days it still was not charged. I assume there was a defect in the wiring somewhere but was unable to disassemble it to look. Packed it back up and returned it for a refund. Amazon was very timely on the refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud, but effective!","review":"This little baby is perfect for our 1/4 acre yard. It's great not having to deal with cords or gasoline anymore. Putting it together was a snap (literally -- the pieces simply snapped together); however, it doesn't seem amenable to being taken apart again, which means that when you charge it, you need to have enough space by the outlet to lean/lay the whole unit. As for the charge itself, well, 15 minutes is all it takes to trim around our property, so I have no idea how long it would last overall. One funny thing about it: when I bought my cordless (Neuton) lawnmower, it was only a fraction as loud as my previous gas mower. However, this cordless Toro is many times LOUDER than the old trimmer! Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute JUNK","review":"This trimmer is the worst Toro product I've had to date. This is my second Toro trimmer but this one is a night-mare to hold a button on the side and another on top of the handle AND actually use it as a trimmer. Cannot be \\"tipped\\" to trim borders while holding all these buttons. Chews up the grass. Going to take some \\"down home\\" engineering to by-pass these obsticles. It is real noisy and vibrates badly when it gets going (local Toro dealer says it \\"sounds about normal\\"). Battery lasts only about 30 min (not the 45 min. it is supposed to last). Thank goodness I also bought a TroyBilt gas trimmer. The gas one is easier to use and not that much louder either.Shop around before you waste your money on this Toro. Toro's on-line customer service was in no hurry to give a (poor) response. They would really rather not be bothered after the sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toro 51467 8 inch Electric 12 volt cordless Trimmer","review":"I purchased one to try it out for a son who lives in the country. He borrowed my corded electric and it could not reach all his property even with a 100 foot cord. I later purchased a 4 cycle gas trimmer for him, but it is always difficult to start. This Toro cordless 12 volt electric trimmer works perfectly. Its light weight and tough. It does the job. No gas, no exhaust, no need for ear protectors. Just safety goggles. Its so good I bought another for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"great.","review":"This trimmer is excellent. Does a great job and last long enough for me to get all my trimming done. For 47 dollars, you can't beat this trimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for me - but slow charge","review":"I have had the Toro 12 volt trimmer for a couple months now and it has worked fine. It has more than enough power and lasts long enough for out lot which is alomost 1/3 acre for trimming around trees, the neighbors fence, and around where the grass line ends and the other bushes and plants start.It sure beats having to drag a cord around like I used to!I am able to do what I need without recharging. It comes with a fairly sizable 12 volt lead acid batter but a very tiny wall charger (like for a cell phone) for such a large battery! I can see why some complain about that. It would be nice if they charged a few dollars more and provided a better charger. I am sure I could rig up one but I don't have the need right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Life is Horrible","review":"The product will only work at decent power for about 10 minutes after just a month of use. Each time you charge the battery it last a shorter period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad unit","review":"This is a great product for the cost. Not only is it \\"green\\", but it does the job. I would not recommend this unit for cutting down small trees or anything, but it's great for weeds and plants.The Toro is lightweight so it's easy to carry around. The battery charge lasts plenty long for the bulk of my yard work. The cord radius isn't exactly huge, but I'm just using it to clean up some of the weeds around my yard. It's fairly quiet and has a good deal of torque to it.There are several reasons why it will never be a 5 star item in my book:1) It'll never replace a gas powered trimmer2) The range is small3) The bottom piece with the trimmer is too heavy and contact is lost, causing the trimmer to shut off. A simple reconnect works.Otherwise, this thing is great and DEFINITELY worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad electrical connection between pieces","review":"Bought this from the Home Depot as it was light and cordless, charged it fully. 30 seconds into trimming the thing stops. Apparently, the two-prong connection between the top and bottom piece keeps disconnecting , as the lower piece slides down due to poor design/manufacturing. I figured it's a defective item and go exchange it for another one. Same exact issue -- the electrical connection between the two pieces is HORRIBLE, so either you have to force the two pieces together as you use this (bent over awkwardly and VERY unsafe) or... Well, I have returned this to the Home Depot and am NEVER getting another product by Toro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toro 12 volt trimmer","review":"Worked good overall.Seemed to have plenty of power for a rechargeable unit.Great for touchup,or small areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"toro cordless","review":"I ignored the reviews and bought this trimmer, the price was hard to ignore and if it turned out to be a mistake I would try to return it or just junk it.After a month this has performed like a charm. Plenty of power, battery lasts at least 30 minutes and the small foot print is not an issue for me. I cut the big areas with my lawn-mower.It is essential for the handle to be seated properly or else you will not get full power, just a tip when you snap things together upon assembly.Replacing the string is easy, but it in bulk and wind it yourself, not difficult at all.I have trashed by gas powered trimmer since this little guy does all I need it to do.Good performance for a low price. BTW you can use a stronger thicker line with it if you desire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toro edger...","review":"First of all, I bought this at Home Depot for $39.99. It's great for light work. I can't handle a heavy trimmer, and I think this is the lightest one out there. I had a corded Black and Decker, and the cord never wanted to stay attached, and even when it did, after about a year, the connection was bad/loose. Definitely not worth the aggravation. I much prefer the Toro. For thicker weeds, listen to the other reviews. This one won't cut it- (literally), but overall, for what I need it for, I'm very happy with it. It's quick and easy to pull out and use. Charge lasts about 45 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short for tall people","review":"I purchased the trimmer, charged it and went out to trim the grass. After ten minutes I had to stop because of a back spasm. The trimmer is about 1/2 the length of normal trimmers requiring a tall user to bend over trim the grass. I read another review, after receiving the trimmer, stating it was okay for a 5'-4\\" person but probably not for a taller person. I am 6'-2\\" and am too tall to comfortably use the trimmer.

It's weak, so weak I could hear weeds mocking it -- and me -- as I came at them with this thing. Sure, if you stay with it, and hack away, the weeds eventually go down, but it takes for ever to do even a small job.Next, when you run out line, it's a pain reloading it. I kept thinking to myself \\"it's 2012 -- they haven't figured out how to make this easier yet\\"?All in all, I'm VERY disappointed with this thing and caution anyone with a yard bigger than a postage stamp to steer way away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of....","review":"I am so angry. All set to do the trimming and within 30 seconds...no string. So, I took it apart, rewound the line, threaded it through and put it back together, which is very awkward and difficult to do in the first place. Got it all together and started again...20 seconds later...no line. What the? I guess nothing is easy. If anyone has a suggestion....If not I suggest a different brand.Update...went back re-wound and threaded a third time. This time it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"This item is worthless. The first time it was used, it had to be charged again half way thru the weed cutting in my yard, which is a small yard. Each time the charge lasted less and less. Trying to use it for only the FOURTH time, it will not charge at all. You get what you pay for. Spend some more money and buy something else. This is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This product literally only lasted 1 minute and I'm being generous with that estimate. I promptly returned it.

Cut some sparse fast growing spots and hard to reach areas at my house. Not quite lightweight. Fatigued my hand pretty fast, probably due to having to presse the button all time. Shaky. Well, what can you expect from a plastic shaft that long. Noisy, maybe purposely does so as a reminder not cutting your toes. The battery can function 15 minutes at best. Beyond the point the cutting efficiency is next to nothing. This makes me wonder if that \\"up to 35 min\\" spec is beefed up, for example to keep the motor running while not cutting anything. Some reviewers reported much longer running time, maybe that includes resting periods. Correct me if I am wrong. But hey, it is just 40 bucks. And 10-15 minute running time is good enough, at least at my house, to trim the areas not reachable by a real mower. However, a longer battery time does help, thus four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the BEST","review":"This is the best little weed wacker I have ever owned. I was a little concerned when I purchased it that it would not hold a charge for very long. However, I was wrong. I have used it several times to trim our back yard and have yet to recharge it. It is very light weight and easy to handle. It does a wonderful job will little or no effort. I never liked having a regular electric trimmer because of having to drag the cord all over the yard and then having to wrap it back up.

One reads 20041123, the other 20050327.

When I e-mailed to inquire about exchanging it for another battery in the hope that it was just a quirk with the one they sent, the response was that I could return it for a refund.

And I'm annoyed with books where the kids are so much smarter than the adults in their lives - teachers, hotel workers, police detectives, etc. And the parents are virtually non-existent in the lives of their children. Those are cop-out cliches to allow the main character free reign to do as she pleases and solve a mystery that adults aren't able to.But I finished it, so I guess that says something. I was curious to see if the author could believably have this not-terribly intelligent girl solve a mystery. In my opinion this didn't really pass the believability test, but that's just me. I see plenty of people enjoyed the book, and that there are sequels, so maybe this is just not my thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an Awesome Book!","review":"I thought that this book was really great. It's about a girl named Lulu Dark. She goes to a party one night and her beloved purse is stolen. She goes to find out who took it and she starts to become more and more like a detective everyday, the very people she despises, as she puts the pieces of the mystery puzzle together, trying to figure out who took her purse. The plot took many unexpected turns which made the book suspenseful, which is the main reason why I liked it. In the end, I was shocked to find out who the culprit was.I REALLY liked this book and can't wait for the sequel to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"a smart fun read","review":"What a wonderfuly quirky little book! It is the small things that made this book for me, the plot had its twists and turns and the overall story was imaginative and well thought out but my favorite parts were the small, seemingly insignifigant character traits that made the characters have real depth. Lulu's cowboy boots and fringe, Daisy's obnoxious mother and all the idepth descriptions of Halo City's funkiest establisments made the whole thing come to life. A hoot from begining to end.

Still, it's a valuable resource of photos to help in the restoration process and good addition to the Mustang library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real followup to Mule Variations","review":"After MULE VARIATIONS I was a little disappointed in BLOOD MONEY and ALICE. I've never taken to his various stage productions, though I like FRANK\\"S WILD YEARS the best of those. But this is the album I was expecting after MULE. On first listen some of it is so harsh that I can understand perfectly if some people dismiss it as noise. But after a few listenings all I can hear is great lyrics, great 'melodies'and wildly inventive production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd and Sad","review":"I have been a Tom Waits fan for over 25 years. I have bought every album he ever put out, and each had moments of genius which made the unlistenable slop worthwhile. This one, however, is pathetic. The musical backdrop to his screeching non-voice is even more annoying than the voice is. It is poorly recorded and the lyrics are like something from Eminem. I did not understand the motivation for the elaborate embossed quad-fold packaging until I heard what was inside.....nothing. Question: is his voice really that bad, or is this some sort of \\"hipster thing\\"? Never again will I throw my money at this guy. Odd and sad. He was special once."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give this crappy album 0 stars...","review":"I don't want to waste people's time with a long review, so I'll just say the obvious...This sucks!!!

I love how Waits is a folk songwriter that decided to rape the genre up the rear with overdrive. I used to not be a fan of the man, but that was then and this is now. He has truly inspired probalby almost everyone's songwriting..for he is a great songwriter. He's not the bes guitar player but writes one great album--and that is what music is about. Folk is such strong, powerful, and yes, rocking music!! Tom Waits takes this literally as almost the entire album is sounded as if it was recorded at high levels so everything is distorted--but this works really really really well with this album. It sounds like its the only way it can be....because of how great it sounds. Its dissonant, its raw, its nasty, its the Primus of folk--Tom Waits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I'll make this short. Major disappointment from Waits. I listened to the CD a half dozen times hoping I was missing something. I didn't. The CD is a waste and one of his worst ever. Save your money and hope for better down the road. Next time I'll wait for a friend to buy the CD, listen and then decide if I want to buy. Major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only \\"Rag\\" rings true","review":"\\"Hoist that Rag\\" is the only real gem on here, and it may be worth the price of the album--but it's not easy to listen to. Most of the rest compares unfavorably to his earlier work: think Swordfish Trombones+Bone Machine, both of which were better than Real Gone. Other tracks worth a listen: Sins of my father, green grass, make it rain, day after tomorrow. Sins gets a passing grade, but the others actually get predictable and boring. It's like Tom thinks he can just whip out the Waits formula and get a song. I think it worked better when he used to write in a hole in the ground or hold his umbrella upside down to catch the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo","review":"Mr. Waits has had quite a burst of productivity releasing 4 albums in the past 5 years.

Nicely done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Song Titles Don't Belong to Songs Being Sung","review":"I just listened to both cd's and discovered that the song titles don't belong to the songs being sung.

This is the latest initiative from OMG, and the future of UML. In fact, agile modeling practice seems to run counter to MDA in several important areas.

This makes the device essentially useless. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it's a \\"cool idea\\".

Save your money and buy a good toothbrush!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very worrying device","review":"I dont know whether the Tanita Breath alert is accurate or not. There is very little information available, other than one site, http://www.halimeter.com/bostonchannel1.html, which offers the advice that it is overly sensitive and gives high readings for the majority of those tested - did they all have bad breath that day? I know that it has given very erratic readings (both high and low), and I have been unable to find any informaion, on the Tanita Website, or anywhere else, which gives correlations between the tanita readings and the ppm readings that you would expect from a Halimeter. The device has affected my confidence considerably, and I would caution those who are wanting to know if they have a problem, that this will make your fears worse. I am off to the dentist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful device","review":"I have used this device for several weeks and find it entirely consistent (as long as I use it consistently) and very useful. It certainly indicates when breath is bad, I'm just not sure whether to believe it when it says breath is good. Apparently there are certain odours it doesn't detect. A really great product on the whole, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be disappointed","review":"This is a coffee table book that has gotten a lot of use in the last 4 years. I use the atlas extensively in my historical research. I looked at many books in this category before deciding to purchase this one because this was the most comprehensive. It has exceptional maps that are large enough and detailed enough to answer questions and follow historical events.Part One has 100 pages divided into eras with multiple maps in each. Part Two has 275 pages showing changes in regional history sub-divided into 1 or more centuries. The Glossary and Index has 64 pages so you can see how detail oriented this volume is.On virtually every page you will find photos, a timeline, at least one map, and summary commentary. It is like an encyclopedia based on locations. You will not be disappointed if you buy this atlas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite enjoyable","review":"I enjoyed Morbus Gravis a lot!

Hilbert goes on to show how Garfinkel's 'Studies in Ethnomethodology' (1967), and related work by other early ethnomethodologists generated a body of knowledge regarding actual social practices that stood Parsons on his head, thereby unintentionally 'recovering' some of the key insights lost to American Sociology through Parson's interpretation of Durkheim and Weber.

After emailing the seller to ensure that the 4 light bulbs are the standard incandescent-type and not the candelabra type, she assured me they take regular standard incandescent bulbs. Even the picture on the box shows standard bulbs; HOWEVER, this fan takes 4 candelabra bulbs. I can't really fault the seller since the picture on the box is even incorrect. I would not expect the seller to open the box and then have to sell the item as \\"opened\\", but this fan takes candelabra bulbs.

It does a great job at illustrating fundamental ideas, such as the difference between lumped and distributed circuit analysis, where a diagram of a resistor and waves with various wavelengths are used to make the point. However, it is annoying that he does not cover oblique incidence of waves (only normal) or dielectric waveguides or antennas. He placed that in a 2nd electromagnetic waves book. This might make sense for a two year sequence in a university. However, his lack of inclusion of these topics make it hard to recommend the book as complete.

I liked that the colors were neutral and could be used for either sex. I had my son 3 weeks ago, and used the playard for te bassinet next to my bed. After one week of use the bottom center of the playard popped up and one of the sides collapsed which tipped over the playard with my on in it. Luckily he was so small he only rolled into the side of the bassinet and did not fall to the floor. This incident could have been a lot worse. I called Evenflo's Customer Care Line and they will reimburse me for the playard. I would have expected this from a cheap unit, but not for the price I paid. I now own a Graco Pack n Play, which I love and must say is better manufactured in every aspect. I feel Evenflo should recall this playard to prevent further injuries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this, get a Pack N Play instead","review":"I agree with most everyone else who has already reviewed this product. I have the Madison playard in a different print, and have had the exact same problems with the sides collapsing. One rail will not lock into place -- even if we pull up on the bottom of the playard like the instructions tell you to, and manage to get the rail to \\"lock,\\" if something as light as a feather touches the rail it falls down immediately. Not safe at all for my daughter who has started crawling and will need something sturdier to sleep in for the overnight trips to grandparents houses -- even more so once she starts pulling herself up to stand. Soooo disappointed with this product, particularly since we bought it brand new, and it has probably been set up & put away less than 10 times since we got it.

The pictures are not any sharper than with my Olympus Stylus Zoom, the exposures are not that great under many conditions, it is very difficult -- if not impossible -- to stop the zoom where you want to in the middle of its range, and -- worst of all for me -- the camera comes pre-set with a printable (wrong) date, that unless you reset or erase it will ruin all of your photos!! I stupidly took this camera on vacation without testing it first and shot eleven rolls of film with it. I sure wish I had taken my Olympus instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and underwhelmed","review":"Bought this camera a few months back and retunred it after a few rolls. Indoor pics are horrible compared to my old Pentax PS, and the camera is uncomfortable to operate. Why on earth did the put a viewfinder on the edge? Don't waste your money on this camera. Go with Pentax or Olympus for PS cameras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"This is a great camera. I looked around for a while for a 35mm point-and-shoot camera that took great outdoor pictures and was durable enough to go with me hiking. This one fit the bill. The Zeiss lens takes excellent photos. It is handy and durable. The indoor pictures are less desirable -- if you want a small size, very good pictures indoors and outdoors, but less durable, try the Olympus Stylus Epic. Yes, I also have a digital camera, but it stays home during vacations and hiking (there are many reasons). My longest period of shooting was a 23-roll set at Disney and all the shots turned out very well. Very impressed with this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Shooter","review":"The Kyocera / Yashica T4 Zoom is a well-made, handsome and very compact zoom film camera. The lens has above-average sharpness and photos taken with this camera show little or no vignetting, a problem typical of these cameras. The camera is very easy to use and, although its small size makes for tiny controls, it's not hard to use. Color saturation is very good and contrast isn't bad, but photos may be overall a bit dark because of the slow lens speeds. My only complaint is that, at wide-angle settings, the flash isn't very powerful, but it's acceptable at close-up range. This camera probably won't take photos that are as sharp as those taken by a single focal length camera (like the Olympus Stylus Epic with an f2.8 lens -- sharper than the original T4? Maybe!), but for a zoom camera it produces quality results."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a CHILD sized rocking chair.","review":"I made the mistake of thinking this was an adult sized rocking chair.

Molvania was hilarous because, though greatly exaggerated, everything (almost everything) had a grain of truth. Unfortunately the same can not be said of Phaic Tan. Whereas Molvania was witty and clever, Phaic Tan is, with few exceptions, just silly. Most of the entries are absurdities that could be made up about any place in the world.

Right now, he has the knights lined up in and on the castle and they are fighting off some Barbarians. This toy has been HOURS of fun as well as a tool for a few life lessons ;)On a side note, as a 38 year old man, I must admit to enjoying this toy as much as my son. The pieces are easy to assemble, fun to utilize, and it packs up nicely.

They want you to remove the water tank and squirt water into the machine's (water) hole (like an enema) to clear it with a turkey baster they send with the machine. It's so common that there's a video on youtube on how to remedy the problem. If it's so common, they should engineer a solution. We're talking about an air bubble here, not putting a man on Mars. For the price, and given how long this product has been on the market (since 2006), it's really disappointing. Having said that, I would buy another Gaggia Syncrony Compact if they still made it.

In addition, like some have said, the cream dries up your pimples, but to an extent. Also, it soothes the pimples initial irritation but works TERRIBLY with make-up. Applying this under would create an extremely cake, uneven texture. If you remove the cream and directly add makeup (my biggest mistake), you will develop MORE pimples and the initial ones will still be there (as the same size). Would not use cream to cover a large surface, but PERHAPS once in a while for big zits. I foolishly made the mistake of giving this cream a chance over another gel I have, and I regret it.

You can rotate and adjust to any angle. The plastic suction cup stays sucked to the window. The only problem is that the mount will get shaky at higher driving speeds (the longer the extension arm, the more shaky it is), but it's not really a problem for me.

The slope of the windshield prevents the camera from being mounted upright. I have to hang the camera upside down and then rotate the video in editing software, which causes it to look like I'm driving on the left side of the road (the wrong side here in the U.S.). I have a Ford Edge, which would have a pretty standard windshield slope I'd think. Apparently there's an extension arm that is needed, but it's not included with the mount and there's no mention of this from Amazon.If you have a camera with a connector on the top, then this might be ok, but if you're planning on mounting a standard handheld camera, which normally would connect on the bottom, then you're out of luck.The product is well made, but the issue of needing an extension arm for many cameras is irritating (especially since I couldn't even find the extension on the Panavise website)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severe dissapointment","review":"My excitement about the price of the Panavise lasted until I tried it.Every time I screwed it into the mount on my Panasonic HD cam, it jammed, require needle nose pliers to remove.

I use it inverted with the 3\\" extension that it came with. The mount is not advertised at all to have this mount but it sure came with one. Using my Canon Vixia HF100 it was a bit too bouncy. Even though that is a small light HD Camcorder it still weighs a few pounds.[...]It is a very small digital cam that can record reasonable quality 720p res video. A nice advantage too is a digital camera will give you a much wider field of view than a stock camcorder lens. I found the cam jostled around a lot less, and I think it was because it was so much lighter. It did however have this audio static when it was mounted for some reason.Anyway, the mount is well worth the money. I am not sure if you could use it on a race track. But I am using it to record driving around in my 2007 Yaris."},{"rating":"1","title":"No suction!","review":"No matter what I do, I can't get this thing to take hold of any surface of my car. Cleaning every surface, moistening the suction cup - nothing creates a grip.I'm in a Corolla, so perhaps the angle of the windshield makes this impossible to use, but it's also dangerous : the mount clattered to my feet as I was driving, nearly wedging underneath the brake.Ultimately, this is too unreliable to use safely.

I didn't get the extension arm with it, so I called Panavise and they advised me to check it for a patent number, which would be on the lip near the suction cup. I checked mine, and there was no patent number.. which indicates that it's a counterfeit product. Which was sold to me as a Panavise product. Now, I've got a product that is not supported by the company who it was supposed to have been made by, and nobody is answering the phone at VanGoddy. My reason for calling Panavise in the first place was to try to get the extension arm for the 809.. then when we determined that I had a counterfeit product, they told me that even if I bought an arm, it wouldn't work on the counterfeit product.

Construction appears very rugged and the suction cup is plenty strong for use on glass and plexi-glass (hopefully that will persist over time too as the plastic ages). There is the slightest of wiggle/wobble when secured; But I think that's inevitable with so much camera mass at end of the mount fulcrum (which, when zoomed-out, doesn't manifest itself in my recordings [which may be result of the image stabilization on the camera]). I would recommend for the casual consumer user looking to create personal videos; but would hesitate recommending for commercial/professional video production (if you required a complete, 100% vibration/wiggle/wobble-free mount). In short: it's a good mount for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Window Mount for Webcam","review":"I bought this suction mount to attach a webcam to the windshield of my car for taking road-trip time lapse videos. With a little thought, I figured out a simple way to mount a Logitech Pro 9000 webcam to the threaded stud on the suction mount.

This hasn't happened, even with leaving the unit in place in sunny (ie: warm) conditions for at least four days.It does not require any special degree of cleanliness on the window, or other surface preparation to make it stick effectively.

Let's face it, sometimes relationships get in the way of the hot sex we all used to have in the beginning, and isn't it better to have someone who knows what you like, that you know how to pleasure, but you don't have to deal with all of the relationship nonsense that goes with it?For a first time editor, Willis has gathered some incredibly formidible names--Felice Picano, Greg Herren, Jameson Currier, M. Christian, Jay Quinn--in addition to some of the top gay writers of erotica today. This gives the book not only some hot and heavy content, but also a degree of literary merit that is usually conspicuously absent from these books.Can't wait for his next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non competitive Britten recording.","review":"While Previn has made some outstanding recordings of 20th century british music (Holst's \\"Planets\\", Walton's Sym. no. 1 & Vaughan-Williams symphonies) this is certainly not one of them. The Spring symphony movements are not performed attaca as indicated in the score, but are separated by pauses which are rather annoying.

I thought the characters were well-developed, even if their actions were not quite believable (an ethical scientist who blackmails the world?). Still, the author managed to flesh out these people enough so that I actually sympathized with the villainess and I was willing to suspend my disbelief and accept her motivations.

I wanted to hear some of the longer format pieces. It's so good. It is good for sitting in the background while I work or play, and it is good for my most focused attention. You can just float along with those notes.I like simple music, mostly, single guitar, single piano. This single sitar with the drone and drums fits my preferences. I hadn't heard this in quite some time since I haven't had a turntable in quite some time. With Ravi's passing I looked for some replacements and found the mp3. Some of the phrases were still familiar and still warm and inviting, still exciting and soothing. I'm not an Indian music connoisseur, but Ravi knows how to deliver the goods to anyone who likes music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hallelujah, \\"Three Ragas\\" has finally been reissued!!","review":"This album is simply amazing...possibly the best recorded work Shankar ever did, and that's saying a huge mouthful. \\"Raga Jog\\" alone is worth the price; it's absorbing, intimate, powerful, played with seraphic skill,and just plain damn unearthly beautiful.

Quite a contraption for zero enjoyment and satisfaction. The refill paper is expensive and your kids will go through them fast. Don't wast your 3xC batteries either. Box is a lie and makes this \\"color EXPLOSION\\" appear to be something it definitely is not. Paper comes pre colored/designed as you can already see before you even begin to color. All you do is drip gooey stuff on it while it's spinning since the markers didn't appear to work very well at all. Plus, you get the same horrid splatter pattern every time. The most depressing thing about this toy is the waste of plastic that will just end up in a land fill. Can't believe the Crayola company would make such trash. I have no idea what is causing the boy on the box to appear so thrilled but you're child will not have the same expression. The toy is not worth anything and it will take up space.

Prepare to be letdown! Vivid colors shown on box do not exist and the spinner doesn't rotate nearly fast enough even with fresh batteries. All our finished projects basically looked the same - not at all what appears on box. I'd be curious too as to where you could find refill paper and \\"magic ink\\" for this and what it costs b/c it only comes with a few sheets of paper. Both my kids forgot about this dud of a toy within minutes of opening it on Xmas day."},{"rating":"1","title":"refills non-existent","review":"This product worked ok but for $27 it is not worth the money. It is neater than the spin art of the 70's but you have no choice of color as you did when you were dripping actual paint -- it comes with paper already colored for you and the clear liquid exposes the colors already there. It's still messy, the liquid is a gel-goo that gets everywhere, and it spews black goo into the sides of the unit. The refills cost $7 and I have been searching for a year and cannot find them anywhere except online (with $6 shipping charge). The funky different papers they advertise cannot be found anywhere, not even online. Plus, to get the paper to fit in the unit you have to fold it -- huh? That's kind of dumb, it should have been manufactured to fit, the way the old spin art used to. If you want spin art, buy a spin art, because this unit is terrible. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"I recently bought this fun art toy and played with it last night. It was a lot of fun for myself, my boyfriend, and his 11 year old son. We were immediately addicted to playing with it and experimenting with markers, explosion drops, and our own supplies. Originally I purchased this product for my church for a preschool party we're having, but I'm going to have to keep this one for myself. It is easy to go through the paper quickly, but any paper could be used. Same goes for paints. Just water down some poster paint and you're good to go. Make sure you purchase 3 C batteries and you're good to go. I just hope the motor has a long life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Toy I bought This Christmas!","review":"In my opinion this is an overpriced junk toy/craft set.

Not worth the money at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor quality","review":"My boys got the crayola spinner for christmas and have only used it twice. This toy was not thought out at all. It seems that the company was in such a hurry to get the spinner on the market that they didn't take the time to make sure it worked properly.

Another thing, you see in the picture that there is a round steel part counter to the nob of the cover..you screw the nobs to it...well I received one that does not belong to this set and its screw did not match either. I improvised something to keep them since I hate the hassle of returning.

My children, who are one and four love to watch the other children learning and exploring on the video. They are not only hearing the words but seeing them in print and specific movement across the screen. I noticed that the creator of this fantastic video is a mother herself, which reinforces the learning opportunities, as she knows what interests children and captivates their attention. I also think that this would be very appropriate in the school setting for primary aged children. Being a teacher myself I see how television can be used in an educational setting and why not use a learning opportunity like this, instead of a cartoon where no specific learning may occur. Children are captivated by television, and this video provides entertainment as well as education! I would defintely recommend this video for all children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold and fun","review":"Fabulous! Accessible stories that engage instead of pander. Simple, colourful scenes that children can relate to and enjoy, with animated words that reinforce meaning. I love the down-to-earth feel of these videos. Kids these days are bombarded with deafening volumes and over-the-top special effects (even Winnie-the-Pooh has been reinvented with psychedelic CGI and scary story lines), yet children thrive on gentle stories with strong, comforting storylines. Big dog; splashing stones with Grandpa; muffin-making with Mum -- all gently captivating.

I have looked and looked. My two grandsons, aged two and three, love the stories. I watch the video with them, and for now, I read the parts meant for the child to read himself. Later, I am sure they will learn to do it alone. In many ways it is just like reading on a one to one basis. Why buy a video then? The large screen is very appealing. This would be wonderful for any child dealing with English as a second language. There are sections in which children read stories they have written and illustrated about the theme of each story.

I'm sure if I ever spaced out and set something paper on top I'd burn my house down. The tray? It warps every single time I use it.

Even 5 minutes after it's done and turned off, I still couldn't leave it alone and I would never ever have my kids use it.I've had a black & toaster before for sixteen years without any problems that worked great.

We have never had one last longer than just shy of 2 years. What can you say, this particular model is not built to last, but it does heat up faster than any other model or brand that we have tried. At about $50 with shipping, it's not a huge amount of money. I wished B&D built them better (ie. to last longer), but the newer models have only one heating element on top and bottom, this one has two, the newer models have radiant elements which look really cool (they have a glass like finish), but they take much longer to heat up. Overall, this is a decent toaster, but I can not refute the general disappointment reflected in other reviews that I have read. If you have limited expectations with respect to longevity, this toaster is going to work quite well, until it breaks!

A total of 150 photographs doesn't cover much when it amounts to limited highlights of his various themes, the selections themselves questionable (I should have taken note when the Editorial said that many of the pics hadn't been published before).

Poesie Photographique is a catalog of his works presents the wide diversity of his subjects; from his early photos of gypsies and ruins to his abstracts, plant art, and portraits. Each black and white picture is presented full-page and explored in several languages, making for an intriguing and important catalog of his entire skills set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't find any people to be a companion!","review":"I bought this for my 13 year old son for Christmas. He tried for hours to find a companion in the game to take with him on the trail, and no people appear (except the ones that work in the shops). I tried it to, and I can't find anyone, so we can't even get started on playing the game! It's frustrating for both of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"It worked at first, no errors or anything and I enjoyed it. But, when it came time to reboot my computer, the game completely failed! I got as far as the town, and then all the people disappeared.

Same thing happened with number three!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Severe Dissapointment","review":"I admit, I was a fool, I went out and bought this game despite the reviews. It was awful! You don't even get to create the charactors you will embark with. It is slow, it takes 20 + minutes just to cross a river! It is nothing like the previous games, and that is a dissapointment. If I were you, I would NOT waste my money on this game. The Learning Company should be ashamed to call this their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"We never could get it up and running for very long, despite having a technical whiz in the family. We could not get any telephone help from the manufacturer, and the online help was skimpy. I would like to have a working product for my children, but am hesitant to buy any more Oregon Trail Products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"This game may look fun, but it is not as fun when you play it. There are many things that you cannot do and can. You can fish, and gather plants. But you can only have two partners. When you finally get to Oregon (which is the only place you can go) you usually end up in a Hospital. You also have to start from Independence. The hunting is good. You have lots of game and you have a wide view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good.","review":"I got this as a gift, because I loved playing Oregon Trail in grade school. This version, though having much prettier graphics, isn't nearly as fun. Half the fun of playing it was naming all the people after your family, and reading the dirty limericks people wrote on the gravestones. Save your money, don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oregon Trail 4 - not what you would expect","review":"I do not recommend buying this game. The first one I bought loaded fine, but I could never move out of first gear. There were no people in the hotel and I could not join a wagon or advance. All the double clicking in the world would not get this game to work. I exchanged the game for another and the exact same senario occured. Bad batch of CD? I think so. Buy the way, the first and second editions of this software are the best. The third edition keeps crashing on the 3rd CD. The Learning Company needs to get their act together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Beyond Belief","review":"This game was extremely frustrating. As one reviewer pointed out, you must switch between Quick Time 4 and 3 to be able to begin to use the game. Furthermore, even after doing that, I had additional problems with DirectX. After hours of communication with The Learning Company to resolve these problems (unless everything is set up perfectly, there is no way to find companions to start the game), TLC simply refered me to the manufacturer of my computer. Extraordinarily poor design and follow-through. My computer is a relatively new HP 4445 that far exceeds the recommended needs to run this game, yet nothing works.Simply put, do not buy this game unless your idea of family fun and education consists of repeated and futile exchanges with the consumer service division of The Learning Company."},{"rating":"1","title":"I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I repeat...!","review":"Okay, Okay, This game may look so fun, but it isn't so fun. I started playing this and it was okay, but then when I went on the voyage/trip to Oregon, it was boring! Nothing to really do and then the game started to mess up...like half of the screen went black. This game is so different than Oregon Trail 3(and not in a good way). I reccomend Oregon Trail 3 instead of this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick Time Blues","review":"We purchased this product for our child based on a review in Consumer Reports Magazine. The program requires Quick Time 3, and will not run if you have Quick Time 4 installed on your computer.

I thought we were doing something wrong until I read the other reviews and see that many people have had the same problem. Big dissapointment:-("},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating to use","review":"I like some of the changes made between this one and edition number 3 but I agree with the other reviews in terms of technical problems. It took a while to figure out how to get it to work. Only when I changed my monitor to show high color vs. true color could I get it to work and then I only happened to try this based on the system requirements listed on the box not based on instructions for set-up. Even so I still keep coming up with technical glitches that I didn't have with the earlier edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Oregon Trails 4","review":"I only wish I had read these reviews before I wasted my money on this game.

It's a classic and flattering style on any little girl. It's completely versatile (on where it can be worn), I can think of plenty of functions during the year.

Definitely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Dress","review":"This is a really pretty dress. It fit our daughter well and looked great on her.

As with most things pink, our four year old daughter absolutely loves the dress which is exactly what we were looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast service very pretty dress!","review":"I bought this dress for my 8 1/2 year old for a father/daugther dance. I knew it would take a while to get here, but I was quickly surprised when it arrived within a week of ordering it! I bought the dusty rose, the color is just like the photo. It twirls great!! I bought a 14 since my daughter is taller and it does fit very well. So I would say, if you are questioning about going up a size, I would. I don't think the fabric feel is an issue for her and she can be picky. The flower is attached with a pin, so it can be easily removed. I highly recommend this dress."},{"rating":"2","title":"mega man","review":"Would definitely buy again! If they had two of them, I would have bought both.

However, the book fails to identify the various phrases used throughout. There is a glosery at the end, but you may not find it until you finish the book. There is much repetition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented author without heart","review":"Though the writer is obviously gifted, and the stories are without a doubt amusing and accurately detailed, the author seems distant from his characters.The author seems to stay un-involved and to coldly inspect his subjects as though they were fireflies in Mason jars, or butterflies on pins.The writing is superb, but the lack of involvment in the characters inner workings and lives, leaves these stories sounding like a girlfriend repeating a soap opera in the office, to someone who missed an episode.I'll lay off with these last words. The author should look into his own heart and write real, breathing characters, not try to bring to life cardboard cutouts. No matter how excellent it is, it must heart. This book does not have heart, though it does have plenty of good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Throwers","review":"Very very cool knives. I mostly have larger knives like the Cold Steel True Flight Thrower (which is awesome btw) so i decided that I needed some smaller and lighter knives. I looked around and these were the best knives for the cost I was looking for. These knives are only sharp on one side of the blade (doesn't really effect throwing) and they are pretty light, so you can throw them fast. Only problem I have with them is that because of their lightness, they don't have the best penetration on my plywood target. The leather sheath is nice to have on your hip when you're throwing, easy stowing for the knives too. At this price, they are great for beginners. 5 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way of the samurai","review":"With all Samurai's, two pursuits are critical to their being; wisdom and death. Sarah Stevens' life is entangled with the two, albeit unintentionally at times. Even so, her pursuits go further than that dealing with corruption and the ever so complicated quest for moral righteousness. This book creates a universe of seedy business practices and a samurai (Sarah) who tries to slash through them and yet still come out on top. Fast paced, devilishly intellectual, and full of current topics that face our globalized economy, this novel serves as a perfect fictionalized introduction to the real world. Anybody interested in Japanese culture or economy, should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"All sizzle--no steak","review":"Despite the attractive photographs, the book is disappointing in that the writer apparently did no original research and simply dumped the City Planning Department's own files for each structure onto each page. The resulting content is little more than expanded captions. These historic resources deserved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book provided only generalizations without sufficient detail.

In her chapter on miscellaneous tips she comments that so many people seem to get pregnant after adopting that you should consider this route. For the record - and this stat is NOT mentioned in her book - 5% of couples who end treatment will end up conceiving on their own *regardless of whether they choose adoption or not.*The rest of the stuff she mentions (herbs, vitamins, etc.) seemed like it was all gleaned from the internet and is presented without any detail.Skip this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Walls","review":"I would recommend this cd and I give it a 4 star rating.

It would not reinflate otherwise for an extended time. The ball itself is cute, but not like an authentic volleyball, more like a plastic version. In other words, if you are buying this for a small child to play around with, it's probably okay, assuming they ship it correctly. For an avid volleyball player, this is not the item for you. To be fair, this was my first return, and it was exceptionally customer service friendly and easy, and I was very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Go Southeast Asia.","review":"An excellent read covering many countries which are not covered in other travel guide series.

The problem is that the authors take too long explaining their points. If it had been a third to half as wordy it would have been much more useful and certainly an easier read. I have tried reading it 'like a book' now twice, and somewhere in the second chapter I just lose interest. Golfers wants relatively quick explanations and remedies. This isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"So my swing is bad because of my mother?","review":"A lot of psyco-babble here. The book delves into psychiatric concepts that might be a little too deep for the average golfer to wade through.The major problem with this book is the writing. Apparently they tried to write it themselves. Two words: Ghost writer. They deperately needed one. It's disorganized and repeats itself frequently, but somehow never really brings the point across effectively.I was excited about this book at first, but it's very difficult to stick with and get through. If you have every other book out there on golf, buy it. Otherwise you may want to pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a GREAT book!","review":"This book had many great tips.

Now, I'm well into my high school career (the video was released some time in between '93-'94, when I was in third grade or so). I own several copies and have watched it many times.

My love of the post-apocalyptic realm started with Wasteland on C-64 and culminated with these classics. With only the excellent Stalker:SOC to tide me over until Fallout 3, its been a long wait. If you've never played them and turn-based is not your cup of tea then I would recommend Fallout:Tactics, faster paced and real-time.BTW not being able to get the game to run on your system is not a reason to give a game a bad review..patches are easily found by competent users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old, but still a good time","review":"I had never played Fallout and I wanted to get into it before Fallout 3 comes out so I purchased this collection. So far the story is pretty good. At this point, with the game's age, the story and the action are what's important. I can't remember the last time I played a game with graphics that old.When I get my character into trouble, it's pretty exciting to get her out of it alive. When I don't I know what is going to befall the other characters that are depending on me.I understand why so many people have so many good things to say about this game, even today. It was well worth the low price for the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the patches?","review":"Fallout and Fallout 2 are awesome. Fallout Tactics is also a good game. But how can a company justify releasing decade old games without including the updated patches?

Pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands the Test of Time","review":"I have played all 3 games in the FallOut series and wish there would be a fourth. The first two are superior, as the previous reviewer noted, for the freedom they provide the player (though, if i recall correctly) in FallOut 1 you have a limited amount of time to complete the first parts of the game or you die of radiation poisoning or something.FallOut Tactics was a bit of a let-down from the first two, but none-the-less a very playable game and some very clever nods to late 90's, early 00's culture. (For example, there's a random encounter based on the movie \\"Pitch Black\\" and later you can hire a mercenary named Riddick who is very proficient at hand-to-hand combat.I know whether these games will work with Microsoft XP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallout collection DVD","review":"Amazing been looking for this installation files have been updated to let fallout one and two run on xp/vista"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallout Collection Set","review":"It was def. everything I was hoping it would be.Contains all 3 Fallout games, quickly installs, and easy to play.A great buy if you love RPGs, and don't mind less quality graphics, but better emphasis on storyline and a focus on the game play instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it says","review":"Color problems with the first Fallout, but they were off and on.

It is fun though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The clunky, slow interface ruined it for me","review":"OK, I understand this is an old game, but I'm an old gamer - all the way back to the days of ASCII graphics, for goodness' sake. Fallout is a bit ugly even for 1997, but acceptable. The interface, however, is horrible. You constantly have to have to right click to change the cursor type, and then left click or left click and hold to select from a menu. I found it very awkward, though I did get more proficient after a few hours. But then the game moves sooo slowly - it seems to take forever just for you to walk from one place to another. I found that turning on the autorun and speeding up the combat helped, but the turn-based combat is still slow.Supposedly there's a good RPG behind this interface, but I don't have the patience. My advice to anyone thinking of buying this game: make sure you download and try the demo first! I didn't - I didn't even realize there was a demo available and bought the game on its reputation alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this disc for Tactics. 1 & 2 are a waste of time.","review":"Tactics is still the best computer based video game out there. It's coming up on 10 years old, but still complely immerses the player in the post-nuclear world. The real time option is the way to go. Customize and control your squad in this immense game. I am not a fan of turn based games. I never saw the point of taking turns in a firefight. You wouldn't do that it real life would you? Keep your squad moving, finding cover, charging in with guns blazing, it's up to you. Tough guy mode rewards the lack of mid level saving ability with extra points to customize your character's abilities. I love the time in the bunkers almost as much as the missions. Steal everybody blind, go sell the stuff you steal, and buy more cool stuff for your squad. Excellent.I highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for windows XP","review":"The fallout collection 1 and 2 did not load and run on my windows XP machine.

A interior shot from the insider of a real moving car was very rare in those days. You can see that Sturgis was just full of little ideas of camera placement in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap Crap Crap!!!!!!!!!","review":"This album is not worth my time to review but what the hell? All you people on here obviously don't know anything about talent. For one, this band is the worst live band on the face of the Earth.

The first thing that caught my eye from this album was the enchanting historical artwork...the Roman Coptic symbol of Ordo Coptaos. The band concentrates on a rock formula with a tinge of grunge mixed in. It's not a bad effort for a debut release and I see more releases from this band of young men from Kansas.The three top songs of this album are 'Let Me Out', 'Unite' and 'Make You Believe'. The last 2 songs I disliked not because of the sound quality which had many riffs but the lyrics were distasteful, hence 4 stars only. Other than that the album rocked and fans of Nirvana, POM, Lost Prophets and 311 should like this band's offerings.

It's GREAT for frying (i made fried chicken a couple of times, and it came out perfectly, no hot spots.) i've used it to make spaghetti sauce, french toast, taco meat, chili and mexican shredded chicken for chicken nachos. it's heavy enough to feel sturdy in your hand, and they're a snap to clean, even with the mexican chicken (you have to cook that down for a couple of hours.) I haven't had any problems with sticking or scratching, and it actually inspires me to cook. You won't be disappointed by purchasing this pan! It's great for the cook that uses a lot of different techniques or methods of cooking (soups, frying, steaming)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for glass tops","review":"This pan was a bargain that turned out to be overpriced.

The story is okay but underdeveloped. It wants to be epic (think Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, etc.) but doesn't quite have the stamina. It feels more like an outline than an actual novel. On top of that, the editing is extremely poor. I felt like I needed a red pen to make it through to the end! There are many, many mistakes (i.e. your/you're, duplicate words, too/to, etc.) that make for a bumpy read at best. The character development is lacking and much of the words are redundant within single paragraphs.

When I pulled them apart, they both had wax on them. I then put a strip on my lower leg and rubbed the 3-4 times (per the directions) and pulled the strip off my leg.

I couldn't find that kind at my walmart, so I had to buy this stuff. I figured it would be easy since the strips already had the wax on them. You have to warm the wax between your hands, which is fine unless you cut the strips. I had to because they were huge and I was doing my bikini line. When you rub the cut strips, the wax comes out the sides...messy. I followed the instructions, when I pulled the strip off, no more than five hairs came off on one strip, some had none. It's always uncomfortable to wax, this experience was no different. I will NOT be buying these again.

The quality has not kept up, the last pack I bought I was only able to use one of the strips. Total waste of time. Never again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I love these. They're definitely the best wax strips out there- the fabric-like strips are so much better than the Sally Hansen plastic ones. They mold to your skin really well, the wax smells somewhat pleasant, and most importantly, it takes off all the hair.Using wax strips for legs is so much easier and less of a mess than using the pot of wax, but I agree with the other reviewer- these aren't great for armpits. In that case, I would recommend using regular heated wax. For some reason that works much better for armpits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a miracle but will do","review":"For me, this stuff works on the following areas: bikini, legs, face, arms. It does not work on armpit hair. I is a bit gooey but not too much. It is not as sticky as wax but will get out the hair fine if you use a bit of speed when pulling the strip off. For the price, this is a decent alternative to salon waxing, which is good for people on a budget like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"After trying SO many shavers, hair removers, wax's,etc. I found these at a local drugstore so I thought I would give them a try. I have super sensitive, pale, see thru skin and usually even shaving shows all my dark roots right away. Well I can tell you that these work SO good I haven't shaved since finding them and the desensitizing wipes they come with are also a miracle from the hair removal gods! These are not messy at all which I absolutely love because other at home kits get wax and residue everywhere that's near impossible to always get off. These also work great on the bikini line so I wouldn't waste my money on the bikini kit. Just so you women know how fool proof these are to use- I even trust my husband to do the pulling-lol. My only complaint is for 24 strips these don't come with enough desensitizing and after care wipes so be sure to try to conserve and even save the ones you have til their bitter sweet end."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"out of a full pack i got 2 strips to work the rest did absolutely nothing except leave the \\"wax\\" in the perfect shape of the strip on my leg. I tried heating in microwave, i tried the old \\"iron on\\" method my grandma likes, i tried the rubbing, no matter was done the wax stuck to my leg and not the strip when i pulled it away. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT buy this product. This product has also caused me hives all over especially where i tried to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still playing with it","review":"I've been slowly trying the strips. At first I thought my hair was just too short so it wasn't ripping any out. I try every few days just hoping that it'll magically work, haa. Today I realized that my biggest mistake was getting the wax TOO warm. It stayed too soft so it left a gooey mess on my legs instead of sticking to the paper. New trick: Take a cold water bottle and use that to rub the strip down. Even though this helped a lot, it still only rips about 50% of my hair off.Save the money and trouble and go for a warm wax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to throw away BOTH packs!!!","review":"I've used Nad's strips in the past with great success. Absolutely loved them. But the strips I got are either A)Quality control has gone WAY DOWN HILL or B) I got the packs that were 10+ years old. The wax sticks to your face and doesn't come off with the pull so you are left with globs of strip on your face that you have to painstakingly rub off with rubbing alcohol. I can see from other reviews that they've had similar experiences. Nad's needs to pay close attention because their customers will (and have) found better products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unusable","review":"I love this product normally, but the packages that were sent to me from this vendor were completely unusable. No matter how I tried to use it the wax stuck only to my skin and was not removed when pulling the strip off the skin. Instead the strips would rip or would come off leaving the wax remaining on the skin. I tried using it as directed as I normally do, after the product failed in this usage, I tried heating it with a hair dryer, which led to the same results. Very frustrating, painful ordeal. I originally placed this order under subscription, but after receiving this first delivery, I will not purchase from this vendor again. Very, very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"These strips are horrible. Most of the wax sticks and stays on my leg.My skin got red because while removing the wax was staying back on my legs instead of sticking to the strip.Same stirips i picked up from CVS, they were fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old product delivered","review":"These strips really do work, but only if the strips are not old or dried out. I received the pack of 2 from this vendor and the \\"wax\\" part were dried out (2 out of the 12 strips were useable). They stuck to each other and the adhesive side was not useable. When you buy this product from a pharmacy, it works great. I would not recommend buying this product from the current vendor. Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"This looked like a good idea at the time and the concept is good.. the product is NOT.I thought this was going to be the same \\"sugar\\" product as the nads in a tub. It's NOT.. it's a completely ineffective wax that sticks to skin and doesn't come off with the strip. WASTE OF MONEY .. I had to use both \\"clean up\\" wet wipe things to try and pry this crap off my leg and it left the hair behind. I love the original product and would go for that in prepackaged strips in a heartbeat but this wax is useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work for Me","review":"I experimented with two strips, following the directions the first time and for the second by heating the strip for a few seconds in the microwave to see if it being warmer helped. Perhaps I wasn't heating it up enough with my hands? Nothing but a sticky mess and hairy legs greeted me both times. I won't be buying this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very ineffective","review":"I got the Nads body wax strips because I thought it would be more convenient for vacation waxing than the usual tub of wax. This was definitely not the case. I did as the box instructed and rubbed the strips between my hands to warm them, when I pulled them apart they had no adhesive properties whatsoever. I put them in the microwave for 30 seconds, they still slid right off my skin. I boiled water for the express purpose of holding the strips against the outside of the pot to heat them, this level of heat made the strip at least stick to me...Unfortunately, when I pulled the strip back all of the wax was still on my leg. I, rather stupidly, decided to try another strip to pull the wax off and then had 2 layers of wax stuck to my leg. I ended up spending about 20 minutes peeling wax off of my leg. I should note that I've been waxing for years and have used this type of wax strip before from other brands and had no problem. This product is useless. Does Nads give refunds?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"Wow...I was really surprised that these worked with no heating of the wax. So easy and so cheap!!! Will definitely buy again. I am not able to shave my bikini area at all because I get so many bumps and ingrown hairs. I am so glad I tried these, they will save me tons of time and money I would be spending on waxing this summer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"normally excellent but 2 defective boxes","review":"These are normally excellent but I bought two boxes and they are either defective or were stored improperly. I ordered in winter, so I doubt it was shipping conditions. The wax completely separated from the strip, what a mess!!! I tried many strips. Some separated when the strips were pulled apart prior to use, some after applied to skin. Really, a painful mess. Not fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old wax strips","review":"The wax strips I received were old and dry. When I applied a wax strip to my leg, it ripped, leaving a sticky mess of wax without even removing any hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work!","review":"I have very fine to medium thickness hair and this product did not remove it, it just left a sticky residue behind. I switched to the Veet strips and they removed the hair completely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true romance; one in a lifetime","review":"I loved this book from the 'get-go' and am hoping that the Author is planning a sequel to continue the story of Storm and Wolf's children."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I first read this book years ago, and lent it to a person who never returned it. I have been searching everywhere for it ever since because it was the most intense book I had ever read. The story haunted me and I can't wait to read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite romance!","review":"The first time I read this book I couldn't put it down! Literally, I was up till dawn and beyond. It was the book that really got me hooked on historical romance. I still compare all couples to Wolf and Storm. Every time I re-read it (5 and counting) it makes me cry, laugh, and sigh. Check out the companion book, And Gold Was Ours, featuring Wolf's cousin. These two are Rebecca's best books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enjoyable","review":"Let me start by saying the I like RB's writing style - she is very descriptive and gives great depth to her characters. That's why I didn't give this book just one star. But I really disliked the story. The story jumps around in time, which I don't like reading, and has several Big Misunderstandings to cause conflict between the h&h, which I *really* don't like reading. If you don't mind either of those plot devices, you may very well love this book. But if either of those techniques bother you as much as they do me, as least you've been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"blast from the past","review":"This was on of my favorite romances way back when. While I think I've grown out of her writing style (her phrasing is rather over dramatic, even for a historical romance novel) I think the story is still quite a classic of the romance genre and a reflection of the era it was written in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling medical mystery!","review":"If you are looking for a great read that is hard to put down, check out Doctored Evidence. From the opening scene to the unraveling of the evidence, it captures the imagination and leaves you wondering about your own medical and hospital experiences. With detailed information on the inner workings of large healthcare systems, Biehl presents a believable story of suspense and deception. Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great mystery--most authentic medical novel I've ever read","review":"Doctored Evidence has everything that makes for a superb mystery: engaging characters, a gripping plot, crisp dialogue, a touch of humor, and a tremendously satisfying solution. It is consistently entertaining. But beyond being a great read, it is a chilling and realistic portrayal of corruption in the medical business. Everyone should read this book before they next set foot in a hospital. Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sure I read the Same Book...","review":"I'm lost by the STRONG reviews going on here. While the book had an interesting plot where the heck was the editor? At some point chapters would almost repeat verbatin paragraphs from other chapters. I could also do without the instructions on how to work her voicemail... \\"press 1 to listen to messages\\", so I pressed 1, \\"press 2 to repeat\\" so I pressed 2. The leaps in logic were off on how she figured out the mystery. At times the story switched between 1st and 3rd person but during the same paragraph which is very odd to read.Lots of potential but didn't hold up. Fire your editor and let's try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story, Slow Read","review":"Investigating the alleged wrongful death of the hospital's own CFO, attorney Karen Hayes uncovers a betrayal of trust, both professional and personal, evidence of criminal fraud, and hints of corruption. Now her job-and her life-are on the line. A line that a murderer is all too willing to cross. The storyline was interesting but the book was a slow read. There was too much useless information that was used to pad the book. I think the relationship between Karen and her husband could have been left out or atleast shortened.

The style is very smooth and really easy to listen to. Its not really country, but it doesn't really fit into any other category either.A perfect cd to pop in, and not have to really think about anything, just sit back and enjoy the ride. Some are instrumental, while others are really catchy, stuck in your head type of songs.My stand out favorites are:\\"Sundowner, You\\" - This is the song that just sticks with me, and is the reason for me getting the cd.\\"Denver Annie\\" - wonderful beat, and tempo. Flows really well. A great story song that will have you snapping your fingers to the beat.\\"Suffolk Down Upon the Night\\" - another rich beat tune that is perfect for zoning out to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok, but I am sure there is something better","review":"Bought this to go with my Zire 31. The case fits well - although the cover itself is just a flap - no closure. For carrying around in an outside pocket on my purse its ok. If it were just another piece of floatsam in my suitcase of a purse, I can't imagine it would do much good. Its a little difficult to get the stylus out of the back when the Zire is in the case, but not impossible.The stylus is cool - a blackpen, an orange pen, a pencil and stylus all in one. It took me a few minutes to figure out exactly how to switch from one to another - but I managed. The screen protectors are ok - nothing spectacular. Don't follow the lines printed on the screen cover when you trim them to fit your PDA - the lines for my Zire 31 are a bit small.All in all, this is ok - but I think next time I will try to find a better case. I would advise any PDA noobs to buy the PDA, take it with you to a store that sells cases and pick one out from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"They need to tell people.","review":"I believe in the title of the Essentials Kit they need to tell the customers that the PDA is NOT INCLUDED.

They need to put it in BIG BOLD PRINT.

An amazing woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worth the curiosity value","review":"Really not worth the effort to find it, even if George MacDonald Fraser was involved with the screenplay. The producers chose the \\"least best\\" of the Flashman novels to adapt, they cast the wrong actor to play the role, and they reduced the whole story to a bawdy, not-very-funny, slapstick comedy. Don't bother searching for it. True Flashman fans will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"A great satire of Victorian England and most especially Victorian era Hollywood movies. Lots of laughs in most unusual settings. Who would have guessed Bismark would make such a comic subject? Hard to imagine why this has taken so long to make it to DVD. The only thing too disappointing about this movie is that it was the only one done to date from the immortal Flashman series, certainly Flashman in Afghanistan would be very timely and on target today, but at least the author Fraser and the director teamed up again on the Three Musketeer movies. I'll be happy to challenge to a duel anyone who dares to question my devotion to the books as long as they allow my friend to load the pistols."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good books, crummy movie","review":"I am forced to cast my vote with those who regard this movie as a failure.To me, the film fails on two counts. The first failure relates to the general approach. How in heaven's name did G. M. Fraser, the author of the wonderfully amusing black comedy novels about that magnificent anti-hero of anti-heroes, General Sir Harry Flashman, come to write such a feeble, would-be action comedy and lowly farcical screen adaptation for this movie?The other failure, and vastly the worse of the two, is the utterly appalling miscasting of Malcolm McDowell as Harry Flashman. The Flashman of the books, a man who cheerfully admits to no virtues whatsoever, is widely admired as a staunch and true hero of Little Vickie's Empire entirely because he looks just like a hero ought to look. Malcolm McDowell most emphatically does not. He looks like ... well, Malcolm McDowell.First-rate books, third-rate movie.

This Wholesome Brand Organic Raw Blue Agave has 16 grams of sugar in one TBL! I called the company and learned it is under 35 on the Glycemic Index....still high.

I always wanted to ask him his story, but didn't want to pry. He didn't brag about his exploits, didn't even mention them. I wish I would've talked to him some more, he passed away a few years ago. But at any rate he, with the help of Marcia Moen and Margo Heinen, put his story down in paper, and it makes for fine reading.

I really expected authors writing to be more polished in this release. I loved Fancy's parts the best as this is the charactor that has the most devolpment. Darrius' and Jada are becoming played out.

But the content has no soul whatsoever. I had never read anything by Alperovitz before, so I don't know if his prior work is any better. But this one is a yawner. I mean, I never skip through passages of liberal policy books, but I just had to scan through significant portions of this stuff. It's just that dry and uninspiring.

I like the spiral binding as it makes it easier to work with. However I don't think it is all that well-organized. It would be better if all the related signs were presented together. For example, food in one section, travel in another. I think the biggest problem is that there are no word descriptions on how to make a certain sign or reasoning behind the sign which helps a great deal when trying to remember it.

I thought the screen shots and demo data was particularly helpful in understanding the basics of how to use Pivot tables. Of course, like anything else, you have to apply your own practical experience to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written (and overpriced) explanation of pivot tables","review":"I bought this book after first beginning to use pivot tables and appreciating how easily they could be used to create and populate tables to present descriptive statistics. I had hoped that this book would show good examples of how to use pivot tables and further understand their features. This book really added very little to the basic understanding that I developed by simply experimenting with Excel and the various commands associated with pivot tables. It really has a low information-to-page ratio. Two much better resources on the topic are the website http://www.datapigtechnologies.com/ExcelMain.htm (really fine FREE online tutorials) or the book Excel Data Analysis: Your Visual Blueprint for Creating and Analyzing Data, Charts and PivotTables that provides quite a bit of information on pivot tables, along with a number of other topics in a much-better written book than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing; Nothing New Here","review":"As an intermediate user, I found nothing new here. I must agree with the other reviews here that state that this book seems rushed.

May be good for beginners, but again, just do Google search on pivot tables an you'll find the same info."},{"rating":"2","title":"More about the how, less about the why","review":"I was hoping to hear more about why I should use pivot tables and under what circumstances they are useful. There is some material on that to be sure but in general the book focuses on how to use the Pivot Table features of Excel. The advanced material is on how to script Pivot Tables using VB. The text is well written. The book is a little screenshot heavy, but you would expect that from this type of book.It's a good book, and it will come in handy for heavy users of this feature. But for those looking for more on data analysis techniques you will probably be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was disappointing. The best part of the book is the section where he describes how to do tasks using the \\"old way\\" -- without Pivot tables -- that is not what I bought this book for!! I agree with the other opinions that state that this book was rushed out in a hurry -- with poor quality. One reason for this is that many of the examples require you to type in your own data instead of providing an example file in the files that you can download from the web site. There are missing or mistaken instructions. I was looking for a step by step example based approach and this book left me scratching my head in many cases. They spent several pages describing the Pivot Table Wizard. But this description is of little value if you don't tie it to an example or examples. Examples are used later, but as I mentioned before, the examples were done in a hurried and sloppy manner. How about testing the instructions in the book with real users next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pivot Tables for Dummies","review":"Save yourself time and money.

Junie B. is bossy, opinionated, and impatient. Her grammar leaves a lot to be desired. She is also laugh-out-loud funny. My daughter and I love talking about how rude Junie's comments can be, and what she should have said instead. And my daughter gets a kick out of Junie's terrible grammar. I don't think a child old enough to enjoy a chapter book will be at all confused about whether or not Junie is talking properly. My daughter loves to read even more since we met Junie B.

My students thoroughly enjoyed the humorous antics of Junie B. as she gets picked for a special job at school. I think that my students especially enjoyed this book because they can relate to Junie B.'s experiences at home and at school. Although the plot of the story kept my students laughing, I was not comfortable with Junie B.'s poor grammar. I know that it's Park's way of conveying Junie B.'s elementary vocabulary, but as a teacher, I don't approve of reading aloud literature that does not promote appropriate grammar.

It just does not make sense.And if you are a parent who understands proper English, it is very hard to read word for word to your child (we usually takes turns reading pages) because the sentence structure is so bad.

Americans are descending into ever worse English and Ms. Park is partly responsible! Why must we lower ourselves to the level of trash instead of uplifting ourselves? Her theory of creating interest in young people by using bad grammar is obviously idiotic from a logical standpoint. Moreover it is lethal for it continues the trend of lowering standards of excellence in this country (look at where our education system ranks)and prepares children for failure. To create interest in reading is important, but it can be done by reading/giving children books about subjects they like, like sports or hobbies or pets. I have done it and it works.

The reviewer seemed to know plenty of other products I have tried so I assumed that this would be good as well. Note that I have only tried it for cleaning and polishing SS surfaces. Here is what I found:-If the surface is dirty it won't clean it. you have to pre-clean the area with something else first (I used a wet sponge, then dried with a kitchen towel).-It is oil. This leaves a film on the surface that you can see, even worst it gets dirtier faster with fingermarks etc because of the very same oily finish.-It has a pleasant orange smell and supposedly can be used for many other kinds of applications around the house.Although I don't know why anyone wouldn't mind all the oily sheen on everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works but . . .","review":"First, it works as advertised.

AND since it's citrus based it biodegrades!Removes crayon on clothes and surfaces, removes grease from clothing. Already washed it and you missed the grease? Just spray it on and apply a litte liquid detergent and then rub. Throw it in the wash and its gone. Removes gum from hair and textiles.I use it to remove candle wax from table cloths, to degrease things in the kitchen, to remove adhesive labels, etc.Add it to warm water in a wash pail and mop the floor.

The pairing of Barnes and Hays was inspired. They were both excellent in their parts, but beyond that, they had a special chemistry.

They needed no frame of reference since all the main characters are from the Revolution or from a specific event. They enjoyed meeting all the players and asking them who, what, where, why, and how. After determining the best information they wrote a newspaper article based on the event and then printed it. The better the newspaper the better the circulation of the paper. My husband and I were very surprised that they have played it as long as they have or as much. These two really like Spyro and Kingdom Hearts, so this was a great deal.

For those who know how the traditional indian hymns sound, the transformation of this song into psychedelic rock comes as a nice surprise. I remember going WOW at that point. I simply loved it. My other favourite is Mystical Machine Gun . Heck I like most of the album. If you do like the Indian theme then I definetly recommend checking out the other album by Kula Shaker, \\"K\\".

While most other bands were rehashing old materiel along comes Kula shaker to fuse rock and ancient hindu music and produce an amazing psychedelic sound. while singing hindu hymns on a rock record might have been a disasterous for alot of bands kula shaker had the talent to make it the mainstream success it was.

The songs taken in part often fail to make the whole. They don't flow but instead bump disjointedly along. These guys are not the Beatles (as a reviewer used for comparison) and the only possible analogy is that the Beatles went thru a Ravi Shankar period but were sensible enough to grow past it. The Indian influence is too much a part of too many songs without a clear reason to tap this style. The vocals lack a crispness as does the guitar work which fails to provide a consistent melody. I've given this a few listens but I cannot recall even a portion of any song. Do not purchase this without a listen first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT SECOND WORK","review":"Sometimes the second album of a new band that began its career with great success, is not the same as the first. Well, this is not the case. Kula Shaker is a band with great potential and with a brilliant future too (being very young the members have a lot to come) Even if you won't find something very different from the previous CD, this one has a great sound and originality that reminds me of the indian phase of the Beatles.The best song is undoubtedly \\"Shower your love\\" followed very closely by \\"108 Battles\\" Also \\"Great Hosannah\\", \\"SOS\\" and \\"Golden Avatar\\" are worth mentioning.

In one big fight scene they have the girls dressed in towels since they were at a spa. Towels?? Where's the tight, skimpy outfits? Preferably in Leather!! And boots!! It's not as if the towels are going to fall off and we'd see something more. This is a PG rated movie. We're not seeing anything more!!

It had a really interesting story line that I had such high hopes for but I just kept feeling like something was missing from the story that Ms. Warren actually wrote. And don't even get me started on the typos and misused words. I think Ms. Warren needs a new proofreader before her next book comes out.

I may never purchase another book by this author again.I did give it two stars because I liked the first half of the story, but the book could have been trimmed almost in half and had a lot better pacing and suspence in the last half of the story.It's almost as if the author had to pump out a larger novel-length story rather than a shorter novella to get paid, which sucked the life out of the story.

It was too many characters and I felt like I had to have a pen ready to write down a new person and their roll just so I could keep up with what the heck was going on. And a lot of the details in the book seemed pointless. Yes, I realize that she wanted the culprit to shock and amaze us, but really? To me it just was doing too much.Now, I have to be honest... I'm not a mystery fan so I bought this book for the romance part and this could be why I didn't enjoy it. Romance was like... 30% of the book while mystery took up the bulk.

I only finished the book on principle- because I bought it and didn't want to waste my money. In my opinion, this is just a BAD book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the love story?","review":"This book is ridiculously overhyped. Instead of telling what would probably be the most interesting part of the story (and the part that would make the rest of the story a little more understandable), the book starts out after Jade and David have broken up and merely chronicles his obsession with her despite all evidence that she doesn't reciprocate his feelings. For all that it's heralded as an honest look at first love, the actual reciprocal love is left out entirely.The hour and a half it took me to read this book would have been better and more enjoyably spent reading the average Harlequin drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross and disgusting","review":"Following this character around for 400 pages was a trial!

This book is not about teenage angst, but teenage stupidity. It's so cliched it makes me want to puke. Just a pathetic softcore harlequin romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't receive credit it deserves","review":"Now we all know what a mess the movie \\"Endless Love\\" was, but unfortunately this book is overshadowed by the film's horrible adaptation. Spencer does an incredible job presenting a story delving into one's psychological mind. He goes into great depth showing how a relationship can be unhealthy and dangerous. Its not a love story; it's a tale of how mental illness affects a man and the people around him: family, friends, and of course the loves of his life, Jade and her family. There is a graphic sex scene I was surprised to see as well as controversial issues slightly covered such as racial stereotypes and integration, drug use and America's radical changes in the 60's and 70's. For people who hated the movie, give the book a chance. For those who haven't seen the book, read the book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"give it a chance...","review":"Scott Spencer has written a confession of love that is so passionate and enduring that by the time you get to the last few lines it literally breaks your heart. Endless Love is the tragic novel about David and Jade- and the crime of loving too much. DON'T see the movie- just read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not die without reading this book","review":"This book absolutely SLAYS me. I've read it numerous times and it is, in my opinion, a masterpiece of modern fiction. The first sentence reels you in, the last page knocks you dead, and everything in between is so amazing and original, I can't even describe it. Just buy it. By the way, when I first saw a picture of author Scott Spencer, I was astonished that he didn't look a thing like David. But that's how true this book seems.This is NOT light romantic reading for sissies--and I despise that silly new cover--but if you are a bright person with a good vocabulary, do not miss this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I remembered watching this movie years ago, and so I decided to read the novel. Ugh, it was awful! So depressing and sad. Not nearly as much of a love story as I thought it would be. I forced myself to finish the book, so that I could form a complete opinion. Not one I would recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding, breathtaking, truly unique experience....","review":"I too thought this book was \\"my little secret!\\" How wonderful to hear from others who feel the same way. One of the few books that have truly broken my heart - I felt changed after I read it. My ideas on love, obsession, living, family, and madness - all were altered by Scott Spencers' suberb, unduplicable writing stye. The intensity of his emotional and physical descriptions, coming from the viewpoint of David, leave you breathless and yearing for more. A masterpiece novel - one of my all time favorites, 15 years after first reading it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intense Trip to Nowhere","review":"After reading Men In Black, I decided to give this \\"classic\\" a spin. Interestingly, my opinion is largely the same.... Spencer's characters don't change much from beginning to end, so for those who expect a book to be a journey, you could be disappointed. However, I don't disagree with any other review in the slightest... I had a lot of trouble putting this book down, and the emotions were of an intensity that's hard to find in a book... There's also a lot of interesting undertones about the psychiatric community... ie: releasing David when his moral character is arguably at its most dangerous. This is an excellent read... just don't expect a wonderous journey from point a to point b... It's actually point a to point a, but a fun time getting there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge a book by it movie...","review":"This book needs a rediscovery. It needs to somehow shake the stigma of a poorly received film adaptation, and be seen for what it is; a beautifully chronicled portrait of love.

He's got a leg up in that the three main characters should all be familiar to Welsh fans, so minimal effort is needed to flesh them out, but in the end the notion that they somehow find love is so far-fetched that I thought it was a joke at first. Imagine Frank Begbie from 'Trainspotting' going soft over a bird and suddenly wanting to escape his violent and nihlistic life (all within the span of two or three pages) and you've got the essential problem I had with this play. The introduction by Welsh is actually the best part.You get the feeling that the lost production costs are being recouped through the sale of this screenplay.

As a bladesmith for more than 30 years, Goddard explains the theory and practice of his craft clearly and simply. The section on what happens to steel during hardening (quenching) and tempering is especially well done which plain old knife enthusiasts (non-metallurgists) will appreciate.For the beginning or intermediate bladesmiths, this book is worth every dollar for the value of the information alone. For inspiration, there are a number of colour plates in the book to display Goddard's lovingly-crafted knives.

By trying to cover both analog and discrete signals all at once, he succeeds only in confusing the reader. Even if he had only tried to cover one of the topics, I'm not sure he would have succeeded. Examples are few and far between - not to mention difficult to follow. Sometimes, he makes reference to equations that have been derived textually and are hidden somewhere in an obscure paragraph.

Also the example problems that are given seem to take the most difficult case instead of a simpler one that could more easily illustrate what is to be learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Text","review":"This is the worst text book that I've used in any course. As a physics senior, I suspected the material in an introductory EE course to be pretty straightforward, which it is. Ambaradar sure doesn't make it that way. With few worked examples, terse explanations and no odd-answered problems Ambaradar makes self-checking and learning almost impossible. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"There must be a better book somewhere for Signals and System","review":"This book isn't a very easy read. I just took a graduate level class which utilized this book, and I and my class mates agree it isn't very easy to follow. Signals and Systems analysis involves some pretty complex material and this book seemed to speed through these complex topics a little to quickly. There weren't enough examples and the examples that were in the book, often bore little resemblance to the homework questions. Bottom line this shouldn't be a one semester (or quarter in my case) course and until university administraters realize this, books like this will continue to be the norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"This book is very subpar. I have found that the examples and explanations are not very helpful. The only way I could do any of the problems was due to my professors. But even then I found the problems to be poorly written and confusing. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because the book seems mostly error free and it is not completely worthless but it is getting there. And why does a 3 inch floppy come included in the book??? My 10 year old computer does not even have a floppy drive! And the book is only a year older than my computer. It probably wouldn't even run on Windows XP. Now that I am thinking about it I am changing my rating from a 2 to a 1 star just because it comes with a floppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this for firewood only","review":"Worst written book I have used in any of my EE courses.

That is what you would usually get as a freebie when you buy a bonus pack or something.I am very disappointed with Dreamworks on this one.

Its attention to nightlife, one of the more enjoyable aspects of Thailand, is dismal. There is a political correctness strewn througout the book, to the point of completely omitting major locales and activities, that is distressing.

We washed them by hand after each use. Then they got used with soda and washed by hand. Shortly after that my family said they wouldn't use them anymore.

Both have outstanding voices and Dick's guitar is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"RCA = junk","review":"As a longtime RCA customer I am very saddened to say that RCA now makes garbage look like gold. RCA's crummy electronics only rivals their non-existant service. No excuse for making an item this poor. This TV in particular is very poor quality because RCA farms out all of their electronics to many different companies (there isn't evan an \\"RCA\\" company any more, just a trademark).

Wu-Tang Clan work rather well both separately and together but basically RZA is holding the fort down seriously. I can't recommend this album for its brilliant piano and string sampling and for the intercultural experiences between Asians and blacks.

The bodywash is excellent. It doesn't have an overwhelming scent. That is what made it appealing to me. I never like cologne's that are \\"heavy\\" scented. In addition to not being overbearing, it has a very masculine smell. No one will be confused with the scent. It is distinctively not feminine and that is more of a reason to purchase Cool Water.

This book answered those key questions for me and gave me many additional resources that I can further explore on my own. The book does not take political sides - it just present the facts and the reality. The book also offers positive life-oriented advice that is always good to follow - with or without this threat of terrorism - but the advice hits home more because of the threat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money and Beyond","review":"I must admit, I have not finished the book, so I cannot say specifically if this book will bring more money into your life.

I have been practicing this whenever I may think of it and it immediately puts me at ease, no matter what the situation. For that alone, it is well worth the book.

Not only does Nadine George-Graves provide fascinating and useful information about the Whitman Sisters, she also discusses, in great detail, the social and cultural circumstances surrounding their historical moment. The information on Toby, the black vaudeville circuit, is invaluable. Much of what George-Graves writes about hasn't been written about elsewhere, making her book all the more unique and important.This is a short book - only 118 pages - but the amount of information it contains makes it indispensible for anyone interested in vaudeville, dance, or African-American theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few new ideas","review":"Sorry, but I do not agree with the reviews of the other two customers (I chose the book due to these comments!).

However, it is just too scattered to be a coherent piece of work.Those of you who have read Shogun and then seen the full version of the mini-series and later the 2-hour version can get an idea of what Tai-Pan is like.The full version of Shogun wasn't perfect (especially because it had to be censored for TV) but was basically good.The 2-hour version of Shogun was almost impossible to follow, even after having read the book and having seen the full version of the mini-series.I do have to admit that Clavell fans will be disappointed, but I still recommend that you watch it.

In fact, one person I spoke with doubted if it even made it to the silver screen and didn't go straight to video. If that did happen, I applaud the film makes for not wasting our time and cash on such an awful film. So much was cut out, key plot points such as the half-coins, and trying to condense such a work into 2 hours just is simply impossible. \\"King Rat\\" was excellent when it was done in 129 minutes, but \\"Tai-Pan\\" was much more complex and deserved at least a two part mini-series like \\"Noble House,\\" and \\"Shogun\\" got.

Noble House could have been better, and the Complete Shogun was more than good. Tai-Pan falls short in so many ways. The screenplay follows the book like some maze running mouse on and acid high. Characters are omitted, continuity is forgotten and if Bryan Brown gets anywhere near a Scotish accent please let me know. I realize Clavell novels don't lend themselves to 2 hour films, except for King Rat which is the shortest I've found, but give me a break.

Moreover, it is written at a level that can be understood by most beginning programmers. The text works very well for an introduction to the requirements, design, and implementation issues, however I felt the chapters on concurrency and data persistance may have been tackling more than he could possibly explain well enough in such limited space. Fortunately, however, these chapters can be skipped without losing much understanding of the later material. His later chapter on implementation issues should not be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I still recomend this book","review":"I read this book years ago, and I still recomend it to people. The book isn't perfect but it is pretty good in a subject area that doesn't have many pretty good books. Some of the other reviewers complained about the lack of many code examples. That is true, but that didn't bother me. At the time that I read this book, I knew how to write programs. I wanted extra help in the analysis and design areas. There were lots of places that I wished the author would go further and cover more but it was a good beginner book. I've read lots of OOAD books that are unintelligable. Jessie Liberty writes in an easy to understand style that keeps you following along. I hope to goes back to write a more advanced book while keeping that easy going manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you buying this book ?","review":"This is a book that covers OO Design in some detail.

I wonder how many days Jesse takes to write this book but I guess it takes no more than two weeks.It is not true that the book is practical actually is no more than a boring and theorical book."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Francophiles and Feline Friends","review":"This book is simply droll and humorous in a Thurber way of writing.Anyone who has or likes cats would find it amusing and if they also know some French, it would be even more amusing.The illustrations are also a plus for this book. It would also make a nice addition to a high school curriculum for French. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sama is perfection","review":"I first heard about this CD of Medtner works by pianist Gunnar Sama through a review of it. The reviewer was the noted pianist/record reviewer John Bell Young who is a top rate virtuoso pianist himself and Scriabin specialist. I can only say that Mr.Young's words certainly rang true when I aquired the CD for myself.Mr. Sama plays this wonderful music with passion and mastery. If you're familiar with Mr. Medtner's piano works then here is an opportunity to hear them presented in the best possible light. If you've not heard his works then this recording is a wonderful opportunity to become familiar with this music interpreted by a performer who obviously has a deep connection with these works.I HIGHLY recommend this wonderful CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read with something for everybody","review":"This is the best piece of erotica I have read in a long while. If it's variety you're after it's all here. Every possible combination of people, location and activities you can think of and a few that you probably wouldn't!The characters are believable and the plot thoroughly entertaining and action packed. Yet there are moments of tenderness and romance too - as I said something for everyone.This book also provides an excellent introduction to the world of sub/dom sex and is bound to be a real eye opener. I promise you it provided me with plenty of bedroom inspiration.Read and enjoy and tell your friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond offensive.","review":"This is an incredibly offensive, obscene and reprehensible costume for anyone, let alone Amazon, to carry.

The story is relational to everyones lives in so many ways! Pete is a visionary and the potrayal of what happens is so on point to the lives of every human being. You will find yourself looking inward and remembering right along with Cool and Charlie. This is as Chatmon calls a REAL \\"New Wave in American Cinema\\" If this is the beginning, than I know we have the Next Great director on our hands. Not to mention the talent and range portrayed by Missick and Saldana. Be on the lookout for these \\"A\\" listers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Premium","review":"I did not like the movie. I think the price was a little to high because the movie was poor. It didn't hold my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Premium was one of the best films I saw last year.In a climate of formulaic plots and predictable storylines, I found Chatmon's writing to be authentic and CREATIVE, two elements often missing in today's cinema. I enjoyed the perfomances of the actors, especially Zoe Saldana. I don't think I have ever been moved by any of her performances until seeing Premium. I really liked her and belived her and I attribute that to direction, once again, Chatmon bringing something fresh to the screen. Dorian Missick was textured and Hil Harper, tangible.I love seeing people of color on screen with purpose and presence. This film delivers that for me and I will buy it to have it alongside the other credible films in my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb actors...average storytelling and production","review":"I absolutely love Hill Harper and adore Zoe Saldana. It is a shame that this is the best that these amazing African American actors can get in terms of work. Hill Harper's character is days away from marrying his beautiful fiance Charli (Zoe Saldana) when Charli runs into her former fiance and still aspiring actor Cool. Cool's reappearance in Charli's life makes her rethink her pending marriage. It's not that this is a completely horrible story, but the story line and production are average at best. These movie is slow in parts and contains out of place comedic scenes that border on buffoonery. Too bad for these amazing actors and some of the other good African American characters in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premium","review":"Oh now I get why they named the movie Premium... cause the guys a filling station attendant... ok... and why was thiy movie EVER made... just BAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm starting get a little disappointed in African American \\"B\\" movies these days.

The material just didn't work for them. The first thing that irked me was the cut to's. If you know how to complete a movie, you shouldn't have to inform me of what's going on inbetween sceenes. I hate that as much as I hate talking on a music CD. I am paying to see a movie that explains itself.

THANK-YOU GEORGE JONES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Belief from a disbeliever","review":"When growing up, my house was always filled with the music of Cash, Lynn, Owens, Clark, William and other giants of 60's and 70's country. As I reached for my own musical taste in my teens, these icons were replaced by Johnny Rotten, Elvis Costello, U2, Devo, Warren Zevon and others. Country music was something I'd just washed out of my hair.Cold, Hard Truth brought to life all the reasons I loved country music and didn't give me a single cliche to kick around. Jones' voice bends phrases like taffy at a fair, plucks emotions I'd forgotten about and brought back memories of Sunday afternoons in our living room with the console stereo where my Dad would play along on a steel guitar while my sister sang at his shoulder.There's more to love in this 34 minute disc than in any ten hours of modern country radio. Truly a classic, truly an unforgettable record. Buy it, borrow it, steal it. Just listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"He is the God of sad country songs!","review":"I guess there's no such thing as a \\"bad\\" George Jones album, but there is something \\"extra special\\" about this one. George's voice just keeps getting better and better, at least it seems that way. We GJ fans tend to think that nothing can top his classics (i.e. \\"He Stopped Loving Her Today\\", etc. etc.) but I think cut #1, \\"Choices\\", is as good as anything he has ever done bar none. \\"Cold Hard Truth\\" and \\"Bed of Roses\\" are not far behind either.The rest of the album is good but these 3 cuts are worth ten times the price of the CD. The raw emotion in George's voice is simply incredible. A box of kleenex should come standard with this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"George Jones gets better and better! Hope he never quits!","review":"George Jones is an icon. His brand of music is all his own and nobody does it like he does.

The \\"Cold Hard Truth\\" is well worth it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Soul of Country Music","review":"There is a God! At last, a true country album with true country instrumentation, arrangements and mix with the vocals out front, not vying with the instruments, (although the instruments are forefront exactly when and where they should be). The songs are almost without exception great songs in classic country style. Jones sings as good as he ever did, interpreting the songs as only Jones can. This album is proof that there are still great country songs being written, great country singers still singing, great country producers, great country musicians, and thankfully, at least one record company who knows real country music when they hear it. Thank you, all of you, for keeping the soul of country music alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Jones CD","review":"This was a used CD it came like new, I love every song on the CD, I would recommend this to anyone that likes country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Country Music","review":"How many times have you heard the expression \\"Haggard And Jones\\" in a song.

I ordered the 75301 Height Adjuster because it looked like a great help for adjusting the motor height from above. But there are no HOLES in the TABLE to pass this Adjuster through! The folks at Porter Cable admit they forgot to provide holes for the 890/891/892 router motor, and they are very nice about this, but told me yes, I really have to drill two holes in the table to use this gadget! The table comes with plenty of other holes to accomodate the attachments, motors, etc. so it seems a shame that they did not make two holes for the ht. adjuster. Actually it's not hard to reach underneath to open and close the locking lever and twist the original height adjuster. I just don't know if I want to drill out the table yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phone system","review":"My son gave my daughter and me this four line V-Tech system. It is great. You can carry one phone around with you while the others are on the bases so you don't have to run to the phone when it rings. We had a cordless phone, but these phones are small. If you misplace one, you can call it and find it by its chirping. Also, if I need to reach my daughter, I can call her through this system.

They don;t have a millimeter of insole, a MM of padding. Nothing. Its just a leather shell and thats it. Don't expect these to be anything as described. If you order a size 9 like I did, you get a shell thats about size 11. You have to wear 2 pairs of socks and have an insole. And they're real wide at the top. They look a litlte like clown shoes. A complete and total waste of time, money and effort. If I lived in an are that had real stores it wouldn't a problem. But shoe stores here in Pittsburgh have 1 pair each of smen's slippers. And they're usually that horrible moccasin thing. Gosh I've learned to hate them. So, I'm, stuck trying to find a decent pair on line. So far, no good.

Profyle's track sounds NOTHING like a new group, as they duplicated Marvin Gaye's effort of \\"What's Goin' On.\\" Tony Rich and Grenique spent much more time and creativity on \\"If This World Were Mine,\\" which pleases the ear after hearing such mindless replicated tunes throughout the first 12 songs of the album.The lack of \\"new-ness\\" is unappreciated on this tribute.

Yes, the PS3 has the capabilities of being a great system, however the games are not taking advantage of the system. The games are basically just better looking PS2 games. The six axis controller adds NOTHING to the game. I think its just a cheap gimmick added on because of Nintendo's controller. And for $600 I have to buy an ADDITIONAL [...] cable to connect to my HDTV? Come on Sony, give us a break. There are also lots of bugs and glitches in the launch titles. It is better to wait until these get hammered out before you spend a huge chunk of change on this questionable system. Don't get me wrong, Sony has potential, but they may have shot themselves in the foot this generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CONSOLE EVER!!!","review":"This is a must have.

The games are obviously beautiful, but the gameplay and storylines of most games are subpar. Yes it's exciting because it's a new system, but it's really nothing new at all. I expect to get bored of it really soon. If you want something awesome, get the Wii. Trust me, now THAT'S a real next generation console. The graphics may not be as great as ps3 or x360, but if you buy games only because the graphics, then maybe video games aren't for you and you should stick to DVDs. Anyway, the ps3 is definitely inferior overall compared to the Wii. Go ahead, take my word for it and sell your ps3 or use the money you were gonna buy it with on a Wii, and have almost 400 bucks leftover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"The PS3 is definitely the best Next Generation gaming system. I own an xbox 360, and it has nothing on the PS3. As soon as more games and online options become available, the PS3 will blow xbox out of the water. Blu Ray is awesome, and the design of the system (with touch sensors) and the sixaxis wireless controller cannot be touched. If trying to choose between a 360 and a ps3, consider whether you want to watch movies in high definition. Blu ray is slightly superior to HD DVD, and if you are planning on buying an HD DVD player with an xbox 360, then you should definitely get a PS3. There is a wider variety of movies out on Blu Ray and the quality is slightly better. Plus, it is built in."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best next generation gaming system!!!","review":"I can't believe the people talking BS about PS3, I buyed a Wii in December and I was very happy with it, I was almost out of buying a PS3 because of all of the bad reviews, The last week I was lucky enough to buy one from Amazon, and OMG! this is awesome, I love the Wii but this is truly \\"the next\\" generation system, INCREDIBLE POWER!!!Just try it out and you will know that you are taking a big step in to the future of gaming..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overheated","review":"Something was wrong with it already.

It doesn't play my playstation 2 games, the graphics still look cartoonish and it does freeze up from time to time. The only plus is the blue ray drive which can play hi-def movies. My take on this is save your money and either go with the XBOX -360 or wait for the prices to come down.

From what I have read on Sony website forum and reviews this is one of the reason they stopped making the 60 GB, seems like they tried to cram to much into the 60 GB version. if you read the fine print on the warranty even on the new PS3's there is only a 1 year warranty, had mine almost two years, the only one that actually lasted the longest was the 20gb, which was my first PS3 when they first came out had over 2 years, and loved it.

One example is the highly anticipated Madden 08 that runs 60 Frames per second on 360 but only half of that, 30 frames per second on the PS3.If you are thinking about getting a PS3, I strongly advise you to rething your decision and get either an XBOX 360 or a Wii (depending on whether you want a better gaming experience or a family friendly console).

So my lesson to you is check your tv for HDMI connection, buy the right game (Fight Night: Round 3 is excellent) and make sure you have the time to enjoy this expensive investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Sony","review":"finally sony has dropped the price on the ps3 now it is affordable i'm so going to buy one now"},{"rating":"2","title":"best console to buy","review":"this truly the best console to buy. the wii is not to be put in the same catogory as the 360 and ps3, but in the catogory of the ps2 and gamecube. the ps3 is perfect except for the price (even though it is worth it) and that for the first 2 weeks, the control sometimes loses the contact with the ps3. other than that, it is the best.Also, unlike the 360, it is good quality. the every one out of three 360 break down. wow..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"Watching my 10 year old play the PS3 just blows me away. The graphicson our 50' Pioneer Plasma (via HDMI) are incredible. The 5.1 DTS soundvia the HK 635 (TOS Link) is just outstanding. We are truly blessed to have 3 incredible gaming systems available to us. I just can't see how one could go wrong. The Wii is a pure fun system. The XBOX 360 is a mature and wonderful platform. Choose a console based on the software titles that interest you. And it's all good. I bought the PS3 based on the established customer base (100+ million strong) and it software library. The BLU ray drive may or may not be an added bonus (Sony has yet to back a winning platform). Played the Wii at the neighbor's house - It was a blast! Tiger Woods golf on the XBOX 360 is stupendous. America enjoy the great choices that we have. No matter what you buy, you will be very happy.

As far as I could see, there was only one left. So, I bought some games, threw down my money, and got the hell out of there as fast as I could. I bought three PS3 games: Resistance, Sonic the Hedgehog (for my sister who says I don't play enough platformers), and Virtua Fighter 5. Resistance is awesome, but Sonic has camera and frame rate issues, and I expected Virtua Fighter to be like old school Mortal Kombat for the SNES (OK, so I was wrong). Even Def Jam Icon is not the same as its predecessors. I guess I'll just have to wait until GTA IV comes out in the fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"ps3 lots of fun and will be more fun when home arrives","review":"if you are looking for an upgrade from your ps2 this thing is awesome. plays blu-ray and lots of fun games so far. i own resistance fall of man, and have played most of the sports games.

Since buying it i have also gotten about 17 blu-ray movies and they are totally worth the difference in quality. I also own a 360 which is great fun too, it also has the only thing that i wish ps3 had=achievements, this should come when HOME comes out.

Its a purely subjective topic that will never end. There are a couple reasons why I got the PS3. I just bought the Samsung LNT4065F 40\\" 1080p LCD HDTV and I wanted something that would really use it. I got the PS3 and Planet Earth on blu-ray right after receiving the TV. The combination was absolutely amazing. I do game so shortly after I picked up Resistance: Fall of Man and Ninja Gaiden Sigma. Both are awesome games in their own right. But really, there are only a few games that I HAVE to play and they are all coming to PS3: Final Fantasy XIII, Metal Gear Solid 4, Resident Evil 5, Devil May Cry 4, Silent Hill 5, and Grand Theft Auto 4. The reason I didn't get a Wii is because everyone else has it including my office so I don't need one. The only reason I wanted Xbox360 was for Gears of War, but thats coming to the PC so I'll wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"playstation in hd","review":"The system is good but I'll be honest I just use the blu ray player, there are no games worth buying.

I figured when comparing the prices of a HD player I might as well go ahead and get the PS3, which is an all in one entertainment system for the same price, if not cheaper, than most HD drives on the market. I haven't been dissapointed yet. The playstation online network is not as good as the xbox, but it gets the job done without having to pay $100 and is continually getting better every month.

If you are looking for a game machine, PS3 just doesn't cut it right now. $500 wasn't worth it when the PS3 launched for the 20GB and it isn't worth it for the 60GB either. Sony is even discontinuing the model and will most likely bring down the 80GB to the same price. So you might as well wait until there are more games for the system worth playing.Get a Wii for a different experience to tide you over until FFXIII, Medal Gear Solid 4, etc come out. Then Uncharted and others will be cheaper and you might be able to get a 120GB PS3 for $499 by that time. I wouldn't recommend the 360 until they get rid of that internal design flaw. Wii has Smash Brothers, Mario Galaxy, Metroid 3, and many other with a whole new way to play that can make parties a blast and even get your parents to play.

Sony's PS3 lacks a scaler to upconvert the signals. So if you buy a game like Resistance which outputs at 720p, you're stuck playing it in non HD, 480p. That's right, rather than scale the game up to 1080i, it downgrades it to no HD. This is unacceptable, the 360 has a bit in upscaler, my cablebox has a built in upscaler, it's not new or expensive technology - why did sony cheap out on this? If I want to play non HD games I would have bought a Wii.

It is not profound, and it doesn't pretend to be, but neither is it full of typical summer-at-the-beach cliches. It captures the lives of several different people, of all ages and backgrounds, who happen to congregate at a beach resort in neighboring houses during one summer in California. With skill and understanding, the author drops us into lives already full of history...and lets us share a small slice of time. It is to her credit that we get so involved with each of the characters that we feel we know them well...from a 17-year-old in the agonies of first love, to a devoted elderly couple facing the spectre of inevitable separation. Even the couple's cat is lovingly described. It has feelings! (As a cat lover, I couldn't help relating.)

A divorced woman faces life as a single mom, while trying not to be bitter. An elderly couple proves that marriage is a wonderful institution. So many other things went on in this book.

Further, her baseless assertion that London's first wife and second wife were happier after his death because he was gone from their lives is wishful thinking. I think his widow might have begged to differ with the good Professor. Professor Stasz but destroys her credibility as a scholar by continually showcasing her assumptions about a man she never knew, colored by her politics.

So I put it aside and just laughed to come here on Amazon. Unlike everyone who thinks this is a gem, I am not gullible enough to think likewise.If Buddha and Jesus met, there would be total silence. That's all. Both individuals know exactly who they are, and I'm sure they will never engage in an intellectual discussion to show who is better. Two beings of love cannot talk with the intellect, only heart to heart conversation is possible. Both beings know the truth in their own way. However, the author is all about philosophy and intellect. Clearly he needs to explore compassion and love a lot more than I thought.Anyhow, good book to laugh at; that's all how I take it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very informative","review":"The key weakness in \\"The Lotus and the Cross\\" is the lack of information about either Buddhism or Christianity. The book seems to be written for Christians who want to learn more about Buddhism. However, the book spends no time introducing Buddhist or Christian ideas before debating them. Most of the points of debate fit into a larger framework in each religion, but this framework is not presented for either Buddhism or Christianity.If anyone is interested in learning more about Buddhism (in a concise form), the book Buddhism A Very Short Introduction, by Damien Keown, is short and inexpensive (maybe a little dry, though). The book Buddhism Plain & Simple, by Steve Hagan is also good. Perhaps a Christian reviewer could recommend a book that gives a brief introduction to Christianity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from Trina Baughn","review":"For someone who knew little about Buddhism, I found Zacharias' perspective very compelling. Though some have stated that he posed a Christain-bias, he has always been one to be respectful and careful in presenting his views."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL BOOK BY AN INSIGHTFUL AUTHOR","review":"I have read three books by Mr. Zacharias to date. His writing is insightful, creative, thought provoking, and real. He is a man of God, and his heart is to serve the Holy Lord.The Lotus & the Cross is just the newest of a great series of books.The book is not one to read lightly, whether you are a Christian, Buddhist, atheist, whatever. I really had to ask myself what I believed in regards to my faith as a Christian. I think that Ravi Zacharias presents a realistic light on Buddha and his teachings, as well as Christ's teachings in regards to Buddhist beliefs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap shot.","review":"A condemnation of Buddhism by a Christian insider who obviously has little experience with Buddhism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, Bad","review":"If I could give this book no stars I would. It did neither Christianity nor Buddhism justice, as if Christ or Buddha would ever be reduced to some sort of competition to \\"save\\" a prostitute. I was very disappointed with this book. Although this book was written biased toward Christianity, it was obvious that Ravi Zacharias doesn't have a thorough knowledge of either Buddhism or Christianity. It was an interesting idea-horribly executed. If you are interested in knowing more about Buddhism or similarities and differences between Christianity and Buddhism read Thich nhat Hanh or books by HH the Dalai Lama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea...","review":"The book is short, interesting and flows pretty well with rather simple concepts so its easy to read.If you are a Christian who believes everyone should be Christian, accept Christ and such you will like the book since it is essentially a \\"sales tool\\" intended to steer people away from Buddhism toward Christianity.If you are agnostic, you might find the book interesting as it does touch on both faiths/religions/beliefs/whatever even if geared toward delivering the reader to Christ.If you are Buddhist (like me) you will see it for what it is, accept that the author only wants to \\"save\\" people and probably means no harm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not buy or give this book away!","review":"As a disciple of Jesus and a friend of Buddhists, I was utterly horrified by this book. I have quite a collection of Ravi's writings and have loved them all up until now...He is a brilliant man and sincere believer, but I think he stepped out too quickly without doing proper research for this project. I have spent years traveling through India, Nepal & Thailand and have known Buddhists of many backgrounds. I have also taught a class on world religions in my local church in order to equip people to understand their neighbors and share their faith in relevant ways. To those who feel that negative reviews against this book are due to \\"closed minds\\" against solid Biblical faith, please do not fall into this trap. It truly is poor research and paints an incorrect characterization of buddhism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with misunderstanding","review":"For the record, I have been studying comparative world religion for 7 years. This is *not* a book for someone interested in knowing how Christianity and Buddhism relate to each other. This is a book that demeans and skews the teachings of the Buddha in order to serve a narrow Christian agenda. There is no true attempt to portray an accurate view of the Buddha's teachings, but, instead, a poorly veiled attempt to show why Buddhism is 'wrong.' It is utter anti-Buddhist propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Closed Mind","review":"This book has nothing to do with Buddhism, it's intended as polemic against Buddhists and Buddhism. I could write a book about Christ and put words in his mouth to make him seem foolish but that would have nothing to do with what he taught!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A deeply dishonest book","review":"Zacharias plays the puppet-master, manipulating his Buddha and Jesus characters to reach his own predetermined conclusion. He is neither fair nor honest in his depiction of the imaginery dialogues, misrepresenting Buddhism and giving a merely conventional depiction of Christianity that omits any hint from contemporary scholarship about the questionable authorship and authenticity of many biblical passages. Buddhists who read this book will not recognize the Buddha they know, while Christians will be deceived. Zacharias should do long penance for writing this tendentious piece of propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misleading characterization of the Buddha and Buddhism","review":"Anyone familiar with the basic story, tenets and spiritual principles of Buddhism would feel deep sorrow for how profoundly Zacharias misrepresents them. This sort of propaganda is disturbing. I invite anyone interested in learning about the ineptitude of Christian interpretations of other faiths to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Opportunity","review":"This author is not qualified to speak for either person he represents in this book.The 'book' itself is itself more of a script for a play you might see put on in a church basement by the youth group than a book. In the forward, the author says that he spent 'scores of hours' studying Buddhism. Broken down, that translates to, at the very least, 60 hours. Not nearly enough, in my estimation, to be putting words in the mouth of the Buddha. And the insulting and belittling fashion in which he portrays Jesus is also disconcerting. With the audience Mister Zacharias commands, I was disappointed with the squandered opportunity. This had the potential to be something special but, in the end, it's wrong-headed & needlessly sneering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buddha and Paul; NOT Buddha and Jesus","review":"As a Christian, I found this book more than a little disturbing. It is not a dialogue between the Buddha and Jesus: It is a dialogue between the Buddha and St. Paul, posing as Jesus.Zacharias' conflation of the personalities and teachings of Jesus and St. Paul is intellectually dishonest and theologically untenable. What Zacharias ends up preaching would be better termed \\"Paulianity,\\" a theology in which Paul substitutes in toto for Jesus Christ.While Paul's message about the Risen Christ is of course central to our understanding of Jesus' living ministry during his time on Earth, Zacharias commits a grave error, and a gross simplification of Christianity, by presenting Paul and Jesus, and their respective teachings, as one and the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not read this book.","review":"Ravi Zacharias writes with a mission, namely to discount the similarities and possibile interconnectedness of Christianity and Buddhism. If you wish to determine the relationship between these two major religions for yourself, please read something else more historical or factual. His arguments are specious as he has an incomplete understanding of Buddhism, and seemingly even his own Christian religion. This book is propaganda, not research or fact. There are many inaccuracies and things overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"This was a solid book. I think Ravi does a good job of trying to capture the Mind of Christ.

After reading this book I realized that there certainly must be more to Buddhism than the simplistic, make-believe dialog of Mr. Zacharias's book, so I purchased and read several books by Thich Nat Hahn, and also the wonderful book \\"Radient Mind\\" edited by Jean Smith. My friends intentions were certainly good, and they led me to following a path that ultimately has increased my spirituality, and also strengthened my relationship with God. I can only reccomend this book to those that may be questioning Christian Fundamentalism, as reading this book with an open mind can only help one to further their search by looking beyond Ravi's incorrect, biased, disrespectful, and closed-minded viewpoints. I am grateful that through the bad taste left in my mouth after reading this book, the veil has been lifted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you know ANYTHING about Buddhism don't bother with this","review":"I was recommended this book by a Pentecostal colleague who thought I might enjoy it once he learned I was Buddhist. I was let down. The author writes from the extreme Christian view- no one is right other than Jesus & Christianity. It was an argument not a talk & it was an insult to anyone who has studied both.

It was well written with plenty of illustrations and give the reader a good background on the topic. It deals with the legend of Atlantis the Pyramids, Stonehenge, Nazca Planes, and the believe in a hollow earth. It is a good overview of the topic and mentions several other authors and books that one could look into to investigate further. I also does not simply promote the beliefs uncritically but rather gives a balanced view talking about those that do not agree with the ideas also.

By Thursday I was charging the battery again, and we had been on vacation those days and not at home! The distance quality seemed to be pretty good.

Thats gotta be close to half the desktops that are made now-a-days that this KVM won't work with. As of this writing they do not have a firmware fix and no ETA on when one will be released.

For a while I was using an old Linksys KVM to switch one monitor between the 3 computers and then a second dedicated monitor on the 'main' machine - it worked better than it sounds.The switch itself has nice video output. I don't see any ghosting or weird analog issues. What I do have a problem with is the keyboard and mouse output.I don't consider myself a gamer per se, but I do enjoy playing my Skyrim. Doing so is impossible on this switch. It is doing some kind of weird keyboard emulation that prevents or completely strips key strokes/key holds. The typematic (repeat) rate is HORRIBLY slow.Not to mention the switch seems to be dropping keystrokes while I am typing this review.I would NOT purchase this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good information but....","review":"I thought this book had good information but found it hard to read.

Translated by Thupten Jinpa, the principal English translator for His Holiness the Dalai Lama, this work is a gift to those of us who speak English. The passages are clear and lucid. The elements of verse flow and the prose is elegant in its force and simplicity. This book could have been a nightmare to read, because the subject matter is not simple, and anyone who has read translations of Sanskrit, Pali or Tibetan knows that many texts come across twisted and convoluted in English. As such, it can be difficult to ascertain meaning. Such is not the case here.This book can be read at long sittings, or picked up and perused for 5 minutes to create grist for your meditative practice. Either way, it is an indispensible reference for serious students of Tibetan Buddhism, with extensive end notes and a comprehensive glossary."},{"rating":"2","title":"great compilation","review":"this is a great compilation for nazareth fans. this cd not only covers the great early seventies phase but it also covers the early eighties period with John locke and Billy rankin and beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"requires a HUGE compressor","review":"Requires a HUGE compressor and 6CFM is a lot of air.

The accounts in this book are grossly exaggerated, the narrative is uncoherent, the language is mostly flat, the description is unexiting and altogether I give it thumbs down.

We have a lot of traditional older women in Iran and I've met a lot of them myself but what Karym's mother does is unheard of. Uncle Jamshid is another big flaw. Very few people go prostitude hunting with their uncles. The relationships between a father or an uncle with son or nephew are very formal and distant.

While the first twenty-four tracks are not entirely unenjoyable, those tracks are short, usually no more than a minute in length. Additionally, the two complete songs tacked on to the end are hardly the best tracks from the movie, and don't add much value.

Never for Sinatra the frankly vulgar ways some modern recording artists attempt to wring emotion from every word.I'm a fan of Sinatra singing swing, preferably with the Count Basie Orchestra, but the orchestrations here are perfect for a set list of melancholy pieces.

The number 2 button went bad on the existing handheld and this was the least expensive way to replace it. This is a servicable and inexpensive 2-line system. The voice quality isn't all that good. The buttons on the handhelds are too small, somewhat confusing and hard to press -- but it's generally OK. For those reasons, I wouldn't choose it for families with older people or youngsters.

Also, the headsets, which are not cheap, fall apart and Vtech refuses to address the problem.

Not only is there an echo of my own voice in the earpiece, but it picks up every little sound from the room and amplifies it. It is also very difficult to hear the person on the other end.

It will definitely stay in my library as a reference on SQL Server."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice introduction through stored procedures","review":"There is a nice introduction in this book that sets up the basics of .NET access right in the first chapter. It then drills into ADO.NET, commands and finally into readers. There are a few chapters on Windows Forms and ASP.NET before the author gets into stored procedures. These could probably have been dropped, but they don't distract too much. The section on stored procedures is a little scanty.Definitely a good book for someone just starting with database access in .NET who wants a step-by-step walkthrough. There is a small section on database fundamentals, but I wouldn't look to the book to teach you that.

You have to pose him like the picture just to get his missile to stay in there.The Shield, which is by far is signature \\"Weapon\\", can't fit on him at all, it didn't have anything on the shield to grab on to with mine. It had a hole and thats about it. I tried everything to get him to hold it and finally had to use Super Glue.Sorry Jaz.

Are they a rock band? Well none of their recorded material particuarly rocks, perhaps at one point they conceived their songs as rock n'roll, but they've been so probed and prodded in production so that they can be played on commercial radio that they hardly resemble rock at all. Are their songs ballads? Well they're almost too fast and up-tempo to be ballads. No, Matchbox 20 have successfully managed to carve their own niche in the music industry, a new genre called bland. And when I meet people who like their music I think they're bland too. One day the fallen phoenix of Punk will rise from the ashes and the memory of Matchbox 20 will seem as if it was just one more bad acid trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matchbox Twenty","review":"Its great that they released this as a single!

Definitely!","review":"The story of Sheikh Adnan Alkaissy is a good one. He ws born in Iraq and was able to become a top amateur wrestler before heading to the US and joining the professional wrestling circuit.It is an amazing story, I don't know how much of it is exaggerated, but it is still a top read. The Sheikh tells us his life story and gives us glimpses into life in Iraq when he was living there.He does not dish the dirt on the wrestlers but tells a simple story of the terror in Iraq, the life of a wrestler in the US and his thoughts on where Iraq will go in the future.Worth buying for the stories of him wrestling in Iraq and his former friend Saddam."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"work\\" of fiction","review":"I haven't quite finished this book yet, but what I've read thus far is maybe 10% fact and 90% fiction. Sure, making up stories about links to famous people makes for more interesting reading, but personally I'd be more interested in hearing the real story. It becomes a lot more readable once he gets to the AWA years. Not the worst book on pro-wrestling by far, but not in the top 50% either. Oh, and I'm not impressed that relatives were able to get signed copies. LOL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Aussie Rock!","review":"One of Australia's greatest pub bands, this is the Angels in top form. Much like AC/DC, the Angels seem to work to a formula, so you'll never be surprised by the music, and if you like the formula you'll seldom be disappointed. There's nothing light and airy about this album, it's all dark rock, with the pick being \\"Man There\\", and the disappointment probably \\"We Gotta Get Outa This Place\\", which is a cover anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Identity","review":"Great album, just not what I was expecting. Every now and then you hear how big bands play in small clubs under a fake name to avoid thousands of fans which the club can't accomodate. The Angels \\"Howling\\" album felt kind of like that. Only in this case it felt more like a classic rock band acting out their Secret-Identity as a trendy 80's band, with stylish hair and keyboards! Wasn't prepared for the sound but like all their other albums, I soon became hooked with their ability to continually write brilliant songs. It's too bad this album didn't get the air-play in the states that it deserved, because it would have influenced trendy, big-hair, keyboard bands of the 80's into writing better material. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Covers many different topics","review":"This book is comprised of several article that cover many issues of Violence Against Women. This book is a good resource when you are trying prepare a report or presentation on violence against women. This book is not for recovery, but is designed for education on the subject.The writting is clear and concise. She puts together many compelling studies on the subject of violence against women. The book is filled with statistics that give a very compelling argument that violence against women is a crime against not only the individual and society itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I do not recommend Men of Sac & the B-36, most of the DVD is silent and you do not know what is carrying on, scenes are repetitive and very boring; narration would have helped a lot.

The second part of the video showed views of the B-36 taking off, flying, and landing, and B-36 air crews. In some cases, in the second part of the video, it seemed like the same parts of film were being used over and over again just to add to length to the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't look anything like the character.","review":"This item does not look this good in real life.

Grating. \\"Where's the music coming from\\" is more interesting. The producers tried for a Petula Clark-like arrangement, and Georgia plays (sings) along as best she can. It probably should have been the plug side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect if you like to step but want something simple!!!","review":"I do step in my aerobics class but don't pick up on the choreography as quickly as some of the other girls do. I was hoping to practice a bit at home and was pleasantly surprised by this workout. While some workouts have you so confused when you first try them that you're not even able to get much exercise, this one is relatively easy to follow the first time through and you get your heartrate up - even if you're not hitting every step perfectly. It's also a good, solid length - approx one hour including the warm-up and cool-down. The workout is designed so that you keep building on the steps you've learned as you go along, so you can always just do part of it the first time and pick up on the rest of it next time through if you prefer. People who love the \\"dancier\\" stuff will probably find this way too boring, but if you just want a good step workout without all the \\"jazzy\\" stuff, then this workout is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gin is still my favorite!!!","review":"She does it again with this video. Basic moves, lots of repetition and her funny commentary to go along with it. It's over an hour long but you feel great afterwards. Some of transitions from each move gave me a little trouble (I am a seasoned stepper) but once you get the hang of it, it's great. And, though its over an hour, not boring and dragging on. She keeps you moving and that heart rate up. I own several of Gin's videos/dvds and rotate them throughout the week. I recently had a baby and not only did I lose my baby weight but I am in better shape than before. She is consistently good and gives good instruction. In this video she is alone in a studio, I liked it way better than her being in a warehouse with all the TV monitors, the band, etc. Lets you concentrate on the step and keeps you motivated. Would highly recommend!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My mistake","review":"I thought that since it was named \\"Simply Step: Classic Moves\\" that it would be aimed at beginners as well as old timers. I am just beginning to work with a step and this DVD was way over my head and my heart. I am now looking for someone to give it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"simple stepping","review":"This has very simple stepping moves but still a good workout. She isnt annoying but I wouldnt call it fun and dancy- more of a basic aerobic workout without the dance choreography. I think the dancing makes step fun so this isnt really for me, a bit too boring... but if you want something where you dont have to think- and still get a good workout with an instructor who delivers clear cues and is not annoying in any way (at least I dont think so)- then this is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too boring and simple","review":"I love step and have been doing it for over 5 years in group class. After I moved to another city, I started to do step at home therefore bought this dvd. The reviews seem good, so I chose it, but I honestly don't like this dvd after I used it. The movements are very boring and tedious, and the music is horrible (don't have good strong bits, and couldn't cheer me up at all). The timing of her commands is fine, but she talked too much especially after I've tried once. I couldn't wait to finish every time I practice with this dvd, other than enjoying doing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible audio quality","review":"I cannot use this DVD because I cannot stand to listen to the garbled audio.

It is dreadful."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply step: classic moves","review":"This dvd was damaged, and would not play...even though it was brand new. I exchanged it for another and it was damaged and would not play either. I returned it and I'm still not sure if Amazon credited my account properly...I spent more time on the phone w/ Amazon and at the post office than I would have doing the exercise tape.

You are moving all the time and easy to understand so you don't get lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work out","review":"This work out is just what the title says, Classic Step Moves. The moves maybe simple, but the pace and repetition give you a great work out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout, Basic Steps, Needs Better Music","review":"I regularly attend step aerobics class and recently purchased a bench for home. This is my first step DVD and I was very happy with it. Gin uses basic steps but at a good pace so you definitely get a workout. My only objection (and the reason I didn't give it five stars) was the music. Adding some upbeat contemporary music would be great as opposed to the non-lyrics music that accompanied the moves. From now on, I will use my ipod with headphones, mute the DVD, and just follow Gin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Refresher!","review":"It's been quite a while since I've done any step aerobics on a consistent basis. This tape is just what I needed to refresh my memory on basic moves, but it is still challenging because it is LONG! Probably not something a seasoned stepper would enjoy, but it was perfect for me and my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable fun toy","review":"My daughter (5) is very into unicorns right now.

Being a big fan of Byrd, I just added it to my collection and I have to say that it just may be my second favorite album he did as a leader (Byrd in Flight being my personal favorite). As always the fabulous Duke Pearson is AWESOME to say the least as are the others - Mclean, Watkins, Humphries. It is too bad Watkins had to leave this earth way too soon.

When I finally received and read my \\"translated into English\\" copy, I was disappointed. I think my hopes were a little high, hearing about how \\"funny\\" the book is - perhaps like some of Bill Bryson's books. The book is poorly edited, and I believe that a lot of what may be enjoyable in the Italian language version is lost in the translation. For Italians(and others) interested in America, the Italian language version might be a very good choice. Otherwise, I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everglades a nice return to a series I had abandoned","review":"I have been a fan of Randy Wayne White since I first read his columns in Outside magazine. I loved the early books in the Doc Ford series, but felt that they took a dark and offensively misogynist turn somewhere around North of Havana. I stopped reading them after The Mangrove Coast. I joked to a friend that the author must be going through a nasty divorce or something, because he seemed to have a compelling need to torture, maim, and/or kill every female character in his books. However, a friend who shared my love of the early books and has continued to read the subsequent books, gave me a copy of Everglades, saying that she thought I would like this one. She was right. I did like it. And I especially appreciated that the main female character didn't die, or lose a limb, or become permanently disfigured. I liked it enough that I'm going to give the author's latest book, Tampa Burns, a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never been to Florida","review":"I sailed into RWW a little over a year ago and have since been hooked.

Where do I get a copy of ONE FATHOM ABOVE SEA LEVEL?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everglades","review":"I discovered Randy Wayne White fairly early on. Doc Ford is my favorite fictional protagonist and so I eagerly await release of each new work featuring him. I have now gone back and begun buying all of the Doc Ford novels in Hardcover. The one thing that I do recommend is that readers start in the beginning with \\"Sanibel Flats\\" as Ford (and White as author) have progressed with each installment. Not that \\"Everglades\\" can not stand on its on, it certainly can but the back story of the character makes for a fuller enjoyment of the novel. One can not go wrong with Randy Wayne White."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Green Flash","review":"Many years ago, John D MacDonald introduced me to the green flash. I've now seen it, if only on the cover of this book. The author's photo glows with the green light at sunset and his book echoes strongly with the convictions first aired by MacDonald. A little too much editorializing, but still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"gimmick\\" that actually lives up to expectations","review":"Admittedly, this product is a good way to get funny looks at the gym. But after using it in the 06-07 offseason, I played my first hardball season in many years with zero arm pain. I have not explored the suggested workouts on the accompanying video, so I can't rate that element.

Y'know, kind of an introduction to who Jesus is. What I found was a powerful call to all Christians, young and old, to know Jesus. Joseph Stowell does an outstanding job of compelling us to draw near to the Lord. All of the \\"things\\" that we think are so important are really worthless next to knowing Him. Even our Christian \\"things\\" can cloud what is the true call of a Christian. The chapters on \\"having Jesus\\" and \\"the fellowhsip of His sufferings\\" are life changing. Get this book and get a new passion for knowing Christ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging","review":"This is a very short but powerful book that tells how to know Jesus better.

Aside from so many books and rules and regulations so many people have placed on learning more about our Savior, this book makes it fool-proof and a most-welcoming experience. It's an easy, down-to-earth read.

This is not a slash around killing game, it is a puzzle and thinking game. You walk around picking up things, talking to people, doing things a certain way to see what happens. You can get killed in this game, so be sure to save often, your last save point is where you will start again if you are killed. You need a memory card to save with this game! I did get stuck in the game several times, at least 3 times and had to write to Nintendo to find out how to proceed! But with their help I made it to the very end. This game is appropriate for children that can read, as you must read to play the game, and there is no goulish violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a challenge to your common sense!","review":"the game is very challenging there is no one on one combat per say but you must use your thought process & common sense. In this game what you see is what you get!

It offers variety in matter and can absorb you in the puzzle solving process. Interesting characters and areas to explore, with something to accomplish in each. I recommend it for all ages that like to think or use their mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best game I have ever played!","review":"Finaly a game that uses your brain.

A lovely performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous and stunning","review":"I saw Raquel Bitton at Carnegie Hall 2 weeks ago,It was the best concert ever. She is so great! My 20 year old daughter cried and laughed and had the best time and we bought the CD. We love it! One of your guest reviewers spelled Piaf wrong,it's with one F not 2 and he says that the songs were murdered with English translations. Is he out of his mind? I own a Piaf recording where Piaf sings \\"I shouldn't care\\" in English,Raquel does a much better job. Also \\"I shouldn't care\\" and \\"J'm'en fous pas mal\\" are the same song,same melody,the orchestrations are so great that it seems like a different song,but it is not.Raquel Bitton you are one of a kind. We can't hardly wait for the next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage sounds made new again","review":"Raquel Bitton's very competent singing in this album not only imbues new meanings to songs associated with Piaf, but also stays true to the vintage nuance of the music of this period. She sings with great feeling without becoming maudlin or mawkish -- a malady that befalls less secure singers tackling the same song materials. Her voice is one with the musical drama of \\"Le Chemin des Forains\\", the still beauty of \\"Mon Legionaire\\", the heartbreaking \\"Pleure Pas\\" and the heartfelt \\"T'es beau tu sais\\" which she also covered in her other great album called \\"I Wish You Love\\". Her vibrato is very appealing and she uses it more as a musical accent rather than to ape Piaf. Bob Holloway should be lauded for his fierce musical vision of creating the period through beautifully re-imagined arrangements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitton does Piaf--in English, malheureusement!","review":"Do not be mislead regarding this CD. While I cannot find technical fault with the artist, the CD is a mishmash of English and French which ruins this collection! I have no idea why the prodcuers felt the French songs had to be badly translated into English. To say that, for example, \\"J m'en fou pas mal\\" can be rendered as \\"I shouldn't care\\" is doing a grave injustice to the original. This and similar CD's need to carry warning labels that the original work has been altered. Ms. Bitton should have stuck to French."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Answer Reviewer Robert C.","review":"I wouldn't boast of orchestration on this CD.

I bought this one because it was relatively cheap, although I was hesitant because it did not have temperature control. But it worked well using small sections of hair.The waves look fabulous. I wrap my hair is a silk cap every night and they seem to be lasting (3 days). It took me along time to do my hair because it is long and thick.

Decided to just order this one from amazon since I only had to pay $3.99 for overnight shipping with amazon prime and it also had good reviews. It definately does the job, but I highly suggest have some gel or mousse dried in your hair first to help hold the crimper and to get it to crimp faster. It takes about 2 mins per bunch of hair to get a good crimp/wave and I have medium to fine hair. I do put it on the highest temp, which I know isn't good but I use heat protection spray.

This CD presents 18 of them and runs for 60 minutes. Of the eight Lehar items, four are sung in English, and Lehar himself is the conductor in another of them. The recordings date from 1927 to 1939.

The batteries get extremely hot while charging, almost too hot to touch. With my old charger (an ancient Radioshack charger), the batteries would last about 5 years and would never get hot. With this one, I'm lucky if I get even 6 months. I am using the same brand batteries as this charger (Duracell). I'm back to using the old charger, and I've had to replace the batteries that were fried by this charger. Stay away from 15 minute chargers at all costs and get a charger that takes at least 2 hours, and make sure it has an automatic shut-off (not just a timer) to prevent overcharging.

As a student of history, I have heard of most of the royal mistresses mentioned but this was a great new way of telling the stories. It was almost like reading a girls gossip ring on paper and I couldn't put it down. I couldn't believe some of the things these men and women got away with!All in all a GREAT book! A must have for anyone interested in history or royalty."},{"rating":"2","title":"The king's mistress","review":"This is a breezy telling of the somewhat spotted history of royal mistresses, from King David & Bathsheba down to Prince Charles & Camilla. There's a rather light-hearted approach to the subject, but it does go into detail of the lives of the women who seduced, or were seduced by, various monarchs. Interwoven in the tale is much of European history, and a lot of diplomacy which was occasionally (mis)managed by politically ambitious mistresses. The ends of mistresses varied greatly, from death in childbirth, to dismissal with pensions or not, to long lives with their husbands, to early death from illness, to being murdered. The story of the Duke and Dutchess of Windsor is particularly interesting, for it puts a different slant on that affair than I had ever considered, and for that bit of information alone I consider the book well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Sex with the Queen\\" is Better...","review":"I was rather disappointed in this book. It was not well organized at all. Too much time is given to the same kings (Louis XIV and Charles II) and mistresses and the book jumps all over the place in general, which is a major distraction. I can't believe she spent so little time on Edward VII, arguably one of the most randy kings in history. The barest mention is made of any king prior to Charles II. And there is hardly any mention of Russian Czars and their mistresses. Her follow-up book, \\"Sex with the Queen\\", is MUCH better. She put that book in chronological order, which I think would have served this material much better. It would indeed have been interesting to see the development of the mistress' powers throughout the centuries. This book is OK, but not the page-turner it could have been. Do yourself a favor and buy \\"Sex with the Queen\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book This Summer!","review":"As a student of history, I thought I knew everything there is to know about the personal lives of European royalty. Eleanor Herman is obviously a researcher and historian of great talents, because I learned more about the great royal courtesans from her book than I had discovered from any other single source. And here is the really great thing about this book: it's wildly entertaining! I wish more historians had such a sense of humor about their subjects--we'd all be more educated about the past. The author treats her subjects with great dignity and respect, yet never forgets that the mistresses were, at their core, entertainers themselves. This is a stylish and comprehensive romp through the bedrooms of kings that I enjoyed immensely and will recommend to everyone I know. SEX WITH KINGS is a breath of fresh air that blows the dust off of history shelves. BRAVA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money - a racy title and not much else...","review":"The construction of the book is quite poor. It jumps around too much by having too many people in a topic, with those people reappear again and again in different topics. The first few chapters were especially confusing as I had a difficult time trying to remember who is whose mistress. The author might have done better to devote one chapter for each mistress and detailing her story. Afterall, her focus seems to be on, first, the Versailles court (especially Louis 14 and 15), and then the English court. Material on other countries appear to be fillers for each chapter.I was already losing interest halfway through the book. Much of the information is too repetitive. It would probably be more interesting to read a book on the French kings, the Versailles court, or even the mistresses themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous Sex scene","review":"This book was dumb.

The way the author wove together the unbelievable-but-true tales of royal mistresses was unique and created a real page-turner that I did not want to put down. I found that I could not keep this book to myself so I started reading it aloud to my husband (who couldn't get enough of it) and calling my sisters to read a few passages over the telephone. There is so much wonderful content at the end of the book also -- I enjoyed reading about how the author came to write the book and her comparison of royal mistresses with their modern day counterparts - pop stars. I give this book my highest recommendation. I will be reading EVERYTHING from this masterful author.MarilynAttorney, Orlando"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly laid out!","review":"Very disappointing!

My vacation was much better without this snoozer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishy, but certainly not academic","review":"While the book is a 'fun' read, the author is certainly not an academic. I had no problems with the way her book was laid out, as some have complained -- it was thematic, so it would have made little sense to tell story after story of random mistress -- the way she did it was preferable to that. The author's citing is sparse so it seems as though there is no credible source for some story or fact. Additionally, her sources are all secondary, so she's positing theories based on other academics work/theories. While the subject is one of interest to many, of course, I do hope Ms. Herman does not consider herself an academic or historian, as she certainly is not that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential is there....just needs more work","review":"This book has lots of tid bits of relationships between the kings and their mistresses. The information seems to be well recorded but the composition of the book is more than I could take. There were times that I was clueless as to whom she was speaking of because the wording jumps around from one person to another and is not clear. That made it hard for me to follow. There are endless notes and reference information that can get annoying after some time. All in all the information that is presented is interesting. It is just the way it is presented that I had trouble with. Keep writing, I believe you may have better luck next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Overall this book is packed with juicy gossip and funny stories of an extremely interesting, although difficult, lifestyle during various times in Europe.If you are interested in getting a quick understanding of the royal mistress's duties, lifestyle, struggles and heartache this book is great. But it is an overview so if you are looking to understand these women as individuals with desires and needs you will have to look elsewhere. Fortunately the author has a great bibliography in the back of the book in which she recommends additional reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself a few bucks and borrow it from the library....","review":"Because I'm going to be donating it the next time I clear off my bookshelves. This book had a pretty good start, but became increasingly painful to read. I put it down halfway through and haven't bothered to pick it back up.As someone already noted, the author does not stick to any sort of chronological order. At any given paragraph, expect to be dragged out of the 16th century, plopped down in the 19th century, only to be abruptly yanked back into the 16th century, but in someone else's court. It's confusing, it's annoying, it's infuriating, and ultimately, it's a turn-off. Which is a pity, because she really does seem to have done her research, gathered a lot of racy, delicious, sometimes malicious details, but has managed to turn it into so much air-headed fluff.I consider this book several hours of my life that I will never get back...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rex Sex","review":"If you are looking for salacious, sexy history, don't bother to read \\"Sex with Kings.\\" The title is the best thing about the book. Although the author examines the lives and times of royal mistresses from the 15th century to the present, she does not inbue her history with any raciness or sense of the personalities involved at all. This is just rather routine recitations of the perks and pains of being a maitresse en titre. The book is organized by topic rather than chronologically, which makes for confusion and a rather choppy read. All in all, a stronger come-on than pay-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but...","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book, but when I saw the photo of the author in a costume, I started to worry.

I was looking forward to reading this book too. However, the book was not an interesting read. The store line was dull and uninteresting and so repetitive.

Sex with great figures of history, Kings, is even more interesting. To me, this was a fascinating read. I enjoyed reading about the trials the mistresses went through, and even sympathized with them. I actually wish there had been more on Camilla, the mistress of Prince Charles, but oh well. I think the most intriguing mistresses were Louis XIV's mistresses. The book was informative on what the life of a mistress was like, the public's feelings towards mistresses, what happened to royal bastards, things like that. It's intersting that some mistresses, such as Madame Pompadour who ran the Seven Years War, shaped history. Others were fostered on the king so as to gain political influence such as Louise de Keroualle from France who was mistress to Charles II, basically she was a pawn of the king of France and tried to influence Charles II.

This is tremendously important because many MDs, psychopharmacologists included,take a casual, potentially damaging approach to the process of discontinuing these meds.I found the book very well intentioned, but redundant. Glenmullen makes a set of points over and over again, yet he doesn't deal at all with other relevant issues, i.e. nutritional supplements which have been found helpful to patients weaning off these medications. Although the subtitle of his first book, \\"Prozac Backlash\\"suggests that it covers \\"effective alternatives\\" there is no mention whatsoever of alternative approaches here.

The book is obviously biased against SSRI's and for good reason--they are overprescribed and cause unnecessary harm. Before you go on meds, read this as a warning...I personally did benefit in some ways from SSRI but wish I could have avoided it...impossible with current medical system.

It is written by telling, \\"Jane's story\\" and \\"Mary's story\\" etc. etc. I personally find this annoying, especially considering how varied antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is for each individual. Also, the \\"tapering\\" or \\"wean\\" schedules/recommendations are only good if you live in the US and maybe the UK. Many of the medications recommended to assist you in tapering off your specific medication are not available in the immediate release/ liquid formulations here in Canada.

That one also had a defect that caused the bottom left of the display to curve in just enough to be annoying. No amount of adjustment could completely compensate for it.Back to Staples for a third time to return it for refund.

He is also one of the more recent hurlers of a perfect game. Browning played almost his entire career for the Reds, and in this book, published shortly after Browning was elected to the Reds Hall of Fame, Browning recounts some of his adventures with the Reds.Browning uses clean language to relate anecdotes from his baseball life, and manages to tell quite a few entertaining tales from behind the scenes. He came up with the Reds when Pete Rose was managing, and was there for the short-lived Tony Perez regime, and the Lou Piniella led Reds teams from the early 1990s.

It has less story more information. This book spends lots of lines to explain some small points which is boring for someone who should know these stories before starting graduate studies.

I didn't actually LOSE my marble (rolling pin, of course) - the cats knocked it on the floor and the handle cracked. This is a fairly worthy replacement however. Even though the thing is HUGE, it's not quite as heavy as my more traditionally-sized marble one which is a drawback - if the pin is heavy, it does all the work so you don't have to. But it's super long which I love, and it rolls just as well as you could expect a pin should.Secondarily, when I lived alone, I used to keep a Maglite D-Cell flashlight under the pillow in my bed - I figured would-be attackers would, at the very least, get a bump on the head and a surprise if they broke in.

I live in the Greater Houston, TX, area, and read the authors' motel recommendation on US-59.

With multiple headphones, I started only getting sound out of only my left ear. The sound quality is satisfactory. The car kit is nice as well. It is pretty durable, I dropped it around 15 times from pretty high while working out until I started encountering problems. It stopped playing MP3 cds, and then one day it randomly stopped playing all CDs. It had a lifespan of around 10 months for regular CDs, and 8 for MP3 CDs. But it still might be working if I didn't drop it a lot. It was a good CD player but I will be buying another one this time, that is a little more expensive. Overall, it is a satisfactory CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"I have a RioVolt CD/MP3 player, but it's not this one exactly. I just think the design is different.

I began reading and settled in to learn, only to discover that this doctor? used this opportunity to write ultra disgusting poronography. Some of the explicit details of some of his so-called patient encounters were not at all necessary, however, it was apparent that the doctor? thoroughly enjoyed writing down these filthy details because it gave him pleasure. I don't recomend this book at all, and I feel he did a huge disservice to those of us who might have benefitted from some of his information, but then how am I to know, since I trashed the book after the first such disappointment with his poronographic details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I am alone...","review":"Most of the complaints I have read don't really address all of that bothers me with this book.The biggest problem I have is \\"the borderline\\" or \\"borderlines do X\\".

Maybe this is because of the training I have but it bothered me so much I have been trying to figure out how to get rid of the book without actually throwing it out (I just can't justify throwing a book out).

The stories in this book are very cliche and in my opinion do not capture the essence of living with someone who is BPD. In ways it is harder living with me than the examples in the book. In other ways though I am not nearly so silly as some of the examples given. When I bought the book I had thought that the authors had a diagnoses of BPD. When I found out though they they were simply experts on the subject I was taken aback. As I began to read I noticed that this book did not seem to understand the reality of a BPD diagnosis, it seemed very clinical. I found the book \\"The Borderline and the Buddha\\" the best book on BPD that I have read and I would highly recommend it. As a plus it is written by a actual BPD patient!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool for understanding BPD","review":"This book,Sometimes I Act Crazy: Living with Borderline Personality Disorderis very informative and easy to understand, yet thorough.

They are very well aware that they \\"act crazy\\" at times. They want to know WHY they act crazy and how to deal with it.

The manual says that the frame accepts unchanged pictures straight out of a camera only. What I found, was that if you create a folder called DCIM on your SD card, and then put all of your pictures (jpg) into that folder, then the frame sees them OK. All my cameras create a DCIM folder automatically when storing pictures.This solution worked for me with all SD and CF cards I tried.

Though this DVD isn't badly edited like \\"Armageddon\\"(sp?), it's the same type of editing that I don't like. Other than that, it's basically the same show except we didn't have 3D glasses, and I don't remember seeing the two ice skaters that we saw live.

Goes together easily, simple instructions, easy to clean. Spare parts and useful tools are included. Sticks very well to my countertop, and efficiently munches through the greens. I would hesitate to use it for harder foods like carrots or apples, because it's not made for that purpose. Great for camping or traveling, as it is light and fairly compact, and no bother with electricity. Juice does not come out foamy, as sometimes happens with the big fast electric juicers.It does pay to read the manual, and take note of tightening the nozzle at the pulp end.

You get a lot of juice from just a couple of handfuls of grass. I drink a shot or two of it a week. The only drawback I would comment on is that if you don't tightened the parts good, the juice will leak out. Just turn the handle nice and slowly. Don't force it or you can break the juicer. I would recommend this juicer to anyone interested in drinking wheatgrass juice as part of their diet.Just a note: Don't mix your wheatgrass juice with citrus juice. It destroys the enzymes in the juice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Requires some elbow grease but great machine!","review":"I primarily use this for wheat grass.

We literally couldn't get one drop of wheatgrass juice out of this juicer. Well I should re-phrase that. We got juice leaking out of it from all the WRONG places, but nothing from the appropriate place. We could hardly even crank it! This thing was immediately sent back, and I wouldn't even recommend it to someone I don't like.

This occurred during the FIRST usage after juicing 1-1/2 trays of wheatgrass. Juicing at least 1 tray of w.g. at a time is normal. Had to discard the juice because the plastic was melting and crumbling off INTO the juicing stream. We fed small appropriate amounts of grass into the auger to prevent overworking.

I ran alot of grass through this and got less than a thimble full of juice out of the end where the juice is supposed to come out.I basically had to chew the pulp afterwards to get the juice out, I also had to run water through to get the green foam to drain out & drink it diluted. This thing really sucks.I got alot more juice from just putting grass through the blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk - don't waste your money","review":"This is a piece of junk that tries to do what a stainless steel wheatgrass juicer is designed to do. It is cheaply made, and you will waste your money if you buy this juicer. It is not made to last. Under the stress of juicing wheatgrass, it will crack and break. The gears of the handle are molded lexan plastic, and will not last. The handle will break too under load of wheatgrass. You can crank a stainless steel wheatgrass juicer and not have to worry about the handle breaking in half. The stainless steel crushing blade will also crack at the seams after a bit of use. After a dozen uses, it cracked on each seam. Don't listen to the seller by email, they lie. They said it is tough. That is b******. Get a good stainless steel wheatgrass juicer, and it will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"This thing is too flimsy. It's all cheap plastic. I couldn't use the clamp because it was to shallow to clamp on my table and the suction lock function was to weak to use. It's poorly designed with the juice coming out right near the handle, if the bowl moves even a little bit it'll miss the juice and it's very easy to bump the bowl out of alignment while you're turning the handle. The handle is just plastic, not nearly strong enough. I tried secure the juicer to the table with the suction lock while juicing wheat grass, a big mistake, it popped off and the juice went everywhere. We couldn't return it because it had been used so we just threw it away. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so excited to get this juicer. There aren't many for wheatgrass on the market at a decent price. Putting it together and washing it can be a bit of a chore, to be honest. And I juice veggies every day with my other juicer, so it's not like I'm not used to washing parts and the whatnot. One has to be very careful to make sure it is secured tightly on the ends, and to the ledge - otherwise you are bound to get a mess. The biggest disappointment has to be that the plastic collecting bin cracked on the 2nd use! Not sure when it cracked - while using it or while washing it in warm, soapy water (I old hand washed it). Not thrilled at all. I think the idea is wonderful, but the execution is poor. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks & is messy, also the extract is wet, not dry.","review":"If you are on a budget, you can make this work with some experimentation, which is why I gave it 2 stars. For example, you can chew on the smashed wheatgrass when it is extracted from the juice, to get more of the juice out of it. You can stop up the little square hole at the back of the bottom of the grinder with a cotton ball to keep it from leaking...much. As for me, though I am on a budget too, I am buying another one, a stainless steel one that reportedly gives much dryer smashed grass results & hopefully doesn't leak.

A wonderful feature of this book is the double-page organization of the atlas portion showing brain sections. For each section, the left-hand page is an unmarked full-page photograph of the section, and the right-hand page is the same photograph with labels and borders drawn around the structures. This is much more helpful than the traditional approach that simply has a line pointing to a structure, for this approach shows the size, shape, and limits of the structure as well as its location. The unmarked photographs allow you to test yourself. I highly recommend this book for Neuroanatomy students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"I like this text a lot.

Also the string of the bow is only a piece of string tied on to a curved plastic piece that they call a bow. It is all made out of rubber and is terribly hard to get out of its box. It was a terrible decision to buy this and I recommend (to those who do not like to look at things that are made for looking at) not to buy this 'replica'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I EXpected","review":"First off, I got to say this was not worth the money I spent for it.'Will Rap For Food' gave me the impression that it was a rap group saying how they were broke because they were so much different.

Though there were some brightspots that actually worth the dollar you spend on a blank cd to copy it from a friend.

I'm surprised that not alot of people know about his crew, or any other good dirty south music. actually, when i think about it, i'm not surprised. southerners who like rap usually like horrible, god aweful crap that most people wouldnt waste the time on.....so its really not a shocker that they dont know what good music is. cop this and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this!","review":"Deacon and Kno combine to make CunninLynguists, but that's not all.

The album is expression. The shortcomings, while minor in comparison to other LPs, include somewhat monotonous blabberings like \\"thugged out since cub scouts\\", the metaphors of which are tedious and often fall flat. The second track, Lyguistics, is utterly outstanding, one of the best songs I've ever heard, and is followed up by an equally impressive third track, \\"mic like a memory\\". The rest of the album is certainly above average; much of the beats are spare and the rapping is moderately impressive. I'd give it four stars because it's something new, it's constantly changing from track to track, and Lynguistics, mic like a memory, and one or two other tracks are in themselves worth buying the complete album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes. Just do it.","review":"I know what you're thinking: \\"I downloaded 616 rewind of the internet, and it had some cool rapping, but is this album really worth it?\\" Yes, you idiot! This album is the start of something great! Kno & Deacon make an excellent pair, and this album comes at you with great track after great track. It's a wonderfully well-rounded album with stellar production. They even went and repressed it so you could feel good about purchasing something worthwhile. Go ahead, you'll be a better person because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection of Timeless Christian Classics","review":"Several of the songs on this cd have become timeless favorites.

The book appears to be a photocopy of a hand-typed 1970s manuscript. Some of the typefaces don't match up. The pages weren't even printed in the correct order so I had to scramble to find the continuity. Jumping back and forth to go through the first couple chapters was almost enough to make me give up. The pronunciation guide is also weak (not explaining how to pronounce common combinations of letters.) That said, the exercises ARE okay and the grammatical explanations are easy to follow. The major exception to that is the usage of the Italian articles for \\"the\\"and \\"a\\" which was sorely lacking. The vocabulary is fairly limited but is presented in a logical fashion.

Hybels parallels the life and attitudes of Christ, describing how the God of the universe humbled himself to become our Savior in order to reach a greater joy. Easy, motivational, powerful reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Down-to-Earth Principles on True Success","review":"Hybels presents a fine definition of true, godly success in this work. He begins by describing the downward path to Christian success as opposed to the upward path to secular success. He then addresses various principles of success or greatness: power, commitment, servanthood, humility, obedience, and joy. Following an explanation of each principle and its biblical basis, Hybels includes a current-life illustration to drive his point home. He concludes his work by sharing his own personal story of descending into greatness, appealing to the reader to follow the biblical pattern. His conclusion is the most powerful part of the entire book.I wholehearted recommend this book to all Christians, but especially to Christian leaders who are pursuing success.

It fits snuggly and you can read with the case on. I would have liked the case to have covered the sides and top and bottom of the Nook, protecting it if it is dropped on its side. It also had a chemical smell that lasted quite a few weeks.

It's attractive and very comfortable to hold as well, and the little booklight I purchased clips right on. Perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Otherwise Good Cover Ruined by Design Flaw","review":"I liked this cover until I brought my Nook on vacation, and had two occasions when the Nook fell out of the case. This happens because while two of the corners are held in with elastic straps, the other two straps are fashioned with strips of cloth that are sown in the shape of a pocket, and both of them quickly became loose with wear. Based on that problem, I cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nook case - with clasp and simulated leather.","review":"I thought this would fit my nook better.The clasp seems to thick.Overall, just looks cheap to me.I did not use this at all and it was a bad purchase.Maybe some people will like this and I'm too picky.This case is more like a $10 case at most.Currently I use just a regular \\"slip\\" case that haseneoprene for the padding... I had this first and thoughtthe other one would work better.Also, if this is leather then I don't know what leatherlooks like. Looks simulated leather to me, or if leatherit is very cheap. I have had simulated leather cases thatlook better. Matter of fact, I have s simulated case formy iPad and I LOVE it. So, the problem is not that it'snot leather. Just looks cheap to me and not all that wellmade.Basically, I \\"thought\\" I would be able to use it while inthis case. IF I have to remove the nook, it loses it'svalue.

The narrative of this book was extremely easy to read and it drew me back into the world of the Talisman. It had been a long time since I had read the precursor to this book but it brought back a lot of memories. This book functions just as much as a standalone as a sequel which is part of the draw of it for me. In a time of lengthy series' it is nice to see a book that can stand on its own not to mention the allusions to Roland and the Dark Tower. I also like to see king return to some of his older stories which he never seems to do except in the Dark Tower books which I also love. Overall I loved the book and read from start to finish over the course of 24 hours. For me, a sign of a great book written by a great writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed, but an Extra Star for the Characters","review":"I liked The Talisman pretty well, though I felt it fell far from Stephen King's standards, so I went on to read Black House. I was hugely disappointed. I stuck with it because I liked Jack Sawyer, and generally liked the other characters, like Henry Layton and Dale Gilbertson. But otherwise I hated this book. I hated the obnoxious \\"We are here and now we are going there\\" narration style, so different from the narrative style of The Talisman. I hated the huge difference from the original Territories, no doubt caused by the uncomfortable attempt to meld King's Dark Tower world with this one. I now feel that if you've read The Talisman and liked it, you should definitely stay away from this sequel. It neither feels like a true sequel nor delivers like one. There are better ways to spend your reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys sure could do better.","review":"This is just another Dark Tower installment, mostly made up of Mr. King's schtick. This book lacks the solid plotting that the Talisman has. Plot elements and devices are brought up and made a big deal of, then dropped, and other elements come out of the blue. Geez, I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"ICK......I couldn't even get half-way through it!!!!","review":"\\"Black House\\" was a screwball interpretation of something I have no clue about. I just could not get into the book....maybe i needed to read \\"The Dark Tower\\" series first. Lately, however, King's books have been tedious to read....I didn't even finish the part where the boy was taken...i just couldn't stay interested. I hope King goes back to his writing of days gone by......Cujo, Pet Semetary, etc......books that were worthy of his name!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I bought this book because I've enjoyed and admired other novels by the authors. I gave it one star because I couldn't give it zero. It is 823 pages of pure tedium, excruciatingly written in the present tense. I loathed it so much I wanted to throw it out the window, but I was on an airplane. There were endless passages of boring description and characters I didn't care enough about to slog through all that mind-numbing prose. I can't fault the editor for doing a poor job because there obviously was no editor at all. I've read thousands of books in my lifetime, and I've never hated one more than this piece of garbage. I want a refund of my $9.99 plus tax."},{"rating":"1","title":"owwww","review":"Please, someone kill me so I don't have to finish this book. What overwrought garbly-gook boring nonsense. I can't even be mature about it. Spare me King at his worst -- I've avoided his Dark Tower fantasy stuff only to find mention of it creeping into this one. No wonder it's so bad. The cover should have warned me what I was getting into.What ever happened to that imagination of his that helped you to ignore the over-writing? This book is a waste of brain space, his and mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing....","review":"When I first picked up 'Black House', after I just finished the great novel 'The Talisman', I thought that the novel was going to reunite Jack Sawyer...but it didnt. The beginning was confusing, and I threw the book across the room after page 400.The story is boring, and I got confusing at the beginning because of the detail and all the skipping around...and it just got more confusing.I loved 'The Talisman', and still do, but 'Black House' is about as confusing as teaching a 5 year old astrophysics.What made it more confusing is the eggs that Speedy sent Jack, how did the eggs get there? ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was boring","review":"I have read many works from both authors and I found this one to be their worst. Without giving things away I will share some frustrations.1. There were characters developed and tossed away without being necessary in moving the story along. They revealed \\"secrets\\" that were already known by Jack or were going to be quickly figured out regardless of the character's intervention.2. There was build up and suspense that went nowhere and the ending was just plain lazy.3. The evil doers were just a bit too feable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black House","review":"A total waste of money and time. It kills brain cells trying to read it.

Then I got this book, and decided that before I jumped into it, I should re-read the Talisman.I cannot begin to describe the disappointment of attempting to read Black House only hours after finishing the Talisman. The way the story is told is just horrible. The whole \\"we\\" thing is completely unbearable. Simply put- the writing style was so bad I couldn't read the book. I had to put it down after only a few pages, for fear I would vomit.I skipped several hundred pages just to see if that particular writing style persisted throughout the entire book, and it appears that it did. I was horrified.So yeah, it's a horror book. Just not what I wanted. Unreadible. I'm sure, somewhere in between the terrible prose there is a story worth reading about, but I couldn't get there. I'm disappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone","review":"They try to be creative in their narrative but it doesn't work.

I tossed it aside once already because I was drowning in the stultifyingly dull, plotless prose, but then I decided to try again -- nope, I still can't slog through this. For people that want a cracking good story -- check out Richard Matheson instead. Even his new stuff moves along nicely. Stephen King doesn't know how to write good stories any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Disappointment","review":"I don't know whether it is because I was so excited about the sequel to my favorite novel and ruined it for myself, but Blackhouse is a total disgrace and a bore to read, until around page 500. Even the ending is a disappointment by The Talisman's standards. Where it takes me less than a week to finish one of King's novels, this book took me 2 months! It was just out of pure respect for King that I finished this novel otherwise I would have returned it after the second chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I just finished reading the TALISMAN (again) the day I got BLACK HOUSE. I started reading BLACK HOUSE today and I doubt whether I will finish it. This has happened to me with many of King's newer books. I feel like I am wading through a quagmire of words that threaten to suffocate me with their imagery. It is just too much! Especially in the light of recent events, I find it difficult to read a book that on first read appears to be so unrelentingly grim. If I were you, I would wait until you can get it at the library. Something this dark needs to be read when there is a glimmer of light somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, plain and simple","review":"It's a good decision: Stephen King's plan to retire, that is. How could the author of \\"The Stand\\" let his name appear on this pile of.......?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Totally disappointing.\\"","review":"Being a fairly new reader of the macabre, I felt like reading a book by the master of terror (Stephen King). Considering the synergistic power of two famous authors, I thought this book would be the ultimate. I felt that my time in reading this book was a waste of six+ hours, and would advise readers to read other materials. Every strange twist and turn in this story was totally predictable. The topic, while gruesome and sadistic, seemed almost normal. I was hoping to be gripping an armrest and losing sleep as I read this book. This definitely wasn't the case. I do believe that with a lot of re-structuring, this would make a fabulous horror film. especially if directed by Mr. King. I was far from impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel cheated.","review":"The Talisman is one of my most favorite Stephen King novels, and when I found out there was going to be a sequel I was thrilled. However, I hated Black House. If you are not familiar with King's Dark Tower series, you probably won't appreciate this book. I'm very impressed with King's ability to interweave so many stories, however, I didn't want to have to read a bunch of other things, i.e. The Gunslinger, The Drawing of the Three, The Wastelands, Wizard & Glass, \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\", and Insomnia, just so this one would make sense. I prefer The Talisman as a stand alone work."},{"rating":"2","title":"more grown-up horror","review":"More horror and more scare in this sequel to the Talisman. Jack Sawyer is a man now. His past is calling him back to the Territories. He's the only one with the skills and unique knowledge to save the children. Unwilling Jack is afraid to confront the past because it means dredging up old memories and reliving the nightmare. Don't let your 12 yr old read this book. Disturbing child abduction \\"parts\\" in here. Enjoyed the connection to the Dark Tower/Gunslinger. The cover alone got me to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR letdown.....","review":"It is hard for me to believe that any fans of the TALISMAN couldfind anything to like in this 'Sequel.' So many missed opportunities....no sense of wonder, no time spent in the Territories, no interesting POV's from a villain to help sustaininterest (SO unlike the memorable evil of the first book).It is obvious that Straub just let SK take the reins; why not,this book will sell more copies than PS's last 5 books combined.The \\"Dark Tower\\" stuff is mostly just silly, and I think it issad that this book was published at all....how could he NOT haveintroduced Henry to the Territories...the only interesting character in the book (including JACK), and we don't evenget to see his extraordinary senses reaction to the Territories.If King/Straub had written this 20 years ago, it would have beena MUCH, MUCH better book. As it is written, it is completelypointless and un-necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artificial Style Overcomes Plot!","review":"Why do authors feel they have to interpose an artificial style between the readers and the story?Although the plot and characters were fascinating, the precious and condescending stylistic devices employed by the authors made this book almost unreadable. As a fairly enthusiastic fan of both authors, I anticipated another thrilling ride...but unfortunately the authors chose to tell their story in a highly obtrusive style in which the narrative voice takes on the persona of your 6th grade teacher, constantly reminding you that you are reading a book rather than experiencing a story.Too bad...it could have been really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"the king of pop culture and the use of straub","review":"have you ever noticed how much pop culture references king can pack into a book? luckily we have straub to hold him back a little.it's supposed to be a sequal to the talisman, but the two aren't really connected. you get to meet some new great characters and some new annoying one. the most irritating is the narrator, who is an entitiy in this book. the whole first section, some hundred plus pages, is a waste of paper. it would be a great (though endless) camera shot. but this isn't a movie. it's a book. the end is a bit of a letdown. i hate it when an author creates miracles just to save the good guys and take care of the bad guys. but the middle is entertaining. we should just really wait for king to finish his dark tower series (i do wonder how straub feels at being used as a device for king's dark tower series). really, was there a point to straub here at all?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Journey You Won't Regret","review":"In the first 100 pages, I think you can see Straub's influence in the way the story opens. It takes a little getting used to, but hang in there. It's King at his best story-telling. Only the master could relate so many of his novels when their plots are totally unrelated. Those of us who are ardent King readers get thrown enough bones in the end to leave us drooling for more in the Dark Tower series. I hope all this talk about connections doesn't discourage anyone from reading Black House. It's a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DT information was good, but...","review":"the plot's a little thin, the writing style is very rambling and confusing, and it will make very little sense to someone who hasn't read the DT series or the Talisman.Also, I found Jack Sawyer to be extremely irritating. He's handsome, rich, good at everything he tries, everyone (with the exception of the \\"bad guys\\") are in awe of him through the entire book, and of course, he's one of the Best Cops Ever. Gag.In case you couldn't tell, I'm pretty dissapointed. Both these authors are capable of much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good addition to the Dark Tower series","review":"I ordered this book the instant it was available because on Stephen King's web site it says:\\"For those of you who are Dark Tower fans, Black House will answer many questions you may have about the Crimson King, who/what are Breakers, how does Ted Brautigan fit in, etc. It will be the closest thing to a DT novel you'll see before the fall of the Year Three ('03).\\"Hopefully Black House is the farthest thing from the Dark Tower novels I hope to see in 2003. Of the 640 pages about 5 of them related to the Dark Tower series. After the literary triumph that was Wizard and Glass, Black House falls short of what you would expect from Stephen King. Let us do remember that this book was co-authored by Peter Straub, who will hopefully play no part in the Dark Tower books to come.Independent of my Dark Tower expectations this book would have gotten three stars from me as there were some entertaining elements but it moved too slowly to rate any higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black House","review":"If you loved The Talisman, of course you have to read this book. If you didn't read The Talisman - read it! It's a fabulous adventure and you won't have to wait twenty years for the sequel! I thought The Talisman read like pure Stephen King, and the ONLY disappointment with this book is that it switches back and forth between the two authors' voices, which I found jarring. I intensely disliked the overview bird thing, I thought it was tedious and irritating. I love King's straightforward style and wanted to stick with it! But that doesn't detract from the excitement of revisting Jack and all those wonderful memories from The Talisman. It's a must-read for Stephen King fans and everyone who loved The Talisman. I hope, if there is another sequel, that it will be written like the first one - all Stephen King's style. But again, this is a minor irritation and I definitely recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"King and Straub chose an AWFUL reader!","review":"My wife and I love listening to Steven King's books on tape and have been willing to put up with some pretty bad readers. But this one takes the cake. He sounds like he's announcing a baseball game, all breathless and excited. We can't stand it. We actually took the set of tapes back and got the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"It doesn't help that I find Peter Straub's writing style boring and I think Stephen King hurts himself cowriting a book with this person.The only thing this book did for me was put me to sleep. It didn't make sense, didn't have a glimmer of reality in it, and it most certainly did not scare me.Stephen King is best at taking ordinary, every day events and turning them into something really twisted and scary like Needful Things and The Shining - his early writings.Don't waste your time with this book - take a look at Clive Barker's books instead.A disappointed reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever been REALLY disappointed?","review":"First off, if you haven't read The Talisman - don't even bother withBlack House. Much of it will go right past you. But if you're still with me......remember The Talisman? The magic? The absolute wonder of that amazing parallel land? The JOY???Not one whit of it remains in Black House. None. The cutesy POV the authors have taken is irritating at best. The attempts at tying in other King works - most notably the Gunslinger series - seem pale and contrived. The whole thing stinks of profit-motive versus art-motive, as if it was written from formula and not from the heart.I say this as one to whom The Taslisman is an all time favorite...Shame on you guys - you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch what a stinker!","review":"If you want a realy great book read the Talisman or reread it but don't waste your time or money on Black House. I was amazed that the same authors wrote this book.

Read it and reflect"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I discovered that there was a sequel to the Talisman, I was so excited. Talisman was a classic with me.Mr. King has drawn yet another of his creations into the Wizard series. Now, although I have read and enjoyed 'Dark Tower', I don't want everything to relate. A lot of my disappointment stems from this.I also found that the comments directly to the reader were disruptive and unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Sawyer returns to the Territories","review":"It's been about 20 years since I read (and thoroughly enjoyed) \\"The Talisman\\", and I always wished that the authors would do a sequel. Now my wish has been granted (sort of), and I have enjoyed this new book by two well-known authors of the genre. The story line is quite well done, and the characters, even the relatively minor ones, are well drawn. The plot, once it gets into gear, moves along briskly, and you get caught up in the excitement of it all. Once again, we see a connection between this book and Mr. King's Dark Tower series, and at least he keeps the plot lines consistent. My only complaint about this book (and it's a big one) is that it's just too darn wordy! An editor with some clout could have seriously reduced the size of this book without compromising the story in any way. Sometimes less is more, and that would apply to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even a blind man could see this is a great book!","review":"I read The Talisman when I was twelve, same age as Jack. That was almost 20 years ago and it remained my favorite book. Until now. I was scared I wouldn't love adult Jack as I had young Jack, but I needn't have worried. He has aged well. The characters-new and old-are great. I felt as if I knew them all. Especially Henry. I didn't think Jack would ever find another friend like Wolf, but again I was surprised. The writers, God bless them, have also aged well. Throughout The Talisman there were sections where you could tell who was writing. Here it was much less apparent. They seemed to gel better. I tried to make the book last, only reading a chapter a night. It was still over too quickly. Hopefully we'll see Jack again soon. Read this book-you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book! Bad bad!","review":"Bad book!

Or was the project simply too tough?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intollerable","review":"Ten minutes into this book I had to check to be sure that I was actually reading the sequel to The Talisman. Granted, this book was not intended to be a smooth continuation over from the Talisman but the writing style even changed. The 'guided tour' styling that is used throughout the book is absolutely maddening. I can't stand it and to make me even more frustrated I cannot understand why they would completely change writing styles from one book to the next when it's THE SAME SERIES.A slow start combined a horrid writing style brew up a very bad novel. As hard as I tried, I could not finish this book. Even if you've read the Talisman, I suggest you point your spending money at a more worthy novel! Black House is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Not only was the experimental narrative style a challenge to embrace, but the book was long-winded and bogged down in detail.

Ending was a bit if a let down. Glad for happy ending, as always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black House Audiobook on Tape is not awesome but adequate","review":"Black House is one of the finest books written by Stephen King and Peter Straub -- and this audiobook is read by Frank Muller, no doubt the finest voice in audiobooks before his tragic accident a few years ago.Black House is a sequel of sorts of the book Talisman and uses many of the same villians. The Crimson King, who makes appearances in Insomnia and The Dark Tower series is every bit as threatening. The Black House itself was a \\"black house\\" and Jack's destination in the Talisman where he fought one of his most heroic battles.The fidelity is fine on this tape version of the audiobook. The only problem with it is ... well ... it's on tape, which means swapping in and out small audio cassettes, some 15-18 of them in the course of the book.However you can't beat the price and all of that wonderful narrative is there to explore."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as The Talisman.","review":"I finished this book last night and I must say, it was very good. I liked it every bit as good as the first entry, The Talisman. I say again: Stephen King and Peter Straub work together with very good results. I recommend this along with The Talisman to all fans of Stephen King and Peter Straub.P.S. I suggest you stop at page 639 (this paperback edition has 659 pages) in the book and draw your own conclusions about what happens next. The last 20 pages are really not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"This is the single most disappointing Steven King book I have read. The characters don't make you wonder about them anytime during or after the story. The most unsettleing thing for me was how the same scene would be told over again from the viewpoint of up to four different characters. I thought this seems like an attempt to just make a long 600+ page book out of a 180 page book. The worst part about the entire book however, was the blatant, graphic violence towards children.To get me back in the Steven King frame of mind, I'll need to make a quick read of The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.My advice, stay away from Black House. It's bad....bad I tell you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not King's best work","review":"After reading The Talisman and Black House, the only obvious conclusion is that the King/Straub collaboration is not a particularly effective one. Neither book grabs the imagination; both are tedious and overly drawn out. The narrative style of Black House is particularly annoying and constitutes the book's major weakness. I can't recall another King work that uses it (thankfully). Severe editing would have made this a much better read. The first third of the book is almost unreadable; however, the last 150 pages or so are much more enjoyable and offer an interesting glimpse into the Dark Tower's Territories. Your reading time would be better spent elsewhere unless you are a big fan of the Dark Tower series and must read every available word about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COMPLETE LET-DOWN","review":"I'm sorry, but Stephen King lost me.( I never realy carred for Mr.Straub's writing..)I live in Holland and for some reason his latest book; \\" From a buick 8 \\" was published here first...Such garbage!!!!!!It looked like he had some notes laying around from the time he wrote Christine...plain awfull!!But anyhoe, I picked up this book and after 50 pages I had enough.I like to be drawn into a book and not read some dry comments about where we're going and how the curtains look.I know a thing or two about writing but enough with setting the scene allready!!!No, I think I'll even pass on everythings eventually.No more King for me alas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps a Bestseller","review":"As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I was thrilled to see how Stephen King and Peter Straub brought back Jack Sawyer, their youthful hero from THE TALISMAN, in BLACK HOUSE--a horror story packaged in a fantasy framed within a mystery. Jack is now in his thirties, and he's left the LAPD. He's living in western Wisconsin where a horror story is occurring. A serial killer is butchering children and dining on their bodies. Jack has no specific memories of the Territories (from THE TALISMAN), but we all know that King and Straub are too talented of professionals to let this poor fellow be. Jack finds himself roped into the investigation and haunted by wide-awake dreams and half-memories of the Territories. You can guess where this book is heading--straight to the top of the bestseller lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bid Disappointment","review":"- Easily the worst book ever to carry the name of Stephen King. What was he thinking, I wonder? Fulfill a contractual obligation, perhaps?- Shallow, flimsy plot, characters you just can't care about, no real element of horror whatever, and an ending not even good enough for a comic book!- Skip this book - it isn't up to snuff and it isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Black House","review":"I can't remeber the last time I was so disappointed in a book. It is long winded and down right boring. The freakish float- around-and-look-at-everything style makes it very dificult to get into the story as does the constant introduction of characters that have no bearing on the plot. It is a waste of time and money and I considered it to be a very poor sequel to a great book, The Talisman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two mediocrities better than one?","review":"Well,the King of schlock is back for another installment of self-repetition and lame references to his other books.The ever so boring Peter Straub(except for Ghost Story)is on board for this not so thrilling thriller.I guess King is doing the old boy a favor.Short but sweet:King is totally out of ideas.Nothing he has written in the last 5 or 6 years has the least spark of originality.He is now on autopilot,relentlessly pursuing more royalty checks while regurgitating by bits and pieces every book he has ever written.I've read every book of Stephen King,but this piece of garbage is the final insult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black House","review":"I loved the Talisman! It is in my top 5 of all books. The Black House was a typical Stephen King book..I'm surprised that Peter Straub even put his name to it. The only redeming part was that it did add some explanation of the Dark Tower Series, but it still wasn't enough. Read at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment","review":"From the beginning I knew I was going to be disappointed by Black House. Good Stephen King stories grab you right away. This steaming pile used a very annoying narration device of a floating guide that constantly reminds you that you're reading a book. Just like the last few SK novels the reader is inundated by details and descriptions that only serve to fill pages. My advice; when you start skimming a Stephen King book to look for the good parts, don't bother. There aren't any."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning is slow, but the rest is awesome","review":"Blackhouse is a very good book. Better than the talisman. The beggining is rather slow, i almost gave up on it, but by the time i got into the middle, i was hooked. After a few days of slogging through it it finally began to scare me. About two thirds of the way through I wanted to put it down because i thought it would give me a heart attack but it was just too damn gripping. I strongly suggest buying it and reading all the way through. The beggining is weak, but the rest will scare the pants off you."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Need of a Good Editor!","review":"I've been an avid Stephen King and Peter Straub fan since I was in junior high. As a huge fan of The Talisman and The Dark Tower series, I was hugely disappointed Black House.The beginning of the booked is plaged by boring descriptions of the of the town of Parrish Landing. The use of a \\"floating camera in the sky\\" technique did more to irritate me, than enrich the experience. The editor of this book should have red-inked the first 300 pages of this novel!About half-way through the novel, the authors begin tying in the Gunslinger Series to the territories of The Talisman. For those of you who have been eagerly awaiting closure after The Wizard and the Glass, prepare yourself for disappointment. These two story lines do not jive well together.If you don't have the patience of Job, leave this book on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment after a long wait","review":"The Talisman was one of my favorite books. It had the right mixture of fantasy combined with light horror. I found myself reading it 4 or 5 times. When I heard the sequel was coming out, I was very excited. I put myself on the waiting list for the hard-back and eagerly awaited its delivery.What a disappointment! A story that didn't pick up till well half-way through, very little mention of \\"the Territories\\" (which I'm sure all of us were hoping for), disgusting pervert killing kids in the worst possible way, bringing it back to tie in with the \\"Gunslinger\\" series...I'm sorry, but I really felt greatly let-down by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rarity - a better sequel","review":"I have read - and loved - every single Stephen King book, with the exception of the Dark Tower series, which I found incomprehensibly silly. Traditionally, I did not like Peter Straub's writing, because it was meandering. To me, \\"The Talisman\\" combined the worst excesses of both writers - too silly, and too long - and I could barely get through it. What a pleasure, then, to discover that its sequel was an engaging, tightly written story, that demonstrates the maturing in style of both authors. Like Straub's recent \\"Mr. X\\", and King's \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\", \\"Black House\\" has a much more focused narrative, and more believable characters. For the person who leans more toward traditional supernatural horror, and away from novels that border on sci-fi/fantasy, I can't recommend this book more highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you thought this was about the Black Hotel....it isn't...","review":"I remain firm that Talisman (prequel to this book) can and actually does stand on it's own. But Black House would be a dismal failure without the Talisman.I began this tale and immediately realized I had to read the Talisman first to get the most out of this book.There is one saving grace (actually two) for this book and if you are reading instead of listening, I honestly would chuck the written version and grab the unabridged audio. Frank Muller is a GENIUS - pure and simple. His character's voices are clear and distinct. Muller is what makes this book. Period.I had hoped that the black house was somehow tied to the black hotel in the Talisman, but alas, no. The second saving grace -- the times when we do get to return to the 'other world,' the Territories. Both King and Straub seem to be most comfortable there as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black House is blah","review":"AW steve and pete, I so loved talisman I read it four times. Looked forwardto this but what a disappointment. No point to it unless you guys weregetting back at your Hollywood hatees. I think this book should be calledthe novel that should never have been written and didn't know when toend. No at all scary, no subtley, no moral nothing. come on guys, you knowyou could do better. you have. You guys are a couple of MY authors,please entertain me again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I can't remember the last time I gave up on a book. It's been years. Black House headed for the shelf after a mere 88 pages. I couldn't bring myself to wade through the lengthy and arbitrary verbiage employed to describe, for example, a street. I found it neither relevant to the story nor setting the tone, mood, etc... This, to say nothing about the bizarre first person \\"we-based\\" narrative. Kudo's to you if you made it through and enjoyed it.\\"Now we float down and click submit to turn in this review.

Not a sequel, more like a companion novel.","review":"This was not at all what I expected. More Dark Towery than The Talisman was. The style is that of the Dark Tower Series also.I own 2 first edition hard cover copies of The Black House. (both given to me as B-Day gifts by friends who know the I am a Constant Reader) but I'd trade them both for a tattered copy of The Talisman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Dissapointed","review":"Too much minutia! I kept reading hoping to reach some kind of plot but when I did it vaporized into a ridiculous fractured fairy tale. I usually enjoy both of these authors works but this one goes past horror into horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read something else","review":"When I heard a sequel for The Talisman was in the works, my heart sank. The Talisman is a great book, combining the best parts of Stephen King and Peter Straub. The Black House, however, is better left on the shelf.It contains none of the elements that made The Talisman such an enchanting story. If you're considering this book and haven't read the The Talisman, start there and ignore this disappointing sequel. And if you've read The Talisman, disregard The Black House and spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black House","review":"This was my first Stephen King book and I don't think that I would read another one. The 640 page book could have been condensed to about 150 pages. It was so descriptive - that the story/plot gets lost. I thought his books were suppose to be scary and thrilling - but I just wanted to tell him \\"WE GET THE POINT, NOW GET ON WITH IT!!\\" I guess if I was use to his writing, I would have thought it better; but I like the intense, non-stop thrilling, \\"OH MY GOD WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT!\\" kind of books and Black House was not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got taken again??","review":"This is not a Stephen King work.The story could be so much better but it's full of wordy crap that is not Mr. Kings style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black House: Best book I've ever read","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. I never read the Talisman, but I think I am going to. The thing thats so great about this book is not just the extremely unique and suspenseful plot, but the characters. The characters are each TRULY unique, each with their own thoughts, points of view, and feelings. The end leaves us expecting another sequel (hopefully) which I cannot wait for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"King and Straub should be ashamed to have their names on this one. It's not up to the previous good works of either author. This, to me, represents a money making opportunity at the expense of loyal fans. It's poorly written, meandering drivel that could have been penned by a high school freshman. It's too bad consumers can't take books back because the contents stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO DISAPPOINTING","review":"The Talisman is one of my top 5 favorite books of all time. I was so jazzed to hear the sequel was coming out. What a piece of drek. This book had absolutely nothing to do with the Talisman. I didn't even finish it actually, before I gave it away. I never would have thought that Straub and King needed money so desperately; to publish something like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real boring beginning","review":"I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I have read every one of Stephen King's books. This was the only one that I have not read. I have struggled to get to page 105 and I have no clue as to what is going one. The style of Peter Straub stinks. Don't waste your money, you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about. Stephen King has finally written a real clunker. This may be the worst book that I have ever tried to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the Dark Tower reader","review":"Black House is a must fot the Dark Tower fan. The book has a lot of character development the first 200 pages or so, then the book takes it to the next level. This is my 2nd favorite Dark Tower book related book(Wizard & Glass #1). I will admit, if you are not a Dark Tower reader this book may be no better than average. The none Dark Tower reader will find that parts of the book make no sense and that the story gets lost in left field sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading","review":"I Have collected and read most offerings by Stephen King over the years.

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I can respect that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I made it to chapter 6 ...","review":"This book was a disappointment. I like Stephen King books because they are fast reads and usually have imaginative story lines. I tried four different times to get into this book but it was no use. I thought it was really boring and in the end I decided I did not want to go where it was taking me. The nursing homes scenes were revolting and the flippant descriptions of dismembered children were a huge turn off. It was one of the most depressing books I have ever tried to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Black House","review":"I tried, oh, how I tried to get past the first 40 pages. I just couldn't do it. It was slow, plodding; laden with so much detail and information the story is lost. To see if maybe this was just for the first few chapters, I read ahead, and this style continued throughout. Those expecting something on par, or even approaching classics like Ghost Story, If You Could See Me Now, and KoKo (my personal favorite), forget it. Save yourself some cash and re-read Peter Straub's older works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprising disappointment","review":"I gave up on King when he stopped writing horror a few years ago, but had to pick this one up. The Talisman was one of the best King (/Straub) books, so it seems that a sequel would be a sure hit. Unfortunately, this is not really a sequel to the Talisman. Its more of a horror/mystery story with some talisman references tacked on to the end. It was a good story, but the whole time I kept thinking how much better it could have been (Imagine Jack, Henry and Beezer on a journey through the territories).The first 500 pages could have been a lot shorter, leaving more room for what we really want - Jack in the territories again.I think the high point was the tie-in to the gunslinger series though, wonder how he talked Straub into that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought something was wrong with me.","review":"Big King fan. Picked this up for my summer reading and am so far very dissapointed. I am still struggling through the first 150 pgs. I would normally cover that in a day, but it's been 2 weeks! Please tell me the typo's subside. Did they even send this to the editor? If so, fire him. I just spent 5 mins going back in the book to make sure I didn't have Fred Marshall confused, considering the text just referred to him as Dale. (sigh) Will this get better or should I quit now and salvage what's left of my summer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this suppose to be a screenplay, a spoof or just bad?","review":"I loved Stephen King and never really dug Peter Straub. I wasn't happy with the \\"Talisman\\" but figured I'd give the new book a shot.I'm up to page 32 and I'm so sick of the narrator having us 'fly' all over the place. I feel like they were writing the screenplay for the movie to save the screenwriter some time. I don't want to fly over scenes in a book. I want to be put squarely into the action and all that zipping around town pulls you of the story. It's not cute or clever, just annoying and distracting.There is one stand out line that I thought said it all:\\"The black house was pretty bad; in fact, it was terrible, but this...this is going to be worse.\\"You can't get anymore prophectic then that."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZ....","review":"I love King. I really do...but this book is BORING. It takes too long to get to anything remotely interesting.
