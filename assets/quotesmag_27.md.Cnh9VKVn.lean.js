I have to admit that the description intrigued me and it had Michael Caine in it so I was game. Now, I will watch about anything and the story line was initially interesting but that is pretty much where it ends. What I can't believe is that I sat through the whole thing. I think I was waiting for the thing to get better but, alas, it did not. There were several branches of the inital plot where characters were not fully developed and did not follow why they did what they did or what happened to them in the end. Where they thinking sequel? I doubt it. However, the bad acting where several of the pirates had the stilted language and then would speak in fully \\"Americanized\\" slang just did not cut it.

The lead pirate (Warner) brain-washes Caines son -some great scenes here- while Caine is given to the woman of a man he killed upon their abduction. The pirates are living by by codes they'd originally enstated over 100 years ago. So, we have some very entertaining dialogue on this island. The US Coast Guard end up arriving for which the pirates have some daring plans. I won't give the storyline away, but when this film finally is released in the US there should be some rejoicing. Definitely one of Michael Caine's best films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont support this paid idea","review":"Good movie, bad format.

The people use a mix of futuristic bioengineering, modern weaponry, and religious ritual and magic to accomplish their goals. There are many factions, plotlines, characters, and ideas to understand and keep track of, and if you can follow all of them, it is very much worth the ride.

We follow the experiences of several contestants in ballet, modern, jazz, flamenco and tap, but most of the time seems to be devoted to ballet. There are also plenty of sessions with teachers and judges, as well as company directors looking for new talent. The style is very professional and exciting to watch. The only negatives are the image quality which is good but not great, and the aspect ratio is the old one: 4:3, so either you will view it with bars on the sides, or, as I do, just stretch it(I am so used to the stretch that my brain automatically adjusts and I hardly notice it!), unless you still have an old TV set.Highly recommended for those who enjoy ballet documentaries and a variety of dancing styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eminem Rock!","review":"When I first heard this song, I just loved it.

The sections detailing the cases of Erickson were quite useful and absorbing. The discussions of the techniques were very useful.The sections where the techniques were formalized using transactional grammar were very heavy going and, I felt, added not very to the discussions of the techniques. The use of transactional grammar was quite interesting in that it pointed out that what not was said was as important as was said and how it was said.

These have great range and responsiveness as well as a depth of tone that is very satisfying.I had really become accustomed to these, but when I swapped in an inexpensive pair of bookshelf speakers for the L & R channels (to test out before installing in another room), suddenly it sounded like a whole layer of aural richness had been stripped away and I could hardly wait to get the MC300's hooked back up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not current edition","review":"Be warned: this is not keyed to the current edition of this text book.

Of the 8 stations to choose from, 3 come in crystal clear 99% of the time. My only complaint (and this isn't a very big one) is that the station numbers aren't backlit. I'm mostly in the car at night, so it's practically impossible to see what station the transmitter is on without turning on a light. But considering how well it works (and how cheap it is), this problem seems really minor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishing it was better..","review":"I get a lot of static with this connected to my Zune in the car.It was pretty cheap though, and it does work, just not as good as I would have hoped.

I got the Zune cranked up to 20, and my stereo louder than usual to get to my average volume. It sounds pretty lousy.If your really gripping to get tunes going in your car or boat, go for it.

I thought I could use it with an mp3 Player and it would save me carrying around a bunch of CD's in my car. What a mistake!. It transmits incredibly annoying waves of static every 2-3 seconds on all eight of the preset channels, none of which are in use locally. In a city where there are stations near those frequencies I'm sure it would be worse.

The cd is just wonderful. The lyrics are insightful and really get to the heart of what is going on inside most of us - the doubts, the fears, the joys. A couple of songs are very reminiscent of Kenny Loggins while others are reminiscent of Garth Brooks' Chris Gaines (appropriate since Wayne wrote many tracks on that cd)!

No biggie, but it makes your calories burned look way out of whack (30 mile run in 2 hours with 2,600 calories burned- I wish).I am very satisfied with the watch and would have been happy if I purchased it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout tool","review":"I purchased this product because I was looking for a GPS training tool that would work both for running and biking. After 10 to 15 hours of research I chose this one, the Garmin Forerunner 305. I couldn't be happier. One of the best things I like is that I'm now able to run places other than the marked trails and courses, yet still know how many miles I've covered and what my time and pace was. Running the same 5k course all the time was getting boring. It was great for my race last weekend also because I could tell at a glance if I should pick up the pace or hold steady so not to wear myself out too early. I just used it on a bike ride yesterday and it was great. I really love to check out the data after an event to see how I did over the entire ride/run and how the elevation changes affect my speed and heart rate. Finally, the unit is multisport capable which will make it perfect for duathlons and triathlons, which I plan on doing next summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with purchase","review":"This is the training and GPS watch that I have been needing to track where I walk. Heart Monitor is just a plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"running with ease","review":"This watch has been such a help in my running. By tracking mileage and pace with ease, it helps with training. Being able to get off the main roads with the nasty fumes is a plus. It is a little large but easy to read features. It charges like a cell phone and hooks up easily to the computer. The GPS hasn't failed me yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had High Hopes","review":"I simply could not get it to find satellites often. I went through any and all of the troubleshooting steps I could find online and the device only seemed to occasionally function properly. It's not very useful and I just yesterday shipped it back to Amazon. Unfortunately, since I took so much time trying to work with it, I've past the normal return time and could pay a hefty restocking fee. An overall disappointing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garrmin Forerunner 305 - wouldn't run without it!","review":"The watch allows me to run any variation in my normal routes without worring about how far I ran or what my pace is. It is reliable and receives GPS signals in the city and on my country routes, in sun or normal cloud cover. The heart rate monitor works flawlessly and was a great addition to the information I was keeping and it is all in one place...my 305!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I've enjoyed running with this GPS. It seems to be pretty accurate. I often run the same 5 mile route, and the 305 doesn't vary more then about .04 miles on that route. I suppose that's the most important feature to a lot of us. I don't care much about a heart rate monitor, but it's easy to use and seems to be accurate.There are a few shortcomings:The altimeter is not very dependable. My 5 mile route probably doesn't vary more than 10 feet, high to low, but it is common for the 305 to show a difference of 150 feet.It would be nice if my wife and I could both use it and be able to tell it which of us is which. Its record-keeping just assumes only one person is using it.I haven't figured out all the mapping features, but so far I haven't found a way to have it just show current Lat/Long that changes as you move. Maybe I just need to study it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Based on other negative reviews of the Garmin 405, I purchased the 305. Very happy with performance! Price was great! It could be smaller, but it's not an issue for me at all. I would buy it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet product","review":"This was my first attempt at \\"electronic\\" training.

Heart rate, distance, maps, even arial views. This was a fantastic purchase for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin 305 for the runner","review":"I am really liking the Garmin 305. It offers everything that I need in information regarding my runs. I do have a bit of a learning curve in terms of the small details, but otherwise it is great. I have just started back running and have entered the Baltimore Marathon so I wanted some incentive and something that would help keep me in check. It is great for Bike rides too. I bought the accessory snap on wrist strap and bike clip. It makes me the complete runner."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I'm completely satisfied with this purchase. Three fully configurable screens (up to 4 paremeters each) give you full background on your workout. Once the GPS satellites are locked, they are really hard to lose. The device itself is very accurate, considering GPS position as well as heart rate monitor. Heart rate monitor doesn't interfere with other stuff like a mobile phone I have with me while running. Didn't go through all advanced options yet, but even the basic usage is more than what I've expected. Also even without the manual you just turn it on, and go - it's very simple and easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good hardware+software integration","review":"Most of these reviews speak for themselves... 800+ reviews and almost 5 stars... this is def. a good product. Whats surprising... at least to me... is the solid hardware+software integration. The Garmin Training Center desktop software is cool but whats even nice is the integration w/ the Garmin Connect website. You have to download a proprietary plugin - which I was a little apprehensive of. However, the plugin lets you sync with the watch almost seamlessly...The only cons is sometimes it takes a long time to lock-on to the satellites... even when it hasn't moved far from the last spot I used it + its not moving. Lack of a backlit screen is also unfortunate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!","review":"great product. Really suprised with all it can do.

If you are thinking about training for any running event I highly recomment this product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"305 for Equine use","review":"We have had a Forerunner 305 for almost a year and couldn't be happer with it. It keeps on track where previous GHS's we have owened dropped the signal. We do a lot of riding in heavly forested areas and for the first time we are getting reliable GPS tracks.We have adapted the heart monitor for use on our horses and find that it works better than any heart monitor we have encountered. It seldon looses the heart rate, and the watch picks up the signal 20 or more feet from the horse, something that is specially handy at vet checks. A great product, we have just bought our second one as my wife and I were always argueing over who got to wear it.Phil Gardner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin 305 .... Awesome..","review":"I bought the product before I went on vacation to Europe on an organized bike trip.

This GPS Watch is really cool. It seems dead on accurate with distance and pace.

A bit heavy though.Garmin Forerunner 305 Wrist-Mounted GPS Navigator and Heart Rate Monitor"},{"rating":"2","title":"garmin 305","review":"Everything is as per my expectations. The only limit I see is the accuracy and I will investigate in the next future how reliable is the gps. Very much appreciated the possibility to customize the fields on the page. The Visual Partner is a good help for long workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"after connecting with the satellite, device is great","review":"First the bad:- It sometimes takes over 10 minutes to connect to a satellite. I run in Manhattan and Central Park, maybe it has something to do with the other transmissions in the atmosphere in this city.- A little bulky in size. I'm a big person, but it still feels like a mini-VCR on my wrist.Then the good:- The device is great once it connects to the satellite, it rarely loses its connection.- The pace is accurate, comparing with some known distances and a regular watch- The charts and goals on the garmin website when you upload your stats are very intuitive.- Battery life has been good so far, my longest use has been 5 hours on my bike.- The ghosting feature to run against my previous run works very well.Overall, everything has been working great. Just wish the satellite connection was quicker, but that may not necessarily be fault of the device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Training Tool","review":"I find the Garmin 305 to be a great running tool. It gives you instant feedback and lets you track your workouts. I just recently started increasing my running from about 5 miles a week to 15+ a week. Having a \\"toy\\" to play with and see how it works has helped my stay motivated to keep running and increase my distances. The work out feature is great and makes planning my weeks running easy (especially on those mornings when I feel like taking it easy but my watch tells me not to). I would like to see it get a satellite fix quicker but it isn't too bad. Heart rate monitor works perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good but...","review":"I have used this watch for 3 marathons and all the training that went with it.Great watch. Don't need any separate item for the GPS link like timex or polar.The bad news is that customer support couldn't fix my software on my computer so I can't download any of my data from the watch anymore. Support said they would need to remote in to my computer to try and fix it except they are only available weekdays during normal working hours which is inconvenient personally.Last bad thing was the cradle that is used for recharging won't connect any longer so I have to use vice grips to force the connection. Granted I have used this watch for well over 1000 miles of running without one problem. My current problems just started so other than that it's a good buy.Note that I have friends that have the garmin 405 and don't like the functionality of it so I probably won't switch for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like my Garmin 305","review":"I have been using my Gamin 305 for over 4 weeks now and have been very pleased with it so far. The features are very useful and helped me finish my first Half marathon.. The only down side is that it is a bit heavier than a Polar 625/825 and might take some time to get used to it. My regular runs are laced with tall trees and I have not had any satellite connectivity issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!","review":"Love this product... very easy to set up and easy to read!! I plan on buying another one for my dad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent GPS unit but only worked for 2 months","review":"I cannot recommend this product due to Garmin's bad product support and the fact that the unit only lasted two months. Buyer beware. While it is working it is a neat tool to track time and distance however at this price the unit should last far longer than two months. This is not a product for serious runners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with product","review":"This is not the first time I recieve product from Amazon that was repackaged but I could not tell if it was used. I don't mind if the item was opened/used but you advertise it as new. Besides the size of the 305 it does everything and more for aspiring triathlete. Like the fact that it handles multiple sports (bike, run, ski). GPS is on target so far. Insturctions seem simple but I refer to youtube clips to learn fuctions. Overall good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent features","review":"Very easy to use...

It is relatively easy to use, and has helped me to improve my time by allowing me to set pace parameters. Its a bit big but I've tried smaller devices and its too hard to read the display.

The training assistant and analyzer to help you to focus more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Garmin","review":"Have had my Garmin Forerunner 305 for several years now and find it absolutely essential for my running. The configurable screens (with ability to configure Bike mode different than Run mode) allows the user to dial in that data most useful to them. My only complaint about the 305 is the boot time - seems to take a long time to find and identify satellite signal. But overall a great tool for a runner or cyclist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent running watch","review":"Garmin Forerunner 305 is exactly what I hoped for. It is versatile, customizable and has all features I needed. The best part is the connection to PC which in practically seamless way copies all your data and with one click shows it on the map in Google Earth. All this for a very fair price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for cycling and running!","review":"I love this watch. I use it for running and cycling (I bought the cadence sensor). My only complaint would be that its only water resistant, not waterproof because I'd like to get into swimming, but will need to get the 310 or 910 if I want to do that. I used it for the Pelotonia (180 mile ride over two days), and the battery lasted for the whole thing! I was impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"This device got me hooked about running. The ease of use and the available data after your runs is great.

It tracks my runs accurately and hasn't lost signal yet even on overcast days. Coupled with the Garmin Connect online site it has taken my workouts to the next level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin gets my vote!!","review":"I recently purchased my Forerunner 305 after getting a lot of suggestions from running pals of mine. I love it! It is a great training aid, and it gives a lot of wonderful information about your run that can only serve to make you better over time. The GPS is wonderful for getting accurate information about distance and speed and the enclosed computer program allows you to set up a training schedule and workouts based on distances, intensity levels, and even tracks your routes for you. I used it for the first time in a race this weekend and I ran a personal best. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to improve their training times. I also suggest purchasing the foot pod along with the 305 if you are wanting to do any training indoors, where the GPS won't function. It is well worth the investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for runner","review":"Great product. I lost my old one and bought this one. It seems to work better: more accurate and locks into GPS faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"My husband and I both bought one. We did a ton of research on all the GPS watches and bought this older model because people seemed to love it. We think it was the best purchase we made for running. Our paces have improved drastically becuse we can monitor our run. It is an excellent training tool for newer runners and a gem to have during an event like a 1/2 marathon.Spend the money...you won't regret it. Oh, and its not too big at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise","review":"I would never have considered buying this, but it was gift from my kids. I opened up the box, scanned the manual, and then went for a test ride. WOW! I came home, plugged in the USB cable and up popped my ride, map and stats beyond any expectations. It is hard to imagine any possible improvement for ease of use. I am not a serious rider so many of the features are not important to me, but the map that relates to time and distance alone is worth the price of the unit. The tracking is unbelievable! I have already recommended this several of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a personal trainer and a running partner","review":"Since I start using the Garmin Forerunner 305, my training results have been impressive (at least for myself). Improvements in time and distance are obviously result of my own efforts, but having the Forerunner's assistance is helping me to keep up the efforts and even push for more. Is easy to use and customize. The Training Center software is very basic (could be improved substantialy), but very helpful. Is not the newest or more advance unit you can find today, but is good enough for everybody, and for a price of $155.00 (shipping, handling and taxes included), no other can beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Forerunner 305 GPS Receiver With Heart Rate Monitor","review":"using it for running biking hiking, full files the purpose where it was purchased for"},{"rating":"2","title":"Runner's dad","review":"My eighteen year old son is thrilled with the Garmin watch and has found it to be everything, and more, its advertised to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps Me Gauge My Workouts","review":"Oveall its a great product. The main reason I chose this product was for the advanced workouts. The software it comes with allows you to create workouts based on speed, heartrate, etc. for specific time, distance, etc. There are several options I haven't explored yet. Previously I estimated my running distances, but the GPS lets me know exactly how far I've gone. You can also customize what information is displayed on various screens.The only things that would make it more usable to me would be quick buttons to turn the GPS on and off (for when working out indoors) and to turn the alert sounds on and off. These can be done from the menus, but you have to navigate through several menu levels to get to them. It would also be nice to be able to adjust the volume of the alert sounds. I often don't need them to be as loud as they are, but my only choice is to turn them off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Overall the hype about the Garmin 305 is pretty well deserved. Its a great tool for an athlete and an even better tool for a Triathlete. You can use the GPS feature to get reasonably accurate distance numbers, and elevation. It also has a ton of programmable features like alarms, workouts etc you can use. I have had mine for a month and have not yet figured out everything. In addition, you can go indoors and use the accessories they have for the Bike and the run ( Foot pod, bike pod). All is well made. The only downside is that its not the most user friendly device I have seen. Not very intuitive. For this HR monitor they are not kidding when they say \\"Read the instructions before use\\" you really do need to sit down and read the instructions. But overall very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This a great product! I used in the Andes Crossing Race in Argentina to win our age category and it helped with pacing, distance and heart rate monitor. It never lost satelite contact in the mountains or woods. The only downside is the 10 hour battery life and it is alittle bigger than a regular watch... Being able to personalize the screens is a big plus. I also like the auto lap feature so I would automatically get the pace for the last km or mile. I recommend this to all runners... for its quality and very reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, wife finds difficult to use.","review":"Purchased as a Christmas gift for my wife.

Even though this wrist unit is larger it is nice only having the wrist unit and not the wrist unit and the arm unit. The GPS is very accurate and strong enough to keep the signal even in places where older Garmin units would lose the signal. Heart rate monitor works well. I like having the ability to adapt the screens for different views. The size of the 405 looks like it would be nice but for the price difference I can't justify it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I've been using this for around a month and it works well. I haven't lost any data or satellite signal yet. It is also nice to get the instantaneous data along with the averages. It shows you the instantaneous data for each leg of your path so you can monitor how you are doing for each part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic GPS","review":"Sure, on cloudy days it does take a little longer to get the signal, but what did I ever do without this unit? I also use the Nike Sport, but I love how I can use other tools to convert to Google Earth and track my routes. It stores data such as altitude climbed and you can compare that against time/distance, etc. Good to know when I biked only 30 miles to learn that I had over 3k feet of climbing. Not bad for Ohio. I love this thing.Granted, I wish it was a little smaller, but you quickly get use to it.I also use it for running and prefer to monitor my pace using Garmin over Nike Sport. A quick glance and I know if I am on target. NIke Sport -- I have to push a button, listen to two or three other items and by that time I'm back to being focused on the run.Get one - you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"The Garmin 305 was given to me as a birthday gift and after using it about 3 times I wondered how I ever worked out without it! The Garmin 305 is perfect long bike rides and running. I feel that I can truly maximize my workout and performance based upon the instant results calculated on the screen.My only negative review of this product is that it the screen can be fragile and needs to always be wrapped in something or put in a case when traveling. I put my Garmin 305 in my gym bag and when I got the gym and pulled it out the screen was cracked and the watch was broken. I'm on my second Garmin within 3 months - neeedless to say, I treat this one a lot more gently!Overall, great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new training parner","review":"I received the 305 in a timely manner. I run almost every day and have used it almost every time. Except for the one time I accidently let the battery run down.

Anyway, I use the product for long runs, tempo runs, and especially, interval training. My eyesight is fine, but the 305's worst feature is the extremely small font makes it difficult read, especially when watching rest times, etc. for intervals. Weird, it tracks the pace ok when I'm running but often when I'm standing still it still shows a variable pace. Not overly impressed, will look for something besides a Garmin product next time although there aren't a lot of choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was hoping for","review":"I bought this so I could keep better track of how far I was running and my pace. I'm not a strong runner and this has helped motivate me to run farther and faster. Very simple to use. The software is perfect for my needs.The only two negatives are that it is somewhat bulky and also the stand-by battery life isn't that great. I had it fully charged and didn't touch it for 4 days and when I went to use it for a run, it was out of batteries even though it was powered off all that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"forerunner 305","review":"I haven't ever used a watch like this before so i can't compare to other models. i love the gps function. i love the sharing of info & training programs/upload. i really wish the battery would last longer. i think it'll go total 5-6 hrs (with getting shut off inbetween). i am training for my first ultra & am afraid w/ continuous usage that the watch will not last for my whole long training runs. it is a bit big & clunky & it weighs unevenly on my wrist when i run.. i can feel it twisting on my wrist & is distracting & after several hours begins to hurt.

There are a lot of cool features that I'm still learning about but it was so easy to start up right out of the box. The display is easy to read and you can set your own preferences for number of fields on each display screen. Comes with everything you need to connect to your PC. I haven't tried the heartrate monitor yet but it, too, looks easy to use. I've worn it in the rain with no trouble. Battery life is great and it charges up from almost dead in a couple of hours. I love the \\"auto pause\\" when you have to stop for traffic or some other reason. It gets a satelite signal pretty quickly, within 1 or 2 minutes. I usually put it on my window sill while getting ready and it finds the signal from there. All in all, it's a fantastic deal with the heartrate monitor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective productive, horrible customer service","review":"The low price doesn't offset the many problems. The unit is unable to locate a satellite in sufficient time, to the extent that you end up waiting for 10 minutes or more to start your workout. The heart rate function works about 50% of the time. The watch interface is unwieldy, requiring that you acknowledge many superfluous messages with an enter click. Worst, the watch now blue-screens my brand new expensive desktop PC every time I try to upload data.....Months later, the heart rate function has stopped working entirely. Contacting customer service has been a hassle. They have been slow to respond and rude, as they imply that I have abused the watch, and are charging me $33 to ship it back. I have gone back to using my earlier Nike watch, much simpler but at least its reliable. Garmin sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Watch and Terrible Customer Service","review":"This watch was great while it worked but . . . the heart rate monitor stopped working in less than six months. Garmin then gave me the run-around. After I bought my own replacement strap -- $50, didn't help -- the finally agreed to replace the watch, but they insisted that they be allowed to charge my credit card for the cost of the watch -- $155 -- which they promised to return upon receipt of my old watch. They then charged my credit card $329, and, when they got the old watch back, refunded $173. At that point, they stopped communicating altogether. I spent hours trying to deal with issue, and in the end, would have been better off just buying a new watch.Again, the product is fine while it works, but if it breaks this quickly and Garmin does not stand behind the product, what is the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch for beginners","review":"Purchased this watch and arrived within a few days. Works great and gives the pertinent info such as distance, calories and heart rate. Plus, I like getting the maximum miles/hr and heart rate so I can train by how hard I am working. And yes it is bulky. I would say the only con is that I have a hard time acquiring a satellite signal at times, and this throws off the distance measurement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives running freedom","review":"This watch is great. Now I can run anywhere and know my miles. The software for the PC is ok but could have better maps. Infact, the navigational aspects of the watch are not very useful in general. The compass kinda points everywhere and you can't download waypoints into it. But, for running or biking where you won't get lost its is great. The GPS is very good and accurate. It even works in the car. If this watch broke I would buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"great monitoring device","review":"I have had the 305 for a almost a month now. I LOVE it. It seems kind of big and bulky, but does not feel that way on my wrist. It is fantastic for tracking routes, giving accurate speed and distances. It has built in workouts like tempo and intervals or you can customize your own. You can set it to pause when you are not moving. The screen is nice and large and very easy to read quickly when on the go. It is very user friendly and easy to download the data onto the computer. The only downside is it can't be used for swimming which means you can't use it during a triathlon. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Garmin","review":"This is my first Garmin so my learning curve is great. I have to admit that I enjoy the HR and pacing options that can be so informative during training. I think I have much to learn about it and will post more when I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Software","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said it's great when it works, it just doesn't work reliably. I've spent the last 2 days trying to download my info into garminconnect. It still hasn't downloaded. Sometimes it works instantly other times it takes repeated attempts and it seems this time it's not going to download at all. The download is very important to me and it just doesn't work very well.The equipment is adequate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Forerunner 305","review":"My Forerunner 305 is a great running partner. It is a great motivator and I like it very much. Very easy to set up and to read. I have only used it for running, but I am planning on going biking soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional Garmin Forerunner 305","review":"The Garmin Forerunner 305 is a functional GPS. Suprisingly small for a GPS but bulky for a watch to wear on one's wrist. The best feature is the programmable display. One can program the number of items shown and what items are shown. The only downsides to this watch are its bulkiness (which isn't too bad) and the side buttons which sometimes take a fingernail to depress. The start/stop and lap buttons on the watch face work just fine.If you don't mind a bulky \\"watch\\" and like to leave it one mode, then the Forerunner 305 is great. It would receive five stars if it were a little slimmer and the side buttons were easier to activate."},{"rating":"2","title":"garmin forerunner","review":"Absolutely worth the pennies...Brought my Marathon time down 20 minutes. My only issue is the bulkiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic running watch!! Highly recommend!","review":"After researching for hours over several different types of watches, I finally decided to go with the Garmin, and I also decided to get the 305 instead of the newer 405 due to some bad reviews I read. I am SO glad I made this purchase! This watch has been fantastic for use with my running, and I really love to analyze my heart rate data, distance, pace, etc. after my runs. The Garmin Training Center program is pretty much useless, but if you use Garmin Connect on the web or MotionBased, it's much more valuable. Though the watch is definitely big and somewhat ugly, it's a true workhorse, and I love having it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where am I? How fast did I get there?","review":"I got this for my wife, who runs and likes to know how fast and how far she goes. Seems to work as advertised, and although it seems big, she hasn't complained. I can see using it for hiking as well, as it seems really accurate. Loads satellites quickly enough when you turn it on, which was a worry when I read other's reviews. HRM seems to work well, too. Pretty neat. We haven't used it enough to challenge battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very frustrated","review":"This thing is not worth the money. It has battery problems, it has tracking problems, it is not easy to navigate. It cannot accurately judge the distance of one lap on a certified track (regularly off by 15 meters). I say save your money and use one of the free apps on the smartphones like Runkeeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"GPS 305 not what it claims to be","review":"I bought this model GPS 305 because it claimed to have better satellite range and reception, every run I used it on, I kept loosing the satellite, the pace per mile would jump from 9-10 min. miles to 2-4 min. miles. It would give me the average pace per mile, but not the max pace per mile, this was a replacement for the GPS 205 that I had, which never gave me any trouble. I will probably go back to the 205."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never run without it","review":"My Garmin 305 is awesome. It makes training so much more productive. Instead of having pre-measured running routes and distances, you can simply start running and it tells you the distance, pace, time, heart rate, lap pace and so much more. You can program several different types of workouts, intervals, paces and distances easily. You can customize different pace intervals and heart rate intervals to your specific settings. Initially I had a problem with the pace fluctuating too much to be useful. The Garmin customer support were very friendly and after changing the setting to \\"most smoothing\\" I am satisfied. I would recommend this product to anyone training for a run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome device","review":"Oh my , this is a great little tool, and I am not a runner, just starting to get into fitness. There a so many uses for this little \\"arm gadgit\\". It does so many things I don't know where to start. Yes it tells your heart rate, pace, inclines, de-clines, tracks your actual location, just to name a few. We have just added to it a horse heart rate monitor for endurance riding. Very niffty.Then add in the charting software simple another AWESOME tool to keep you on track and accountable for getting out there and burning up the calories. I just started working out and this has been a great tool to have around. The walk/run club I joined ([...]) several members have purchased this device and are loving it.The delivery service was outstanding. Pick up your own and see your workouts/ runs improve!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to return 1st one.","review":"Purchased the Forerunner 305 as a gift for my wife who runs quite a bit. I charged the device as soon as we got it. It would not power on even after charging all night. It said \\"Charging Complete\\". I called Garmin support which tried to do a couple different resets, but nothing worked. So I returned it to Amazon. They sent a new one out which has worked perfectly. The first one must have been a lemon.Both of us have used the watch for several runs now. I think it is great. It finds satellites quickly and hasn't dropped the signal on me yet. I found it easy to use and I believe my wife does as well. I have no regrets about purchasing this watch. I'm also glad Amazon has a wonderful return policy to handle these types of failures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive toy that doesn;t work!!!","review":"I bought this \\"VERY EXPENSIVE TOY\\" for my husband . He got to use if for a few times before it stop working, we went to the Garmin store and they couldnt do anything for us more than give us their costumer support phone number. They give us some pointers, but nothing has worked, next...keep on calling until we can have it fixed or my money back.... 8(."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!!!","review":"I've had this product for 1 year. I was happy with it for about 7 months until some issues began to pop up. Most were minor and I simply reset it by turning it off and then back on which seemed to cure it. About a month ago all buttons stopped functioning and it started beeping and turning itself on and off on it's own. I have one friend who had similar issues and sent it in to Garmin. After a hefty repair charge he had the same thing happen to his wife's 305. After speaking with him and doing some research I found that this product has known issues and Garmin continues to sell them with no modifications to the units to correct this problem. I'm VERY hesitant to purchase another Garmin product and am waiting for my wife's 305 to fail as well. This product is a $300 paper weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3 weeks...","review":"When it worked it was great...however it stop holding a charge after 3 weeks..no reason...worked on wed...didn't work on thur!It's under warranty so I had to send it back to garmin (also had to pay s&h; and tracking)...awaiting a new one which I hope isn't refurbished.Bought a Nike gps and love it. Plan to sell the forerunner if I ever get it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin Forerunner 305 GPS Receiver With Heart Rate Monitor","review":"I purchased this refurbished product at Christmas time for myself, and my husband had the same idea of getting a watch for me. I have heard it is a great watch, but this one was refurbished. He ordered me a pink garmin which I loved more, so I decided to keep both of them and give this one to my mom for her birthday. She started using it, and it isn't working too well. The heart rate monitor doesn't work along with some other things on the watch. I should have tried it out instead of putting it away in my closet. Now it is too late to send back. Make sure everything works with this company, Warehouse Deals, Inc., before it is too late to send back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"Well, its been 6 months since I purchased the product and the gps function has croaked. Everything else works but the distance always reads zero and does not change.I have tried to reset the watch (holding the mode/reset+power buttons) but that has not helped. The watch wasn't exactly cheap and what's worse is that I never dropped it and always wore a wristband under the watch so that it would not get all sweaty so I took very good care of it.I am very disappointed in the product's lifespan and Amazon only has a 30 day return policy so it looks like I'm outta luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Forerunner is great","review":"I have had great luck with most Garmin products. I dont see the need to spend twice as much money to buy the next model up, when I only wear it for running. it syncronizes autmatically with your computer and updates all your records accordingly. the map is a cool feature too. Its fun to look back on the stats and progress.Worth the money if you are a runner. I bought this watch a couple of months ago, it is fantastic. I live out West and the GPS works great, measures distance accurately heart beats, calories average speed and max. speed. watch is comfortable enough most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Running Gadget","review":"I love this product. I am fairly new at running and knowing that I have this attached to my wrist really keeps me motivated. The information that you get from each run is great. I also like simply being able to just turn it on without having to do any set-up to get started charting my runs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best purchase I've ever made!!!","review":"I'm absolutely in love with my Garmin Forerunner 305! It's the best on the market, easy to use (once you get the hang of it) and I got it at an AMAZING deal, which makes me enjoy it even better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT worth the money!!","review":"I have had this Forerunner 305 for about a month now. I bought it to replace the Forerunner 101 because my 101 would take forever to acquire a GPS signal and I was hoping the 305 would be much improved! I was sadly mistaken. It takes as long as 10 minutes sometimes for it to acquire a signal, and if you are a runner in the park, like I am, good luck keeping the signal if there are any trees nearby. The only reason I gave this product a 2 star and not a 1 star is because when it does actually work, it appears to work really well. Unfortunately for me, that is not very often!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets your heartbeat up alright","review":"The watch is alright once it works - but today I waited 20 minutes before it was able to lock on to the satellites, and waiting for this thing time and again makes my heartbeat rise faster than in a full sprint.It's also a big, ugly chunky thing - not that I really care too much about that.Once it does finally work it's ok - measures various data such as distance, heartbeat and approximates calories burned. The attempt at measuring ascent/descent is ridiculous and all over the place. The Garmin Training Center software is a throwback to what made Windows 3.1 so exciting. The motionbased website is a tad better, and lets you compare your times with other runners, and is a bit more professional than Nike+ is for instance, but is still awkward to use.All in all it's a nice idea - sorry about the execution. Try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice watch","review":"I bought this watch back in 2007 and haven't taken time to write my review. I have to say that this watch does what it's supposed to do and does it well. With that said, based on most of the reviews for this product I would say it's a great training watch for the marathon, which I used it for and now I plan to get the bike cadence adapter with it to integrate my workouts. Overall, great watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For runners","review":"This product is a great training aid as well as a good companion on races. Tried it in my first race last week and was surprised with the wealth of info and detailed feedback to help me track my runs and improve my times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best purchase","review":"This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. It has been a great motivator for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic running aid","review":"The Garmin Forerunner series are a must-have for any outdoor runner. I have owned the 205 for a number of years, and am only just starting to realize the amazing array of features and customizability this GPS device holds. I purchased the 305 for my wife, and she is very happy with it. The watch is very similar to the 205 excepting the color. The interface and menus are identical, from what we've been able to tell. The only key difference is the addition of the heart rate monitor, which gets information from the chest strap. We have yet to use this feature, but have been told it takes a little getting used to. All in all, a worthy product and something I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissaponted","review":"I am very dissapointed in this Garmin. Its a great device, but I used it twice and it completely stopped working.

With web offers and rebates, local stores couldn't touch the net price. I've had it close to a month and have no complaints. I'm able to monitor the heart rate and have a clear idea of how my training is going. It's also nice for those experimental rides where you're not sure how far or how hard you're going. Combined with a wired bike computer with cadence, I have all the data I need. The Garmin software is easy and the Motion Based website is even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin 305","review":"The watch has 2 little holes under that allows the swet to go inside it. So if you use 3 to 5 time a week end swet when running, your watch will last no more than 1,5 year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for running and no much more","review":"This model has been on the market for a while. A little bulky and limited to 4 types of info at a time. Features rich for training. Buttons are hard to press.

The wrist unit itself work's very well and I am very impressed with the ability of the Forerunner 305 to receive satellite signal's,even on heavy overcast day's! However,I am experiencing,what I believe,is a simple problem with Garmin's \\"Training Center\\" PC software that is included with the Forerunner 305. After I had made NUMEROUS attempt's to E-mail my question to Garmin Customer Support,I have come to the conclusion that Garmin does not want to be bothered with their customer's technical question's! So,in conclusion,when my GPS unit eventually become's inoperable,I will not bother Garmin with anymore of my money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product but battery life poor","review":"I have enjoyed working out with this watch. It has helped me get ready for three triathlons so far with more to come. I like that it can be configured for running or biking, with several screen options embedded. The heart rate monitor has worked great for me and I like to download my training into the computer.On the flip side, the battery life is still poor. This thing needs to live on the charger between workouts - I cannot get two workouts in a row without charging the battery. Wish they would address that problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finger of Steel needed to push the buttons","review":"Borrowed from a friend - I am giving it back. The manual is terrible.

It was $153.94 just five hours ago, now it is $211. I am writing this to let everyone know Amazon can make money selling it at $153, so if you are paying more they are making a killing on you.

I bought this 3 years ago and can't imagine running or biking without it anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Years and still Running","review":"First of my Army Friends to have this toy and have been the cause of many to buy this product. Simply an awesome tool while running to give you exercise time, distance, pace, heart rate, and much more. Awesome tool after running as it automatically creates a log for every run while it is on your wrist calculating time, distance, and splits(I set mine at 1 mile pace splits). Every friend I have loaned it to has bought their own soon afterwards. Over the past 3 years it has been very durable with no issues. My only complaint is the software that it comes with has really baseline maps with no graphics(I know Gramin can do better in this area), the pace lags about 5 seconds behind but is still a good benchmark to see where you are at that point in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"The 305 is great. The freedom this device gives the runner/rider is awesome. I would prefer to give it 4 1/2 stars, though. It is pretty bulky but I can deal with that. I did not like that you have to run it till its dead before charging it again.Despite these qualms, the 305 is well worth the month and I would definitely buy it again if need be and recommend it for any running/cycling enthusiast.Sidenote: I have yet to try the heart rate moniter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted","review":"So many others have written so much about this HRM, that I don't see the need in another long review. I am extremely happy with the Garmin 305, because it is the perfect balance of price and function. I was looking for a tool that could alert me when my heart rate wandered out of my target zone and also alert me at certain distances. For this price, nothing is as reliable. Furthermore, the included software was simple to install, and very user friendly.My only complaint was that the maps used in the software are outdated, but with the ability to sync with Google Earth it makes this a non-issue. I don't know why this model is being replaced by the much more expensive 405, which in my opinion fills a totally different product niche."},{"rating":"2","title":"me","review":"Certainly,one of the most fun and technologically advanced gps exercise devices I've owned.

I bought this to start tracking my training. I was worried about the GPS and tracking capabilities here but there has been absolutely no problems. The mapping and tracking has been what I hoped it would be. I have no comparison to other products like this, but I absolutely satisfied with the outcome.The ability to transfer outcomes to your computer and track your splits and progress are really nice as well.

Unless it comes right off the charger it tends to give you a low battery alert and shut down after just a few minutes. The internal rechargeable battery is not user replaceable although some have successfully done it but it sounds like a job for a jewler.

The smallest repair out of warranty, at least in Canada, is $94, and you have to pay $40 up front for them to even look at it, and that is not refundable when they tell you that they can't find anything wrong. When they're working they're great, but be ready to buy a new one every other year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"I researched a few of the Garmin units before deciding on this one. I looked at the 405 and the newly released 110, and after comparing the features and cost I went with the 305. I couldn't be happier. It is a little larger than the others but after wearing it a couple times I don't even notice. The amount of data that it collects is great to go back and analyze, and you can see how you were doing at specific portions of a race.In addition the 305 gives the option of using the footpod (indoors) and a cadence sensor (bicycle).Would definitely recommend to others and would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS for runners!","review":"I bought this for my husband to track his runs.

I am training for my first marathon in 21 years, and after being a decidedly low tech runner for all that time, I decided I'd like to have a GPS watch to give me flexibility on long training runs, both at home and while traveling. Most of my running friends who have GPS watches have this same version and all are happy with it. I honestly don't use most of the more advanced features, but at this price, who cares? I considered the newer, much more expensive version, but since I am not a triathlette, being fully waterproof was not a valuable enough feature. Nor was wireless data upload, since I am trying to avoid becoming obsessive about tracking my running history. I have knobby wrists, and this is a little heavy, but after a few weeks it becomes much less noticeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tether is off","review":"Simply stated, the Forerunner -- like all running GPS units, I'm sure -- has essentially removed the tether from my runs. Now I'm not bound to pre-measured runs, which was very limiting. Instead, I can add side streets to bump up mileage on days when the running's easy and idle back a bit on days when it's extremely hot or I'm feeling flat. Satellite linkup can take a couple of minutes, but I run on a lot of wooded trails and camp roads with overhead foliage and I never lose lock when it's been established. The display is large enough to read easily and while not truly intuitive, the unit is pretty easy to figure out. The size appears to be an issue -- it does look bulky -- but you don't even notice it when you're wearing it. A great training tool I can't imagine running without."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BOMB!","review":"Pros: The complete package. HRM and GPS work great.

Another friend of mine had already bought the 205 model (the same as the 305, but w/o the heart rate monitor). Now, after 3 years of use, all 4 are not working AT ALL, because of dead batteries. The joke is that you cannot replace them. When they die, you simply throw your 305 to the garbage. Furthermore, during these 3 years, one always had problems with long races, ultras or trail marathons that would last over 7-8 hours. As I read, Garmin is still using the same philosophy for other similar products, like the Garmin Edge 305HR (bike) or the new 405.It's a pitty that such an anti-ecological policy prevails, for a product that, otherwise, is very good for outdoor sports, running, biking even skiing (but not triathlon). I hope that Garmin changes policy, cause until then they have lost 4 customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware - Battery can only be replaced through Garmin at $79","review":"I bought this as a gift for my spouse a year ago. They absolutelyloved it. Recently, it would not turn on and we thought thatperhaps the rechargeable battery needed replaced. A call toGarmin support revealed that to replace the battery, we wouldneed to arrange for it to be mailed in and they would thenreplace it with a different REFURBISHED watch (not the onethat we own) and -- it gets even worse --- it would cost $79.00!!So, needless to say, we are not doing that. We were toldto try upgrading the software and if that did not work,then to press the mode button and the power button to resetthe watch. I will try those suggestions, but if it turnsout to need a replacement rechargeable battery, forget it!It will be no more Garmins for us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!","review":"In October I bought this Garmin 305 while training for my first half-marathon. There are so many features that other companies don't even come close to matching. As far as the GPS.. nothing else can even compare to the accuracy.When the Motoactv came out I felt that I would enjoy this product even more than the Forerunner 305. Boy, I was wrong. I loved the fact that it was an mp3 player and a GPS. However.. the GPS was wayyyyy off! I ended up returning the Motoactv.Needless to say, I am more than pleased with the 305!!! I can't see myself using anything else for a while.. and when I do upgrade.. it will definitely be a Garmin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome watch","review":"I am very into running, and am on the Junior Olympic cross-country team.

I initially loved the watch and was very pleased with the results. After my 12th run with the watch it went completely dead. I tried all of the \\"hard\\" and \\"soft\\" resets and scoured the internet for solutions to the problem, to no avail. The watch will now only turn on when it is resting in the cradle and as soon as I take it off, it dies. Amazon was great and agreed to let me return and receive my money back, but I will not be buying another Garmin watch. Any suggestions for an alternate???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I saw this watch on quite a few runners at a half marathon I was in recently. Started asking about because I thought it looked so bulky and heavy. But after they told me more about I was intriqued. So the next week I took the plunge and bought it here. I was still worried about the size but I was wrong. It does look big on my small wrist but I have not noticed any difficulties with size or weight. I love being able to see how far I have run or need to run. Sometimes the pace goes a little crazy but overall I feel it is pretty acurate. So I would definitely recommend to someone who runs alot and in places they may not know the distance of their run. I have only used the HR monitor once so I do not have an opinion about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great training device","review":"Purchased the Garmin 305 because of Garmin's excellent reputation and the recommendations from several people that I run with. Easy to setup and use. The software is Ok, the free [...] is better. At first it seems large on the wrist but you soon get use to it. For my aging eyes, larger screen text, numbers would be nice. I also used it mountain biking and it worked well. Overall pretty darn happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Forerunner 305","review":"Great training tool. I was afraid that the GPS might not be very accurate but it was pretty consistent and picked up satellites, even in areas I thought were fairly remote.

I use it whenever I run now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Forerunner 305","review":"This is a great workout item. I use it for running and biking, and it does a great job tracking speed and distance. I bought this in Sept 06, and had a few problems with running pace. This was fixed with some software updates in April 07. The only drawback to this product is the very poor heartrate monitor. It works most of the time when I run, but doesn't work at all for biking. It shows spikes of over 200 bpm for the first 2 miles, then settles down a bit, but still has spikes over the rest of the ride. The colder the weather, the worse the heartrate monitor works.

The first day i wanted to use it on a run it didnt pick up any satelites. It worked for my next three workouts, but then for no apparant reason it wouldn't turn on. I know it was charged from the night before and was not on prior in the day. In fact, when left in the portal it usually displays a message that it is charging or that the charge is complete; this time nothing. When it works its great... great data, feedback, the pace runner. But twice now it has failed to live up to expectations for as much as these units cost. I would have given this a 1 star, but it does have nice features when its working. I read someone else had similar issues and was on his third watch from Garmin before he got one that worked right. I sure hope it doesnt take me that long."},{"rating":"2","title":"garmin 305 training watch.","review":"This is a great tool for tracking your run or bike rude.

They rapidly replaced it with a refurbished unit. About three weeks later, the Mode button started malfunctioning (working only intermittently) on the refurbished unit.

About 3 months ago, a mysterious swiggle appeared on the screen (under the glass) that blocks about 1/3 of the watch face. Last month I noticed the average lap pace was no longer accurate. This week I discovered my watch is no longer transmitting my run history to the on-line website, even though I keep current on software updates. I assumed the data was being uploaded because the synch was working. Result - loss of all runs and bike rides over the last six weeks. Garmin won't replace my unit since it is out of warranty.

Big time recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"This is a fantastic product and the cost-benefit now is absolutely amazing. I think everything has already been said by the community. I love this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome GPS Watch","review":"This is my first gps watch and I love it so far. I've used it on runs and bike rides and it is always within 5 hundredths of a mile. The best feature for me is the integration with RunKeeper. To import new workouts, I simply connect the watch to my computer, go to runkeeper and import the workout directly from the watch.The only thing I don't like is the size, but I don't really notice it when I'm running."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for marathon training","review":"I started marathon training on my own, thinking that if I just ran a steady pace that I would improve. OH, How wrong was I, my more experienced marathon family told me to get this watch in order to watch my pace and it works wonders. It does everything I need it to, track mileage, current pace and average pace times. I would highly recommend this product for those who are thinking about serious training.The only problem I've had, is that my wrist bone stick out farther than normal and it does cause some discomfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"usefull tool","review":"I haven't figured out everything with it yet, it has a lot of functions.

A very good tool for both running and biking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin Forerunner 305","review":"The Garmin Forerunner 305 has two MAJOR problems. First, Garmin's algorithm for altitude recording is poor. It apparently records every foot of elevation it thinks you gain or lose. Since there will always be some measurement error in altitude, you could run a mile on a track and the Garmin Forerunner 305 will say you've done 300 feet of elevation when you're done. I've had Polar and Avocet altimeters and both gave accurate readings on known elevation climbs. The Garmin typically doubled the true elevation gain!Garmin's bigger problem is customer service. After using the Forerunner for two weeks, I had a software problem and emailed Garmin's customer service. No response. I emailed again. No response. After five emails over four weeks with no reply from Garmin I gave up and returned the Forerunner.Until Garmin gets some customer service, I'd advise getting a Suunto or another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted one year","review":"I used the Garmin Forerunner 305 for just about a year. It worked great and was very helpful for tracking my runs but then it just stopped working. The software that came along with the watch now can not recognize the watch. I have tried several recommended fixes and none of them work. A one year life span is pretty weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ergo bust for slim wrists","review":"A small person (5.5 ft, 110 lb) would have to make an elastic padded satin collar or some such.

Good tool to improve your speed or distance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy Customer","review":"Either I am not using it correctly, or I'm just plain old unhappy. Here's why:1. The calorie counter doesn't seem to be accurate; according to some deeply hidden reviews, it does NOT calculate correctly.2. The strap lowers and I cannot make it any tighter.3. GPS is good; but I could now just use free APPS on my iPhone.4. To set up runs, it takes a great deal of navigation to get to interval training.5. In summary, it's not user-friendly. My iPhone and the Free Apps (like runkeeper, etc.) are much easier to use.6. Product is really bulky; thought it would be fine. It's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"garmin forerunner 305","review":"Excellent product. Bought it for my wife so she could train for her half marathons without having to map out every run. Takes a few minutes to find a gps signal, but is very strong and reliable when it does. Its a little bulky, but shaped well so it stays in place well on the arm, no slippage while running."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty product","review":"I was really excited about this but after using it for a month, I wouldn't give it a high recommendation. The main issue is that mine spontaneously shuts off while I'm running - multiple times. The user's manual doesn't give a lot of trouble shooting options, nor could I find a solution on Garmin's website, so I emailed the company and got a two-part answer two days later. I've done step one and my Garmin still has the same problem, so I'll undertake step two and see if that provides a solution. If not, I'll either try to return or I guess I'm stuck with a fairly useless product.Since I also value this type of tool for heart rate function, it would be good if I could read my heart rate without glasses, but the heart rate is displayed in approximately 8 point font in the upper right hand of the device.I am really disappointed with this product overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great for me","review":"I run more sprints than long distance and you can design your own workouts with alarms so its perfect for what i use it for. I also use it jumping rope, battle ropes, or even circuit training. Figuring out how to use the programs were not bad but once i got it down pat, I \\"LOVE\\" it! Its last years model but so what, for $130 it was a steal for me. I would definitely buy one again, I use it for fitness and cardio for mma, but i have a friend that does triathalons, he bought one too and loves his! Im sure some people will downgrade it, but you cant please everyone, especially the ones who complain about everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for the Serious Runner!","review":"I have had this device for almost a year now and don't know how I lived without it. Garmin has raised the price on this because it's feature set is close to the next level up and it was half the price...too bad for those who didn't get one earlier.As a preface, I dont use the heart rate monitor. I thought I would but haven't. This is an amazing tool! The connect.garmin website is slick and makes publishing your results very easy. Its deadly accurate with exception to highly wooded areas and metro areas. When I did the Oakland Marathon, It was off by .4 of a mile by the end and I think that had to do with part of the terrain.Overall its incredibly easy to use and I love this thing. May you run long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!","review":"I bought this to help with my cross country skiing and its summer, so I have only gotten to use it a couple times for running. It locks in pretty fast and even inside sometimes. Once it does lock in, it stays, so that is good also. I do plan to use it for grouse hunting and deer scouting in the woods as I always wonder \\"How far did I actually go today?\\". Once again that season starts in 2 weeks so I will continue honing my \\"programing\\" skills so I can easily get where I want to go from the menu and such."},{"rating":"1","title":"short product lifespan; worst customer service","review":"Great product while it worked. I've had it for about 18 months when it suddenly died. I've tried everything from reset to software downgrade/upgrade; nothing worked. The customer support suggests to send it in for a repair that costs more than half the price of a new product. Unbelievable.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for running and cycling","review":"I use 305 for running (long distances and intervals) and cycling (mostly watching my cadence since I'm new in cycling). The only complains I have are:1) It takes long time for it to initialize GPS. Sometimes up to almost 3 minutes. Not good when it's freezing or raining outside.2) I wish sound level for beeps is louder.3) Some minor issues with their PC software (mostly related to saving/importing workouts), nothing serious though.But onve again - 305 is just a great device!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GPS speed is too slow for any good","review":"experience the same as many reviewers, the GPS speed of this item is just too slow, either in Built-up area or in open park (slightly better), you can expect to wait for up to 10 mins. just to get the GPS catches the signal before you can start your routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS unit, support software is very buggy","review":"The actual GPS unit performs very well, but I've had problems since day one syncing the unit to Garmin Connect. Regardless of computer used, the sych process locks up at least once every time I need to sych. I'm used to the inconvenience now, but it's still quite annoying. Also, the device does take quite a while to find satellites at times.Compared to my Edge 800 (which is flawless uploading to Connect and finding Satellites) this unit is mediocre in performance, but an excellent value. I guess comparing a $130 unit to a $500 unit is somewhat unfair, but, it is what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This is my first heart monitor and so far it is a great product.

I love the mapping features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upgraded to newer model","review":"I love the new Garmin 305. I had an older version, and it didn't work if you ran in the forest or under trees. This one works well and the distance and pace are accurate. It's really easy to use and you don't have to study the book to figure out how to use it. I love it.I haven't used the Heart Rate Monitor yet, or downloaded the workouts to my computer, but those are available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Forerunner","review":"It seems easy to use at first but when I tried to delay when it started tracking, I couldn't find out how.

Could generate amazing graphs for post-run analysis, race against my own PR, and even overlay my runs on GoogleEarth.Unfortunately, after only 13 months of use - 1 month out of warranty, the unit won't turn on. Okay, so I work with Garmin support, and after a few latent iterations (up to 3 business days per response, egad!), my only option is to send it in for repairs. Okay still, except ALL repairs are a flat rate of (gulp) $99.I wish Garmin made the rechargeable battery serviceable by a retailer or jeweler, similar to competing products. I realize that this might not be the problem, but since it appears to be fully functional when powered, it would be a worthwhile $10 test, as opposed to spending half the cost of a new one to get the not-so-old one repaired.Goodbye Garmin! I miss you already!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this GPS","review":"I 've been using this product for 5 months and I am really happy with this product. i recommend this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin 305 Review","review":"The Garmin is everything I expected. Its accurate and has a lot of very helpful functions(most that i'm still trying to play with). It's a little bulky but I also have very small wrists. I wear in on my inner wrist or it'll rub on my bone and become irritated. It stays in place fine, even when I get sweaty.When I was setting up my Garmin with my computer for the first time I was having difficulty with my laptop recoginizing that it was attached. It turns out that the USB cord that was sent from the seller was not the proper cord or there was damage to it. There is no Garmin logo or writing on it. I only discovered this after being on the phone with tech support for over an hour, so that was a bit discourging. Garmin has sense sent me a new cord, free of charge.I absolutely love all the information you get when you load your runs to the website!I'm overjoyed with my purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shuts down during runs","review":"Great watch and great price, but had it for 14 months and it stared to periodically shut down in the middle of my runs (and yes it had been fully charged). Reading online blogs others have also experienced the very frustrating defect. Garmin was of little help when I called them. Will try to avoid Garmin products in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers its promises","review":"Was delivered in less than 5 days without any problemI used it 3 times on my usual jogging trails and tested various features. They all work fine, exactly as described in the Garmin website.It took 2 to 4 minutes to find satelites when turned on. After that it never lost them. I was jogging in an area with buildings, trees, bridges...The PC connection and the software to analyse performance works very well and are very convenient.Great product for monitoring and tracking performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Running Tool","review":"Pros-Excellent device. Always you to run anywhere while tracking miles, time, and heart rate. No longer constrained to known tracks.Cons-First one failed/returned. Some of the features like pacing and calories do not work well; the sample period is too short so it wonders to much to be useful. Elevation tracking is poor (+/-30ft, cycles up/down, known GPS issue), so calory estimations are way off.Even with flaws, wonderful device for monitoring your training progress... love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unreliable","review":"I bought a Garmin Forerunner to help me train for running a marathon. The unit is great, and it has been a huge help in training. However, the unit keeps malfunctioning--I am currently on my fourth Forerunner. On Forerunner #1, the GPS went out. On Forerunners #2-4, the device just died, and wouldn't turn on. Or if I could turn it on, it would turn itself off after a short period of time. Luckily I bought it at REI and they have been good about exchanging the device.I really like this device, but I would advice against buying it. Also, Garmin's customer service isn't the best. Once you actually get to speak with someone, they are helpful; however, plan to wait on hold for 45 minutes to an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got one, amazon said \\"brand new\\" but it is already registered","review":"bought one from Amazon last Dec,used it for running for couple of times before Xmas and New Yearoverall it is not a solid productbut recently been trying to play with the sharing map optionwent to garmin's website and was told this device is already registered (not by me)well, obviously what I got was not brand new as amazon claimed.Garmin's crappy online FAQ just list the question yet doesn't provide any suggestionI'd recommend this product but would not trust amazon like I trust them before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"I already own one of these and really enjoy it so I bought another for a friend.

He loves it so far. The GPS feature seems work out pretty good; the device is able to track most of the the running trails he went including Melbourne city in Australia.There is only one thing I am not satisfied with the customer service of Garmin 305. There is a warning sign that certain materials used for the watch may cause birth defects or cancer. I called up their customer support and they are not able to provide me any information about this. I hope Garmin will do better than this to reduce the health risk that their customers may expose to when the products are distributed and used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin 305","review":"I've had this watch for over a year and love it.

I mostly use just HR, pace, distance right now but hopefully will be able to figure out how to create workouts and use the HR zones soon. It is biggish, but I dont mind. It helps to turn it on and put it in the window sill before you plan to go out as it takes a while to pick up a signal sometimes. I use the Garmin connect website to upload but wish the software were better. I dont think sporttracks is available for macs yet. The buttons are small, and you cant really figure out what you're doing while you're running, so it helps to review everything before you actually go out on a run until you get used to it. Overall, easy to use and adds to my fun with workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only I could download the data into a GIS...","review":"Great device. I would really like to be able to access the raw data- the readings of coordinates and time and elevation and heart rate so I could plot them as I need. I've heard of some freeware that could do this, but Garmin really should take the lead here. Also, it seems from the highly erratic speed/pace data that some smoothing is in order... a single errant point (common in GPS receivers, especially those with antennaes being waved around) can cause distortions in speed calculations. But these can be smoother out using averages over several points. Another reason I'd like access to the data. Ok, I'm a geek, but there's great information wasted here! And in the interest of full disclosure- I'm a GRMN stockholder."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Still a Sure Timekeeper+","review":"This is my second 305. My first started to leak water -after 3 years of use and having purchased it from another person- and wasn't repairable.This newer one is even better. It locks in on satellites in less than a minute. It took me through a series of questions in the set-up menu so the calorie count burn rate would be accurate. I did go with a refurb for a little more money. I wanted the 1 year warranty.This newer model has a shorter wrist strap. Still fits but fewer holes left over at the end. If this ever dies I will want another just like it.

I started out using it for running only, then I switched to multi-sport, and now, I'm using it primarily for cycling. I absolutely LOVE this thing. It's easy to use. It works. It's accurate. With cycling, when I upload the rides onto Strava.com, it does seem to short me a little bit on the amount of climbing I do compared to what other devices register, but that's not a big deal for me at all. I've dropped it, gotten it wet multiple times, biked and run thousands of miles with it, and it still works perfectly five and a half years after I got it. I've only changed the battery in the HR monitor once, and it still works fine as well, as does the cadence and speed sensor accessory I purchased. I haven't tried the new stuff, but I don't know if people need to drop the extra money for the newer models because this one may do everything you want it to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor warranty service","review":"The Up button broke after 3 months of use, never had a fall or even a bump or swim, in fact it may have been that way from the start as I only started to use it fully.

The GPS is awesome! I havent had any problems with connecting at all. I originally bought the Sunnto t6, and used it for about 3 weeks. I hated it. The display was limited to 3 lines of text, the altimeter had to be reset before every workout, the pods were ok, but i just thought not having them was a better solution. Yes it was smaller, but after getting used to the 305, I dont even notice its a little big now. And when on a bike I have it on the handlebar anyway, so no problem. I would recomend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I usually don't write reviews, but I REALLY enjoy my Forerunner 305 and wanted to share with others. I have had my forerunner for about a month and am more pleased each time I use it. I find it easy to customize and it seems to have all the features I could want and more. The Heart Rate info is stable, easy to read and the GPS locates satellites quickly. I Love being able to run in new places and see exactly how far I am running and at what pace. The best thing is that it actually makes my running more fun. I download my runs to the Training Center Software and review them to watch my improvement which gives me more encouragement. I thought this was for more advanced runners, but I find that as a novice runner it really keeps me motivated."},{"rating":"2","title":"heart rate gps watch","review":"I think this is remarkable. I can go out and come back and look at what I've done.It is very easy to use. I'm somewhat computer illiterate and this has been understandable for use.

The first watch that I used lasted about two years with no problems. The three subsequent monitors have given me a myriad of problems, from no HRM, to failure to charge, to crashing my computer, to failure of information to download. I ordered a unit about six months ago and used it for two weeks before it failed to charge. I sent it back and immediately got another which did the same thing. I don't know if they're dumping the defective monitors on the market or what, but getting two in a row with the same problem may not be coincidental. I highly recommend buying your monitor from Costco or some other local store that will give a full refund for defective gear. Using mail order involves shipping and at least a two week wait for a refund. I have basically been without a monitor for a month because of what seems to be a big drop off in workmanship. For someone who's seriously training, this can be a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Great to have for training...I like being able to immediately log my workouts into the computer. Very accurate....however, since nothing is perfect.I am disappointed that the beep of the \\"alert\\" setting is barely audible.and Garmin says that it can not be adjusted..........So far..I am enjoying it. N. Guidry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice gadget","review":"I have totally enjoyed this thing. It adds another dimension to my running and, since I am obsessed with tracking my distance, it is very helpful. The virtual partner is a great training tool. I have not even played with any of the advanced training tools , nor the navigation tools. I am waiting for warmer weather before trying out those features.The drawbacks have been mentioned by other reviewers, namely the software is not so great and it takes a couple of minutes to find the satellites (a problem when it is 8 degrees and you want to get going). The issue one reviewer mentioned about erratic pace readings I have not seen. It is a little jumpy at the beginning of a run but stabilizes in the first hundred yards or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Forerunner 305 GPS","review":"I bought this because my 201 quit working on me one day. I use the 305 for running, biking and hiking and it does exactly what I want it to do. I hiked Mount Washington NH and the elevation display seemed right on to within a 30 feet. It definitely picks up the GPS signals better than the 201 and I very rarely hit a dead spot. I have had some trouble getting the heart rate monitor to steadily pick up the beat and have not figured out why it works sometimes and not others. I wet it (and me) as it says in the instructions and tightened it etc. so go figure. Overall though I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic GPS Watch!!!","review":"I love this watch! It works as advertised. The best part for me, is that it really motivates me to push just a little bit harder each time I run. Also, I love the ease of tracking all my training now.

Thank you Garmin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good tool","review":"It is very flexible in terms of data display definition we need to control like heart rate, distance, laps, time, speed, elevation, and so on. Only the instant speed is not very precise as the it is based on the GPS device. In my case it is not a big deal, as I am more interested in control my average pace. I live in a neighborhood with several buildings, so the watch takes a couple of minutes to find the satellites. The software is nice, but the site Garmin Connect is really cool. It is possible to upload your data and share it with your coach for example. I need to explore more the exercise options and how to use the software/site to plan my trainings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"The unit itself is a little big, but I love the feedback it gives for all of my workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great for 2 years, but now not working","review":"Bought my Garmin 305 in February 2010, and have used it extensively.

But -- in March 2012, the day before my first marathon. I charged the watch to make sure it had plenty of battery life. Showed fully charged. Then I tried to download my last run data, and it wouldn't turn on. Tried charging again, and nothing. I assume the battery has died. I have a message in to Garmin. Surely at the price these devices are, they should last more then 2 years. We'll see what Garmin's response is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS watch - just very large for my very small wrist!","review":"I have recently taken up running and am preparing for my first half-marathon, after runnning several 5 and 10Ks.

In hind sight I'm looking forward to finding something smaller."},{"rating":"2","title":"The running watch to own","review":"This is my second Garmin 305 watch. I wore out my first watch after 3 years and 3000+ miles. This watch has everything a runner needs. If you are looking for a watch for a triathlon then look at the newer Garmins due to the water resistance. The price can't be beat. I also purchased the newer heart rate monitor strap versus using the one that comes with the 305 which is worth the money since it is much more comfortable. The quad split screen is easy to see and use. Some people think the watch is bulky. Yes it is not the most fashionable watch but then you are not going to wear it out on the town. I like hooking the watch up and seeing my runs on Google Earth. If you are a high milage runner like me expect the watch to last 3 years. This seems to be the consensus life time among all the feedback I get from others within my running group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I expected it to be","review":"It is a really great watch.

So, this is still an upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin 305 is great","review":"I chose the 305 over the newer Garmin models based on customer ratings and I am glad that I did. Although this GPS watch is big, it is light. It is packed with features. I am pleased with the ease of opertion and the wealth of information this item provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"He loves it!","review":"I got this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift since he runs, He absolutely loves it, the gps tracks your distance no matter where you are so it gives you the freedom to run anywhere you please. When you connect it to your computer it logs a map of where you ran, your heart rate at each point in your run along with your pace, it creates a spreadsheet of your averages and min and max rates."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE my forerunner!","review":"I love this Garmin! It's a lot less expensive than other models out there, (probably due to it being a little more bulky)but it still has ALL the bells and whistles of the other models. It big but it's pretty light and breathable. I get annoyed wearing things when I run but this doesn't bother me very much, I would never leave home for a long run without it! If you are looking for something smaller and a little more \\"watch\\" like this probably wouldn't be a good choice as it is one of the larger models. But if you don't want to spend an extra $100-$200 on \\"less bulky\\" this is a great choice as it will provide the same functions (in some cases even better) than the smaller Garmin Forerunners such as the 110. This tells you your current pace, whereas the 110 does not. Overall EXTREMELY happy with this purchase. It's been used between 2 people for over a year and is still functioning as well as the day it was purchased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Forerunner 305 a winner","review":"I have loved using this since I received it. I am still finding new features to use. If you are doing intervals and/or heart rate training I would highly recommend this. I many times run in the dark so it is nice to set the alarm to beep at a certain distance and then I don't have to keep looking at the watch. At the distance I can either hit lap to see my time, or you can have it automatically record lap data at certain distances. Being female I have very small wrists and have had problems with many watches. I was worried this would be too big, and while it is large it fits very comfortably and I hardly notice it is there. The only draw back is that I can't wear it in the pool and that I won't be able to wear it in triathlons because it is not waterproof... if this one breaks I am definitely buying another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heart Rate Monitor Feature Did Not Work","review":"The watch came highly recommended, but I just could not get the heart rate monitor to work.

Imagine my surprise when I discovered there is no easy way to replace the internal battery. You have to know how to solder wires as the battery is connected by wires to the watch.

I charge it once a week or less and have had no problems. I've heard people complain about the gps satalite aquire times and I don't know what they are talking about. I've used a number of gps units from hand held to aviation and this watch actually aquires the satalites quicker than my garmin aviation model (196). It does take a little time to learn all the features and that is probably because it has a lot of features. I call it as I see it on reviews. If it was crap I'd call it crap but this thing provides a lot of value for a buck fifty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected it to be...","review":"I confess I may not understand how this thing completely works. But, the reasons I'm not happy with this product are: the watch doesn't seem to stay charged very long. And, I bought this to use on extended hiking trips (overnights)... and wanted the GPS for my own safety. Secondly,if you are a woman with small wrists... this watch is HUGE. Very clunky. But, in it's defense... most of the GPS watches are too big for small wrists. If I had seen this watch at the store... I would not have bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"This is one, if not, the greatest running tool you can buy. The garming 305 has so many great features to help you improve your running, it can keep of everything so that you can improve your time on the next run. You can upload routes to share with other users and download routes from other people to compete with them. The only things that keep it from achieving greatness is that the heartrate moniter doesn't work, I even let my friends tried it to see if it was my heart and it was a no go. I tried every tip on the troubleshooting page and nothing work it and even if it work is still too small to read while running at a decent pace. If you are a dedicated this is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down one of the all-time BEST GPS watches... ...EVER!","review":"There are volumes written about the form and function of this GPS, so I won't try to repeat any of that here. This GPS \\"watch\\" is simply one of the best for runners, cyclists, or triathletes. Period. The fact that it has been around so long is incredible. It just goes to show that it's hard to improve on something so close to perfect!I use the HR strap, cadence sensor (bike), and foot pod (run) on an almost daily basis. The ONLY thing this model won't record are Ant+ compatible power devices. You have to go to the 310XT or higher for that.As a triathlete, this or the 310XT are the perfect training companion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Upload Issues","review":"This watch does everything great except for data uploads which makes it nearly useless. You can eventually get your runs to upload but it typically takes 5-10 attempts (about 15 minutes). The problem has been noted dozens of times on Garmin's home site as well as other blogs accross the internet. In the Garmin Forums, the Garmin reps suggest checking your connections, clearing cache, re-booting, adding Garmin to your secure sites then if you do not give up, they tell you to contacting support. I have never seen the issue resolved and Garmin Support acts like this is the first time they have seen this issue.I thought I got a great deal on this watch on Amazon. You get what you pay for I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid GPS watch","review":"I'm using this for the past one and half year.No problems so far.I replaced the battery of the heart rate monitor last month.I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good gps watch.BTW ,I bought it for $110 and now it is listed for $250.It is the only gadget I saw where the price is going up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid GPS Receiver","review":"I have owned two of these. (Lost the first one during a bike ride). It is an excellent GPS receiver, but it is rather large and uncomfortable on the wrist. I only use it with a bike mount of some sort, so it is easier to read while riding. The mount and quick release strap that are for this are good, but I lost the first receiver when it popped out of the mount... but it is possible I didnt have it seated correctly.The GPS accuracy is excellent, even when in cities, but it does take a while to get the initial satelite lock.All in all it is an excellent product, that I use regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product, worst possible software!","review":"The only reason to buy this product is if you have a hear condition and need to carefully monitor your heart rate. The software makes no use of the data at all. For example, the way calories are calculated, it says you burn more on a miles long cost down a mountain than you'll burn working hard on the way up.It only uses SPEED to calculate effort! How silly is that? Buy the cheaper unit and you'll be happier. If you really want to measure your efforts forget the value of the GPS and get something like a Timex or Polar. They use the heart stress measurements correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!!!!","review":"I was loving the features of this running watch for 4 months before it stopped working altogether.

For whatever reason, the people at Garmin deemed it unnecessary to include a simple software that can calculate calories burned based on your heart rate over a period of time. Because of this I now have to buy a separate devicewith a separate HRM strap for my indoor activities.Their built-in terrain map sucks too. Good thing they built in the ability to view your activities on Google Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't pick up GPS signal","review":"Initially worked well, after a couple years it would not pick up the signal.

I'd spent ages considering the pro's and con's of all of the different versions - 405, 405CX, 310XT - but just made a 'snap' decision one day that at this price I'd go for the 305.And I'm really glad that I did. It does everything I need and didn't cost the earth. The HRM signal reception is rock solid and the GPS acquires the signal pretty quickly when it has a decent view of the sky. I don't really need to swim in it or wear it as a day-to-day watch, so didn't need to pay the extra for the 310 or 405.Only minor negative is the maps in the Garmin Training centre software - it only show major roads. It would have been better to integrate it into something like Google Maps to get a better map view, but the export to Google Earth makes up for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch for a runner!!!","review":"My wife really likes this GPS watch!

The heart rate monitor works very well and the ability to look at all the stats after the run on the computer is very helpful in being able to see how one run compares to another. The computer readout shows heart rate, pace, distance, etc all along the path that you run. You can look at heart rate etc. every step along the run or look at averages across the full run.

This watch works well in forest or bold sunshine, records heart rate, altitude, direction, and more! Software is included for storing data and makes it easy to compare previous routes against one another. The only downfalls are the low battery life, not being able to have it double as a wrist watch, and the sheer size of the thing - as a small female it looks large enough to throw my gait off and caused an initial \\"bruising period\\" for a friend of mine.These things aside, this is an amazing tool that has done nothing but impress me.

Good investment for any runner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect entry level GPS with Heart Monitor","review":"Purchased this to wear as I trained in the NYC area for my first marathon. About a month in, I could not be more pleased. I like to vary my training routes for a little variety in my outdoor runs, and this little baby tracks pace, distance, elevation, time, and, with the included heart monitor, it tracks your heart rate as well. More importantly, when you plug it into the computer, it will map out your routes according to GPS tracker, so that you can create and upload running routes to review them and even set up courses for your speed or interval training.THE ONE DRAWBACK: Sometimes the device is sluggish finding satellites, which means that you need to stand in a spot with a clear shot of the sky for about a minute while it locates them.Otherwise, I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've owned them all...","review":"I've been running daily with this unit for over two months (25-30 Miles/wk.), and I just think this is a great product. Two points about me; I'm pretty tough on equipment, and I'm pretty anal about things working correctly. You know the type... Well with that said, my only wish-for would be better battery life. I get about a week to a week and a half between charges. For the outstanding quality and accuracy of this unit, the battery life is not an issue. You won't be unhappy with product, it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful product","review":"The price was right and the item was in perfect condition, just as it said. I had no problems whats so ever with the payment and mailing. Wonderful product. So easy to use. If you have used any of the earlier models it is exactly the same format. the 305 gives you more information and the program that goes along with it is outstanding. Even if you arn't an avid runner, the 305 can help you with other sports and walking. I'm telling you this is an awesome product. I stared with the 201 and I had that for 3 years, I thought I would never need or want anything else. But the difference between the two is huge. trust me on this one, spend the extra money and get the 305."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had two defective 305s and working on my third","review":"Garmin apparently has big problems with the Garmin 305.

The concept behind the 305 is great, but it just doesn't hold up in terms of quality. I had to send mine back because the altitude function didn't work. The elevation profiles for my workouts looked like I was jumping on a trampelline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forerunner 305 GPS/HRM","review":"This adds HRM function that my current Forerunner 205 lacks.

I can't believe I was ever able to properly train without it. I run a lot of trails and peaks and I've never been able to properly gauge mileage and speed. Now, not only do I know how far I'm going, but what kind of elevation gain and incline I'm working. On the road, I have now been able to start properly training for road races by doing real tempo and interval workouts, something I always had to guess at before. This watch has truly changed the way I run.The bulkiness is not even noticeable now and I have personalized my display settings in such a way that I get to see the exact information I want within the first two screens.I originally bought the watch for my wife and I to share. Is it bad that I don't want to share any more and just buy her another one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Forerunner 305","review":"I have been using my new 305 for a few weeks and love it. The watch and heart monitor strap are comfortable. Once the watch locates the satellites, the response time is very quick for pace, elevation, heart rate, etc. Good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigger than a watch but functional","review":"It is on the large size but not too big. Battery life seems to be excellent. It takes a minute to acquire the satellites but will acquire much quicker if you are not wearing it but rather leave it on a table or ground while it is trying to acquire the satellites.My chief complaint is I wish the heart rate readout on the device was larger. It is hard to read while running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look No Further, This is the One for You","review":"I love this watch. I've now had it for one month and have run over 50 miles with it. I've tracked all of my runs and enjoy the ease of use and built-in analytics using the software. If you want a watch that can easily help you train towards rate, time or distance then this is it. Kind of big, but not bothersome. I think it becomes easier to operate and view with the larger screen. I've even used the heart monitor band for most of the runs without any problems. The battery lasts forever.Amazon was also the right place to buy it. Everyone else wanted $30 - $50 more for the same thing.The only thing I would like to change is to have more flexibility in analysis via the software. I doubt most people would care about that though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool way better then my old one","review":"I had the 101 I think it was called and that worked but when I got the 305 and hooked everything up it was great! what a great tool and so indepth. more stuff then i need but it's nice to know if and when I need it, I have it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT BUY!!","review":"I'm completely satisfied. My runs have improved w/this watch. I totally recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I run 40-50 miles per week. Love being able to run free through my city, know how far I've gone, take it to the trails at times and continue to monitor distance and altitude. This watch is easy, simple, works perfectly, has all the features I need. I don't care for the HR chest strap, don't really use it. It is big, would be nice if it was a bit smaller. But I wouldn't trade for the 405 or 410. The 305 is simple and reliable. The big screen comes in handy as I can see time of day, time of my run, pace, and distance on one screen. I can set it to scroll to other screens to show my avg speed, altitude, calories (lets me put in my personal info), and lots more. Very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took my running to next level","review":"I was very satisfied with this device. I just started using it and it has really helped me train. I look forward to learning about it's additional capabilities!My only negative is that on cloudy days it takes a long time to locate the satellite. One time it actually took about 20 minutes. However, this is my first Garmin so they may all be like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Running Companion","review":"I am a triathlete and used the Garmin Forerunner 305 to train for and race my first marathon. Its heart rate and real time pace functions helped me stay on track during the marathon when my body was getting tired and my mind wanted to wander. It's like having a training buddy or personal pace-setter. Its GPS enabled functions also make ideal for cycling as there is no need for speed magnet sensors. The displays are easy to read and customizable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I recieved this watch for my birthday. I did alot of research before and was torn between the newest model and this one. I decided to go with th 395 because of the wealth of reviews and the negative reviews from the newer model. Definately the rigt choice. I have used in in downtown INDy as well as in wooded areas. I have never had difficult getting a signal. No problems and am happy I went with the 305. It is slightly bigger than a regular watch but I dont where it to make a fashion statement. Great workout partner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dang near perfect -- great for Mac users too","review":"This is a really well designed product AND website that works well for those on the Mac platform. In SoCal, the watch quickly finds a GPS signal, usually within a minute. Although it's a bit bigger than a standard sports watch, its very light and well designed -- you really don't notice the size. I find the pace info to be steady (depending on my run) and the watch to be pretty accurate and glitch free. The website now has an \\"altitude correction\\" tab you can tick to filter unneeded data.The features available from Garmin Connect are what really motivated me -- Google Map traces of your workout, graphs of pace, speed and heart rate, and the ability to track weight and other info. I was especially impressed to find that the watch, the Garmin desktop software and the watch's ANT Agent program work well under OS 10.5.8 and the data transfer from watch to the Garmin website is smooth and quick. Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice","review":"Heart rate monitor and GPS work very well. Workout programming is very useful. I guess the only drawback is that it can't really be used as a wristwatch - like some other models can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk of junk","review":"I have a cheap Casio watch that can tell me how much time I have run or walked. But I purchased this expensive product (the Forerunner) because, among other things, I wanted to know how far I was going for each unit of time. Although it worked well at first, after six months the distance has become increasingly more inaccurate. For instance, several times today, I walked two blocks, and the distance had increased by only .01 mile. I have even noticed the distance going backward (which it did three times today). As a result, the distances are completely unreliable. I would have thought that the device could at the very least keep time and distance accurately. And six months is much too short a period for the product to quit working properly. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding! Delivers on all promises","review":"Ok, my only regret with my purchase of the 305 is that I waited 2 months to purchase it because of the initial bad reviews. I had a 201 and loved it until I accidentally left it in my workout clothes and it got washed. It survived the washer but I think what did it in was banging around in the dryer. I trained/ran 2 marathons w/ the 201 and loved it. The 305 has been an awesome upgrade. I also bought the cadence for my bike and now I have all the info I could ever need. Having all this info has really re-energized my workouts and am now trying for my first Ironman. I have in two weeks put in 200 miles on the bike and 35 in running and have no complaints. It does acquire satellites faster, gets a stronger reception in tree cover, and connects with the computer far easier than the 201. My only issue is that I had to improvise my own bike mount but hope Garmin will be coming out with one soon. Also I wish it was waterproof enough to take swimming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted","review":"I have used my Garmin Forerunner 305 for about a year and a half. It was always well taken care of. It was never dropped or submerged in water. I have used the Forerunner 305 to help train for several races including half-marathons, military physical training tests, dualathons... The Garmin was a great tool to help gauge my exertion level and speed. I really enjoyed being able to just hit the pavement and run without really planning out a distance route ahead of time. After running I could download my training session to the pc and track my progress.Then about a week ago during a race my watch just stopped. I can reboot it and it stays on as long as I don't put any pressure on the back of the watch. There seems to be a short somewhere under the back plate of the watch. Of course the warranty has now expired...which leaves me wondering what to buy now. I don't want to drop another $200 bucks on the same model and only have it last another year or so..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock","review":"What an absolute crock of shit!

It has some photographs (which have inspired me to get out to Cape May and other cool birding havens) but most of the pictures are black & white drawings. The detail I think is actually pretty good. The drawings do not give specific detail of color shading etc but instead provide the broader strokes of major markings or wing shape or how the bird might look looking down at you. There are head-on profiles (in different modes of flight), some top down drawings, but mostly looking up and side. The raptors are segmented into the different groups of Buteos, Accipters Falcons, Kites, Northern Harrier, Eagles & Vultures, and Osprey. Within each section each bird has a few pages with pictures and really neat info about their migration patterns as well as tips for id.I'm still not very good at id of these birds but I love watching them and trying to id them.

I enjoyed the format which does not provide only pictures for the process of identification. The book makes an effort to educate the reader by understanding the probability of the bird type based on dates, recognizing flight patterns in addition to bird shape to improve identification. I am amazed at the distances I can identify a raptor when you use the knowledge gained by this resource.

Lead rarely breaks, holds its sharpness well; well-balanced and solid, quality wood construction.... everything you expect in a pencil and more.

The pencil is smooth to the touch due to the matte finish and the graphite in this pencils is very impressive.

The only saving grace was the bonus feature: Remembering Shemp, but even that got tedious with repeated footage continually going on throughout the feature. How many times do you have to see Shemp waving a hanky around? 6 or seven times? The quality of all the shorts are terrible, the worst being the Camel Comedy Caravan with what looks like a cat's coughed-up furball on the upper left-hand corner of the screen during the whole show.

They have been released and much better quality. To add insult to injury this company thought it would be cute to add a horrible brownish tint to give the shows an ancient look. All it does it make it even harder to watch. Come on....colorized movies are bad or good depending on the individual. But no need to give it a phony brownish look to make it look like an old tin type photo.

Granted, the first two selections on disc 1 are rare, Radio Pictures shorts, and they're choppy and not restored. That I could forgive due the rarity of their availability, but the rest of the material was given no attention at all to clarity of picture- it was as bad in quality as they come.

Even seeing some of the familiar Shemp/Stooges shorts once again becomes a slightly different experience after you listen to his family's stories, anecdotes, perceptions, and remembrances. He really does sound like he was a great guy - in addition to a natural comic. I can't imagine a Stooges fan skipping this, if only for the rare, first-person insight into this unjustly overlooked member of the troupe. Oh - and the glimpses of home movies with Shemp, Moe, and Shemp's legendary wife Babe and only child Mort are fascinating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Time Ripoff","review":"I am a huge Stooge fan and really got ripped off on this DVD ...

Houston is a an established Dr. and Josie is his resident. He wants her but thinks he shouldn't because she is his resident and Josie wants him but feels very self conscience about her weight. All of us girls have had our self doubts about our body at times, so I felt a connection with the character. Finally one day he goes for it and she accepts an invitation which lead to some good ol hot steamy sex.Then they have to face a tradegy together and learn to lean on each other which is very hard for him, but they finally learn how to trust and love each other.

Sure he could ignore the view but Houston is not a stupid man.Josie Adkins has always wanted to be a surgeon, just like her late father. She keeps telling herself she needs to keep her thoughts on medicine and not the hottie Houston Hayes.Houston proposed that he has the ideal solution to their mutual attraction. One night of sensual pleasure and they both will be cured. Josie thinks this is her opportunity to showHouston that one night is never going to be enough.Houston, We Have A Problem is one more outstanding book from Erin McCarthy.

My main complaint is that the lead seems to break every stroke the pencil takes. I find myself repeatedly pushing out more lead. Soon after, the lead pushes out all at once because it can't secure an inch of lead. The inch of remaining lead, instead, slides out of the pencil and is wasted.

When you try to manipulate it back into the pencil, you only wind up frustrated because it doesn't \\"lock\\" properly. It ends up sliding too far back into the barrel.

The vertical orientation is good, because all of the other sharpeners will slide as you feed the poencil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pencil sharpener","review":"Worth every penny. Very glad we bought the upright model, allows one handed use and uses less desk space. No problem with shavings drawer size, plenty big for home use, would work for the office too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrapens cockeyed","review":"I am very disappointed in this pencil sharpener. It is the worst I have ever triedfor sharpening crooked, i.e., there is an excess of exposed lead on one side andwood all the way down to the point on the other side. Even the cheapest hand crankedsharpeners are no worse about this. Trying to guess which way to tilt the pencil toget it straight is the only way to get workable results at all, but is very difficultto pull off and takes many tries. I will not buy a pencil sharpener again withouttrying it out.Aside from that, I do like the vertical design, and the shavings box is bigger thanthe last electric I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharpener doesn't work.","review":"I ordered this sharpener as a Christmas gift based on the good reviews.

Fortunately Amazon makes returns easy, but there is still inconvenience involved, and we still don't have a pencil sharpener."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome little machine","review":"I've owned this pencil sharpener for almost three weeks now and I love it!!! It is heavy duty and sharpens pencils to a very nice point. I also like the way that it stands up high and has a vertical feature, entering the pencil from the top rather than the front. It doesn't slip when you sharpen the pencils either. I would suggest this model for moderate to heavy use of sharpening pencils. The kids use it for their pencils, as well as me for my teaching, in which I sharpen approx 20 extra pencils a week for my class. What an awesome little machine!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this sharpener.","review":"I had the same experience as Patricia D. Brown had: After having worked wonderfully, the sharpener produced dull and extremely fragile tips. Instead of producing a conical tip, the sharpener produces a cylindrical one, where the point is blunt and too much of the graphite is exposed.My sharpener became poor after three months, instead of Brown's nine months, probably because it was used for four hours twice a week.I really wanted to like this sharpener, despite its noise and its tiny pencil shavings holder. The vertical entry, sleek appearance, and Panasonic brand were enough for me to convince myself to spend over $100 for a sharpener. But it's junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked at price change!!","review":"While I would give this a 5 star for overall product quality, I am shocked at the price hike!!

I have NO idea how they justify this being worth $140?!? It would have to be able to the job entirely by itself for that price. ;) I guess I will be looking for a different sharpener for now... Too bad~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Out of all the pencil sharpeners that I've purchased, this has been the best. When I first started my new job they had a pencil sharpener that EVERYONE complained about, however, when I replaced our last sharpener with the Panasonic, I haven't heard a peep. I think that everyone is more than happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids","review":"This sharpener is perfect for my 4, 6, and 8 year-olds because you put the pencil into the top instead of the front. That means they can do it with one hand. If the opening is in the front, you have to hold the sharpener with one hand (to keep it from sliding across the table) while you push the pencil in with the other. That might seem like a minor thing, but it's much easier for a small child to reach up to the sharpener on the kitchen counter with one hand then to get both hands up there. It's actually easier for everyone to use.The auto-off function is great. It doesn't break the lead like the past 5 sharpeners I've had (if you find that your pencil lead breaks or the tip falls out 5 minutes after you sharpened it, it's not the pencil's fault...it's the sharpener that's breaking it). And there really is plenty of room for shavings. It might seem like a lot of money for a pencil sharpener, but it's great to get one that really works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"I am a calligrapher who likes and needs a sharp point on pencials. No sooner is the pencil in the sharpener than the red light goes on. You wonder how it could be so fast. Result: a VERY sharp point. I also appreciate being able to use the sharpener with just one hand. The sharpener remains stationary in use as the pencil enters from the top, not sliding across the work surface - as with other models where the pencil enters from the side.Expensive, but well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Can Do Better","review":"This song is booorrring.

BUY IT !"},{"rating":"2","title":"super-intense and challenging.","review":"This is an extremely complex album, probably the most musically demanding progressive/prog metal album aside from Garden Wall's _Forget the Colours_. Spiral Architect's profound technical excursions are voxtex-generating maelstroms of staggered, sycnopated razors rhythms interacting in an abstruse, hyper-complex manner both intensely Dionysian and Apollonian. Polymeter and displacement, odd articulation, and very unusual structures (much more challenging to play than to hear) are the tip of the iceberg for this band's unbelievably insane music. The vocals are high-pitched prog metal style vocals which sound a little off at times, but the way he sings really fits so it's all good. Check it out or shame on you. And hey, anything where Sean Malone contributes is automatically amazing (even if it's only on a brief instrumental interlude). _A Sceptic's Universe_ [sic] is essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's lots, and I mean lots, to listen to here.","review":"As several other reviewers have mentioned, there is a lot going on here, sometimes to the point of being excessive. I enjoy the disc but do feel that it may have been better as an instrumental effort. The bass playing is extraordinary but is too high in the mix, sometimes burying the guitar. Don't get me wrong...I like the album and would recommend it. Just make sure to wait 30 minutes after eating to listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a mess","review":"As a big fan of progressive rock and metal, I was highly disappointed with this cd. It seems like this band try way too hard to be way over the top with songs going a million directions at once. After listening to the cd many times, there's still not a single song that I can remember. I can never go back and hum a chorus or vocal melody. This almost sounds like a bad jazz band on angel dust. If this bad toned it down a little for their next cd, I feel they will be potential of making a decent cd. The singer has a decent voice, he just needs to learn how to use it.There's nothing memorable about this cd no matter how many times you listen to it. Try Dream Theater or Spock's Beard or Shadow Gallery instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little over-done","review":"I am a huge fan of progressive rock and progressive metal, but I think they went a little overboard with this cd. I admit it probably takes tons of practice for these guys to do what they're doing here and to get everything just perfect, but most of the time it doesn't really sound like they're playing anything in particular. The singer is great, but he'd be better off in another band. I don't know, it just sounds like a big mess to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what's wrong with prog-Metal...","review":"Spiral Architect, is yet another band who opt to exhibit their virtuosity, instead of writing good songs. Are they impressive? Yes. Is Nordberg a bass God? Sure. Is there anything on this CD that is worth hearing a second time? Probably not.I'd be interested to hear what these guys are up to in a couple of years.

This amazing album grows on you. It still sounds fresh after many listens. This is what a metal record should be like. The musicians are really skilled, the vocalist really sings; something you don't see often in today's music and manufactured stars. The blending of melody and complexity of the music is somewhere on the lines of Death, Control Denied, Watchtower, Mozart, and Beethoven. Added to this is intelligent lyrics. Those who complain that the music is too technical don't have a long enough attention span and should stick with their korns and limp biscuits.

The plot is cliched, as are the characters. There are a few genuinely interesting ideas here, but they're lost in the utter banality of the rest of the story and the terrible writing.I abandoned this book about halfway through because I just couldn't take it any more. There was no nuance, no depth and the characters, and I mean ALL the characters, are like the cast of a cheap, badly-written sitcom. It's like a constant string of dad jokes, wisecracks and cheap gags that simply are not funny.

Peter Watts' Blindsight was #4. Blindsight is by (very, very) far the better book (2 & 3 were fantasy). This tale is a decent yarn, but it's ideas are mostly rehashed and so thinly explained that many of its arguments about how we'll interact (hint: very violently and genocidally, though all narrated with a human-touch) with alien civilizations, much less the aliens themselves, are only plausible if you're looking to have your biases confirmed.If you want bleak-but-scientifically-and-plausibly-defended, go read Watts (you can even get his whole Rifters trilogy free). Or, if you're looking for a poignant tale of aging and war, go read Iain M. Banks' Look to Windward (which is also an excellent book). And, if you want great recent space opera, go grab John Charles Wright's Golden Age trilogy. If you want some confirmation bias, I suppose that this'll do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Heinlein - better!","review":"While the steady stream of interesting and entertaining ideas in this book is reminiscent of Heinlein, the quality of the writing surpasses all but the very best of Heinlein's novels. On the strength of this book alone, I'm adding Scalzi to my list of must-buy authors. The setting, the plot and the character development are all first-class. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Somewhat enjoyable, very lightweight read. One of Scalzi's first novels, and it shows. Amateurish, poor dialog, and unfunny. I recommend you read The Forever War and Starship Troopers and then there is no need to read this. Maybe he improves in his later novels but I won't bother to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"No conflict whatever","review":"Okay, why do so many like this book? In the first half there is zero conflict. Zero. Finally, after all the false conflict of basic training and pages of sassy, \\"funny\\" and glib dialog about meals, having sex (imagine that!) and did I mention having sex? And while we're on the subject of sex, it's sex without meaning, sex without eroticism, sex that's just going through the motions (like the rest of the book) then we finally get to the first big battle scene and... and... Pffffffffffft goes the air out of the balloon. No one is in any real danger. It's a turkey shoot. That's where I gave up. When you can read half a book and not care if the main character lives or dies, then it's time to, as Dorothy Parker suggests, hurl the book with great force. If you want an involving SF story, CONFLICT and maybe even a character you will care about, try any earlier Jack Vance orSisters of Glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"I read Forever War and was aching for more of the same. This is badly written garbage, that could be included in the ranks of Pulp Sci-Fi, but bad pulp. I don't understand the glowing reviews unless the author has a lot of friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad science, shallow writing","review":"\\"Old Man's War\\" is a trite, weakly written novel that barely qualifies as science fiction. The characters are aging people from earth who are transformed into hyper-soldiers to fight aliens. The science (I'm a hard core devote) is absent or implausible, and the action is a series of chiches. For example, at boot camp the sargent delivers a brutal speech about the horrors of war, ho-hum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Cursing","review":"There are good Science Fiction writers out there that don't curse Jesus name in vain through their Characters over and over again. I'm a couple hours into the audio book and they rip it pretty good in this book, I'll not buy Scalzi again.Just letting any who care about this know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously overrated","review":"Since most people just want to have quick idea about what they should expect from the product I'll keep this very short and to the point.If what you are looking for is just another action packed book which lacks both imagination and intelligence this one may serve you well.On the other hand if you are looking for a real sci-fi book I highly recommend you to stay away from Old Man's War as well as any other book written by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"old man's war","review":"this book has gotten teriffic reviews, and the reason for this escapes me.

I bought this book based on all the rave reviews I read here and I felt like a sucker. I could not finish reading this book because it bored me to tears. There are dialogs after dialogs, but no action. If this is a movie, there will be only one scene in the whole movie, of people talking to each others.So be warned!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I was getting a Sci-Fi book!","review":"Actually, the first chapter had a rather novel premise. A couple pages into the second chapter I threw the book into the trash. I will not stand for subliminally being preached to. Far, far too many references to religion and god. I wanted Sci-Fi not mythical fantasy. Caveat emptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, quick read.","review":"It took me less than 24 hours to plow through this book (on my new Kindle!). The only reason it took me that long was because I have to sleep sometime. It reminds me a lot of a childhood favorite, The Stainless Steel Rat series by Harry Harrison. For whatever reason, I really prefer 1st person writing. A fine mix of humor, thoughtful science-fiction and action make this book worthy of a download and a read. And now I move onto the next book in the series.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Farts in Space!","review":"I loved this book! I found the idea of only being able to join the army when you turn 75 interesting and the alien/human encounters entertaining. I enjoyed the sarcastic tone that's in much of the dialogue and the military battles were exciting. While there are serious moments, there weren't enough to leave me feeling down after finishing the book. I often recommend this at work - especially for people who want to start reading sci-fi. It's not too technical, it's exciting, and it's fun.This is the first in the Old Man's War series. It's followed by The Ghost Brigades, The Last Colony, and Zoe's Tale.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid entertaining innovative science fiction action adventure","review":"John Scalzi's Old Man's War series carries on the tradition of military science fiction in the tradition of Haldeman's Forever War and Heinlein's Starship Troopers, although with some original twists (which I won't divulge). Old Man's War sets the stage, The Ghost Brigades fleshes out the technology and humanity of, well, the Ghost Brigades, and The Last Colony puts it all together adding company politics and intrigue. All three are fast-paced and Scalzi's style is smooth fun to read. The only quibble I have is I wish he would have added more descriptive narrative to his places, peoples, and tech. But the storylines and humor will definitely satisfy someone in the mood for some sci-fi adventure fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic book!","review":"I loved this book. The book was engaging from the first page right through the last. I really enjoyed the way that John integrated humor throughout the book, especially at very unexpected moments in the story. I actually found myself laughing out loud a couple of times. He created some very good characters and a story that was always interesting and exciting. I found that I had a really hard time putting the book down and was disappointed when I was finished with it. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leans towards star wars","review":"Old Man's War leans dangerously close to Star Wars, in my opinion. Like Heinlein in Star Ship Troopers, Scalzi inexplicably feels the need to have humans fighting face to face with aliens. THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENCE. For example, why not use drones? Why not use NUCLEAR WEAPONS? Are they really afraid of radiation - they can't deal with cancer? Blach! The idea that humans would go land on a planet with rifles, line up, and shoot at the aliens like the soldiers in Napoleon's arms is weapon grade balonium. The attempt to add hand to hand combat + sci fi is too contrived. 4/5 for a fantasy novel, but 2/5 for science fiction.If you want good sci fi, read books descended from Asimov, not Heinlein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Going for book two immediately following this post. This is a story that demands the big screen but could never be done justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, Great Characters","review":"I picked up this book after seeing it recommended based on my read of Halderman's Forever War. I wanted a new space battle science fiction book in similar vein, and I was not disappointed. The story of John Perry works on several levels, from a fun, if somewhat campy science fiction war action tale to an introspective view into what it means to be human, to cope with aging and to deal with life. Overall a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"One of the best sci-fi books I've read. Everything is, in a very satisfying way, written so that it makes sense and seems logical (according to the universe created by Scalzi). The book is funny too, but not in a way that takes away from the seriousness of the plot.If you like space opera, aliens, war, and such, you'll love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not The Forever War, but what is?","review":"If you're craving a balanced diet of space opera, military sci-fi and alien romance, this is for you. It isn't The Forever War, or The Vor Game or Avatar but has enough of each flavor to make for an enjoyable read. Nothing really jumped out at me (except, perhaps his odd relationship with \\"Jane\\") but each page had me flipping expectantly to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great military sci-fi inspired by Heinlein's Starship Troopers","review":"A Military Sci-Fi novel that draws on Heinlein's Starship troopers. In fact it draws inspiration from several other novels by several authors which Scalzi is very clear about.For me the novel, and in fact the same was true for the second novel and as it seems the third one as well, was about new situations. Sure it's about war, but it's seen through the eyes if a man from a world in much the same level of advancement as ours and when he leaves it's spaceships, star travel and shooting aliens in the face.That said the novel isn't entirely about war and spaceships. It's also about humanity's place in the universe and how this is seen through the eyes of the soldiers. It's also alot about the main characters own situation when faced with this more or less new reality, which I can't really go into without spoilers.All in all, it might not be perfect, but it's close enough to warrant a rank of more than four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sci-Fi novel I've read in awhile","review":"This is a wonderful book. Both the prose and characterizations are far above what you can normally expect from science fiction these days. Scalzi has imagined an interesting universe and there are a lot of intense action sequences balanced by thoughful, nuanced passages. The book also has a lot of clever, salty dialogue between the soldiers that is often quite funny.This is the best science fiction book to come out since The Risen Empire/Killing of Worlds by Scott Westerfeld, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Scalzi, May We Have Another","review":"I've been very picky about what books to pick up recently, given my lack of free reading time. We've all read books that make us wonder what we were thinking at the time of purchase, or why someone could possibly have recommended this book to us....Scalzi did a wonderful job of setting up a believable world, with interesting characters... it reminds me in many ways of 'Forever War' by Haldeman, or early Heinlein.Sure, there are some parts of the book that felt like they dragged-- but for pete's sake, considering this is his first science fiction novel in print, I'm looking forward to the planned sequel. ( And since I know he reads the reviews: GET BACK TO WORK. We want, nay, we *REQUIRE* the sequel. )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"A well written novel and a great commentary on the human condition. Hard to put this one down. Going to get the next and see if it's as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts strong, but disappoints soon after ...","review":"Bought the book based on the excellent reviews. Book starts really well - entertaining, sometimes funny and interesting, new idea (seniors enlisting to army). But excitement soon disappeared - book soon turns into boring \\"starship troopers\\" killing all kinds of \\"evil, nasty\\" aliens and plot just gets week ... towards the end I felt like the whole book should have condensed to 30-40 pages and let's go ... what's next? Well, that is maybe answered in other Scalzi's books, but I won't know ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent light sci-fi","review":"\\"Old Man's War\\" is a bit on the lighter side, but as a military science-fiction novel it's very enjoyable. There's plenty of action, humor, and even a few genuinely touching moments. It's not deep literature, and it probably won't become a classic; but what it does, it does well. I was surprised to learn that this was Scalzi's first novel; his conversational descriptors get a little repetitive at times (for example: \\"he said\\", \\"she said\\" being used far too often to wrap up lines of dialogue), but overall this is pretty good stuff. Definitely worth a read if you are a fan of the genre. It's just a shame that the sequels were not up to par."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fun book","review":"This book was very fun to read. It has been a while since I read a book that made me care about the characters as mush as this book did.The book is basically a fun retelling of Heinlein's Starship Troopers. As much as that last line sounds like an accusation of plagiarism, let me assure you that is not my intent. Where Heinlein's story was a vehicle for lectures on society, this one is a story about the characters. The book goes in a totally different direction and accomplishes its goal quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea, Great Execution. Very Entertaining","review":"***Spoiler free Review***Scalzi writes like the masters of old, but he also incorporates his own style... The result is a modern masterpiece that has a great 'old time' feel and is a great homage to the great works before it.The writing comes across as real and not 'pretend'. The characters are so well done, the worldbuilding is superb, the dialogue is AMAZING, this book just basically does everything right.But more importantly, he gives you a phenonmenal story. I don't know how I've gone this long without ever having read Scalzi, but i'm glad i've corrected that problem. He is now in my top ten of best Sci-Fi writers ever and FWIW, i've been reading a book a week for over 20 years.anyways, this book is a must read, read it cover to cover in two days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where do I enlist.","review":"It was funny, serious, and adventurous. I enjoyed it immensely. I'm no warmonger but the opportunity to recapture youth certainly is inviting. It was very surprising that John Scalzi and Alister Reynolds both defined space travel as an elevator like device. I also found the concept of jumping from universe to universe reminiscent of Jodie Foster's sci fi movie about space travel and the TV show \\"Fringe\\". It was a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I read lots of military Sci Fi, going all the way back to Starship Troopers and Hammer's Slammers. This work was a breath of fresh air. The plot was well executed, and the story was a blast. I was sorry to see it end. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read","review":"Scalzi is a wonderful writer, the book is very engaging.

I so hope they make a movie out of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but. . . .","review":"A fun read, but I liked Jack Campbell's Dauntless series quite a bit more. I disagree, in particular, with the lead review that praises the tone of the book. I found the tone uneven and often discordant. I also found the premise unpersuasive -- that a technologically advanced space army needs the \\"consciousness\\" of elderly people to fill out its ranks. But the book was worth it, if only for an excellent joke about the Chicago Cubs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic SF","review":"If you are a fan of the pulp serials of the 50's and 60's this is a story for you. Great escape in the \\"\\"young readers\\" tradition of \\"Glory Road\\" and \\"Starship Troopers\\". Just the escape for those of us who were \\"young readers\\" back in the day and want to be so again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work, well written, compelling characters","review":"The Heinlein comparisons are apt, and complimentary. This has obvious elements of Space Cadet and Starship Troopers, but it's not in any way derivative.In some ways, the story ends a bit too abruptly...really feels like the first portion of a larger story, and the sequel is already on the way. But, no story elements are left unfinished, it's just clear this is a broader story line. That's good and bad, as you definitely want more from this author, but I like a more closed feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rejuvination - at a cost","review":"A unique take on the immortality-through-cloning plot - to get your 'rebirth' you have to sign up for the intergalactic armed forces. Though the story took a while to get going, seemingly because the author took too much time (or pleasure) in explaining how the immortality was going to work in his universe, once you get past the army cliches, the story becomes quite fun. I like the alien races he created, and how he imagined our interactions with them to be. The story really got GOOD in the last third of the book, so I expect the follow-on books to be just as good now that the universe is already explained."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"A lot better than many movies put together. A fine blend of fresh thinking, fast action and interesting humor. Very enjoyable to the last page. Can't wait for more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Discerning Readers","review":"Judging from the cumulative score, a lot of people like this book. Good for them. But it has some of the worst dialog I have ever encountered. A typical example:\\"Sorry about that,\\" Thomas said. \\"I didn't mean to hold everyone up. The fettuccine was excellent, but my lower intestine would apparently beg to differ.\\"\\"Please feel free not to share such information in the future, Thomas,\\" Susan said. \\"We don't know you that well yet.\\"\\"Well how else will you /get/ to know me that well?\\" Thomas said.Endless pages of this stuff. If it sounds funny to you, buy the book. Otherwise, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, but way too much vulgar language for me.","review":"While I enjoyed the premise and execution of the book, the level of vulgar language was way too high for my personal tolerances. Your mileage may vary, but if four-letter words aren't your thing, I'd recommend staying away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic","review":"The book starts out well, lots of wit in the first dozen pages. But the dialog becomes lame, pointless and obvious. If you've read Asimov, Heinlein and Vinge then the science will seem simplistic and tenuous. If you've read Orson Scott Card then you will find the moral lessons simplistic.I had to skim the final 100 pages. I'm surprised this is so highly rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty Sci-fi Miliporn","review":"That's it. It's miliporn. The concept was great, but in the end the author was not up to developing it. Actually its low grade miliporn because it's pretty obvious this guy is a Deitz-wannabe but hasn't the chops to pull it off. The Deitz cyborg legion covers the same issues from the same empty right wing positon but does a much better job. Or read, Their Master's War; The enternity Brigade; The Forever War; Bill, The Galactic Hero, I could go on but why point out so many books that do a better job on the theme?The real tragedy, of course is that the author has a great idea. If I was an editor and been given a choice sight unseen between this work and the Clone Republic I would pick this book immediately. The problem is that the clone Republic is a higher grade of miliporn than this piece. That's too bad because if he could open up his view and write for the sake of his work and not a check, this author could be a fantastic writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars on the Amazon scale...","review":"...I've seen it written in a few places that Scalzi follows in the Heinlein tradition of scifi. The Heinlein that gave us Stranger in a Strange Land. The Heinlein that gave us The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. And the Heinlein that gave us Starship Troopers. In full disclosure mode, I admit that I'm not terribly familiar with Heinlein's work. I read a novel or two of his in high school before largely moving on to Gibson, Vonnegut, and other novelists that better resonated with me. A lesson there? Perhaps not...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"I bought this book with the expectation of something new in the way of military science fiction. Ultimately the book proved to lack much in the way of character development and originality. The main character easily jumps past moral quandaries with a pause and a sigh. Perhaps it is an unfair comparison, but the Forever War deals with alienation in a much more effective way.Ultimately, it reads like John Wayne of the future with the main character saving the day in multiple, and very tired ways. All of the \\"surprises\\" were predictable and uninspiring and the hints of self-doubt are pushed aside like so many alien carcasses.I highly recommend avoiding this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Trilogy","review":"I picked up Old Man's War because of the title and the great reviews on Amazon. I picked up the 2 remaining novels in the trilogy because the first book is solid science fiction. It was highly readable, the characters had depth and the alternate reality so important to sci-fi was consistent and believable. It was an enjoyable read.I think the price is too high. Yah, yah, I know all about Amazon pricing policies and publishers. $24 bucks for the trilogy is too expensive for a data stream. I read a lot and this will push me back to the local library. I'm on a fixed income and I can't afford $100 a month for 12 novels.Other than pricing, I'd buy more of what John has written. As it stands, I'm going to be walking to the library tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Paced Sci-Fi Reading","review":"Enjoyed reading the first book of the \\"Old Man' s War\\" series. The book was well paced and quick read. John Scalzi's story about how future space wars could be fought and the technology used was engaging. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"If you have any interest in Science Fiction you owe it to yourself to read this book. A likable protagonist and a great premise. The first in a series of books that are wildly entertaining. They do not all have the same main character and some are not even in all the books, but they tend to recur and recombine in interesting ways. It opens with a retired American man of 75 about to commit himself to serving in the military for the mysterious government of humanity's space colonies. In exchange he expects to receive unspecified medical treatments to prolong his life and restore some measure of strength and vitality. He also gets to learn something about the colonies and the universe, knowledge that the colonial government has carefully kept hidden from the inhabitant on Earth. After his service he gains the right to become a colonist, a path otherwise reserved for the citizens of less affluent and more overpopulated countries.

One reviewer mentioned some aspects of the story were over the top--dude, it's a satire.As far as the dialogue goes, think \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" meets \\"Starship Troopers\\". I read this book after reading \\"Perdido Street Station\\" and \\"Spin\\", so it was a nice change of pace. The writing, pace and plotting makes it an easy read; it's perfect if you are traveling or sitting on a beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transhumanism and action with an interesting plot","review":"I'm fascinated by tales of transhumanism. Old Man's War is a novel concept that takes us to places we might find if we develop the technology to move the contents of a human mind around into various bodies. It's also much, much more.Scalzi's writing style is palatable. His plot devices worked for me. I found his characters interesting. It's a big universe out there, and Scalzi shows us what he imagines it might be like for humanity if we can ever move off our home planet.Military elements in Old Man's War are well crafted and plausible. I found the book to be hard to put down, which becomes rarer and rarer as I age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I took this book on vacation with me and all I wanted to do was find out what happened next.

Great story, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid 'war story' type of story.","review":"This book does not require any advanced education in physics, as some Sci-Fi does. It does not require you to learn a whole new universe with new languages and odd cultures. In fact the only effort that this book requires of the reader is the hard work of sitting and enjoying a truly excellent story.This book does not resort to any fancy literary devices or try to be cute and clever - it is simply really good writing that tells a really good story. Straight, simple, good.One warning - don't read this book within a year or two of reading 'Starship Trooper' - both excellent books, so enjoy them separately with a little time in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"This generation's Heinlein?","review":"Looking forward to reading more of his writings.

Opening the book, I met a central character whose lame attempts at humor are acclaimed as hilarious. Gradually we find our man is gifted at everything but amazingly modest. This endears him to his fictional friends who are numerous and described in tedious detail. The tiny amount of SF is antiquated -- the \\"elevator to orbit\\" has been with us many years if not decades. Even so, we are supposed to marvel at this and the few other dusty \\"marvels\\" introduced. A physicist character in inserted to relieve the author from any explanation by insisting that our math is inadequate. Aliens are thrown at us in pathetic haste, as mere cartoon monsters. I wonder this book can be classed as SF. Yet so many other readers have written glowing reviews that the book must have some special merit I fail to grasp. I can only warn those fond of real SF to be wary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ol' Sci/Fi","review":"This is just an all around good sci/fi book. Action, aliens, humor, and drama.

But I saw that 2 eminent professors, whom I read several times a week--Glenn Reynolds (Tenn) and Steven Bainbridge (UCLA)--both loved this book.It was great. I started reading on my morning and evening commutes, and had to finish it before falling asleep that same day. A great mix of a survival tale, with epic plot tension, intriguing physics extrapolation, emotional realism, witty dialogue, and humor. There was a bit of a contrivance in the last third of the story, but I don't want to lob up a spoiler.I heard a sequel is in the works, and I'm really looking forward to what happens next to John Perry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it or leave it.","review":"I've read worse SF books than this, but many that were much, much better. If you're looking for something light but more engaging than a magazine, this might be good. It certainly doesn't warrant a five-star rating or words such as \\"superb.\\" Yech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best SF I've read in quite a while","review":"Really wonderful book. Scalzi manages to introduce you to his universe, alien races, and lots of super-cool technology while still writing a story that is driven by *characters*.If you're really not a fan of the military, you may not like this book as the vast majority of it takes place while the characters are in the armed forces. However you don't need to be a vet or even an admirer of the military to like this story about second chances, and learning how to stay true to yourself even though your entire world changes.Edit 10/20/2011:I'm now in the middle of my 2nd reading of Old Man's War and have just realized that it really is only *nominally* a sci-fi/adventure story. I don't want to give anything away to anyone who hasn't read the book yet, but the setting of humanity fighting an inter-stellar war against alien species really is truly background."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"Fast-paced, entertaining, and thought-provoking. It manages to be traditional military science fiction, but with some serious thoughts about aging and politics. My only complaint was that it was a little too much like Robert Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers.\\" I understand it is supposed to be an homage to that novel, but the story arc was a little too close in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hard Core SiFi I have read in Years","review":"Wonderful book for semi-hard core SiFi fans. I know enough physics and can \\"do the math\\" enough to get into the theoretical stuff. I really enjoyed that the hard science is mixed with soft concerning aging and synthetic people. I bought the sequel and enjoyed it as well. For a page turner that makes you think just a little, this is great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I'm not a huge war-sci fi fan, but I really enjoyed this book. I liked the characters, I liked the story and plot, and I liked the action. I wouldn't call it hard sci-fi, but there is good science and it is presented as feasible and plausible.If you've read any Verner Vinge's \\"Zones of Thought\\" books, I think you'll like this book. At least it's much much shorter :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Man's War","review":"I had forgotten just how much fun science fiction could be, especially in the hands of a very entertaining,humorous and imaginative writer such as Mr. Scalzi. It is my intention to readeverything he has written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit by Scalzi","review":"After reading Old Mans war, i was highly anticipating this. However I waited a while before reading this because personally I like to take a break between reading multiple novels in a series, lets me feel refreshed towards reading it. Anyway, this book again exceeded my expectations, as I generally don't read much science fiction. Yes, I would agree with most that it doesnt reach the same heights as old mans war, but thats OK, because that book was amazing. This book is as well, It just isn't AS good as old mans war. Once again, Scalzi writes this book at a quick pace which makes it highly entertaining and fits well with the subject matter. A big thing I like about reading Scalzi novels is the humor. Every time i read a scalzi book i know there are going to be some laugh out loud moments, and this is no different. The action is great, the comedy is there and the plot is fun. Pick this up, and don't compare it to old mans war. Just enjoy this book for the fun that it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"This is a beautiful combination of life with certain death or a second chance at a New life that is out of this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great space drama","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, it was fast paced and exciting.

For hard core military sci-fi fans, this is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Entertaining book, I picked this up from a recommendation on Amazon and enjoyed it. You can definitely see the paralells to Haldeman and Heinlein, but this book stand on it's own and doesn't feel forced. I'm anxiously awaiting the next book which is being released in a few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic sf echoing forever war and starship troopers","review":"Others have covered this book well, I will just add my endorsement as a reader of classic SF. This novel reads like one from the golden age of sf, it flows well and has original ideas in a familiar style which is much too rare these days. Try it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, engaging read and a nostalgia trip","review":"This was a good read- definitely worth buying if you're an old Heinlein fan. As other reviewers have no doubt mentioned, this book is very much a modern version of Starship Troopers. Lots of fancy, interesting tech and some interesting futuristic infantry/military stuff.It does have some shortcomings. The hero seems even more wide-eyed and innocent Jonny from the original book (mainly as he's supposedly 75 years old but really doesn't act it). Space warfare is very primitive (low-speed kinetic weapons seem to be cutting edge) and the society painted is a bit two-dimensional. But if you're looking for an easy, engaging read rather than cerebral social or sci-fi exploration (that'd be Banks and Reynolds), this is a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not heavyweight, but pleasant","review":"Scalzi writes with a clear and lucid style reminiscent of Mike Resnick, or Nevil Shute, more than Heinlein. I finished the book in a day and I liked it well enough that I will buy something else he wrote. Hopefully, he will outgrow story elements such as the bipedal, mammalian humanoids one inch tall, and the idea that the universe is overrun with aliens that all think humans are tasty snacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heinlein is back","review":"I really enjoyed this novel. It was a really nice love story. Now all of you are saying \\"love story?\\" Well, yes, a love story between the protagonist and his wife of many many years. It is also excellent military science fiction. The battles are well written and you get to know the soldiers and the other characters. There is not much non-violent alien to human interaction but this is not the point of the story.The point is human relations, the friendship and comaradery of the soldiers, the love between a man and his wife.The technology depicted is interesting and reasonable. There is not too much \\"magic\\" to just push along the plot. All of it is plausible. I thought the neatest thing was the \\"brainpal\\" that each soldier had. This was essentially a WiFi network in your head with instant messaging.I found this a fast and fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good hard science fiction","review":"What a marvelous, actually old fashioned, hard scifi story! When I read the blurb that compared the author to Heinlein, I thought \\"sure..... impossible!\\" But I really did feel like I was reading some of Mr. Heinlein's books! And I mean that as the highest possible compliment! This was pure adventure -- no complicated social issues, but I can see how, in a series, such might arise! Imagine a universe where 75-year-olds sign up for a kind of galactic army, fighting aliens that threaten earth colonists. Imagine having youth again, but this time \\"augmented,\\" so to speak. I enjoyed this book a lot and recommend it to readers who enjoy the genre!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pale shadow of 'The Forever War'...","review":"I'm glad I got this book from the library instead of buying it based on all the rave reviews here. This is so clearly a retread of \\"The Forever War,\\" by Joe Haldeman, that it was a chore to read. Yes, Scalzi does add a dash of Heinlein, but then I was always very ambivalent about Heinlein when I was reading him in the 1960s... too jingoistic and misogynistic. I'll try another Scalzi book at some point, but it won't be because of this tepid effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read!","review":"This was a very good book. I would highly recommend it to any science fiction or military fiction reader. There were some very interesting and unique features in the story. I will definitely consider reading more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read it on a whim and loved every minute of it","review":"I got this book as part of an ebook bundle. I read the book I had bought the bundle for and enjoyed it well enough, and then decided to peruse this one. It was easily the best book in the bunch, a welcome surprise! It's both witty and intense, charming and violent. The extremely likeable characters draw you into the gritty extraterrestrial world, and the technology the characters use is too ridiculously cool not to like (and badly wish for!) I can't wait to read the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"DERON","review":"GOOD BOOK...READ AND READ...UNTIL IT WAS FINISHED...COULDN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW ONE...BUT THE 1ST WAS BETTER..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Life in a space military thousands of years in the future, as written by John Scalzi, is as unimpressive civilian life in here in the early 21st century for the most part. Much of the story is told in mess halls as character's sit around having obnoxious conversations. When the action finally does come it's brief and underwhelming; the main characters shoot a few aliens and the action is over.As a former sailor I know military life can be dull at times but just the same I didn't want to read a novel about a bunch of space soldiers having lunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars from me also","review":"As almost everyone before me who did a review on this book I have to give it 5 stars also.

I put the book down because at first it didn't appeal to me, but then, frankly, I couldn't find anything else so I picked this up. It looked okay, just not stellar. I was wrong. This is one of the best written and most interesting books I've read in a very long time.

For fans of mangas that deal with incredible martial arts fights interspersed with humor and romance, this book won't let you done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative censorship for the teenage market","review":"Tenjho Tenge (\\"TenTen\\") is not for kids. The artwork glorifies sexual violence against females, and it boggles the mind as to why anyone would try to censor out the sexual elements (obscuring panty shots, drawing bras in scenes where breasts are bared, etc.) in this title in order to market it toward teens. The amount of \\"editorship\\" CMX performed on this book is simply astounding, in a perverse way. By comparing the CMX version with the original Japanese version of TenTen, you can learn many techniques that can be used to censor a comic or a manga. Unfortunately, a playbook on censorship isn't why you would want to spend money on this release.If you're looking for original, unedited artwork, you're advised to look elsewhere. Likewise if you're a parent interested in buying this book for a teenager; the content left intact by CMX (which includes a rape scene) is still unsuitable for teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completelly edited","review":"Avoid this. This is simply the worst case of editing in a manga, ever. There are 36 edits. yes, THIRTY-SIX EDITS. This is not a title for teenagers. There's explicit rape, extreme violence and nudity. Covering-up the nudity with shadows, cropping the panels and adding (badly-drawn) lingerie does not change the fact this is and ADULT MANGA. Do not support DC's editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! I want my money back","review":"I am a big fan of the Tenjou/Tenjho Tenge anime and was pleased to hear that the manga was coming out. I went out and bought it the same day. I had seen samples from the japanese GN's and was ready for some high-flying action, along with a lot of fanservice. However this version of TenTen was so HORRIBLY MANGLED! Every last nude shot or panty shot has been edited out and the manga has been given a teen rating instead of the mature rating it deserves. A character's rape is oddly downplayed, as is some racial stereotyping (make your own minds about that one). My opinion tends to be the general opinion of the anime community all over the internet. However, Dark Horse has refused to release a statement regarding this travesty and are continuing to release a mature manga to a teen demographic. Do yourself a favour and just watch the anime or buy the original Japanese releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"The editing already starts with the cover image!","review":"There are over 35 edits in the first book of this series. Do not buy this if you like to read your manga the way the author meant it to be read. The only other edit that comes close to this is the UK version of the Urotsukidoji DVDs which is missing almost half of its content.

It is the perfect system for travel. I intend to take it with me for my 2 week vacation to Hawaii this summer. Yes, you have to hook up wires, but the portability and flexibility of being able to put the speakers where you want is incredible. I dare you to compare this with the Bose systems and even the B&W portable systems. I am extremely satisfied with the sound and quality. I don't understand why these are not flying off the shelves.

The films other main fault is the lack of action, the first three reels are almost completly composed of talk. When the lacklustre action finale finally comes it is handled with unbeliveable ineptitude by Mr. King, he seems to have sped up much of the footage.

This is a Hollywood costume picture in the worst sense. Eye-candy, to be sure, but the movie never transports you away from the soundstages of 20th-Century Fox.

Some of the best old movies (Gone With the Wind, Ten Commandments, Wizard of Oz) stand the test of time because of the exceptional color that made costumes, scenery, and people seem to leap off the screen. The Black Swan is a visual treat: lots of color and beauty, not only on handsome Tyrone Power and beautiful Maureen O'Hara, but also in ship-on-sea shots, and even interior shots. Even if the film's plot and acting bored you stiff (and it won't) it's beautiful just to look at. If you like swashbuckling films that are colorful and fun, The Princess & the Pirate, with Virginia Mayo and Bob Hope are great, too. This is a great movie to watch George Sanders as a campy villian (something he doesn't usually do; he usually plays the seriously bad bad guy)and Thomas Mitchell is likeable and interesting in just about anything. Wish they still made movies like this. Today's films try too hard, and still fall short."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Black Swan","review":"We had seen this movie many years ago.

Joe was way ahead of his time, and you will get tremendous value from the original book. But beware, the 20th anniversary revised edition from 1993 contained lots of extra information, written a decade after Joe's death, and some was in direct conflict with the original text.

I did just notice that the book has a 2005 copyright date. I've never heard of a post-dated copyright (have you?); but regardless, if you promise something in business, aren't you supposed to deliver?

He is loyal to his compatriots but once they are eliminated by the law or by a criminal adversary, they are discarded from Parker's life as if they were empty cigarette packs. Women to Parker are merely vents for his occasional sexual needs. There is never any emotional attachment with them.

And these ones by Prismacolor are my favorite colored pencils to work with. I got them for my birthday and I only use them for special projects of mine. (For everyday drawings, I use my mish-mash of Crayola/Colorific/PRANG/RoseArt/etc. colored pencils, which are also awesome.)The Prismacolor ones really do have nice color laydown and are great for shading. There's a good range of colors to choose from in here. My only complaint is that there is no grey in this set, but if you use the black pencil lightly, it looks like grey. Besides, there are two metallic pencils!As for care, I just treat them like my normal colored pencils. I keep them in the tin and I use aStaedtler(R) 2-Hole Metal Pencil Sharpeneron these and it sharpens them very smoothly.

The pencils were new though - as far as I could see. The box was sealed, but the pencils were in totally unordered state, not color by color.

The pencil outer shell is half chipped off or melted on mine and ?

I bought these as they were the most inclusive set I could find, and they seemed to be a good deal. Plus Prismacolor is the biggest name in the game. The problem I have is that the \\"leads\\" seem to be pre-broken at increments all the way down the pencil. When you sharpen a pencil to a point, the \\"lead\\" is broken just below that point so that when you apply pressure to paper, the point breaks off. I went through an entire yellow pencil in less than an hour just sharpening and breaking the point. I wish their was a better option to Prismacolor colored pencils, but I haven't found it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Made in Mexico!!!","review":"I want you to notice you that the pencils are made in Mexico.

The romance was only a small part of the book and some of the actions and words of the characters implied the gwowing attraction without going into detail.

He plays basketball with friends, goes through the motions of school everyday and avoids being with his parents -mostly his mother- at all costs. But a catch is that Theo's entire family, consisting of his younger brother Jeremy, who is in the 5th grade, his mother, a prema-donna, and his father, a humble carpenter, are all deaf. Theo is stuck in between a deaf world and a hearing world, where he is his family's only line to the outside world. This book follows him as he goes through high school, meets new friends,and faces the challenges of everyday life -for himself and his family. Full of themes and life lessons about everything from love to self-identity, this book is a feel-good book for readers, showing insight into the lives of those who are deaf and live with deaf people. Also full of emotion, you won't want to read this one without a tissue box beside you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mind-stretching read","review":"In \\"Of Sound Mind\\" we get a glimpse of the world through the eyes of good kid who has a whole lot on his plate. Theo struggles with that huge task that all adolescents face--defining himself as separate from his family without abandoning the important ties that bind. Most high school seniors have to go through some version of this struggle to define boundaries between self and family--that demanding mother who seems to undermine every move toward independence, that father whose loving support can't last forever, that clinging kid brother too lovable to push away. Is it their deafness which makes his family seem so \\"other,\\" or is it just his own need to grow into his best self? As Theo straddles the chasm between the deaf and the hearing he shows us a different view of the world.

Theo never goes out or hangs round with friends because everyone at home is counting on him to help him with the thing they need to do to get on with life.I also liked this book because it shows how mature Theo is. He has to take care of his father and brother, after his father had a stroke, because their mother/ wife is too frightened to deal with the family's situation.This was a great book and I recommend it to everyone, young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids","review":"If you want to laugh till you can't breathe you have to read both of Peck's books about the visits to Grandma's.

I have taken these apart and tried inserting lead every which way, and it's just a huge hassle and I have not ever done it successfully. I think a mechanical pencil should be easily refillable and reusable, but these just end up in the landfills once the lead runs out. Not a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never, ever saw the lead","review":"I bought a small pack (5 or 6) to give to my writers group. It's a good thing I tried one out first.

How many twists does it take, 50?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"I prefer the wood pencils to these...","review":"While these mechanical pencils have some advantages over a regular pencil, they are not what I would recommend. The reason behind this is that they are not refillable, and, with the ones I had, the lead would occasionally break inside the pencil, and I would have to throw the pencil away. The refillable pencils are better because they can be reused over and over, these have to be thrown out when they run out of lead. Another thing that I don't like about these is the method of lead advancement. To advance the lead, you have to twist the tip where the lead comes out. After using other mechanical pencils, I became used to pushing on the end for more lead, and got frustrated when this technique didn't work on these pencils. These pencils do have the advantage over regular wood pencils of not having to be sharpened, but I think I prefer wood pencils to these.Loggie-log-log-log"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-refillable?

A simple twist allows one to retract the lead; good for then carrying it around in one's pocket. The lead does not break off as much as it does in some other mechanical pencils.But, and this is a big but, this pencil is NOT refillable. So, it will simply end up in a landfill. All that plastic and a long metal spring inside are just so much garbage--and consume resources and energy in the making. A regular lead pencil, made out of wood, is much more environmentally friendly. Other mechanical pencils, that are refillable, are a MUCH smarter buy-- both for reuse but also to spare the Earth.Anyone who buys this really is saying that they don't care about the environment!Shame on Papermate for making such a thing. Now, if they would make it refillable, I'd reconsider my rating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This pencil is okay","review":"I would not reccomend this pencil because it is a total waste of cash.The pencils are not refillable, and the lead breaks really easy.

I'm going back to BIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but Goody","review":"These mechanical pencils have been around for forever and there's a reason for that. They work well and write smoothly, the lead holds up to considerable pressure, and the twisting action of the tip makes it easy to dispense more lead AS YOU WRITE. Other designs make you click on the side of the pencil, which means you kind of have to stop writing or at least maneuver your hand away a bit, whereas this style allows you to simply rub your index and middle fingers ever so slightly, all the while writing and not moving your hand away from the page. It's quick and uninterrupted. Another advantage to this pencil is that erasers fit nicely over the end if and when you use up the stock eraser. Best of all, these are priced right. All in all, it's a quality pencil at a bargain price."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite, most reliable pencils","review":"After college and 4 years of graduate school, I can comfortably say these are the most reliable pencils I've used - not the most precise or accurate (I like some of the metal ones for that, can't come up with a brand) or with the most useful features (that has to go to twisterase), but these jam the least.Note that the erasers aren't great- try a gentle circular motion to reduce smearing, especially on newsprint or thin/color textbooks - twisterase has great ones. The lead can spin around in its holder, so that you can go from a dull to a sharp point less predictably than with other pencils that grasp the lead more firmly. However, grasping it firmly leads to more breakage - so for reliability go with this guy.I DO wish that they'd release a 0.5mm version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price!","review":"I love these things. Trouble is, so do my kids which means that when I want one (daily) I can never find one. And so I buy in bulk and stash them.

However, the author did a very unprofessional job in that there are just too many errors in the code samples; it seems each time I try any of the more complex hacks, the code samples are riddled with syntax errors to the point where instead of focussing attention on learning more about baseball stats, I have to focus on debugging details.If you are both an expert in the R program and are fluent in MySQL, you can work around the bulk of this without wasting too much time. However, if lack either of these skills, you will find this book nightmarish IMO. The small amount of info the author gives in R, for example, is not nearly enough to troubleshoot all the errors.It's too bad - this could be an excellent book if the author hadn't been so lazy about getting the details right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disapppointment","review":"I have tried just a couple of the Hacks in the beginning portion of this book (#11, #14) and nothing has worked as displayed in the book.

I will say this candle smells pretty darn good. You have to let the candle burn for a good hour when you first light it for the first time to enjoy it's aroma. When you relight it later the aroma kicks in pretty quick.

This is nothing like it and does not show the same inventive flow.

First off, I will say that I like Lucy Liu as an actress, but this movie degraded her acting prowess. Uma Thurman was sadly disappointing. You can find better acting in a children's theatre than in this movie. Also, there is such a lack of realism. Maybe that was what Tarantino was after, but the movie would have been better if it focused more on the plot and storyline and less on the gallons of fake blood that exploded from severed limbs. I won't even mention the music, of which made me cringe everytime I listened to it. If you do like non-realistic depiction and bad acting, then this is the movie for you. Rent it before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faking it is just too easy","review":"I cannot understand all the positive ratings. I watched the European dvd last night and have just two comments.1. The Western actors tried to hard to make their studied Japanese lines sound like real Japanese. I speak Japanese myself, the intonation was off and some of the lines sounded ridiculous!2. The fight scenes were miserable. Do I need to say more? They should have used Michelle Yeoh instead of Lucy Liu for example. Ballet and sword fighting are two totally different things.Yes there were some nice scenes in this movie that why I give it two stars, but for me it was irritating most of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarantinwho?","review":"What is supposed to be so great about this guy? This is badly written and badly directed pap and not since Monty Python have we seen blood spurting so generously. Is this supposed to be a farce or is it just sick self-indulgence?In scene one our 'heroine' appears bloodied and pregnant in a wedding dress and is shortly shot in the head. Things go downhill from there. The fight scenes are ludicrous, the dialogue appauling and every single step is utterly predictable in all respects except perhaps the level of bloodflow.This is just twisted and apparently pointless.

It's just art-house on Meth; its ludicrous, which is probably what it is supposed to be from jump street, but I have had enough of Scream acerebral thinking. I am sure it is boat loads of fun working with Quentin. There obviously is a reason movies like this are made. Five stars indeed. I'd rather watch reruns of Ghandi and a marathon on AMC of awful Clint Eastwood films like Unforgiven, then to ever, EVER sit through a Quentin film again.If this is the kind of raw new talent coming from Hollywood in that era, I certainly have a chance to bring my ideas to fruition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarantino is the great deceiver!","review":"The only reason why Tarantino has done such a weak films is because he can't do better films. I consider myself a great movie fan. I have been watching films for more than thirty years, so I know what a good film is and I'm sure, \\"Kill Bill I, and Kill Bill II\\", are not good films in any way. Nobody can even call this film alternative, I'm sure this is a complete \\"Nothing\\"! It's a total lack of creativity, ridiculous script, the only one good thing here is the real beauty of Uma Thurman. First time I watched this film I had to watch \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" after to forget the waste of time I had just done. In my opinion Tarantino is the great deceiver of all movie industry. If he had stopped with The great \\"Pulp Fiction\\" he would be considered a genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the title of art","review":"This has got be the most disgusting film that has ever been produced in history.

To say that the plot is lacking would be rather kind. Not only is it lacking, I have seen hundreds of martial arts/animes that have the same premise, and this movie didn't really stick out to me. Sure there are lots of dialogues and colorful characters that Terantino fans will love, but it just isn't a great movie. Entertaining as hell, but not a great movie. I hate to say it, but Terantino's best movie is, and always will be, Pulp Fiction. I wish it wasn't so, he is so damn likeable and stylish, but it's the sad truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointmnet","review":"I used to be a big Tarantino fan before this movie and I am bitterly diappointed now.

Not funny, not real and no plot.Those who'd like to see the same plot but real martial arts masterpiece - watch HARD TO KILL with S.

Ok, so Tarantino has a non-chronological, attempted mind-bending style. But ~think~ people, what REALLY makes this so great? Right; Nothing.

You can see this two times in the film if you pause it and zoom in during the airport sequences when Uma is handed her passport. I thought it might have been an alias name, but if you watch the mouths of Vivica and Lucy Liu you can see them mouthing Beatrix (during the beep). Just thought some fans might want to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Effort","review":"I am very disapointed in this film. I have enjoyed some of Tarantino's other films like \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" and \\"Jackie Brown\\". However, this movie was a let down. I understand what he was trying to do with the violence and the blood splurting out or every wond. It seemed he was trying to make a real life movie resemeling Japanese animation. It may do that is some slight ways, but the plot and the writing are terrible. I do not have any desire to see \\"Kill Bill 2\\". I also find it funny that people think that this movie was originally made with the idea of making two movies and that a sequil was required due to the success of the first Kill Bill. The truth is that this series of movies was only suppose to be one complete movie. I am not sure if it was mere greed of the belief that people would not sit through the entire length of both movies combined, but Tarantino decide to cut the movie in half and try and make twice the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brain Dead Cinema","review":"I think that this movie was poorly put together. It seems that those who think it is the greatest movie ever are more concerned with praising the director because of his past works. My main problem with this film is the swords. What is the purpose? It is not like she and her family were attacked with swords.. they were gunned down but suddenly she picks up a sword, which she has no skill with by the way. The worst scene in this movie is when the bride fights Yakuza and they all have swords and one fights with a ball and chain. I mean really...don't gangsters carry guns? Its set in the 21st century for crying out loud. The plot is horrible, the time frame is wrong and I could understand if it was a comedy..but anything else no. Show yourself some respect and save your money..rent it at best I gave it 2 stars because of its attempt at something unique and at times it was amusing.Uma Thurman : tricks are for-Lucy Lu : - kidswhat the ????????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smile","review":"Yes, there is a point when you ask \\"Does no one own a gun?\\". But you do leave feeling your time spent in the theater was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOZING WITH STYLE, BUT LACKING IN SUBSTANCE","review":"The soundtrack though is a fabulous treat. And so is Ms. Therman. The fighting finale would match, or beat, the 'Burly Brawl' from Matrix Reloaded. But sadly that's about all going for the movie.Sure, it's a typical Tarantino visual feast with delicious camera shots from wicked angles. And yes, as a martial arts movie it may hang with the top of the tops (was it just me or did anyone notice \\"Crouching Tiger\\" influences too?)But his 4th film nowhere near matches the sheer class of Jackie Brown or Pulp Fiction. Once the hype has faded, I am sure people'll realise how mediocre this film really is, stylish maybe, original somewhat, but a boring script that shows little direction.What's most worrisome is that this tripe should be long enough to be cut into two bits. Perhaps the stuff that cults are made of, but a disappointing movie overall. One can only hope that the second part is where it's at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a patch on the original drama","review":"I give Tarantino his props for creating his own genre of blood splashed action but he has absolutely no idea when it comes to paying homage to the original kung fu and samurai films that he claims to love. KILL BILL is well-crafted but overlong and it lacks the passion and sense of duty and honor that make the true HK and Japanese so-called \\"chop-suey\\" flicks so well regarded. Not a bad way to kill a rainy Saturday afternoon but hardly worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as some of the true HK classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Budget Gorefest","review":"Basically, it's a B-movie with a huge budget. If you like sensational violence with severed limbs and hot girls killing each other; then you'll probably enjoy the flick. I was bored by this movie and struggled to make it to the end.I've never before seen a movie where I kept thinking to myself \\"What a waste of money?\\" so much. Tarantino could have made the same movie with 1/4 the budget and unknown actors. Then maybe he would have further developed the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surrealist, gratuitously violent trash","review":"This movie combines extraordinary amounts of violence with almost no plot at all. I'm not a prudish person: I'm all in favor of violence that is reasonable and enhances a movie (eg. soldiers in a combat zone getting blown up). By contrast, the violence in this film is grotesque, unbelievable, and serves no particular function. The plot could be summarized without loss on an average-size napkin (woman gets beaten up and raped, recovers, and travels the world slaughtering members of the responsible gang).That this movie has been (and continues to be) so enormously popular is a frightening testament to both the herd mentality that prevails amongst movie-watchers and our society's numbness to gore and brutality. I recieved this movie as a gift, and I am sorry to have unwittingly contributed to its success. One star is too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whew, what language","review":"Whoever made this movie lost what could have been a fun to watch parody of the martial arts. The out of place vulgar language and stupid violence cost my vote. Rented it, played 5 min. and returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind-Numbing Garbage","review":"I went to see Kill Bill in the middle of a mostly mind-numbing convention. The movie did nothing to improve my mood. The level of violence--implied, threatened, and realized--overwhelms what could have been an interesting storyline. This is commercial exploitation at its schlockiest--before one can understand Kill Bill 1, one needs to see Kill Bill 2, where supposedly all questions will be answered (Who is the Bride? How did she become an assassin? Why did someone want to kill her? Why did they pick her wedding in the middle of Nowhere, Texas? Who is Bill, anyway?). I come out of few movies wishing I hadn't wasted my time, but this is one of them. Skip the DVD and find something good, like Master and Commander."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Tarantino thinking?","review":"What was Tarantino thinking? He stuffs all his favorite genres into a single movie mixing visuals, music, and styles from scene to scene. A washed out scene like a spaghetti western including the ripped off soundtrack. A campy chopsuey bloody fight scene. A stylish martial arts scene. Japanese anime - yes, Tarantino tosses in animation scenes. Film noir. A dash of campy Charlie's Angels. I'm sure I'm missing some. Add in a near record number of annoying flashbacks and you have a confused film one assumes is meant to be, at some level, satire but lacks any real humor, cleverness, or bite. Terribly sadistic in places, it generally is lacking in humanity. Uma Thurman is completely wasted though she tries awfully hard to breath life into an empty script. Oh, did I mention his fascination with spraying blood that gushes from wounds like an uncapped fire hydrant? Excessive is what this film's all about. This movies is only for Tarantino fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Game","review":"This movie is basically a non-interactive video game. Lucy Lui plays the boss of the game. It could've been a lot better with just a little more thought and a lot less stupid violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you don't mind blood spurting!","review":"Great, if you don't mind blood spurting!This is a great mix of movie styles, including animation, and garden hose blood spurting.If you don't like movies that are a little different, then don't bother.If you liked Pulp Fiction and you like Japanese cartoons, then you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This is the first Q.T. movie I have ever seen, and I wasn't enthusiastic about seeing it from its previews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it's got a lot of blood and gore and it isn't very realistic- the bride would have had to pull a lot more out than an IV if she had been in a come for four years- but the fight scenes are good, and the showdown at the house of blue leaves is fantastic. I loved Gogo's character and also Lucy Liu's portrayal of O-Ren. And the last fight scene between the bride and O-Ren was done very well.. the lightly falling snow and the beautiful Japanese garden really added to it. I've watched it many times and still am hooked. If you can enjoy a quirky movie that isn't supposed to be realistic, you will like this one. Don't buy it if you have a habit of taking movies too seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was one of the best action movies I ever saw!!","review":"This movie was super!

As a writer, I prefer a movie with a stronger plotline and character development. However, if you're big on action, you may like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Kill Bill","review":"It is never a good sign when the first Quentin Tarrantino film in years borrows its basic plot from a Steven Seagal movie. At least in Hard to Kill, when Seagal emerges from his coma, he has to train to get back into peak condition. Whereas in Kill Bill, all that has to be done to get back into shape after being in a coma for 4 years is the old \\"wiggle your big toe\\" work out.I guess this is Quentin's homage to old school Kung Fu movies... I feel like he borrowed a little too heavily. Right down to the team of assassins, which may be \\"inspired\\" by the Five Deadly Venoms.Of course, it's hard to give this film a fair review, since the movie theater asked us to leave after the first half. They told us we could come back in February to see the rest, but we'll have to pay again. That seems fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an Amazing Film","review":"Quentin Tarantino is a genius!

(not a spoiler) I kept thinking what Japanese song this was and then I had the strange idea it could be Zamfir, but thought if it was it would be kind of a geeky joke between Tarentino and the few people who actually remember those tv ads for the panflute recordings... And by jove... the song is called \\"the Lost shepherd\\" performed by Zamfir. ;)If nothing else, I'll get a nice soundtrack of music from this movie. That's a guarantee with Tarentino movies. :D~L~ who's giving her copy of Kill Bill to her brother"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarantino cinematic genius","review":"First off I loved the film. An instant classic though some believe its based off Hannie Caulder or Death rides a Horse. Though I believe its from his head and partially based off the kung fu movies he must have watched earlier in his life. I believe that the mans a cinematic genius just the opening the 70's style with the Feature Presentation in the opening and how the movie transitions into animi was just incredible. i'm kinda pissed that some are still hung up on the cliff hanger I just don't understand.

If you are a fan of Tarantino movies then you will probably enjoy this one as well. If you are not familiar with his work, then this may be the least offensive you might start with. The gore is mostly phoney but still prevalent. Ms. Thurman is an attractive young lady, no doubt. But her attractiveness quickly disappears in the gratuitous mayhem and glorrification of blood revenge. The fight scenes are pure martial arts fantasy of the cheesiest variety and are only props for additional blood-spurting \\"entertainment.\\" There seems to be little of value in this one but Tarantino fans are die-hard fans and this one is classic Tarantino."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Just about anything by Quentin Tarantino is bound to be interesting. This is a cross between \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\", but not as good as either. I couldn't give it five stars because it wasn't creative enough. It just didn't grab me. The soundtrack was great, as usual. The acting was pretty good. It just seemed too much like other movies that have been out recently (hint: too much like \\"The Matrix\\"). Still, recommended and I will watch the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you would just like to be entertained for once.","review":"If you're at all a fan of martial arts action films, you're going to enjoy this. I'm definitely a QT fan, but for one of his films I didn't think it that great. What earns it four stars for me is the femaie heroine, even if I don't fully believe Uma Thurman in this role.It's actually imaginative And gory, intelligent (in its references) and (blissfully) stupid.But not every film has to be a stunning display of high-brow, high-minded stimulation for the cranium.The bottom line is, if you like blood, you like gore, and you're mature enough to relax and enjoy it, without thinking of it as real, or even an accurate reflection of reality, have fun, and enjoy this action film starring a chick flik actress.

Basically, Uma Thurman\`s character just wants to \\"Kill Bill\\". And this movie is pretty much a staightforward sequence of well-directed and cleverly made action scenes with enough blood and violence to deserve cult status and some appeal. Mix some black humour, cultural and cinematic references, technical gimmicks, a cool soundtrack and even an anime sequence and you will have \\"Kill Bill\\". What seems to be lacking is a decent and original plot, since this is nothing more than a typical revenge story about a vitimized and angry tough woman. Overall, this is flashy and disposable entertainment that doesn\`t care to provide much food for thought. Not that it is a bad thing, but Tarantino has done better and a movie like this doesn\`t deserve all the praise it got.Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is sick art","review":"This movie is nothing but an orgy of violence. I cannot see this movie's appeal, unless you really like watching a relentless stream of hacked off limbs, blood gushing everwhere, pedophilliac rape, etc. The movie has very little plot. What truely amazes me is that I didn't turn it off earlier.For Parents: If you are one of those parents that use the rating system with some latitude, don't do it here. Keep your kids away from this one. This one is sick.I think the critics must be afraid of Tarantino or something. I cannot understand how they present their reviews of this flic. I suppose that in some way the movie was art, but the critics certainly should have at least qualified their praise.

Smarfart cineophiles get their eyeballs stroked like tools with nearly every shot.The mundane and exotic are contrasted so starkly you begin to think the film is actually being shot in black and white and you are simply graphemic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarantino has lost his touch","review":"I thought Pulp Fiction was the best film of the 90s, which pains me to say, because the decade contains Goodfellas and Martin Scorcese is my favorite director. When you consider PF along with Reservoir Dogs and the True Romance screenplay, Tarantino emerges as one of the singular voices of the past 35 years. But it seems he has lost it. Yes, there are flashes of brilliance here (Uma's initial meeting with fighting master Pei Mei is mesmerizingly cool and surreal). However, it seems as if more than 50% of this film is spent in having to listen to David Carradine's Bill ramble on about the film's backstory. It's a film Quentin, not a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"slice and dice volume I","review":"This is a very graphic blood and guts fight movieusing sharp edged instruments.I don't like Quentin Tarantino (Rating R) very much after having seen a number of his movies:mostly because he is very very good atgrossing me out. A younger me would have hid his head at this movie; the older me says he hopes no stuntmen/ extras were hurt doing this.I'd buy shares in his company, because people are going to line upfor these movies. I just don't have to like his product or the manbehind it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The return of the revenge flick.","review":"Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill is a throw back to the retro 70's revenge movie is not only a tribute but also grand come back to those styles of filmmaking. Uma Thurman is Wonderful, and Lucy Lu is just as great as her adversary.

This movie has moments that shine like some of Quentin's best work, but the other parts fall short of the perfection of Pulp Fiction. I understand that you cannot compare a masterpiece to something that is just a fine piece of film making, like Kill Bill is. It's just the unbeliveable gore that is shocking. Not only does the spraying blood start to become humorish (which had to be the intention), it also is distracting from this outstanding thriller. This is not something, the faint of heart should watch, but for those thrill seekers out there...Quentin wants to take you for a ride. I cannot wait for Vol 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miramax Sucks!","review":"I loved this movie, okay, let me get that out of the way. But they are such sneaks.

Don't waste your money on this and wait until the ultimate version comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever Made!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is my all time favorite movie (Next to Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and Reservoir Dogs). Tarantino is the best director i've ever seen. This movie is so cool with its non-stop action and its sick style for killing. The story to the movie is easy to follow and the action is the coolest.

Tarantino's movies are the greatest and thats all I have to say until...Kill Bill Vol.2"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift for Tarantino fans.","review":"Its been quite awhile since Tarantino gave us something to talk about and now I can't stop talking about this movie. It truly exceeded my expectations and surpassed anything he has given us so far. With all the movies filled with martial arts violence already in existence I expected the usual, but Tarantino's synism and brutal wit threw the ordinary out the window.I was on the edge of my seat with a big grin watching Kill Bill. I loved how Uma's yellow outfit was the same as Bruce Lee's in 'Game of Death'. The plot was all it needed to be, revenge, it speaks for itself. I left the theater with the tingle. Lately that has only happened after the matrix movies.this is probably one of the funniest and most fun movies I've seen in a long time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its nice to see Uma Thurman again","review":"This is one of the best movies i have seen in the last few years.I've been waiting to see it for a year and a half, first Pulp Fiction now this, Quentin Tarantino is the man.

The Battle at the House of Blue Leaves is sheer cinamatic genius a great tribute to all those Japanese films one spent the 60's and 70's growing up with. The duel in the snow is marked with absolute quiet, stark beauty, and subtle violence that only Tarantino could capture. This one scene alone makes the film. Sure it is mind chilling violence, sure it is snatches of lives lost, but when in recent memory have you gone to a film where the audience gave it a standing ovation, and bothered to stay till the end of the credits?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The family liked it, but...","review":"although i'm a fan of most of q. tarintino's work, well, this one didn't do much for me.

Quentin Tarantino, takes notes, and good ones, some of the best movies. This film has a dreamlike quality, with an amazing soundtrack to boot.It's very rare to see a film that has the ability to carry a plot, so character driven, and balance it with action. The storyline is one that is relatively new amidst the constant parade of romantic comedies and action pics that all seem to star the same people, as well as characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"An homage to classic asian fight films. this movie, to me, tells a great story, despite the purposely campy effects. not as great as pulp fiction or resivoir dogs, but a great film all the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harken Back To Old School","review":"This film was absolutely a trip down memory lane. If this was a western it would more than likely be a spaghetti western. In fact the second film Vol.2 has a track from THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY. I noticed the influence of old kung fu and spaghetti western films. This was an example of excellent film making and you can tell that Quentin put his heart in this piece of cinematic greatness. Of course the film is ultra-violent and you shouldn't let kids see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chop-Suey!!","review":"I bought this Blu-ray version of Kill Bill after I discovered my standard definition version was defective. I'm not a big movie collector, I probably own only about a dozen movies on disc. I'm very happy with this purchase. If you like watching movies to be entertained with almost non-stop action, it does'nt get any better than this. The Blu-ray makes the picture crisp and clean, and the soundtrack is top-notch! This is an ideal disc for showing off your home theater set-up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross and Stupid","review":"My husband and I are huge martial arts fans, but this is aweful.

It is a funny blood drenched spoof about a young woman who is betrade, by her colleagues and left for dead. she wakes up one day and finds that she has been in a comae for 4 years. And now she is seeking revenge on those have betrade her. This is a must see and when Kill Bill volume 2 comes out be sure to see that to.

Kill Bill is nothing but blood and guts and has no real plot except this phsyco woman needs revenge for her screwed up life. Trhoughout the whole movie is the worse kind of violence you have ever seen. Yes, living in this country Quentin Tarantino has the right to show this kind of crap, but he has a poor taste in movies and has earned himself a bad reputation with millions worlwide. Scratch this film off your list, unless you are as low as Quentin Tarantino himself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickness as art","review":"When hollywood doesn't know how to capture an audience with anything intelligent or unique, they can always resort to the cheapest and easiest trick in the book. Just shock the audience. Show them something more repulsive or twisted than they've seen before. It's easy to do, and it always buys a few good reviews from people who think anything that shocks them must be art.The fight scenes in this movie are less imaginative than what you can see at home in Alias or Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but they add ridiculous amounts of blood to please the small minded serial killer wannabes out there. No realism - just characters that never go into shock or bleed to death. This movie carries on Hollywood's seeming goal of desensitizing the public to any kind of atrocity - perhaps to help make the real atrocities in the world more pallatable for us. Don't see this film. I did, and it's a memory I wish I could erase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill Bill","review":"I have not walked out on a movie in many years. But 20 minutes into this movie I left.

There are so many good movies out there that get left behind - and this is not one of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and pathetic","review":"Trash is too good a word for this film. A bad copy of some bad Japanese Ronin film, an insult to Samurai, a slap in the face to any Japanese film buff.Call this a very bad spaghetti samurai film.The dialogue was horrible, especially when Uma Thurman is trying to acquire a sword from a Japanese cafe owner.

If I had paid to see it in a theater I would have been mad.First off, it's not a complete movie. There is no real ending. Tarrinto thinks everyone loves him so much they will lineup for what is basically episodes of his half-baked story.Secondly, if you're going to create a ridiculous fight movie, leave it fun and ridiculous. Tarrinto tries too hard to make a plausible story line and the movie loses direction.I'll pass on the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to Feel Really Bad?","review":"Want to feel disgusted and depressed for almost two hours? Watch this senseless sexually violent piece of tripe. Whatever happened to writing a good story and presenting it in a creative way?

The violence and horror is completely tasteless and certainly not enough to save this movie from being banal and idiotic."},{"rating":"1","title":"i didnt even get the dvd","review":"i was very excited to own a good movie but when it came, it was just the dvd, there was no dvd.whats the point in that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill Bill","review":"The worst movie I ever viewed, made no sense at all, I fell asleep twice. What a joke!! And Those ugly toes, why didn't they just cut them off and just have Uma walk around on bloody stumps to a Burger King. And on the way, falling into the wood chipper from Fargo. And what about the whole story line of a bride getting shot in the head, why? didn't she put out? I mean she did pretty a good job while in the coma. Even Repoman and Rabbit proof fence beat this on by a mile."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was really bad","review":"Kill Bill v1 resembled an old poorly-dubbed chinese kung fu movie far too much - the action sequences and sountrack were that hilarious. In addition, the animation sequences looked completely out of place. If q.t. was looking to reproduce the \\"freshness\\" of pulp fiction style-wise, imho he failed miserably. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I saw it on a nice new plasma screen at the Sun Valley Inn, after a decent meal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous violence posing as stylish","review":"Disgusting. Trash without any redeeming value. Violent to the point of making one feel depersonalised. If you want your children to become murderers, this is the film to get them. Tarantino has a great sense of black humor but none of it came out in this film. It was just degradingand sick. On my 5 worst list of all times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quentin Tarantino likes man candy","review":"Let me start this review by reminding everyone how much Tarantino sucks ass. Everyone loves this guy for basically no reason...He made Pulp Fiction, great, but that movie blows. I mean seriously, it was a mesh of inconsequential garbage losely tied together and littered with sophomoric dialogue that certainly worked to fool a lot of viewers into thinking it was somewhat significant. To top it all off, they add swearing and gore, so people won't be scared to think it's 'cool'. The whole movie blows.Anyway, Kill Bill is stupid. Who wants to see an ugly banana jump around pretending she doesn't suck at martial arts. Honestly, could the martial arts suck any more? Tarantino has such a huge ego inside his watermelon-sized dome that he thinks I care about his girly little 'style'. Someone needs to stick a javelin in his brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worsy ever","review":"Quentin Tarantino must have some very serious psychological problems.

Kill Bill is nuanced and subtle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be Kidding !!!","review":"This movie, was just horrible; I hated it, and if l could give it below one star, l would, in a heart beat.I can not see how anybody could like it, but it would seem people do - perhaps they were under the influence when watching it !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Messy...but that's Tarantino!","review":"No one can dispute that Kill Bill is a violent movie...but hey, that's Tarantino's style. The film opens up with a hardcore fight in sleepy suburbia, which shocks you into paying attention and makes you ask, \\"What is up with these women?\\" And to find out, you have to keep paying attention. As the film progresses, and you learn more about The Bride and why she's so mad, you sympathize and root for her, which makes most of the violence more palpable, because most of the victims had it coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Exciting, Cartoonish","review":"I loved Kill Bill Volume 1. Sure, it's a gory movie, with lots of violence. But hte gore is very cartoony, as is the violence. Also, the storyline is very interesting, and the fights are excellently choreographed. This movie is only for the action fans though, as the gore can be a turn off. However, it was an excellent film as far as Tarantino films go. Starring Uma Thurman, Lucy Lui, Vivica Fox, Daryl Hannah, David Caradine, and Michael Madsen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarantino really fumbles with this film.","review":"I'm happy to be one of the few who didn't care for this movie. Every few seconds a limb is sliced and BLOOD sprays everywhere. I don't care to watch that. People with swords flying through the air? One swordsman (woman) defeats an army of 30 trained swordsman in less than a minute? Characters are shallow and have no grounding to reality. I can keep going, but It'll just bore ya... I guess my taste in movies has improved since the days of Pulp Fiction.

It's not funny.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill Bill, Volume 1","review":"This movie was over done with violence and exessive gore. The only reason I gave it two stars is because Uma Thurman did such a fine job as an actress that she carried the whole movie. Also I have to add that the fight scenes/Kung Foo were very well choreographed. But basically the only reason I would have any interest in seeing the sequel is because of her performance. Other than that the movie would be garbage in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing movie, terrible DVD","review":"Kill Bill Vol.1 is a fantastic movie, if you like QT you will love this movie. The problem is this bland, almost featureless DVD. Miramax has already said that he's thrilled about being able to put out multiple versions of of this movie on DVD to make more money off the saps that buy the early versions. Rent this DVD and wait for the full thrills versions that will be out after Kill Bill Vol.2 makes it to DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL HYPE.... Really lame and unoriginal","review":"Imagine Quentin Tarantino, a well known hollywod producer, gets tired of making original movies. Most of his movies ( Pulp Fiction, Dusk Til Dawn1,2,3 etc.) are entertaining, but have been done before or at least have a totally familiar theme. Well now, Quentin just decided to lower the bar even farther. Take B-grade kung fu movies, B-grade western movies, Japanese Animation movies, and steal the most famous scenes out of them. Then throw in tons of people getting killed. You might think this would equal action, but no, it gets old in two minutes. Both volume 1 and 2 are horrible. I tried to like these movies, but I don't understand how anyone could be entertained from this. Wait a minute! I know what it is! The best part in this series is playing name that scene! It's like a trivia book of other people's ideas!Don't bother"},{"rating":"1","title":"Say Goodbye, Western Civ; it was fun while it lasted...","review":"An absolute bloodbath. A celebration of the wanton destruction of human life, like all other Tarantino vehicles, only this time he gives it a cartoony bent.If anybody ever needed succint, tangible proof that Western Civilization is dying, is succumbing to perverted bloody blood-games the way Rome did, one could do no better than to look to this latest debauchery by Tarantino, the King of pointless death and murder onscreen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous violence instead of plot","review":"When you boil it down, its just another Tarantino attempt to make up for lack of an interesting plot with a ton of violence.

All style and absolutely no substance, it was like watching a two hour video game fight scene, with the gore setting turned on maximum. I suppose young boys (and yet to grow up college males) love this kind of mindless blood fest, but I just hated it.

It is one my favorite films of 2003 and I can't wait to own my personal copy, but now is not the time. It has been stated by the producers of the film that after Kill Bill vol. 1 and vol. 2 are out there will be a boxed set of the two. After the boxed set they plan to release special editions of the films (which may or may not be the versions shown in Japan) and the special editions are planned to be released in single and then boxed set form as well. Heck, you might be able to buy boxed sets with the original and special edition versions together.

Then it keeps you entertained laughing and cheering for its heroine.It is one of those movies that has classic lines and sticky tunes that will keep you coming back to watch it over and over.If you (or someone you like) watch movies that deal with revenge and classic kung-fu theather (with girls doing the fighting), this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I had high hopes for this movie. I thought both \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\" were great, innovative, interesting movies. But this movie... I totally wasted the $4 I paid to rent it.The first half was quite good. Very stylized, the characters seemed interesting, Uma was doing a great job. Then, all of a sudden, it's just all this extremely lame and gratuitious violence, not to mention that they stole (along with so many others) some of the wall-climbing \\"Matrix\\" moves. Boy, I'm tired of seeing those.The worst part, and my husband agrees, is that when people would get stabbed with the samurai blade or have a limb chopped off (it happened a lot), the blood would come out in the super-fine spray, like an airbrush, not like an artery had been severed. Call me a nitpicker, but that got old, too.I know Quentin Tarantino has better movies in him. I just hope he makes those movies before a third \\"Kill Bill\\" installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best film of 2003!!!","review":"Just like everyone else, I too was waiting for the next Tarantino masterpiece to be released. I eventually saw the trailer during some movie and I got goosebumps! Then the day came, I went to the movies and saw a masterpiece. I've always regarded Resevoir Dogs as the best Tarantino movie, but not anymore!!! All I can say about this movie is that it has perfect balance! It has all the ingredients of a great movie. Uma Thurman dazzled me with her gutsy performance, both physical and emotional. The hospital scene where she wakes up and finds out about her baby was soooo convincing, I almost felt guilty, I truly felt bad for THE BRIDE. Plus all the action she does in the movie is just amazing! My vote is for Uma Thurman, best actress, and she deserves it. I saw this movie 9 times in the first week....it's that good. Till next time, I'll be waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still haven't decided if I liked it.","review":"One thing that can be said for Quentin Tarrantino, he is committed to his vision. \\"Kill Bill, Volume One,\\" his fourth feature length film shows that commitment. From the very beginning, QT lets you know that this movie has it's roots in '60s chop-socky cinema. When you hear the themes from \\"Ironside\\" and \\"The Green Hornet,\\" you know this is going to be very different. When he starts quoting \\"Ancient Klingon Proverbs,\\" you know it's not to be taken seriously.Uma Thurman is \\"The Bride.\\" A woman left for dead on her wedding day, along with the rest of the wedding party. When she awakens from a coma four years later, revenge for the day in question is her goal.While this is filled with primarily cartoon violence, it is a bloodbath of cartoon violence. It never really stoops to gory. However, it is relentless in it's pursuit of another limb to vanquish. If you're squeemish about such things stay home. Otherwise, enjoy the twisted genius that is Quentin Tarrantino."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"This is an unusual story with huge amounts of action and entertainment.

Very Highly Recommended!","review":"Run Lola Run, The Matrix, Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon and several other crazy, violent films all reduced to a 2-hour tour de force. This is what Kill Bill Vol.1 is all about in a nutshell. Driven by Tarantino-style exaggerated and grotesque violence, this film is actually a profound drama about murder and revenge. The soundtrack is oddly eclectic, calming and very appropriate for the endless horror sequences.Uma Thurman and Lucy Lui rock the screen and take your breath away with their charm and moves (some of which are comic at times!) If you don't spend most of the time watching this film looking away or feeling repulsed, it will definitely get your nod!The cinematography, anime, fight sequences and dialogue make this movie a unique triumph for Tarantino. This is not a family or romantic movie experience. Nevertheless, I highly recommended it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martial Arts Perfection!","review":"I am a HUGE Shaw Brothers fan. I loved Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown. They are two of my favorite films. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is perhaps Tarantino's most entertaining and fast paced film to date. It is extremely creative and inventive. It's like a madcap combo of shaw brothers style chop socky kung fu, brian de palma's suspense, blacksploitation's sound and edge and the spaghetti western/samurai film sense of purpose and storyline. The characters are so fascinating even with the bits and pieces we get of them. I loved this movie. I can't wait till it comes out on DVD. This may in fact now be one of my favorite films of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"We love this movie and have been looking for it everywhere.

Kill bill. I don't know what it is about this flick, but it has to be watched over and over, with that soundtrack cranked. Any anime fan can recognize the style of the odd-ball camera angles, unusual close-ups and strange outfits - it's right out of any one of a couple dozen of major anime's. The close-up of LUCY LIU's O-Ren Ishii's eyes as she draws her Katana from it's sheath - pure anime. Same with the little school girl look of Go Go Yubari. And Uma's yellow bike leathers. I've heard some people compare the blood spurting to Monty Python. Sure, MPFS had the excessive blood is a couple of classic bits, but it's in EVERY martial arts anime ever made. Plus the soundtrack really rocks.If you're a fan of anime, martial arts or action flicks, get this movie. I never saw it at the cinema - too bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little disappointed with this....","review":"If you want to know the plot, watch the movie... it is great!!! Or just read the longer reviews.The only thing that I don't like about this movie, is the black and white during the fight scene at the end. I think it is crap that it is not in color. It wasn't intended to be in black and white because I saw it in Japan IN COLOR!!!!! It takes away from the art of the film and I am unpleased with it. I was expecting to see what I saw at the theatre, but it isn't same without the color. I wish they would have at least put the original version on the DVD... I guess I will have to find out if other countries have the color version.It is a fine piece of work by QT and should be able to be seen in the original version that he intended and created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uma Rocks ... Lucy Lui & Vivica Fox ain't bad either!","review":"Watched this on the recommendation of a friend -- and I liked it! Ala Quentin Tarantino - it's super violent - but it's cartoonish violence.

Monty Python meets all the Samurai movies you've ever seen.Uma, co-creator of these movies, is perfect as The Bride. Love the yello track suit, an homage to Bruce Lee. Lucy Lui - somehow this reminded me of her Ally McBeal days? Perhaps its the quietly lethal air she has about her!(some of the trivia tidbits about the conception and filming of this movie are really interesting - amazon has a compilation of much of them in the DVD listing)Kill Bill Vol. 2 has already been added to the netflix queue. (Where we finally get to see David Carradine!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this mess!","review":"I like movies such as blade and Crouching tiger... and others, but this is out there. For the record this is one of the most ultra violent, bloody,and revengeful movies that I have ever seen. It is Samurai Jack meets Charles Angel and Blade. The blood makes Jason, Halloween, Jeepers Creepers, and Aliens look tame by comparison. This movie is a super ultra-bloody, and violent. This is no way a compliment. Although the fight scene are unbelievably cool and good, I hope no one is stupid enough to let their children watch this mess. This film could have been better. The guts coming out is over the top. I got the point that the guy had to die."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hell Of A Move!","review":"Kill Bill, man what a great movie it was!

The one point made in this trash is that witnessing extreme violence damages the viewer. In this film tarentino seeks to do this to his viewers (and the weak minded will accept it. Sadly these films all end up in the hands of kids.) Not really about revenge, it takes as much or more delight in the torture of innocent people .

After watching full movie, I didn't understand why the assassins were trying to kill her in the first place.

However, upon viewing this film, my thoughts regarding the perverse liberal mores of today were merely confirmed. It becomes evident, quite clearly, that Quentin Tarantino is a Democrat, something which I find quite unacceptable. I was highly disgusted by the utter lack of violence in this film, but was somewhat pleased by it. His political stances are evident, if not elucidated to a great extent, in this film. Take for example the particular scene in which the woman decides to attack the other woman; only a tree-hugging liberal would contrive such a lascivious scene. In summation, however, I would recommend this film, as it is highly entertaining and a delight for the entire family.

Tarantino said he made one film, but it was too long, so he cut it in half, but you still pay the price for a whole movie. Entirely not worth it! Don't waste your money on this or on part 2.

The anime segments done properly had the potential for a bit of creativity.

Uma Thurman is great and, while unbelievably super, is convincing enough for you to forget that it is impossible to face down, say, 40 sword- and mace-wielding contract killers in a go. Indeed, Thurman is as beautiful as ever, and this time deadly.Recommended. Just keep the barf bag nearby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill Bill... wait, kill me first please..","review":"I understand that many people love Quentin Tarantino's work. However, I do not see it at all. Kill Bill was plain stupid. The movie was interesting in the beginning where the chicks fight but it gets old. The movie turns into a cartoon which I do not understand at all. Did they not have enough money to preform these actual stunts so they drew them up?I understand the story of getting revenge since she was left for dead on her wedding day but it was not enough to keep my attention.Kill Bill left me wanting her to kill me so the movie could finally be over with. If you are a Tarantino fan then most likely this movie will be for you. I don't like lots of pointless action scenes, they don't impress me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"My opinion of the movie has somewhat mellowed since the last few days after seeing Kill Bill. Still, after mellowing, I find the movie distasteful. The only thing that keeps me from rating this movie even lower is the excellent cinematography and the extremely well done fight scenes (alright, alright, the whole spurting blood thing was funny), and the insanely cool character GoGo. I understand that its a parody of many movies and has got lots of influences, blah blah blah, but all in all, it was a huge corny ball of weirdness. This movie is SO overdramatized, and sometimes the script and the dialogue makes me want to hurle. During most of the movie, it felt like Tarantino was trying REALLY REALLY hard to make a live action movie based on an anime or something. Makes my head hurt just thinking about this movie. But hey, don't let this review stop you from watching this trippy film. If you like watching skinny blond girls who speak bad japanese wave swords around, go ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say, rip off?","review":"To say that Tarrantino pays \\"loving tribute\\" to grindhouse cinema, Hong Kong action flicks and spaghetti Westerns is an incorrect statement. He doesn't pay tribute to anything, he basically RIPS OFF scenes, music, and camera shots from a score of classic movies in the above mentioned genre's.It's not new, it's not refreshing and it's not original, it's simply a hack slapping together a meddley of borrowed scenes, wrapped around his own silly story. He even copied Bruce Lee's get up from Game of death, lol.How can you really blame him though? These days ripping off and rehashing old movies is a common and well accepted practice in a Hollywood so painfully devoid of creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential","review":"KILL BILL has a weak storyline, and next to nothing character development. That in itself is enough to make you steer clear of this film. KILL BILL relies on violence and unusual killings to try and pull you in. The only saving grace of the film is the interesting camera work, but I very much doubt that this film will become a cult classic like earlier films from Quentin Tarantino.The very best part of the film was when it ended. Let's just hope that Volume 2 never sees the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"This film was so bad that after 5 minutes, even the guys in our group were groaning.

If anyone thinks that this is a good film you must not have a very high moral standing. We are becoming an ever more and more violent country and these films really help that cause. This film should not be viewed by anyone who is mentally disturbed. It will just add another nail in someones coffin. Tarantino should be ashamed to make films like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie. Terrible DVD","review":"Exactly. Kill Bill vol. 1 itself is a great action flick. It's extremely gorey and violent to almost a comedic extent at times but for fans of martial arts movies or Tarantino, it will not disappoint. However this is, obviously a rushed DVD. There are very limited extras and since vol 2 is out in theaters, it will only be a matter of time until we see the special edition with deleted/extended scenes, and a collector's box featuring the 2 volumes together in time for christmas. Be warned that during one particular ultra violent action scene, the screen flashes from color to black and white in order to avoid the NC-17 rating. If you want to see Tarantino's film uncensored, then buy the Japanese import or wait for the next dvd release. If this doesn't bother you and you just want to see the movie you saw at the theater then pick this up. Just please don't give Miramax your money twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the best action ever","review":"Buy both to save you $$$$ !!! This epic adventure chronicles a very angry gal.

A great revenge movie, Tarantino spends the first movie of two parts showing the blunt of the bloody revenge, leaving the story to be more developed in Kill Bill Vol 2.

Most that do not like the movie dont realize it for what it is, a tribute to the great movies that dominated the 70's. the reason this movie did not recieve a 5-star rating is simply because of the lack of extras. A 20 min. making of, some music videos, and trailers from Tarantino's other movies.

All because they attacked her at her wedding and she thought that they killed the child that she was carrying that was Bill's.

The storyline and philosophy is based on Japanese samurai movies from beginning to end. But I found the violence to be unbelievably over the top for an R movie. \\"Natural Born Killers\\" is tamed by comparison. Slightly off topic but I was shocked to see someone coming in with a friend and both bringing their 4 kids obviously all under age of 10 to watch it; oh the baby was there too and we all sat in the first three rows of the theatre.To the reviewer who thought it trumps every samurai movie ever made, I seriously doubt it but in terms of sheer violence, blood, and gore I think it has. Also to the same reviewer, anime can be ultr-violent but that is not the norm; I don't think most societies are as obsessed with simulated violence as Americans are.Although as an adult I kind of liked the movie; but the excessive violence was a major turnoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarantino...

They were great movies... but this movie is an imitation of Sergio Leone\\\\Ennio Morricone work. There is no vision here... In fact what tarantino has done is work backwards. Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns were inspired by Japanese films amongst many things. Here, Tarantino turns a spaghetti Western back into a Samurai tale. There are scene for scene shots from 'Good, Bad and the Ugly' and that makes me angry.Its an entertaining film but Tarantino is just ripping Sergio a new one... Kill Bill Vol II and Inglorious Basterds aswell.Then there is the homage to B-grade movies ahem ahemand the manga derived animation... as if we've been hiding under a rockHas he devoted his life to resurrecting other people's work.He gets the big bucks for this?

The over the top violence was obviously taken from Japanese director Miki (Dead or Alive, Ichi the Killer etc..) I'm giving 4 stars for the creativity and the homage to asian filmaking. If you liked this movie then do yourself a favor and check out the japanese and chinese directors and the films that KILL BILL is referencing...

A simple revenge based film, with admittedly good choreography, but unrealistic battles and a general poor filmEveryone also seems insistent that Tarentino is a genius.

As ususal, he tells the story in a series of plots which relate to a larger theme. The problem is that at times the plots are not in sequence. This leads to some confusion on the part of the audience. Combine this with the undeveloped background of the characters and the audience is left with too many questions. There is a humorous element in the premise of a bride (unnamed) who is exacting revenge with a Katana sword, sort of like Bride Magazine meets Highlander, but overall it is a silly unbelievable plot with little redeeming value. Some good sword techniques if you are into the Martial Arts though. I understand Volume 2 will be out soon and will explain some of the things which were left out in this version of the story. Maybe someone who sees it will fill me in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled.

Get a clue, Quentin.) Later, during the anime sequence, a young girl hides under the bed while her mother and father are brutally, graphically slaughtered. Ha, ha... am I supposed to laugh now?

After seeing it my premonitions proved correct. Kill Bill has nothing to offer in comparison to a whole lot of other violent movies. Everything I liked about the previous films of Tarantino was missing. Intelligent plot and humor, very good acting, characters with depth, and I could go on, were all missing. The whole movie was a big cliché. Tarantino probably did that on purpose, but then still intentional boring clichés are still boring. Not to say that KB is not well made in a technical sense. It's just not the special film that we all know Tarantino can make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daring? Brilliant?

I simply could not be more sick of violence; it bothers me, and carries no \\"entertainment\\" value whatsoever. Give me Dances with Wolves, Farenheit 9/11, Forrest Gump or Field of Dreams anyday.

I kept waiting and waiting for things to work... but they never did. The film has absolutely NO tension (in fact because the movie is told in Tarantino style out of order, we know that Lucy Liu's character has already been killed previous to that segment's beginning). The main character is herself an assassin who murders a Vivica Fox's character, and then threatens her young daughter over the body... which is to say that The Bride is shown as a complete moral vacuum, who has NO standing for judgement of others.

It is just not necessary. This film rocks! Total over the top mayhem but with style and real suspense. It really takes skill to do a good action flick as can be evidenced by the ton of crap out there. But Quentin has mastered it. I just love this film and Uma is sooo hot. She is way hotter than those bimbos Paris, Britney, Christina, Electra and Pamela combined. She has heart and it is her heart that made this film the classic that it will be known as. I cared about The Bride through the whole film and fought with her in every battle. One of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen.

It's a heavy kung-fu action flick that attempts to outdo all other kung-fu and action flicks. It's extremely bloody; well past the point of being ridiculous.Overall, the music, directing and cinematography are perfect. They are the only things that keep this movie alive.While Tarantino's writing hasn't gotten worse, per-se, it's just not up to par. The dialog is good, not great. The story is fairly routine. And, except for the girl with the ball and chain, the characters are not particularly memorable. I didn't find myself identifying with, liking, or even rooting for any of them.Unfortunately, even the best production and effects can't make up for a weak backbone. Quentin calls this his \\"4th movie\\" during the intro. Maybe he should stick with that count but include True Romance and scrap this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as his others...but still a must have!","review":"i really give this one 4.5 stars especially for uma thurman's performance. she is killer (literally) in this movie! the 70's styling of the movie was okay but a bit unbelievable. still some great fight scenes and a sick storyline. a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full DVD Not Here","review":"The full unedited movie was released on DVD in Japan not here. jbox.com is a good place to buy it if you have a region free player.Movie 5 starsDVD 4 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie: 4.25/5 Picture Quality: 4.25~5/5 Sound Quality: 4.5/5 Extras: 1.75/5","review":"Version: U.S.A / Miramax / Region A, B, CMPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / High Profile 4.1Running time: 1:50:43 (U.S Cut)Movie size: 31,48 GBDisc size: 36,01 GBAverage video bit rate: 30.06 MbpsLPCM Audio English 4608 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 16-bit / 4608kbpsDolby Digital Audio English 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbpsDolby Digital Audio French 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbpsSubtitles: English SDH / Chinese / Japanese / French / Korean / SpanishNumber of chapters: 20* The Making of KILL BILL Volume 1* THE \\"5, 6, 7, 8'S\\" Musical Performances* Tarantino Trailers: \\"Reservoir Dogs,\\" \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" \\"Jackie Brown,\\" \\"Kill Bill: Volume 1\\" bootleg trailer, Kill Bill\\" Volume 2 teaser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate slaughtering movie!","review":"Tarantino is without no doubt the master of violence movies!Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are classics. He can also write interesting stories and create terrific characters.You don't need many words to descripe Tarantino's new movie.Blood, violence, battles and revenge are good ones. Uma Thurman is an excelent choice for main role because she can play very killer and revenger roles. If you like terrific fighting acts and don't fear to see ultimate violence then I recommand Kill Bill vol.1 for you. The most intering part of this movie is bloody animation in the middle of the film. It looks like Japanes manga cartoon! Lucy Liu makes a fine and short visit on Kill Bill vol. 1 before her time has come...Tarantino almost made a classic movie but not enough because there is too much fight and too less plot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Say it ain't so Quint!","review":"I'm not a professional movie critic but atleast I know a piece of crap when I see it. Any critic that gave this turd a high rating has got to have there head so far up quint's @$$ that they need a flashlight to write their review. I love all quint's movies (this is the exception). All of his flicks are great with witty dialogue and gorey action scenes. But this one was such a disappointment it almost brought me to tears. I felt I should say my piece and let everyone know not to be misguided by critics or any fanboys that say this is a great movie. Hey I like quint's flicks but atleast I can be objective and not come off as some fart sucking fanboy. Jeez!! THIS MOVIE SUCKED! But I still think Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors ever! I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the scene with Sonny Chiba. Other than that the movie was pretty bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing-- I can't wait for VOL 2","review":"This movie was amazing. The music, the diologue, the action, everything. It is Quentin Tarrentino at his best. There is an amazing animated sequence which is fantastic. However, this movie is not for everyone. It is violent, but most of the violence is so over the top (as it is intended) that it is comical. This is one of the best movies this year. It is well worth the $9. There is just one flaw, not enought Bill (David Carradine). But I'm sure we will see more of him in Vol 2. The movie takes hold of you from the opening sequence until the end and it leaves you wanting more. Go see it you will be amazed by what Tarrentino has accomplished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie is really dull. I saw it in the theater and wished I had a remote. Let's have a long scene where Uma Thurman pretends that she can't speak Japanese but maybe she really can even though she can't even pronounce \\"yakuza\\" correctly. Let's have this go on for five minutes and then find out that it is completely unimportant and irrelevant to the story. What fun. There's a reason those bad kung fu movies were only shown in \\"grindhouses\\" - they were crappy and very few people wanted to see them. Okay, let's be cool and say that bad is good, and pretend we're the first ever to say that things are relative. That will really show our parents, huh? This is a movie for fourteen year old boys.

WRONG!! This movie is so bad that I had to turn it off after about 45 minutes. Probably only the 3rd or 4th time I've had to do that in my life, so that's pretty bad. It is very slow-moving and boring, and it constantly strays away from the point. You have to sit through about 15 minutes of cartoon-fighting which I thought was retarded. If I wanted to watch cartoons I'd borrow my nephew's DVDs. There wasn't nearly as much fighting or violence as in his other movies (at least in the first half) but of what violence it did have sucked. And the parts where he tried to make it funny were not at all funny. They were stupid. I can't believe this movie sucked so bad! What a huge disppointment.

The pricing structure for UMD's is absolutely ludicrous. I understand the ones priced at $19.99, but that seems as if it should be the upper limit. Pricing discs for $29.99 for a no frills UMD is unbelievable. Hopefully SONY will realize people aren't going to pay thirty dollars for a movie they already own on DVD just so they can watch it on their PSP. They will buy one or two movies as I plan to. Solely for the coolness factor. Nobody is going to own a movie collection on their PSP though, unless they are rich. Even rich people will likely be angry about being price gouged.

Apparently, neither Uma nor the deadly Viper squad is in good financial standing; they have no guns and they must settle the score by swordfight. yay...VIOLENCE: Children should not be watching this movie. There are numerous scenes of deaths and decapitations. In one scene, she pulls an eye out of one man's eye socket.SEX: None except a rape scene.

The fight scenes (albeit bloody) are amazingly entertaining, and the characters are enjoyable. Some of the dialogue is a bit dry (\\"Silly rabbit, trix are for kids) but they do fit the scene. It has comic relief in there right when it is needed. Uma Thurman gives a wonderful leading lady performance as she takes out her various former associates who attempted to kill her, ultimately leading up to the point where she will kill Bill, the head of the organization, known as DIVAS (Deadly Viper Assasination Squad.)

This watch is understated enough, yet because of the polished stainless steel bracelet and diamond markers, it looks more expensive than it really is. It's a \\"diver\\" style watch but elegant looking enough to wear with your career outfits and dresses, yet sporty enough to wear casually.

To my surprise I would have thought it would have included a bit more, either in booklets, pics, or any other bonus. And especially for the price.The songs posted here though on Amazon are totally different than what has actually been released in stores. I was disappointed to say the least it did not include the purple medley, Erotic City, Alternate versions, nor \\"Live\\" versions as the CD itself states.Also as many here have already said it also is missing many other \\"Hits\\" and rare and out of print mixes and/*or extended versions which would have easliy been a third disc to include in this set.If you can find a copy of it rather than the first \\"best Of\\" than by all means snap it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince CD","review":"I had to buy this to replace a cd that was broken by a friends player.

The way this is laid out though is confusing at best:Disc 1 seems to be for the mid-range fan and it makes sense that they would choose the single edits though some of those chosen are questionable. (\\"My Name is Prince\\"? His take on \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\" when Sinead O'Connor's is definitive?) Disc 2 compiles 12\\" mixes and remixes and similar rarities..i.e. for the diehard only who has to have every little bleat His Purpleness ever records.BOTTOM LINE:This is haphazardly thrown together. Middle range fans are better off withThe Hits/The B-Sideswhich compiles his biggest chart stuff with a pretty decent selection of interesting flip side material (some of which equals his singles)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince's Review","review":"Outstanding & unique are two of the words that come to mind when you're talking about Prince.

It's worth buying since I'm glad to hear these mixes and long versions on a disc. Most of these songs were not released in cd form, but only in vinyl format. The first disc (Disc 1) is something a Prince fan would have already... so, it's no big deal. Overall, get this cd if you're into Prince's long versions, which are cool to hear since the longer it plays, the FUNKIER it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate?

The extended mix of 'Anotherloverholenyohead'? How about the extended mix of 'Irresitible B***h'? Not here!!! And I'm just scratching the surface!

It must lead to an interesting round robin of the promised 'repair of replace at our option' between consumer and manufacturer. Why would you not want to confirm oven temps above 440?

If it is clipped to a rack it can't be read. Hang it sideways... can't read it. Hang it facing the door... you can't read it. Lay it on the bottom rack (which I ended up doing) and it's readable but very difficult to read.

Many of the characters are prison escapees on the run from the cops, and the atmosphere of clammy, running panic reminded me of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS(!) The chador cleverly serves a dual purpose here: symbol of oppression, but also much needed cover from the pod-like pursuit by the law.

Sorry Davies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A world of wonders, truly.","review":"Frankly, I regard \\"Fifth Business\\" as the best book I have ever read, of any sort. Never have I read a book as fresh, as inventive, as rich in creating its own world, its own spell. \\"The Manticore\\" and \\"World of Wonders\\" suffer slightly in comparison, but still the trilogy ranks as a high point of imaginative literature in the English language in the 20th century. Never will I forget Dunstan Ramsay's obsession with saints, or with Mary Dempster, to his mind the most perfect of saints; never will I forget the story of how Paul Dempster, uneducated carny and abused child, was tempered like a bottle in the smoke to become Magnus Eisengrim, the magnificent, the nonpareil. Davies creates a magic world here, one I think most readers will not be able to resist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep and moving","review":"Even though this is technically three books, it reads as one, in fact I couldn't imagine reading any of them by itself. Reading only one simply wouldn't give you the depth. The characters in this book are quite well done, Davies has a gift of showing even ordinary characters as interesting, and throughout the trilogy he constantly shines a light on new and hidden qualities of all the characters. He is not an action oriented writer though, so if you are looking for a page turner you best look elsewhere. But if you're looking for intelligent yet accessible writing this set really gives the goods. Of the three books, The Manticore and World of Wonders fare the best, deep yet they still move forward at a steady pace. Fifth Business is good as well, but since this has to pack all the information that you need for the next two books, it loses a bit of its focus along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely read","review":"This is usually considered Robertson Davies' masterpiece; I once heard Atom Egoyan (in an interview with NPR) describe \\"Fifth Business\\" as the Canadian Bible, \\"a holy book, and sacrilege to criticize.\\" I for one don't actually get all the hype; and its ur-Jungian underpinnings utterly lose me. I do find \\"Fifth Business\\" enthralling as a story, though its philosophical and mythic resonances slip right past me. (Compare this to John Irving's \\"A Prayer For Owen Meaney,\\" which it shares some resemblances.) \\"The Manticore\\" and \\"World of Wonders\\" similarly lose me, but I did appreciate Davies' flirtations with the fantastic, while remaining grounded in the entirely real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it before and it is still just as good","review":"Robertson Davies is a master story teller.

The first book was by far the richest, but I think that the other two were very necessary to fill out the story and give a more balanced perspective on the characters.

If you can't read standard notation music then you're strumming back-up; the good news is that it does offer some variety of 'chord voicings' -- ie; you can play a \\"G\\" like this, like this, or like this... which is good, the back-up playing has some variation -- so two stars for that, but if the book says \\"music and tablature\\" on the cover, I expect some tablature.It's a bit like a really cute but unpleasantly violent kitten.

Since I was coloring the Victorian Houses adult coloring book, I soon knew why. The detail I was able to achieve with these coloring the trim and such, I could never have done with the regular crayons. Since these are the first time I've used these for such a project I can't compare them to other coloring pencils I've used in the past since I've never needed this sort of detail with color pencils. My only regret is that I didn't buy the 48 color box since I could have gotten 2x as much for only 10 more bucks. Sometimes while coloring I wish I had more color variations of red, beige and orange including a grey. I imagine everything I've been wanting is in the 48 box. Overall, very good pencils.

Very informative and a must have for all Mustang lovers despite its short commings. One big problem is that there are not enough stats(hp,torque,0-60,etc...).

I was drawn to the film because of my interest in early Veronica Lake.And delighted as I was by her unmistakable presence in the film (the scenes with her doing sleight of hand are magical--no pun--to behold), it is Alan Ladd in his screen debut who steals the show as the cold-blooded assassin Raven. For a debut performance his characterization is not only convincing but a tour de force. Two early scenes alone a worth the price of admission. In one scene Raven is both sympathetic, offering milk to a stray cat, and violent, slapping the cleaning lady who mistreats the cat. In another, he contemplates killing an innocent girl who might be a witness to one of his crimes. Chilling, because for a moment his look and bearing make the spectator believe such cold-bloodedness is possible.There is also a fine performance by Laird Cregar as the conniving night club owner Willard Gates."},{"rating":"2","title":"LADD'S ITCHY FINGER'S ON THE TRIGGER","review":"Great title and Ladd at his best in a dark drama of love and hate, life and death.Underrated director Frank Tuttle directs Alan Ladd and Veronica lake (and her amazing hair) in what is now considered a classic film noir.Set in San Francisco during World War II, Philip Raven (Ladd) is a cold-blooded hired killer. He's hired to murder a chemist in possession of Nitrochemical Corporation's formula for poison gas, which he is using to blackmail the Los Angeles-based company. Raven kills Baker and his secretary after retrieving the formula, and is paid $20,000 by Willard Gates, an executive for Nitrochemical. But Gates registers the numbers on the bills with the police and claims Raven robbed Nitrochemical. The story explodes in a desperate double hunt for survival and revenge.

Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the other Ladd/Lake film noir features","review":"This movie starts out good, but the plot gets chaotic and boring.

The weird plot about nasty billionaires selling poisoned gas to the Japanese during world war 2 cranks along, and one second after a character exits a door we hear a car drive off at speed - this is carrying damatic convention a tad too far.

Brought back the travel bug...Actually the most intriguing part of their story is the part I did not do, e.g. leaving an established life with apartment, jobs, family expectations, etc... The realization that the risk of leaving everyting for 'the trip' and regretting it later, is nothing compared with not going and then regret not having gone. This is when you know, you have to go. You can get a lot more philosophical about this issue than F&H; ever did in their book, but it makes for good reading, so I could have had more of it.Apart from that, the only thing missing from this inspiring story were a few decent maps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EASY","review":"EASY, FAST, THIS WAS A PRODUCT THAT I HAD A HARD TIME FINDING.

I have used other pastels that did not have the brilliant and sharp colors that Crayola has. They also smear easily for blending. Included in this pack is metalic gold and silver. They are soft enough to use as oils should be, but hard enough not to mush or break. Nice color assortment as well. Works well on black, white, manilla, and many other colors of paper. These are good for any age. I am 37 and I use them for my own personal artwork. The price is great, too. And, be sure to buy here from Amazon.com, as these run out in stores very quickly!Thanks,Tiff"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"Pros: The price is great!!!

I only got these thanks to the great reviews. We compared these to more expensive oil pastels such as Faber Castell and Pentel, and these are great! The others we've tried are a little bit softer, but also much more fragile and small. I'm not an artist, but we do lots of art for fun. These are sturdy, larger and longer-lasting, plus they color smoothly and are great for rubbing and blending. These are ideal for children or anyone that doesn't want their pastels to break. I generally moved away from Crayola as I found nicer things, but this is a keeper! Thanks Crayola! My children love these, and I do too!

In this concert DVD the band members appear to be bored throughout the show, and the audience members stand rigidly in front of their seats clapping to the music and smiling broadly --I think their shoes were nailed to the floor. No dancin' allowed! The exception is guitarist Jody Porter, who cleverly throws in some ironic guitar-god posturing as he plays the hooks and fills. I want to tell Chris Collingwood to relax, smile from time to time, and maybe throw in some clever banter between songs. Fans will watch the DVD and enjoy the songs, but this show doesn't generate much excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure FoW","review":"This DVD is a simple performance video -- nothing fancy, no extra stuff, just pure Fountains of Wayne.

I had someone at Sephora do my makeup and she used this and my skin has never looked so good. I ended up purchasing it to see if I could create the look she did. IT IS SO EASY! I don't even have to cover up my dark spots, just spray this on, or even spray on a brush and put it on and I'm all covered up and it doesn't even look like I'm wearing makeup. I highly recommend this product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with some minor issues","review":"The DiorSkin Airflash Spray Foundation is an excellent product. It provides good coverage and a very smooth, even finish. I would recommend to spray the foundation on a brush and use it that way, rather than actually airbrushing directly to the face. The product comes out of the can fairly forcefully and may create a mess around the hairline. I have not yet been brave enough to try that. Sprayed onto a foundation brush and then applied to the face works very well. The shade is slightly darker than most other \\"lightest\\" shades I have tried, so if you are very fair, it may be a little bit too beige. It just about works for me if I apply the product sparingly. I would definitely buy this again, it is a great foundation product and my dry skin tolerates it very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy glow","review":"After reading the positive reviews and tips about this foundation, I decided to try it. I'm glad I did, but also a little sad. Sad because it's NOT cheap and now that I've tried it, I just can't go back to using another foundation! It takes the red out of my skin and gives it a dewy, even glow. It's never cakey and doesn't settle into my lines. As others have said, use a brush and it will blend perfectly every time. Also, when spraying onto the brush, use quick little bursts, apply then spray another quick burst if needed. It really doesn't take much and you don't want to waste any. I probably wear this foundation 4 days a week, (in order to make it last longer). I really don't care about looking \\"flawless\\" when I'm running errands or working out! For those days, I just wear a tinted moisturizer (Sonia Kashuk from Target, is an excellent one).Almost forgot-this foundation does not make me break out as have many I've tried and it's a bit cheaper on Amazon than at Nordstrom's."},{"rating":"1","title":"This make up accentuates lines you never knew you had","review":"I had my make-up done by a make-up artist at Dior, excellent make-up artist by the way, however this makeup is not for anyone who tends to have dry skin.

I am a singer and novice piano player who is madly in love with the music from Les Miserables.

I found that while the sound quality was good, the set up was not easy. The description sounds pretty simple: \\"set the transmitter & a stereo to the same fm frequency\\". Problem is there are only 5 or 6 frequencies that it works on. Also, they don't tell you is that in order to set the frequency, you have 3 LITTLE switches on the side. You need the little paper \\"manual\\" to tell you which switch goes where (up/down) to set it to a specific radio station. Of the frequency choices, there was only 1 that didn't have a station on it. Then as I traveled, I would lose that frequency and have to stop and reprogram the unit.Listening to spoken word the sound is good, I have not used it for music so can't say how the sound quality is.Would I buy it again?

Supposedly once Canada's most promising MC, Choclair has regressed into a world where money, women, and cars are the order of the day - \\"Let's Ride\\" is a prime example of this mentality. Choclair's misogynistic words have done nothing to endear him to feminists such as urban scribe Liz Mendez Berry. After striking out with both this album and Kardinal Offishall's \\"Firestarter...\\", it's seemingly up to Saukrates to see whether or not the acclaim heaped upon their collective (The Circle) is well-deserved or self-promotion.

I don't think so.","review":"I've been reading about the buzz on Choclair and actually heard some of his earlier material like \\"21 Years\\" years ago which is mad nice. However, his debut Ice Cold is not at all reminiscent of his material when he was unsigned. On the majority of the tracks all he's doing is trying to pick-up and \\"hit\\" hotties---all that juvenile stuff that most rappers talk about. The beats on \\"Rubbin'\\", the title track and Bare Witness (featuring Guru) are pretty hot, but no self-respecting hip hop head can say that this guy is saying anything relevant lyrically about where he comes from (Toronto) or anything for that matter. The interlude (i.e. \\"Intro\\", \\"Kardi's PSA\\") are just plain stoopid 'cause all he's doing is boasting about his sexual prowess and disrespecting women in the process. This album's a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choclair like chocolate is so sweet","review":"I am very hesitant to give any album 5 stars, but this cd certainly deserves it. It captures the essence of undergound rap, espescially with the smooth flowing beats. What I like the most is that every song on the cd is good. Most good rap cds have at least 5 good songs, but every single song is up to par at a great quality.

I am much more empowered and prepared now that i have read it. i am disappointed in some of the content. one thing in particular was the section on circumcision. it was extremely n narrow minded and poorly written. if you are planning this procedure for your son you can skip that little excerpt and do your own research. In the section about breast feeding it was mentioned that best feeding was to extensive of a subject for this book and should be research on the side, the same should have been said about circumcision. it is not a one sided issue. other than that which really upset me i loved this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book- so important for any expectant mother to read!","review":"I owe my entire natural childbirth and delivery to this book. I was calm, collected and centered. I never once had fear or uncertainty, because of the techniques I learned in this book. My labor was smooth, consistent and the baby was born less than 45 minutes after ARRIVING at the birthing center! I really enjoyed the techniques that it teaches you WHILE you're pregnant, to prepare for labor. The pain coping techniques, the breathing, the positions and stretches. I felt completely prepared for labor and delivery and it relieved any anxiety I had about pregnancy. I would buy this book for every pregnant mother I know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE revise the Kindle Version","review":"This was a great book but the Kindle version had so many errors it was difficult to read at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful at all","review":"Having already decided on a home birth with a wonderful midwife, I thought this book would offer support and insight. It offered neither. Instead it was full of cheese, schlock, and banal attempts at commercialized spirituality, all while directly contravening much of what I've learned from my midwife and doula. A total waste of time and money. Stick with Ina May."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took the Class","review":"I read through the first few chapters of this book while I was taking the class that is based upon this book \\"Birthing from the Heart\\" (Lewisville, TX). I stopped reading the book because I realized that I was getting ahead of the class in what we were learning. There are a lot of wonderful techniques that you can learn from this book, as well as learn about how you feel about having the baby and your relationship with others. The book seems to focus on you as a woman and your becoming a mother...in a traditional sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"a repeat of Creative Childbirth","review":"I loved Creative Childbirth for my first and used it and Better Birthing with Hypnosis for my 2nd . I received ' Within 'for a gift . Liked it but other two had all I needed plus fantastic audio tapes. A good runner up but birth art in Creative and Better Birthing much more healing This is agood runner up to first two Linda"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"So, for those of you interested in creating art projects and then attempting to find meaning in them, buy this book. I'm sure there is nothing really wrong with the book, but it doesn't appeal to me at all. I am not interested in such things personally. I would love birth stories, scientific information, etc. I love Ina May Gaskin's books on birthing. This just isn't what I thought it would be. Maybe I should have trusted some of the other reviewers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Zen...","review":"I think that studying birth, learning focused relaxation, using biblical imagery like lying down in green pastures, is better than blanking out one's mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has good points but...","review":"This book has a lot of good ideas and good points, but a caution to first-time moms: despite being a birth attendant herself, the author ended up with a c-section with her first child, and I felt that the whole book had the feel of 'here is a wonderful, beautiful journey...and it has a high probability of ending in surgery.' I know you can't discount all the information because of this, but I also think you have to go into natural childbirth 100% sure that is what you want, that it is safe and healthy and the best option. The author also admits that she almost didn't include the chapter on home birth...which is such an important yet overlooked option. If you already have had vaginal birth(s) then I would definitely recommend this book! It's just hard for first-timers when the book plays into that fear of whether your body can actually successfully birth a baby or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly not very useful","review":"Wow, given all the positive reviews for this book I put it on my must read list. I read the first few chapters then started flipping to see if there was better material coming, there wasn't. The emphasis on this book is on the spiritual and emotional. They lost me at the \\"birth art\\" section. Sorry, I'm not pulling out my Crayolas to draw a picture and better understand my fears about birth. I'm also not overly interested in a bunch of individual birth stories or feeling connected with every mother in the world. There must be plenty of people out there this book appeals to given the high rating, but if you're looking for a fact based, practical book this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent, but mystical","review":"If you are not into meditation and visualization, this is not the birth prep book for you. Although incredibly helpful as a supplement to the Birthing From Within courses, on its own it's not as helpful. I did enjoy the information from various cultures, and how they variously approach the childbirth process, but the actual hands-on techniques (birth art, breathing exercises, etc.) seemed like they'd be more effective in a group class setting. It did reinforce the most powerful advice my childbirth educator ever gave me: that women everywhere, in myriads of situations, have given birth- and you can, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best on subject so far","review":"I'm expecting my first child, and have purchased and read many, many books on the subject of birth. This is the best by far. I read it in one day, and plan to go through it several more times before delivery.The mind and the emotions control hormones, and hormones control pregnancy and delivery-- this book addresses issues and feelings that might interfere with a healthy birth.I really liked the author's voice and attitude. She is unique and her perspectives quite holistic; yet she does not alienate anyone. No one reading this will feel judged for their birth choices, but instead empowered and supported."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlocking the Mystery","review":"As an expecting parent for number 4(!) there remained a number of mysteries as to why the earlier births were so protracted. This book answered many of them and provides a great insight into overcoming and embracing \\"you\\" as part of the birthing process.Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gave me inspiration","review":"I had no idea how how to go about my laboring with my first pregnancy. This book was given to me by a friend, and now I want to go as natural as possilbe. It gives you the strength to take back your labor, and not let the medical staff tell you what is best for you. A GREAT read for mother and birth partners."},{"rating":"2","title":"After reading, my photography improved","review":"I never considered myself an artist, but I noticed how much my pregnancy and birth photography improved after I read this book. This book helped the creativity in me to blossom. In turn, the creativity lead me to having much more fun with expressing my next pregnancy through artistic photogrpahy. No more boring belly shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Tell You In A Month","review":"We took the BFW preparation classes so we had to get this book. While some of the ideas seem a little wishy washy on the whole I think the general philosophy of the book is good. Some useful ideas for bonding with the child before they are even born, examining your own birth, the section for partners was definitely helpful as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"If you want a book that gives you many wonderful prompts for artfully exploring your fears and desires regarding an impending birth then GET THIS BOOK. It's probably exactly what you want.That was not what I was looking for. I didn't feel any better prepared after reading it than before. I don't need to explore my fears. I am a worrier by nature and I really don't need any more help confronting all the things that could go wrong. I especially don't need to bring them to life with colored pencils.Ina May's Guide to Childbirthmade me feel empowered and excited about giving birth naturally and I would recommend it before this title.Also, the Kindle version, as of this date, is FULL of typos and text anomalies."},{"rating":"2","title":"good advice in general","review":"this book contains hands on on exercises of drawing and self-reflecting about birth.

I read \\"Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way\\" and \\"Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Newborn\\" before reading this book, and it doesn't even come close to being as informative as the other two. It doesn't give much detail on the actual process of birth. It's mostly just imagery and art projects. The only useful part to me was about identifying what your real fears or hangups about birth are. The rest of it was way too touchy feely for me, and the advice amounted to \\"follow your instincts\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird Birthing Book","review":"Very \\"new age\\" hippy-like birthing book. Had some useful information, but had to filter through the preachy, biased, and over-the-top spiritual and artistic junk to get anything out of it. Skimmed 150 pages, read about 15 pages, and am ready to \\"retire\\" this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave me an unneeded guilt trip in the labor room. Boo!","review":"I was very excited about this book and read it in earnest during my third trimester. The \\"art\\" sections were superfluous; I sought tangible advice for \\"labor day\\". Once in labor, my midwife respected my wishes not to be \\"offered\\" an epidural, but the attitude of this book caused me to delay my request for an epidural by 3-4 hours. My only regret in labor was that I let this book make me feel guilty about getting an epidural. After the epidural, my remaining labor/delivery was very pleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend this book","review":"I did not read more than a few pages. This book was \\"out there.\\" The ideas of how birth is in and how medical staff are in the hospital; I find hard to believe. I am not having a baby at home. Drugs are not \\"terrible\\" for pain control. I wanted tips on handling the beginning pains before the epidural and how to have a healthy birth. This book was a waste of money and time. I didn't even waste my time finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Howling like a coyote???????? No thank you!","review":"First off, this was honestly one of the scariest reads ever. It put me in the mind of a \\"hippy-esque cult\\" type of deal. A majority of the book focuses on being creative through mediums such as drawing, painting, and sculpting. I'm completely for spirituality, creativity and natural childbirth, but being a first time mom, I have a feeling that all the spiritual and creative mumbo jumbo thrown at me in this book is just setting me up for the ultimate rude awakening when I actually go into labor. And if howling like a coyote will benefit me in any way, I seriously doubt it. I, being a free-thinker and very openminded, could find very little useful in this book. Even though I've been thrust into the category of a \\"hippie\\" my whole life, this puts me more in mind of a cult!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big waste of money!","review":"I regret wasting my money and time on this book. I have read everything that I could get my hands on during pregnancy and this book was absolutely useless. For a natural birth, I highly recommend Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way."},{"rating":"1","title":"really weak","review":"Did not like this at all. Did not even finish the book. If you are a hippy you will probably like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I found this book pretty useless. A lot of it deals with \\"birth art,\\" which seems like it would be useful for someone who had a previous traumatic birth experience, but that's not me, so I found the excessive birth-art stories & examples irrelevant. A few of the pain-management techniques are good, but nothing you won't see elsewhere (or can't figure out for yourself). I'm not exactly sure why this book is so popular, and after reading it, I'm very glad I didn't sign up for a course based on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"birthing from within is a bit biased","review":"While the first few chapters of this book are amazing (encouraging artistic expression to help with birth and labor), the rest of the book feels like propaganda for anti-hospital/medicated births, often telling frightening stories and sharing scary artwork about hospital/medicated births. I was hoping it would be something that would give me peace of mind rather than attempting to make me feel frightened by doctors, hospitals, medication, nurses, etc ... If you plan to have a birth that involves the safety of a hospital, this book probably isn't right for you, as it uses mild fear tactics to try and lure you out of that decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a practical approach to labor","review":"I am totally on board with the idea of having a \\"natural\\" childbirth. However, I'm pretty sure it's not something that happens as easily as people want you to believe. I picked up this book looking for ways to manage pain and understand the birthing process and gain some confidence about going through labor without drugs if possible. I don't find birth stories and artwork to be useful in that regard. I also don't find it helpful to read books that make you afraid of your doctor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spiritual and Educational Work of Art!","review":"\\"Birthing From Within\\" has something for everyone: practical advice for first-time pregnancies, things you ought to know (that you won't be told at the obstetrician's office), nutrition guidelines, and post-birth information on becoming a family.The information on pain-techniques and birthing techniques is something I haven't run across in the many books I've read on childbirth. There are worksheets and reminder cards and wonderful ideas for creating birth art (even if you don't think you're artistically inclined)!This book is creative enough not to be lumped in with the generic mainstream birthing books which basically ignore the spiritual side of birthing. It manages to balance the practical advice with the information that makes you cry, ponder, and look forward to the powerful experience of childbirth. This is a GREAT read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to start.","review":"Although I don't agree with all aspects of Ms. England's philosophy of birth, I still highly recommend this book to friends who are just beginning to look into the benefits of natural birth. She brings birth back into the sacred space that traditional obstetrical care dismisses, offers a fresh perspective on pain management, and takes a well-researched and matter-of-fact look at the pros and cons of routine interventions. There are very few books on birth out there that do not cater to the medical establishment's limited view of what birth can and should be. This is one of them, and for that reason alone is worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"After all of the information I got bombarded with as a pregnant woman, this was the first thing that I read that made me feel really inspired and empowered in having my baby. This book lets the reader know how special and universal it is to go through becoming a mother, being pregnant and the process of labor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for every expecting mother","review":"This book is very informative when it comes to discovering your inner strength to birth your baby. It encourages women to search within themselves to gain the strength to birth their baby they way they want to do it. There is not just one way to give birth-pitocin, epidural, episiotomy. You can choose a different way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move beyond breathing and biology","review":"This book is amazing! I am a 2-time Bradley graduate, and while I think biology lessons and breathing techniques can be helpful, this book helps you look within to find out what YOU need to birth YOUR baby. The answer is uniquely different for each of us. The authors do not try to tell you what it is. Rather than professors, they act as guides, helping you look into your own heart, mind, and past experiences. You make the discoveries, you win the information you are seeking, you are in control. It is a very empowering journey! They do offer practical information, like biology and pain-management techniques, and it is good information. One of the pain management techniques was a sanity-saver at my last birth. Still, there is also a lot more to this book.Get this book, and read it. You won't be sorry. Happy birthing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too thin.","review":"The package arrived very quickly.

Stop listening to those meatheads with degrees who claim evolution is how it happened. This is a beautiful book that lets you peek over Mary's shoulder on her sneak peek of Heaven. Better than a Near Death Experience (NDE); and all according to Scripture; just as you knew heaven would be. Mary K. Baxter takes us along with her from the time the Lord Jesus allows her to enter the \\"Pearly Gates\\" to her awesome awareness that she is standing and watching God the Father actually dispatching Angels to answer prayers from his people. Mary carries the message that all \\"heartfelt\\" prayers and tears are heard and \\"captured\\".

However, in light of the fact that everyone who believes in Heaven already knows that it is paradise, her inability to provide specifics renders her account worthless. In contrast to her overall lack of specificity, Ms. Baxter is specific about one thing. She is quite definite in telling the reader that the most important thing someone can do to assure their salvation is to pay their tithes. I'm surprised that she didn't find some way to say that it would be best to pay your tithes to HER ministry.As a Christian, I find Ms. Baxter's brand of ministry to be distasteful and offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"changed","review":"it changed my ways of thinking after i read it. i was the perfect christian. eventhough afterwards i reverted back to my normal ways of thinking, but it gave a small sense of heaven in words."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Divine Revelation of Heaven","review":"I was very disappointed with the book and am returning it. This woman is clearly delusional and she just imagines what heaven would be like based on the biblical quotes in the book. It is very poorly written, repetitious and boring.

The author gives such an encountered look of what we have to come and what we have to look forward to after this life. It brings joy, hope and peace, all the fruits of the Spirit, refreshing your soul and reviving your spirit as you read through these life-giving pages of eternity in heaven. It is remarkable, captivating and a pleasure to read, a book that ministers and breathes life into the deep resources of our heart.

In the bible, Paul has seen heaven, but is not permitted to speak about it.(2 Cor 12:1-8). If the great prophet Paul was not permitted to speak about what heaven is like, what makes you think that Mary K. Baxter is permitted to do so? This is not a personal attack on Mary K.

The first part of the DVD explains how and why this program will work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"Having just turned 65, I was looking for something to help me maintain my strength and mobility which I know will slip away if I do not put some conscience effort into it. This DVD is perfect. I feel confident that her instructions and movements are safe as well as productive. Mirabai is pleasant and easy to follow. I especially like the rhythm, which for me makes it easier to keep going. It is not difficult to do the workout, yet I feel really good afterwards and I have already noticed an improvement in my posture. I have purchased some ankle weights and when I am able to do the enire leg routine with the weights on, I will move on to her strength training level 2. Thank you Mirabai."},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely for beginners only","review":"I am an active over 50 - so thought this would be good. But this video is for absolute beginners only.

He told me, in his very sexy voice \\"It's Brenton Wood's, I like the way you love me\\". He told me where I can find and it and buy it if I'd like. So I said what the hell you would think a DJ on a radio station would know what is good and what isn't. Holy Crap he was Right!!! So if you LOVE oldies as much as I do, and more so like to listen to every song on your cd, then you can bet your mone you'd enjoy this one! So thank you Mr. Tony Sandoval from HOT 95.1 FM.

It took 4 tapes to communicate 6 basic ideas. Buntman repeats these ideas, word for word, about 15 times each. The examples and analogies he uses are so simplistic that his style becomes condescending. The interview style used by the narrator and Buntman was contrived, and came across as a plug to buy the book.The ideas conveyed are good ones, but this way of communicating them was just about as irritating as it gets.

It tells Clarice's story thoroughly, with far more archive images than any other book, and great colour pictures of pieces from collectors from all over the world. The author interviewed nearly all the surviving paintresses who worked for her between 1927 and 1964 and this shows in the attention to detail about them, life in the 1930s and individual patterns they painted. There are many quotations from Clarice in the book and these give a \\"flavour\\" of her as a person. I'm prompted to write this review for newer collectors or Clarice fans who might be confused over the best book to start with, but in my opinion THIS is it, and at a very good price too.

I do not recommend using this unless you need 6 gauge wire, and this is even not quite as thick as 6 gauge.

The filter is high-quality material, and you can skip changing it for one interval.

This book which reads and feels like a massive, self-financed ego trip has plainly never been professionally edited. It is almost as if the author - a decent man I am sure - has never had an unexpressed thought in his entire life. Books need an outside set of eyes to read over them and to cut out the unnecessary and extraneous material. What may seem interesting to the author is of little or no interest to anyone else. An outside pair of eyes leads the author to the necessary self-examination to produce a worthwhile book. As it is the book reads like an exercise in self-congratulation. It is almost as if Graves, ironically a therapist himself, is still searching for a validation he hasn't found in life which is saddening given that he plainly cares about the gay community and has done more than his fair share to try to support it both in Boston and South Florida."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamite!","review":"A wonderful collection of poems.

But, when you watch birds either in flight or trying to find one in an are the field. The field of vision is way to small.The power is nice if you can hold steady on your object. But be aware the more magnification the more unsteady it becomes. If I wanted to have a pair for the glove box for an emerengy to watch a herd of elk or deer while driving and could stop by the side of the road and hold still, then these would be OK. For bird watching and even football games you need a larger lense at least 35mm or 50mm is better. This gives you more brightness and at dusk you can see much better. Dawn and Dusk 7X50 are the best. Don't get me wrong this is a great deal for holding steady on a bright day but will be disappointing for the most part in the field with limited light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small mismatch in power vs. objective diameter","review":"These binoculars are good for a hunter wanting to spot deer and judge their size from a tree stand, but only if extreme portability is a must. They would have been a bit better at only 8X to improve steadiness, as a compact bino such as this would never be used with a tripod.Make no mistake; they are not designed in any way for bird watching, as birds tend to flit around quite a bit, and the very small 26mm lens on these makes the field of view quite small, making it tough to follow moving objects."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding optics, great value","review":"The quality is outstanding, with superb image even in low light. I can easily read the numbers of license plates from 200 feet. Easy to focus and while it is very light it feels rock solid. But be warned that the eye cups are not very deep and so there is a tendency to hit the lens when one blinks. On the other hand, the Steiner specialty of eye cups shaped to block light from the sides work very well. The maginification is just right for detailed views and while there is some tendency for shake, that is not an overwhelming problem, and well worth the tradeoff. Overall, these are superb quality German made glasses, and it is amazing to get them at such a low price. These should last a lifetime and I look forward to taking them on my safari to Africa (where from past experience, light weight for glasses is essential-it is very tiring to have heavy glasses around your neck all day)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these binoculars!!!","review":"I love them!!! Saw them on sale and binoculars have been on my husband's wish list for years (I honestly never saw the need for them so when I pick things off his list for a gift they kept being passed over) so I bought them. Since Father's Day is so very far away and Amazon's return policy .....well, the less said the better, I decided to take them out and check to make sure they were okay. Okay? These are fantastic!!! I live in the middle of nowhere and I can see the deer herd move through the hills. Not only can I see them but I can now pick up little individual characteristics and tell them apart (yeah, I have no life-got a problem with that?). I watch the birds and see every little feather on their heads. Poor husband is going to get his gift and find them well broke in but a pair of Steiner binoculars will be on MY wish list soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Maybe it's just my particular pair, but I'm very disappointed with the focusing mechanism in these Steiner binoculars. The focusing knob turns very stiff & has a lot of \\"slop\\" to it, ie, when you turn the knob too far, & you start to rotate the knob back the other direction to get the precise focus, there is about 15 degrees of rotation before it actually does anything. Not very effective when trying to view fast moving objects or getting that first initial view of whatever you're looking at.I don't wear glasses, & feel that the eye cups don't extend out far enough to be effective. It feels like my eyes are practically touching the lenses to get the proper view through the binoculars.The clarity of the optics are good for the price paid, but I ended up putting these back in the box & went back to using my old Zeiss 8x20s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product","review":"I would not ever purchase this item again.

Later regretting that decision, I searched for it and after a long time found it. I bought it, expecting a thrilling read about a disturbed teenage girl. The girl, Lisa, was disturbed, but the story didn't thrill me. I learned nothing new about mental illness, except that many times even adults handle the situation like children.(which wasn't really all that new to me before, I just never thought about it) Plus, three of the four girls involved in the story had similar names: Lisa, Elizabeth, and Betsy.

The scenes were set up so clumsily that I kept on making mental notes on how I would have written them. To open up with detailed descriptions of all the main characters (and their parents!) is such a weak method of writing. What ever happened to Show Don't Tell. Things that could have been revealed through conversations were instead just listed outright. There are so many things that are poor about this book that it is extremely frustrating to read the cover declaring that over two million copies have been sold.

Her drama queen friends take it upon their teenage selves to give her some therapy. Because, of course, the parents and other adults just don't care and are willing to sacrifice a good young woman to keep their paradigm intact.Um. duh.Much like Go Ask Alice, this book glamorizes teen dysfunction and makes it seem, like, omigod, totally cool and out there. I read this as a teen and steered my own daughters away from these sort of books that portray mental illness as something adventurous or glamorous. It's not healthy.Make them read To Kill A Mockingbird instead.

Is a great novel.I would recommend this book to any teen or pre-teen.This book taught me just how important friends can be, especially when no one seems to understand or believe you.sixteen year-old Lisa Shillings had everything and almost anything. She was; popular, smart, pretty,and was dating the most popular guy in school.But Lisa wasn't so normal; she begins to develop mental illness. Her family didn't believe her; Lisa's teacher denied it. Her friends Besty Goodman, Mary Nell Fickett, and Elizabeth Frazer are the only ones who seem to be listening.Taking matters into their own hands, Lisa's friends walk with her where adults refus to go.

It is a little old fashion, compared to Cut, but very good all the same. It's about a young girl slowly losing her mind, and her friends who help her get the help she needs. It's the classic story of the parents not believing the child, and then the children must take care of the problem themselves.

However, I still feel it's an important book for teens and pre-teens to read, especially with the rise of depression in teenagers and adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"dim and dim","review":"While searching for books, I ran into this one, and by the back, it seemed highly interesting. Not to mention, it was recommended by a lover of \\"Go Ask Alice\\". Anyhow, the basic fact is that is was disappointing and unexciting. I think the most disappointing part is that it was not raw in any sense. You will not read anything you don't already know about madness. It makes you wonder if this author does in fact know anything about it. Which it seems he doesn't. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Point of View","review":"In my opinion, I simply hated this book. I'm into the whole mental illness scene, but this book was poorly written. It's not even written from Lisa's point of view. We just get to hear about her feelings and actions from the friend telling the story, Betsy. Betsy, the narrator, is concerned for her friend, yet she talks about her life too. I really didn't care about her family or about who she thought was cute. That has nothing to do with Lisa and her illness. And Lisa's parents are the most blind people, which is the point..but its hard to think someone's parent would ignore such cries out for help. Quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible.","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read.

The potiential that writing about a girl going mad is high, but there was something lacking. The characters seemed like flat little card board cut outs that give you no particular feeling when you read about them. Especially, Lisa. By the end of the book all I knew about her was what I already knew from reading the summery on the back of the book. And the story in general? There was not much to elaborate on. Girl goes slightly crazy, girl goes slightly more crazy, girl at her craziest. If your going to read a book like that, what you need is a little feeling. But this had none.

The book shows how cruel and cold a person's own parents can be because inside themselves, they are not strong enough to admit or to deal with the fact that their child really has a problem...it opened my mind and perspectives to new areas. It also opened my heart to help others, as her friends did in the book.

In the case of \\"Live In Geneva\\", while I generally agree with most of the reviews here, I was surprised to see little mention of the video quality of this DVD. It is terrible! Whether deliberate (which I doubt) or not, the image is soft and muddy. It has the appearance of something shot on video back in the 70s. It leaves your eyes fatigued from constantly trying to focus, to no avail. To add insult to injury, they constantly throw in deliberately de-focused shots and grainy black and white clips. Did they think this was \\"arty\\" or what?The video quality of this DVD was poor enough to significantly impair my ability to enjoy the concert. It would be best to leave the TV off and just listen to the audio through you sound system.

It had a nice mood synthesizer and lead guitar combo. Hawkwind had five successive top notch early albums 1970's Hawkwind, 1971's In Search of Space, 1972's Doremi Fasol Latido, 1974's Hall of the Mountain Grill, and 1975's Warrior on the Edge of Time.

The program must be downloaded to your pc & then it tell's you a bit about Dr. Nagler and how the program works. The most important thing said is that you only have to hypotize yourself once (which takes about 45 minutes) for this to work. A lot of the program is focused on relaxation techniques & then Dr. Nagler states a few affirmations and it's over. I think that I need more affirmations then the ones given.

The guy can't write. His sentences look like they've been created by a child. He lacks good judgment (if he has any at all), not to mention good taste. There are parts in this book that gave me the impression he is not very bright either.Apart from the fact that he never sold a screenplay (there are good screenwriting instructors who never even wrote one), the worse thing is that Mr. Berman is a terrible teacher. The only idea he successfully communicates is that he is the last person on planet Earth from who anyone should get advice on writing screenplays.For the sake of mercy and charity and other good qualities I like to use sometimes, I will refrain myself from commenting the included screenplay (and also the decision to publish it in there).Anyone trying to write or sell a screenplay should very actively avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books","review":"No, I have never sold a screenplay. No, I have never written a book. I am an armchair critic; and a eager reader. There are better books out there that not only touch upon the same topics, but actually are enjoyable to read.

Luckily you may read these reviews and move on to an author who will actually give you a good script to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"*I* might as well have written this book","review":"I am truly amazed that this book is in publication. Berman has literally no credentials to write such a book. In over ten years he has not even managed to *get an agent*! And this guy is supposed to tell *us* how to do it? Wow.Aside from the obvious shortcomings mentioned above, this book requires you to read an entire screenplay by the author - and it is terrible - so he can teach you his methods. Okay. His methods haven't managed to even get him as far as acquiring an agent in ten years. What in God's name could we learn from a script that can't even land a published author an agent in a decade?Under no circumstances should you waste a penny on this book. Its very existence undermines the work of others who actually have a right to author a book on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-experts, start here","review":"For non-experts who want to know the basic facts about this little-studied but central event, this is the book for you. It is precise, detailed, cleanly written. Be advised, it is also highly opinionated. The author does not hesitate to dispense blame. I happen to prefer this kind of writing, but if you do not, then stay away.Also, bring your own maps. Those provided (it is not clear by whom) are incomplete, lacking basic information (like which way is North, which you can figure out, but it's nice to be told), lots of important stuff left out: a complete map of the Crimea would have been helpful.Other than that, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharplet 2","review":"This is the only pencil I can draw with.

I decided I needed to see it again. It was worth more than I paid. Rare to see a non-religious \\"religious\\" film. With warmth and humor the story of Pope Leo and the defeated village of Monte Petra reaffirms the value of elegance in story telling and the power of great and honest acting to move the soul. The humanity rooted in love, even when love can be a hard pill to swallow, can and in this case does, inspire. Tom Conti's character in very human,striving to cope with almost superhuman responsibilities. His \\"escape\\" to find his people allows him to find himself again...and his spiritual Guide. Enjoy this one with your family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pope of the People","review":"This movie will engage you from beginning to end. All of the characters are complex and each is very convincingly portrayed. It's appeal is not an overly sentimental presentation of the \\"old god becomes human theme.\\" Instead it takes a man who happens to be pope and allows him to temporarily abandon the vestments of his position. The central character has all the flaws of any man and makes mistakes that in some instances result in trajedy. Tom Conti's performance is outstanding. His character is both passionate and sensitive but like the rest of us struggles to make the right decisions and take the best action. The results are not predictable. You will laugh and cry but above all else it will challenge your views of what constitutes good and evil. And in the end...(I'll let you decide)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected treat!","review":"This movie was never noticed in theaters, and is not available on DVD. I stumbled across it by accident - it sounded like fun in a rental store. It was not only fun, but Pope Leo is a warm, real character who brings life to the church - and to real meanings in life. Catholics and non-Catholics alike must respond when he tells someone making excuses, \\"Ultimately, we are responsible.\\" This has become a family quote. It is easy to watch, but also makes you think, and can be taken on many levels for the spiritually minded who question right, wrong, the meaning of life, spirit, truth.

When I was using the cranactin products, I was able to cure urinary tract infections (UTIs) and I thought it was because of the d-mannose. So, I thought I'd try d-mannose alone. It kept me from getting really, really sick but it would not cure an infection. Eventually I went back to the cranactin products and I started getting the original results - it cured the UTIs.So, for many people, d-mannose might be enough. But if you have stubborne UTIs that d-mannose won't cure, I would really recommend that you try Solaray's cranactin products."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as pictured","review":"I ordered this item thinking the colors were as pictured and in fact the colors are Orange and Brown ,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Promise Little Success","review":"This book had such great potential and it was all just wasted.

The flashbacks/past life connections detracted from the story. The editing was poor. The book dragged on and on. I kept reading hoping that at some point, it would improve but finally gave up around page 85. I read 85 pages too many.

Each illustrator was chosen because his or her style seemed to uniquely fit the story he or she was visualizing.This may have been a great idea, but it just didn't work out.

More people care where their food comes from but this goes beyond that and goes to the farmer and the other reasons why we should all care. A little education goes a long way and if we take heed we can help each other as this goes to the heart of what is community. The Walmarts and other big centers for anonymous food are the antithesis of community and their paltry attempts at throwing money at communities does not change that.

Reid doesn't stay with any one person, region, time period, or theme long enough for what's he's writing to make sense; instead, he constantly jumps around, making it necessary to keep a separate, written list of people and places if you want to make any sense of what's going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but small","review":"I go tanning a lot and I love using stickers but when I ordered these ones I didn't realize how small they actually were.

It seems to have all of the best songs recorded by Joan during this period, including many that I had never heard before. My favorite tracks are Show Some Emotion, I'm Lucky, and Me, Myself, I. No one had a blend quite like Joan's; part rock, part folk, and part jazz. This blend is most apparent on disc one, disc two has tracks that are closer to the realm of pop with mixed results. I don't care for the last third of disc two, and especially dislike I Love it When You Call Me Names, a sadistic homage to domestic violence. What could Joan have been thinking? Nonetheless, there is an embarassment of riches on these two cd's, and they'll be spinning in my system for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooo good!","review":"It is great!

They are wider than the average pencil, which makes them easy to hold & write with. The built-in grip is nice too. The only problems I found were that I used up the eraser very quickly and then some of it was stuck in the pencil and I couldn't get it out to put more lead in. Also one of the pencils was at the bottom of my bag, and somehow the clicker part to advance the lead came off, and I had no way to advance the lead and had to throw out the pencil. Next time I will go back to the Bic mechanical pencils with a longer lasting eraser and no clicker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Shelf among the cheap plastic mechanical pencils!","review":"As lower-end multi-pack mechanical pencils go, I give these a good recommendation. They feature a sturdy pocket clip, comfortable grip, and reliable operation. The leads are easily refilled and the erasers are the same size as a standard wooded pencil, so if they're taken care of, they can last indefinitely. The lead advance on the grip is very handy, but takes some getting used to. It is easy to inadvertently press the button while writing. As much as I like these, they are only made of cheap plastic: try not to sit on them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Does Work","review":"I have only played craps 4 times, I read and re-read this book several times.

After reading this book TWICE already I have to agree. The only way to beat craps is through controlled shooting, or, as Scoblete calls it, rhythm rolling. Sharpshooter goes into every aspect of how to do this. You learn about the proper grip, the proper dice sets, and how to gently throw the dice so that your sets stay in order. I have to say this book is right up there with Scoblete&#65533;s book Forever Craps because Sharpshooter is talking about real ways to get an edge on the casinos and not just betting systems. This is a must read for anyone who is the least bit serious about craps. In my opinion, it&#65533;s an instant classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great, Completely Useless","review":"While this product looks fabulous, it is completely inadequate for use as a double towel bar.

The author really thinks he is going to be more impressive by quoting some actual scientific facts (like the number of genes we have as opposed to the number a fly has). He also picks on Darwin's theories and talks as if late 20thcentury conventional scientists completely turned against Darwin's theories. Realize this people. Darwin died over 120 yearsa ago. Of course some of the stuff he said about evolution wasn't going to be true. But a hell of a lot of it was. Many conventional scientists now realize Darwin was certainly partially right and furthermore disbelieving a couple of Darewin's many evolutionary theories doesn't mean a scientist is against evolution in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is hit and miss","review":"Out of a pack of six pencils, I had the lead advancing mechanism fail within the first coupe of days of use.

At that time, the profile was held together by steel rods, eye-bolts, and a plastic bandage to keep the rain out.

In other words, women lack courage. This is reminiscent of Larry Summers' view that women lack innate intellectual abilites.

More female leadership--with all the compassion, humility, and collaborativity that it would bring--might be a very good thing for this world.

It is as boring as reading a train schedule.I did skim the book to see if the rest of it follows the same pattern of random references with no interpretation.

It does not.The idea for the book is interesting, but the book itself is full of padding and fill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tenured Bigotry","review":"On a recent TV interview, Mansfield claimed that we live in a \\"gender neutral society\\". I guess that's why women make on average 76 cents for every dollar men make.He also said that women should stay home and take care of the house and kids, while men go out and be breadwinners. I suppose next we can expect a book saying that Jewish people should be money lenders, Chinese immigrants should be dry cleaners, and that African Americans should stick to sports and minstrel shows.We need to demand that our universities stop harboring tenured bigots like Mansfield. Harvard should be an istitution for learning not spreading hatred."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for being outragious","review":"If you thought caveman thinking was dead, the good professor wrote this book for you.

Bush, and the a-hole jocks you knew from high school. His whole book is a meandering meditation on why we should worship such bossy, simple minded, egotistical jerks as the pinnacles of manhood, yet the examples he cites from literature (such as Hemingway's \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\") don't even support his own argument very well.This very shallow definition of what exemplifies a \\"real man\\" is rehashed and expanded upon (but never looked beyond) throughout a bloated, boring bit of pseudo-academic writing that contains some occasional insights amongst a vast amount of filler and mind numbing repetition. Also, there is a lot of bashing of feminists and liberals that, while sanitized for academia, really isn't all that far from what you might hear your typical Fox News panelist spew on any given night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manliness for liberals","review":"Quoting from Darwin, Nietzsche, and many other progressive types, this book definitly is a product of a liberal Harvard mind. While still giving interesting thoughts on many subjects, such as the current status of the gender-neutral society, as a conservative Christian and patriot, I disagree with most of this book. I have researched manliness and courage for about 3 years now and was really looking forward to reading this and was disappointed. At one point, I may have read him wrong but, he makes Christianity seem unmanly, which is complete fallacy.

This bubble level is easier to read and use than those built into the bases of tripods, so this is a great gadget for those with \\"older\\" eyes. I use mine frequently for landscapes.

Nearly every song features that repetitive background vocal, and, while initially the album strikes one as energetic, upbeat, and fresh, it quickly becomes stale about halfway through the twenty-plus tracks, burying itself in its own droning, repetitive vibes.Energy in a live performance isn't created just by making your audience jump up and down to a \\"hey!\\" beat.Two hours of this amid a sweaty audience and too much beer in your system might work, but on a CD, it translates to music that annoys.Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive!","review":"I agree with the other review.

They seemed okay at first-they broke in quickly and were comfortable (although lacking in cushioning). But I gradually began to regret wasting my money. Firstly, the soles of the boots tended to mark up the floors at work, leaving little black footprints in my wake. After about 4 months, whatever naugahyde-type covering they used on the toe section began to crack and peel off. I trashed them after about 5 months when they looked too haggard and worn to maintain any semblance of professionalism. In my opinion, if you're going to shell out some cash for a pair of boots...might as well pay a little more and get a reliable pair that will last more than 5 months.

I have to say this is to date his best. The sound is tight and stripped down. The songs are beautiful.

This album ranks above the Scary Monsters album that other reviewers have compared it to because the sound quality and song writing has improved over the 20-30 year span since Scary Monsters came out. The quality of the sound production is more like his later Heathen or Hours. I highly recommend this album for David Bowie fans or fans of highly produced 90's style of music with crisp guitars mixed in with strong drum tracks and keyboards.Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Brilliant","review":"When I first reviewed this album, I said it was Bowie's best since SCARY MONSTERS.After dozens and dozens of listens, I have to revise that: THIS is Bowie's best.I never thought I'd say that ANY album by Bowie could top HEROES, but this is the only one that does (OK, maybe there are times when HEROES is #1, but it's definitely a see-saw act between that and REALITY).So, if I was compelled to give my \\"Bowie Top Five\\", they would look like this:1. REALITY2. HEROES3. LOW4. HEATHEN5.

Yuri is certainly one of those artists who truly personifies everything special about such an awesome decade. Her songs truly cut to the heart and were certainly not a high pitch latin sellout version of the american madonna. This girl stood out on her own having brains, beauty and the talent as an actress. I don't follow up on today's artists since the modern scene fails to capture my attention and most are unworthy of true recognition because of the arrogance and vanity that corrupts the music industry nowadays. I will always remain faithful to the 80's american and latin pop and rock culture. Yuri in my opinion was an 80's awesome diva."},{"rating":"2","title":"great energy in her smile","review":"I gave it 4 stars only because when transfuring from different steps it seems like it is made up as you go. also I will have a hard time keeping up as you are learning new steps while moving very fast, but the set and music keeps your attension., also she guides you always talking telling you what to do, She is so beautful and a smile to die for, ankle bracletts and cute coin belts are part of the wonderful eastern dance that she brings to us, its alot more fun than cardo workout step tapes that mount into the millions, all alike. I bought all her tapes just knowing her energy and style will make me want to do this after 50 times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun, pointless","review":"I thought I would check this out from the library before buying it and am glad I did. It was boring and silly, nothing like what I was expecting based on the rave reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - Not What I Thought","review":"I tried this dvd because it looked different and fun. However, I was hugely disappointed. It looks like an amateur video off You Tube! There is minimal direction besides: \\"Shake your hips, do it with attitude!\\"It just played like someone grabbed a camcorder and said: \\"Start dancing Hemalayaa!\\". I ended up returning it for a partial refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout for men, as well as women","review":"I imagine that most people who work out to this DVD are women, however I believe that there is a tremendous market among men for this DVD. For one, it's a great workout. I spend the majority of the day sitting at a desk working at my computer, which leads to considerable neck, shoulder and back tension. Bollywood dance is largely about shaking the shoulders and neck, and stretching the back and I've found that working out to this DVD is of tremendous assistance in getting me limbered up. It might not seem macho, compared with lifting weights and making grunting noises, but it's a really good workout. Add to this the fact that it means working out while looking at beautiful women - which inspires and makes it all enjoyable. Highly recommended for everyone - but as a guy, I suggest the other guys check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing workout","review":"I bought this workout video based on the user reviews - while the instructor does go over a series of good Indian dance moves, the instruction leaves a lot to be desired and individual moves are not broken down into their component parts at the height of the workout. There is little notice given before switching moves and I often found myself left behind and unable to follow the instructor. I would not purchase anything by Hemalayaa again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had better workouts!","review":"After buying this workout dvd based on such high reviews i was very disappointed! I was hoping for a little more \\"bollywood\\" action in the moves, as I have taken many bollywood classes. This DVD does not compare to an actual bollywood workout. The cool down period was the best part of the dvd. If you are looking for an intense workout, skip this dvd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much FUN!","review":"This is such a fun dvd- really challenging as far as just loosening up your body but easy enough that anyone could do it. This dvd illustrates how to LAUGH with your ENTIRE BODY! Talk about cardio! Talk about toning your legs! But the best part is that you really feel like you just left a dance party with the gals- not had a serious excercise session. At first the movements feel realy awkward and goofy, but Hemalayaa makes them all look really cute & sexy... after a few trys, you'll feel cute and sexy too... you may even be inspired to take these moves to the dance floor. And the Bhangra beats are way infectious, the sound of joy- this dvd is all about having a good time. I totally recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible teaching","review":"This video was very disappointing. The instructor is a great dancer, but cannot teach at all. She goes way too fast and the sections change too fast as well. I do NOT advise this for beginners or for anyone who needs a low-mid impact workout. It puts a strain on your shins, knees, ankles, and neck with the moves she does. I believe she was more concerned about looking pretty than making a good workout video. Don't spend money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"This is a great and fun dvd and the service to get it was very fast, I recommend it if you want to loose weight in a fun way!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not much of a workout","review":"Hemalayaa is beautiful and sultry, as are her \\"two sisters\\" who assist. Lovely \\"eye candy\\"; the music would be fun if one could actually listen to it while \\"dancing\\"; however, Hemalayaa chatters incessantly through it. It was difficult to get our heart-rates up, and there was a lot of \\"down time\\" doing the hip shimmy, which could have been utilized illustrating other dance steps. It was fun the first time we tried it, but we haven't used it since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Money","review":"I purchased this hoping to find a fun, entertaining workout. I was disappointed from the start. Right away I noticed that the instructor, Hemalayaa, isn't in very good shape herself. She has no muscle tone and quite a belly bulge. Additionally, the dance moves are very awkward and do not flow very easily. I mean, even the instructor and her partners to not seem to flow through the moves. As an example, she actually starts off the routine doing facial exercises... give me a break! Do yourself and favor and continue looking for a dance workout CD because this one is nothing more than a dust collector!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I havent received this product. I asked for the tracking number on this package and havent heard anything yet. Need a tracking","review":"I dont have a review to write because I havent received this package. I have asked for a tracking number last week and still havent received one. Could someone please, please, please give me a tracking number. Thank You, Christine barg"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better workouts available","review":"I was not impressed. Although this DVD received some high ratings, I tend to agree with those who gave it only a few stars. The video seems thrown together and unorganized. I get the concept but you would be better off putting in your favorite music CD and dancing around. The narration is annoying and the workout is boring because it feels like there's no structure. I would pass on this video. Just my personal recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...Skip buying this one","review":"I thought this DVD looked like it would be a fun workout. It might have been okay, but I just couldn't get past the fact that all the girls were doing the steps at different rhythms. Not only that, but the girl on the right didn't seem to know what she was doing at all. This workout felt thrown together. They could have benefited from a little more rehersal time.The moves are fun. So if you can get past the \\"thrown together\\" feel of the video, you might enjoy it. If you can't, you might want to skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energetic","review":"Hemalayaa is very energetic and her DVDs are fun. This one I thought needed maybe a bit more instruction, but it is still very good. If you keep moving to the beat and get as much of the routines as you can then you can still get your heart rate up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"I have tried a variety of dance tapes and love many of them. This seems to be very little of either dancing or workout. There is no choreography and the movements are very sloppy -- the dancers just seem to stumble from one half-hearted motion to the next. If you've actually seen a bollywood movie, you won't recognize this workout as anything like it. Also, the music is not very interesting and the instructions are rather ridiculous at times. My boyfriend (who is used to seeing me do dance tapes) was laughing out loud at the tape while I was trying to follow it. Don't listen to the other reviews, no one should ever pay for such a horrible experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music not that great","review":"I got this because I was hoping for great music and it wasn't worth the money. The dancing is nice, but doesn't help with a workout and the music isn't really that prominent. I only felt like it was good if you want to see how they do the dance moves, but they don't explain how to do it well. I wouldn't purchase this unless you want something to watch, not workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...Surprisingly bad...","review":"This product was the worst exercise video I have ever done, and that includes the old vhs Tony Little workouts! The warmup focused more on the neck that large muscle groups, the actual workout was quite fast paced for a beginner, the voice-over instructions didn't alwasys sync with what was on the screen, and the transition from one set to the next was very awkward. I finally stopped when they began doing a squat-type exercise that involved putting your knees all the way over your feet, which as any trainer knows is bad bad bad!All in all, I would save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Easy","review":"You don't have to be in great shape to enjoy this DVD and it will give you a good workout no matter what. The dancers and the setting are beautiful and you have the choice to watch it with just the music, which makes it great for everyone who gets tired of the same chatter during workouts. She tells you to \\"Smile and have fun with it!\\" a lot, so you'll appreciate being able to just have the music. I wish all workout DVDs gave you this option. Watch your knees and your neck. The dancers don't wear shoes, which I think is a problem - that's tough on your feet, so if you do wear shoes, some of the moves will be riskier for your knees if you're on carpet, so just be careful. They also roll their heads way back at times, which is not something you should ever do to your spinal cord, especially not at the speed they do it. But overall, this workout is fun and relatively easy, so the time flies and you're not exhausted when you're finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes working out easier","review":"I'm not a workout junky and the tape allows me to move my body, loosen muscles and get my heart working, all while having fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great & fun workout!","review":"Dance workouts are not something I enjoy, but after picking this up for a friend who loves dance workouts, I previewed it & the instant I started watching I could not help but join in. The instructor is great, as is the music. I also greatly appreciate the fact that the dvd has a music only option, so when you want to move the way the spirit moves you, you are free to do so with no voice over giving direction.Instructor encourages you to smile, have fun & laugh at yourself, and is very positive throughout the entire workout. I highly recommend this if you want to have fun, feel better about yourself, and at the same time start or change pace in your fitness journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready to smile","review":"This may not be the most intense work out you'll ever do, but I can garuntee one thing: you will SMILE A LOT. It's just fun. Let your hair down, and get down with Hemalayaa - this work out with leave you feeling really happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly boring","review":"I love dance workouts but this is very disappointing. Bad cues. Bad camera work -- too many closeups on face when you need to see what the body is doing. And worse, the routine is boring. Bollywood is fun and exciting, but not this. It would be hard to get a workout if you are in half decent shape. I'd skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start","review":"I really just started trying to get in the workout mode and I thought this was the perfect start out video.

You definitely get your heart rate up and have fun at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly fun","review":"I don't usually like doing video workouts, but this one really is fun. It is a bit silly and corny, but I do work up a sweat and have a great time doing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I enjoy dance dvds for something different or for a lighter day if I have already done some cardio or weight training. I like the music and the idea of this, but the cueing was bad, the moves were boring - hip shakes in place, spine stretches, yawn. Face stretches were simply silly.Wasn't for me, but sounds like it's a 50/50 chance as others seem to have enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I wanted to like this, since I was looking forward to trying one of her videos. Unfortunately, I didn't like the dancing at all and could not follow along with it. I am beginning to think I just can't do any dance video..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I need to get in shape but wanted something fun and this dance workout is definitely fun! I love doing the workout every day. I think it's perfect for people of all experience or none at all. It gets you up and moving. Also as Hemalayaa says several times in the video 'have fun you don't have to do what we're doing just do whatever feels good for you' There are a few parts I have changed, I can't do the jumps she does partly because this is my first workout video and because I have a very small space. I would recommend this video to any as a daily workout or just to get you started moving until you have the stamina for something more aerobic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"I was hoping for a little more maybe then she gave, while the workout was fun, it was too choppy to keep me engaged, with too many pauses and segments, and it did a lot of jumping moves. I was hoping maybe for something a little more like belly dance, with smoother moves. Kinda hurt my knees and I don't have knee trouble. I would only suggest this to some one who loves Bollywood and knows what it is before they start. I had trouble keeping up with this, maybe start with a basic learn the steps program before doing this. Also, if you have trouble with your computer running programs with pauses this will make you crazy.Don't do it unless you have a smooth stream on your internet connection. But try it you may like it if you like Bollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't enjoy it","review":"didn't like it at all. thought the workout was wierd.Not my style.Not what i expected I guess.I like a faster paced choice of music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun dance workout","review":"If you want to have a little fun while you are working out, then this is for you. Its a great gift as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Challenging","review":"I do this workout once or twice a week to keep me motivated.

I am having fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for exercise, but that's it...","review":"I've done a few different Bollywood DVDs and this is basically a typical exercise dvd.. Definitely would not use it to learn Bollywood.The moves that she does are often sloppy, and the facial exercises are pretty silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hip-Hop meets India","review":"I suppose when i got this i thought there would be more traditional dance mixed in but it is mainly modern street dancing. It reminded me of a music video. I thought i would try different kinds of dance videos to spice up my workout routine. I have an Island girl video and i love it. But this one is not for the faint of heart. If you have knee problems or back or neck problems i would advise you against buying this. She does alot of flayling about that gave me a headache. I felt silly doing most of these moves. Especially the face excersises. She goes to fast and i felt like i was just jumping around most of the time. I also disliked the naration tract over the video. The extra preformance you can watch looks like sleepovers i had when i was a kid and was fooling around with my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I hadn't wasted my money..","review":"I bought this hoping to learn a few bollywood moves and have some fun, but this dvd was disappointing on so many levels. the workout lacked any flow between segments and changed steps without warning. The narration and dancers were often out of synche with each other, which was very frustrating. My other major gripe was that it lacked any of the grace that is found in Indian dancing. I found the instructor very tacky and seemed she was more interested in displaying herself than teaching any moves. At some points it was simply vulgar and that is not what Bollywood is about! I noticed a reivew from a professional Bollywood dancer and she also commented how far-fetched it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst dance workout","review":"Absolutely no sweat and no fun. This video is not a good dance workout or even a good dance intructional video. I will never buy a dance workout again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not bollywood dance","review":"I rented this form the library to check it out. I would have bought it if it was good. I would not recommend his.* Its not anywhere near a Bollywood dance routine. A hotch-potch of some steps from yoga and what not ...its funny....* Presentation can be improved, also the narration.* Change the title for this DVD... its misleading.What I expected was an introduction to some Bollywood dance steps. And good dancing to some excellent bollywood numbers. But noooo nothing here. I am better off buying a DVD with a compilation of good bollywood dance numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Bought this DVD thinking it might show a few more dancemoves for Bollywood. I am so disappointed with it! 3 women in a Bollywood inspired setting who frollock about for 50mins demonstrating moves that a 5 year old would do better. Very badly demonstrated and not at all 'sassy'...this is constantly used to describe what you should be doing while dancing. Not at all inspiring and ideal for 14-16yr olds who fancy themselves. Really bad DVD and it isn't a workout. Save yourself the bother of getting it only to return it and just get any of the other DVDs!! Such a pity as some of the reviews were positive and influenced my decision to purchase - will be more cautious in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible, shameful","review":"this is terrible.

Producers should be sued."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cardio","review":"I was hoping for a good cardio/sweat inducing workout and I got it with this video. The moves aren't broken down step-by-step like with other videos, so you have to pay attention. The camera work makes it easy to see what the dancers are doing so just take your time and practice and you'll get the hang of it. The first few times, I didn't worry about keeping up with the dancers, instead I just focused on getting the moves right. It definitely got my heart pumpin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This didn't rock my Casbah","review":"The main dancer is as cute as a bug, but the moves repeat and repeat ad nauseum -- it feels more like high impact aerobics to me which i HATE. It killed my calve muscles too. Constant jumping and bouncing til my teeth rattle isn't my thing. I didn't feel sexy doing it either which surprised me because I thought I'd be a wildy sensuous indian princess aftewards. Go figure! Nice set but I'm giving my copy to the local library. It just didn't have that sharp, intelligent dance snappiness or, alternately, any down-lo sexy flow -- of which I expect one or the other of in a dance video - especially an Indian one! Big disapointment. Too repetitious in it's movement. Unimaginative. I could have swore I'd love this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun","review":"This was just as much fun as I thought it was going to be and it was a much needed break from my tougher workout videos.

I'll admit it was more fun when I it with a friend of mine, than the first time I did a run thru, and I felt a little silly. And it probably takes a few times through to really get all of the moves. But it got the blood moving and the sweat flowing, which is what I wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one","review":"This expensive DVD contains a 65-minute concert from late 1976 and features clips from critis throughout the show.

Very cute for any kid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've Let it Go by Now","review":"The Little Mermaid and the sequel were made years ago, so why did they just decide to do another one out of the blue? It is just not that great either. It doesn't stick to the first two at all. I think Disney could have given us a great back story on the original characters but blew their chance. This plot was stupid, the music was awful, and I think Disney should have left well enough alone and not made this. If you are a purist and want sequels to stick to the original closely, don't get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After watching Little Mermaid 2, I was quite excited for this sequel. The story line is a bit depressing. Not only does her mother die (this is Disney afterall) but then the whole story is about how her father is a real downer afterwards. There's not enough time and too many sisters to really get a good handle on who is who. The music is good. If my daughter chooses to watch it again I think it will be for the music. I'm glad I didn't pay full price. I think this one will be a dust collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for any age!!","review":"I bought this movie for my 1 and 8yr old girls. They love it! And honestly, so do I. We are very happy to add it to our collection of Disney Movies. It arrived very quickly considering the holidays.I recommend this movie for any family.Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a typical Disney","review":"I Love Disney movies. Usually it is because the story is good and so is the music. This story was nice, but I have to say that the music was just AWFUL!It pretty much ruined the movie for me. I mean in one part there was this dreadful piano piece that didn't even fit.Sally Field, as much as I love her, can't sing.Disney could have made this movie so much better. I would suggest they try again with a different soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting from Disney","review":"My daughters kept waiting for the happy ending. They were shocked by Ariel's mother's death. Whereas I know my kids will learn sooner or later about the depressing aspects of real life, I really don't expect Disney movies to help them along on this front. Disney is supposed to be about dreams, wishes come true, and happy endings. This movie falls short of those expectations and just ended up disturbing my kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ariel's begining","review":"My twins have wactched this new ariel movie alot and the best part of the movie is that they did not have Ursala in this one she always scared my daughter. Good movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does very little to answer any questions","review":"If you wanted to know what happened to Ariel's mother, the first 5min of this movie will tell you. After that, the movie is a complete waste of time with some pretty terrible music.Jodi Benson's voice is great as usual. But they give her horrible material to sing to. Why can't they get decent song writers at Disney anymore?The movie would have been a million times better if it featured Ursula and why she was banished from the kingdom. Instead, we get some new sucky villain who sings sucky songs and has a bizarre relationship with a green monster who looks like it had been playing in nuclear waste.Ariel's mother strangely is an exact replica of Ariel. Which means, while Triton is romantic with her, it looks like he's getting it on with his daughter. Which is pretty creepy.2 stars for some good animation, thankfully. But other than that, it's another sequel/prequel that doesn't come close to living up to the original movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Sad for Little Ones","review":"My 4yr old daughter loved the scene where Kig Tritan and his wife showed how much they loved each other! But after the mother was KILLED she kept asking what happened to Ariel's mommy??? When she figured out that she died, she got really upset and wouldn't watch anymore. And still won't watch it now! Horrible Storyline!!! Shame on Disney!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not really pleased","review":"This movie was rather boring. Both me and my daughter fell asleep watching it.

It doesn't seem like an addition to the original Little Mermaid. It is strong enough to stand alone and make a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The only thing entertaining about this movie is the villain's name, Marina Del Ray. A lot of people do not give children's opinions credit, but my 3 year old daughter even loathed this movie. Coming from a girl who loves cartoons and anything Disney, that speaks volumes. Avoid this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"This story was a cute prequel to the Little Mermaid story.

Great add to your Disney collection if you are a Little Mermaid fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment face","review":"The Little Mermaid is nothing like i remembered as a child.

The main female character in that movie was named Ariel and her father was the one who outlawed music in the town. I loved both The Little Mermaid and Footloose movies, but I'm just thinking, \\"where is the originality Disney? Come on.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Please. It even SOUNDS awful.","review":"I love The Little Mermaid, but after the hideous sequel they made, I'm discouraged by the very description of this story. It sounds like an episode of the TV series. If they're going to do a movie, why not have a decent story? A proper villain? A plot? Tension? Not some watered down pansy 4-year-old drivel with a moral that bashes you over the head. Disney have gone to the dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the sequel","review":"I actually gave this movie a try. Being a Little Mermaid fan since a young kid. I loved this movie. It was very intense and sad. It followed it own story plot unlike Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea which was just the opposite of the little mermaid. I do recommend buying this movie. Very good!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO Scratched it isn't playable","review":"I gave this to my daughter for Christmas, to my surprised it was so scratched up when she opened it and tried to play it, that it wouldn't play. I took it to Hastings so they could buff out the scratch marks, it to was no avail, They couldn't do anything and it still has scratches so deep it wont play. Don't waste your money buying this unusable CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame - Disney Isn't Even Trying Anymore","review":"The story is thin and really makes no sense. The music is just weird... songs aren't really songs at all -- more spoken than sung. And the melodies are really old mambos, generic jazz and stuff. It is just so sad, considering how wonderful the songs in the original were.Disney is famous for killing off a parent, but they do it within two minutes of the movie. What used to be a touching moment in their animated classics, is now a cheap gimmick which disturbed my kids.The animation quality is okay, but you can really tell they are taking shortcuts.But most important is the storyline... I can't understand why they didn't work a little harder on a story that held a child's interest. My twin girls were so looking forward to this, and within twenty minutes they were squirming on the couch and looking for toys to play with.Just a big disappointment. Disney should spend as much time creating the DVD as they do on marketing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE LITTLE MERMAID","review":"MY GRAND DAUGHTER WANTED THIS FOR CHRISTMAS. COULD NOT FIND IT IN TOWN. VERY EXCITED THAT YOU HAD IT. SHE LOVES IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"If love old school Disney, avoid this \\"movie\\"","review":"Another direct to DVD sequel/prequel from Disney. Bland color palette and lack luster animation are the foundation of this latest installment to the little mermaid series.The thing that stands out the most is the awful, awful musical score to a series where the original is known for having an amazing variety of songs.Seriously, they have \\"Jump in the Line (Shake Shake Senora)\\" as one of the songs. Are you freaking kidding me? Not an original Disney creation, one of the crappiest swing songs I have ever heard. I seriously hate the **** out of that song and they play it like 2 or 3 times throughout the movie because it's practically the only song they have.If you had fond memories of the Little Mermaid, you owe it to yourself to NEVER see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting.........","review":"MAde five requests about returning the item and I am still waiting on the seller to give me return details. So not happy right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sweet Movie","review":"Yes, its another Little Mermaid movie. It was a sweet movie that explains some background under the sea but it did leave some questions unanswered. That's okay though. Ariel's parents relationship is the main focus here and you get to see the sisters grow up. Sweet movie. I was pumped since I saw the teaser trailer a long time ago. Ariel is my favorite princess and though there is no mushy love plot with her, it still is a sweet disney movie for those of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for anyone who loves Ariel.","review":"I got this for my daughter who loves Ariel. Great kids movie. She watches it all the time. I love to find movies on amazon that I cant get in the store and they are always at a good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ariel's mother dies!","review":"I bought this video for my granddaughter at my daughter's request...it's a cute video, like the original, and we knew in the original Little Mermaid, Ariel only had a father, but neither of us was prepared for Ariel's mother dying in this one! Not a good thing for little ones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc damaged","review":"Disc damaged and does not play all the way through, though it was supposed to be new.

The Little Mermaid is by far my favorite, I own all three movies and love them all. This one was not as action packed as the first thats true and I do believe the storyline could've been a little more devloped but all in all it was worth my money and time. It was deffenetly better then cinderellaI II which was a complete waste in my opinion because it had absolutely no relevence to the first Cinderella, whareas this movie I think gives a nice tie in to the others. Its a good movie for all ages"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten movie","review":"I am not big purchaser of direct to DVD movies, we usually stick with theatrical releases, so this one may be decent compared to other movies of this type. But, compared to other Disney theatrical releases this one is terrible. The animation is fine, but the writing is bad and the music isn't anything special. Also, there are any number of scenes/actions in the movie that I don't want my daughter emulating.The best part of the movie is the credits (they're animated and set to music in the Monsters Inc. style). The movie seemed promising when I read about it and pre-ordered it months ago, but it sure did fall short. As others have noted, bonus features do nothing to improve this movie purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgracing and Pointless!","review":"Oh god, do I hate this movie! The absolute worst Disney direct to video sequel, prequel, midquel, or whatever I have ever known. I have not seen this movie but I have heard plenty enough. It's a disgrace to The Little Mermaid francise, especially the really good television series! The way Ariel and Flounder met in the series when they were cute kids was so good, yet they substitute it in a movie of absolutely nothing. The only thing I can compliment is the animation looking much more modern than the other direct to video films. But that doesn't change the bad choices they made for this story. King Triton is at his worst; he's a total jerk! There's the fact that they've put King Triton and Ariel through another major conflict when they've already had enough in the original movie, there's the fact that bringing music to Atlantica has no point to the original film, it's-I-er-IT'S SO TERRIBLE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent, scary and just plain stupid","review":"This video is awful. It begins with a depressing story of how ariel's mother died and how this affected her father, ariel, and her sisters - just what you want your young child watching - right?This movie also contains scary scenes and violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent deal","review":"this purchase was an excellent deal. the product was recieved as promised in great condition and very prompt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This film is definitely not a dud as compared to Cinderella II. This is a great film. Could Disney have stopped at just The Little Mermaid, yes. But this film answers some unanswered questions that were not addressed in the first firm. Overall, it is a great film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"When I came across this book on Amazon.com, before it was available, I was very excited. As a computer maintenance technician whose knowledge is rather slack in the area of printers, I was very happy to see what I thought was a brand new book on printer maintenance coming out. Other books on the subject that I have browsed at Amazon seem to be rather dated: 1996 or even earlier. And the fact that it was Hewlett-Packard was gravy -- just about all of the printers under my care are HP models. What could be better than an HP printer handbook?So you can imagine my dismay when the book finally became available and I got to read the above spiel from the author. Not what I had in mind at all. Gee, a whole book devoted to choosing a printer -- just what the world needs. I recently got a chance to take a look at this book at a local bookstore and it was even sadder than I imagined. When is someone finally going to write an updated printer MAINTENANCE book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a book on printers for regular people!","review":"Most of the books that I have looked at in bookstores on printers have been full of technical jargon and very little information that I needed. With a little bit of reading, this book finally answered many of my questions and gave me ideas on what to do with my new Epson inkjet.

Unlike the reviewer who gave this volume 5 stars, I feel as though it is overly determinstic in its' approach. There is almost no room for any type of individual behavior, as this does not really exist for McCracken. The book is also heavy on a kind of behavioral pop psych dogma and he does not take any other modern consumption ideas into account. In the end, check this book out from the library if you really want to read it, otherwise you're just throwing your money away on overused dogmatic tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book written for the intellectual elite by the intellectual elite","review":"This is one of the many books written by professors at universities in order to get tenure. It is not written for the average reader but for other professors who already have an understanding of the subject matter. For that matter, I wonder why the author would make his book available to the general public and not make his material accessable to them. The book is dense, the author focuses more on referencing other authors rather than providing a clear, concise or original thesis to the subject. I dont not recommend this book if you are one of the billions of people out there who is not a professor at whichever universities this author was trying to impress."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!!","review":"The type that says \\"performed by the Countdown MixMasters\\" is really, really small on the front of the CD... these guys are cheats!

Well, the graphics are much, much better, but I found the game just too complex. There are too many decisions to make, for my blood. Of course much of it can be put on automatic, but what is the fun of just watching the action? I found the new religion feature to be confusing. I was also disappointed in finding that I could not view as much of the game field as I could on Civilization 3. If I zoomed out far enough to see more of the field, then the field became blurry.

However, as the game is turn-based, the occasional substantial pauses between turn updates is an excuse to turn to more productive tasks - the impact (when in window mode) on other tasks appears to be minimal, possibly because the game exploits only a single processor (which it tends to run at 100% utility).While I miss some of the features of prior games, the richer diplomatic actions, the fine graphics rendering, and the fairly substantial number of technologies makes playing the game both enjoyable and challenging. I expect it to be part of my actively played set of games for some time to come making it worth the price.I'd like to suggest that Aspyr consider exploiting multi-processing however, to the extent possible in order to reduce turn latency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of money","review":"Civilization is awesome but this was a complete waste of money, download doesn't even work.

I won't even attempt to see what it's like with a full, modern world.

Performance is slow and painful on an iMac G5 and worse on G4 machines. Aspyr needs to release a patch soon to fix this game.Updated 7/21/06Seems that there has been an update to version beta 1.61 Rev A. This does fix a lot of the speed issues on powerpc.

Every time I attempt to download the 1.74 update, the game hard-freezes about 1/2 way through the download. Not only that, the game requires you to insert the DVD before playing! What is this, 1995?!? You'd think a dual-Xeon machine with 6GB RAM would have no problem running the game...And why is there no download for the 1.74 patch? I can download 1.61c, but 1.74 requires you to use the in-game downloader. Very annoying! Not only that, the support system is convoluted. I can't possibly be the only person to have this problem! If Aspyr support doesn't answer my problem soon, I'm sending this one back to Amazon.I'll post again if anything changes.<update> The game crashes often, for some reason, so I eventually stopped playing it.

At the usable graphic settings the game looks about as good as the 2D Civilization III. All of the 3D graphics are really just a big waste.Based on the poor performance, I cannot recommend this game.

This excellent 2-CD collection did the trick. The songs on here show the wide range of material that this band played, from R&B influenced tunes and uptempo rock to more jazz influenced pieces. Traffic was a group of truly outstanding musicians; Steve Winwood and Dave Mason, plus drummer Jim Capaldi and the others. I guess with the personalities involved --- and the urge by Winwood and Mason to persue solo careers --- it was inevitable that they would split up, but they left behind some truly memorable music, some of the best of the early 70s. This double disc set is attractively priced and loaded with tunes; a perfect introduction to the mesmerizing music of Traffic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winwood at His Best","review":"This collection entitled \\"Traffic Gold\\" is much more a history of Steve Winwood.

Her writing reveals, on more levels than one, the payoff for gently confronting our resistance to writing. Her goal is to help you write with joy, and at least for me, it worked.

Mirror's dark edge and Mostastless' lyrical delivery. They bring so much to the table with content ranging from urban myths to politcal views to religion. So songs are a tad boring but, Jamie and Paulie came through on this. Easliy beats Green Book and Freek Show. If you've never heard Twiztid give them a chance, they are def. worth it.

It was more or less an academic documentary, not the ratings-grabber of VH-1 years later. The Experience Project of \\"Rock and Roll\\" is the way to go.

We are reintroduced to Sybelle, Geoffrey and Joanna's daughter, Alinor's granddaughter, who is to be the heir to Roselynde. The family is shopping for a husband and helpmate for her and has in mind a friend of Simon's. Walter is enchanted with Sybelle but unsure of the requirement that he be tolerate women with power in their own right and expectations of being treated as vocal equals...and the requirement to be a faithful husband. He is shown to grow and overcome his more prosaic notions and Sybelle also becomes a more tolerant and wiser character as she matures quickly in the face of adversity and civil war. Political intrigues abound as does the trechery of another women who wants Walter. A good read with complexities."},{"rating":"2","title":"A concise, exploratory tale of witchcraft and drugs.","review":"The book concerns the Matamoros cult of Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, the mechanics of how it came to be, and the inevitable end of the participants.

The murder of Mark Kilroy is covered sympathetically, without being overly \\"patriotic\\".

These blades are like a hot knife through butter...but there is a catch...If you rush the saw/blade - you will chip the surface, no mater what blade you use! The lesson I learn - nearly half way through the project, was to make my mark on the back of the flooring board and cut at about half speed (the force moving the saw forward - not the speed of the blade moving up and down). I did find a cleaner cut when I did increase the vertical blade speed (adjustable speed jig saw).

I realized that Grimaud was probably just too young at the time she recorded this CD because she completely missed the true Russian flavor that was needed to make the pieces work. Now I love both of these pieces (as performed by Ashkenazy) and use Grimaud's CD to play frisbee with my neighbor's dog. Recently, I noticed on YouTube an older, more accomplished, Grimaud as she performed a Rachmaninov piano concerto. Much better, and although I must stick with Ashkenazy on that piece as well, I was pleased that she had truly made it as a serious performer.

Its filled with fun, happiness, sadness, love and a bunch of Irish Fairies. Great read...especially of you love Irish tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"This is the second book of Nora Roberts' Irish trilogy following the lives and loves of the Gallaghers -- Aiden, Shawn & Darcy -- that has a touch of that Irish magic. Dreamer Shawn has met his match and his fate with Brenna O'Toole. Though one knows this will be a happy ending, we thoroughly enjoy every moment of the journey! I can't wait until book three!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tears of the Moon","review":"First off, I think this was a really good story. I enjoyed the main plot between Shawn and Brenna, but I also enjoyed the subplot that involved Carrick, Prince of Faeries. Brenna has wanted Shawn for a long time and she finally decides to go for it, and I give her credit for that. Shawn, he is a slow guy, not as intense as some of Nora's other male leads, much more of a dreamer. He is shocked but they kiss, and from that point on, he can't get Brenna out of his mind. The romance between them is a little slow to develop I thought, but once it got going, it was very good. I liked how Shawn was pretending to let Brenna court him towards marriage and such. Also, you find out more about Jude and Aidan, how their lives are going. Something big is happening for the Gallaghers' and it will continue on into the next book, with Darcy. Big plans. It was a very enjoyable read and if you liked JEWELS OF THE SUN, you will like the second book in the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGIC, AND LOVE THE BEST COMBINATION","review":"I HAVE ALWAY ENJOYED HER BOOKS, IT HAD EVERYTHING YOU WOULD WANT IN A RELAXING BOOK TO READ, LOVE, SUPRISES, AND MAGIC --- IT LEFT ME WANTING TO READ THE NEXT ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant second Gallagher book!","review":"Nora does not disappoint - this is the second story in the Gallagher siblings trilogy, wonderfully begun with Jewels of the Sun.Here, Shawn Gallagher, the cook for the Gallagher pub, writes songs and idly lives with little thought to the future, or to his lifelong friend Brenna.Brenna, however, has been giving thought to Shawn for a long time. In fact, she wants more then the friendship they've had all along and lets him know it, much to Shawn's shock.Carrick, Prince of the Faeries, encourages Shawn in hopes that this romance will make it for the 2 out of 3 that he needs in order to get his own happy ending.We get to revisit Aidan and Jude from Jewels of the Sun, and Shawn's sister Darcy, who is scheduled for her own romance in Heart of the Sea, the last Gallagher book.I absolutely loved this book, reading a \\"sibling\\" book by Nora is just about the most fun there is. Her characters are well drawn, her heroines strong, her heroes nurturing. She's done it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"I simply loved the story and all its characters. Some parts were very funny and I loved the way the romance developed! I listened to the first of this trilogy, \\"Jewels of the Sun\\", which was also a real winner. Can't wait to purchase the third story. You will not waste your money on either story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Magic","review":"Nora Roberts remains, in my opinion, undefeated in her talent for spinning stories of love, the occasional suspense, and the ever-present whispers of magic. The second of three Irish novels, Tears of the Moon will make you laugh, cry, fall in love, and believe. She draws the reader into the Irish culture, settles them there as if it were home, and weaves a tale of a love from long ago that mingles with the hearts of two present-day characters. Brenna O'Toole and Shawn Gallagher grew up together in the small seaside village of Ardmore. Shawn's music is part of his soul and he is part of Brenna's heart. With the aid of Carrick, Prince of Faeries, and the spirit of Lady Gwen, a love that had long gone undetected by Shawn and buried beneath a disguise of physical attraction by Brenna, is unearthed. It was such a delight to read as the characters wound their way around to the ultimate happily-ever-after ending to this modern-day fairy tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ardmore, Ireland","review":"After reading this series of books, I just had to go to Ardmore to see if the town and the tavern were real. They Are!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprising Favorite","review":"I tend to perfer historical romances, but Nora Roberts does such a wonderful job with this book, and its predecessor, you can't but help but fall in love with the characters. It has all the magic of a romance novel, the lust, anger, and surprising love, along with the comfort of characters. I would recommend reading the Jewel of the Sun first, as it too is a wonderful story and provides more background for the book. An excellent way to spend any evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than The First One","review":"I am one of those people that always reads reviews, and rarely writes one. But on this book, I really felt like I should tell others that Tears of the Moon was much better than the first one (Jewels) in the series. The storyline was much more compelling, and the characters were a lot more interesting. That's not to say that the first book was bad, but this one was just a whole lot better, comparatively speaking. When you're done, you're left with a really nice feeling. Nora Roberts did a great job developing the two characters and the relationship that has developed and does develop between them. I would definitely recommend this book as a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Nora Roberts success!","review":"Nora Roberts has done it again. With wit and grace she sets forth two amazing characters and sweeps the reader away. I loved this book and read it in one sitting. The beauty and mysticism of the Irish, land and culture, are lovingly portrayed. The people are funny and quirky and very true to life. I am really looking forward to the final book in this trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Ireland winner from Nora!","review":"Nora Roberts takes on the second of the Gallaghers and doesn't disappoint! This time, dreamer brother Shawn is romantically run over by local handyman (woman) Brenna, a lifelong friend who's decided they will get friendlier. Brenna's approach to Shawn was fresh and amusing in a story, and it was interesting to watch Brenna's character develop-- from deciding there may be a place for a dress and a lipstick, to watching her decidely UN-ladylike reactions to Shawn when she thought he needed to learn a lesson! Though the outcome is evident early on in the book, that does not take away from the pleasure of the story at all. You WANT to watch the Gallagher clan, Jude, the O'Tooles and the ghosts build the story. Would be surprised if we don't see a spin-off book on little sister Mary Kate after volume three of this series is printed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very romantic!","review":"I enjoyed Jewels of the Sun, and Tears of the Moon is even better! Shawn and Brenna are an exciting and wonderfully romantic couple. Loved the scenes with Carrick and Lady Gwen. I will be waiting with great anticipation for the final novel in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book - Best of the trilogy","review":"Tears of the Moon, is the second, and my favorite of the Gallaghers trilogy. It is about Shawn Gallagher and a life long friend of the families, Breena O'Toole. Breena has had a crush on Shawn for years, and finally decides to act upon it. The two of them have a great chemistry, and this book is always entertaining. A very good book, especially if you enjoyed Jewels of the Sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I enjoyed Jewels of the Sun, but this one didn't keep my attention. I think I read up to chapter 4 and couldn't continue. The description of Ireland keeps going on and on and the whole \\"faerie\\" story was boring to say the least. I do recommend Jewels of the Sun, the first book in the trilogy, but stop it there because it doesn't get any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and Better","review":"After Jewels of the Sun, I just didn't think Nora Roberts would be able to get any better in this series. I'm happy to say I was wrong! Ms. Robers managed to recapture the spirit of the first book and yet still make the characters unique. It's less like reading a series than returning to visit old friends. I can't wait for the third book to see what the wonderful Ms. Roberts has in store for Darcy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun sequel","review":"I was a bit cheesed by the way the romance happened between Aidan and Jude in the first book, but in here, the romance feels more natural, in fact I feel this book is the best of the trilogy. Aidan's brother and Brenna are a lot of fun to read about, especially when they fight. Oh yeah."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool book","review":"after reading jewels of the sun i couldnt wait to read the second book, and i enjoyed it a LOT!!! it was fun because the main male and female characters are different from the ones in the first book so you dont feel like you're reading some boring rehash or anything. now im gonna read the third book! yay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooring!","review":"This novel really didn't bring anything new to the whole Irish romance legend story. Painfully predictable and very blah... I caught myself rolling my eyes a lot and going - \\"oh, come on!\\" Sorry, Nora, but you should have stopped at the first one in the series (\\"Jewels Of The Sun\\") which I thought was a true jewel of itself - very cute, romantic, enchanting and a fun read.I suggest getting this one at the library or borrowing from a friend if that \\"suits you\\" :), but not wasting your money buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Romance","review":"\\"Tears of the Moon\\" is just as wonderful as \\"Jewels of the Sun\\".

This is a must read for anyone who enjoys a fun romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series!","review":"The first book in this series, Jude's story, is still my favorite. But Brenna and Shawn's story comes in a close second. I love the world NR created. As an author, she has made me believe in the charm of all things Irish. I love her Irish heroes and Shawn is no exception. Buy this book! It's a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to finish my trilogy out","review":"Since my mother liked to randomly raid my bookshelf and trade my Nora Roberts books to a friend at work for some weird thrillers, I ended up missing this book. But since I love the trilogy and had the other two, just had to get it. It's Brenna and Shawn's story, and I like it. Book was in decent condition, and slow to arrive, but overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. I just think they should make half the effort they do when shipping books for Prime that they do for other things(I mean, I ordered a steam mop this past spring and had already mopped my entire apartment 36 hours after I placed the order, it arrived that fast)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"Let's just say that my first impression of Shawn is that he's a sissy and a wimp.

The call clarity is great and the menu system works very well. I especially find the hot bar menu system on the start screen very convienent. The mp3 player function workds remarkably well and with a 2 gb smartchip, this think becomes a monster media device. My one grievance is the camara on it. It lags horribly when you try and take a piture that is not staying perfectly still. In all, I highly recommend this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP Plastic....","review":"Although this phone has so many great details that are mentioned in other reviews, I could not believe the cheapness of the plastic!This phone could have been just a GREAT design and durable as well as I especially like the clock on the cover. Instead, Cingular offers a phone that cost over $300 with all the bells and whistles and terrific technology ....with plastic like a kid's phone. I couldn't believe it and when I mentioned it to the reps on the phone, they stated that all the customers were saying how disappointed they were.I mean, how much more would it have cost Cingular to spend a few bucks for quality materials? If you drop this baby even once, you had better kiss it goodbye..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked External LCD screen","review":"The external LCD screen on the phone cracked mysteriously. This seems to be a design flaw. Do a web search ( \\"Cingular 3125 cracked LCD\\" ) and you will find a number of owners who have had this problem. The descriptions are all the same - no one dropped the phone, they just generally pulled it out of their pocket and it was cracked. The crack appears on the *inside* (internal side) of the screen so it is not the result of physical damage by the user (no external facing dents/marks etc) .Users posting in web forums report that the damage is not covered by Cingular. They also report that the phone is not insurable.Phone screen broke for me 2 days ago - rendering the external screen useless. I will go to cingular this weekend and see if I can get a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chock Full Of Great Features","review":"The reasons I chose this phone are: it is small and lightweight, I can synch with MS-Outlook, it has a great MP3 player, expandable memory, it has Bluetooth, a decent camera, I can read pdf, Word and XL files that are e-mailed to me and much more.What I don't like: The speaker-phone is poor quality because the speaker is so small and this also affects the ring quality. Many times I accidently turn on the media player which runs down the battery. I wish the media player would not work unless you have earbuds plugged in.Overall it is a great device if you don't want to carry a big phone on your belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are problems","review":"As soon as I got this phone, people told me my voice was breaking up, sounded like static, noisey, etc. So I took it into a Cingular store they said 'Oh yeah this phone is bad', and exchanged it for another unit. So I am on my 2nd 3125 now. I called a couple people and asked if my voice sounded clear now, and they all said it was still messed up. Now what? The MS ActiveSync is a well known nightmare to get to work. I love the looks of this phone, but frankly I am very unhappy with several aspects. I guess I'll go back to the store again and get a 3rd unit. Maybe one of these will work right."},{"rating":"1","title":"You do not get what is pictured","review":"What a rip off, Amazon post a picture of the cable and inline fuse, and even describe it in the description, you only get the short 1 ft inline fuse, no cable as pictured or wrote in the items name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading picure!!!","review":"While I should have read the description more closely, they should have easily edited the picture to show a correct representation of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNSATISFIED!!!","review":"Lets start off with the picture is VERY VERY VERY msileading.

Whoever this company hired to make the connections should be retrained. Half of the wire had been cut off. Also the crip was such a low quiality that the wires frayed and came out of the connector. I had to cut off part of my 4 gauge power wire that I purchased from a local stereo shop.Third the fuse holder set screws wouldn't tighten on the wires.

Wound up changing out the wire and terminal for my old one and just kept the fuse holder. Started everything up and no power. Checked power from my amps all the way back to the battery.

How to Be Filled With the Holy Spirit is written in a very balanced Charismatic viewpoint. It reveals how to receive the Holy Spirit in a way that changes one's life and one's life for Christ. This is one of the best books written on the subject. Many authors, evangelists, and pastors just say \\"God bless you\\" and finish there. But Aiden W. Tozer goes beyond that. He tells you HOW you can receive the blessing. That's what makes Mr. Tozer an excellent author. Being filled with the Holy Spirit is a continuous process and this book explains that wonderfully. The Holy Spirit is here on earth for all of us. He's here to give us power and comfort. All we have to do is receive Him. In return, we'll be filled! Buy this book!

Tons of gain and great clarity, tone, etc. The unpredictable drop outs when operating in or around steel beams, bar joists, etc. (which are in most new commercial buildings) make the use of these units quite risky because you never know when you will experience drop outs. Some repositioning of the receiver helps sometimes but the risk of using these vs hard wired mics is always there."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK just OK","review":"these mics really require you to hold them very close to your mouth.

The receiver is super, really powers the mics well. Voice gain is good and there is no external sound picked up. All four microphones can be run at the same time without the need for an extra amplifier, which is nice, some systems do not have enough power to push all the equipment fully.Upon my initial test trial I found the system incredibly responsive. Battery life and distance range is approximate yes, but neither were grossly overrated. I previously rented misrepresented equipment and am pleased with this system falling well within the products description.This unit payed for itself with the lack of rental/late fees. Generally, better equipment than those rented also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half functional","review":"I bought this with the understanding that the quality of the sound would not be great, especially because of the low price. I set it all up and did a practice run with the kids at my school for a show we were putting on. The mics started off great, but one stopped working in the middle. I changed the batteries, thinking that the ones that came with the set might have been bad, but it still wouldn't work. Then, when I set up the next day to see if I could figure out what was wrong with the first mic, another one stopped working. I know that I shouldn't expect amazing sound, but no sound out of half of the microphones is just not acceptable. I had to return the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed :(","review":"tried these microphones on 4 separate occasions before I returned them.

Many TV viewers will remember her making a virtually unknown concerto by Crusell sound irresistibly witty, and surprisingly she does the same to the finale of the Mozart Concerto which, at an unusually fast tempo, has a giocoso quality that is both novel and enchanting. She also manages the very soft phrases in the slow movement most beautifully, and quite rightly she adds miniature cadenzas at the pause marks. Not all do. If there are any faint traces of insecurity, I hope that in ironing them out she doesn't lose the youthful freshness that makes her playing so unusually pleasing.

Brian Hazard (the one sole member of Color Theory) has crafted another brilliant album while retaining the same values he set in his two previous efforts, but he has done this without repeating himself. There are more great synth lines that are reminiscient of early Vince Clarke (i.e. Yazoo). This new album has some of his best drum work yet including some Drum 'n Bass style tracks (watch out Goldie!!). Songs like 'New Years Eve' and 'Now I Know' are reflective, introspective, and full of emotion. While songs like 'April's Bonfire' and 'Faces' keep the dance floor moving. All-in-all, another great effort by Color Theory...Highy recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best work so far!","review":"If you appreciate classical piano and polished vocals, you will love this album, which is spruced up with electronica, making this album a synthpop album in my humble opinion. The piano and synthetic sounds work quite well together, and you could not ask for better vocals, though perhaps you might have a hard time deciding between Gahan and Brian Hazard. This self-prouced album is definitely worth checking out, and he has a nifty website too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Old School for the wrestling collector","review":"Another great VHS tape by WWF Coliseum Home Video.

I Love older AFI but i dont want to here the same album remade more then once. The music has to change thats what makes this band so great! Growth and development is what music is all about.Anyways about DECEMBERUNDERGROUND it is a really good well writin album that has a cold feel to it. The guitar riffs and solos are writin better then ever, Daveys vocals have gottin better i just cant see why fans are complaining AFI always changes. I think if your looking to get into AFI start off with Black sails and shut your mouth then go from there...But i do thinkyou should get this Album because AFI is very different from any other band out there and every Album is a different story..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album...shoulda bought the 12''","review":"This album is great.

I mean Miss Murder was a different for AFI, but I thought Decemberunderground was going to take off from Sing the sorrow. However, I was greatly disappointed when I first listened to Decemberunderground. Overall, the album is too slow and too \\"poppy\\" for me. Musically and lyrically it is good, but it just isn't my type of music anymore. There is also a little too much techno. I am a fan of their old stuff, but I realize that is natural for a band to change. \\"Miss murder\\", \\"kill caustic\\", and \\"affliction\\" are probably my favorite from this album. Maybe if I listen to it a little more, it will grow on me. A lot of people will like this album and I will support AFI, because I am a big fan, but this just isn't my type of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"This cd is a dissapointment for both the fans of the new, and the fans of the old. I think that AFI's last four full-lengths have all been five-star material, but I can't find too many things about this one that I like. It's kind of touristy: it spans quite a few genres without ever actually hitting the respective marks. The electronic and industrial parts are well done, especially in the intro, but the \\"hardcore\\" leanings that Davey mentioned in interviews prior to the album's release are watered down and uninteresting - the vocals during these moments do not mesh well with the production, and as a result sound kind of forced. The rest sounds like your average, boring, hooky radio music. I think the most interesting band member on this release was Hunter, the bassist. The rest of the guitarwork is drab and predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A revolution like all great artists","review":"I'm sure I sound like every other person jumping on the bandwagon after buying \\"Sing the Sorrow\\", But I remember being 16 listening to \\"The Art of Drowning\\" thinking, How could this get any better? This album isn't horrible or disappointing like most critics are saying, it is just different. This is what makes a great band great, the ability to expand their sound to different levels and capacities. For a real fan of any band, they can appreciate the fact that they do not want their current work of art to mirror the last. AFI has exposed us all to a different angle of their genius and we should all be thankful for it cause I am pretty sure the reason so many people hate this album is because the're to f**king slow to understand and interpret the deeper meaning of each track. Quit acting like a detective with a fine-tooth comb and just lose yourself in this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"I bought this Cd after hearing \\"Miss Murder\\" and \\"Love Like Winter\\".

All the songs sound the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this CD","review":"If you like any other AFI songs/cds that are not \\"Miss Murder\\", this album is not for you. Lovers of \\"Art of Drowning\\", \\"Black Sails\\" and \\"All Hallows\\" will be extremely dissapointed. AFI has progressed from the dark rock sounds of \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" to the incredibly cheesy tracks of Decemberunderground.

Thats about as new as you should go for gAyFI. Davey looks/sounds like a girl now, how do all these teenage girls like him?? The only way you'll like this is if your gay or a teenage girl.

This album is just not good. There is another review on here where the person says you have to listen to the songs at least 3 times because they aren't catchy. I'm sorry, but I thought that was a sign of poor songwriting. No matter what style of music you play, if the song is good it's gonna get stuck in your head. This album doesn't. I've listened to it more than 3 times and I honestly can't hum a single tune from it outside of Miss Murder which is being played everywhere right now. And that song's not very good. It has no structure. It's just a 3 minute length of sound with some Davey Havok screeching. Some of the songs are like a mix between AFI and Depeche Mode. I don't know. I think this band hit it's prime with Sing The Sorrow and can probably look forward to coasting swiftly downhill pretty quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete junk","review":"there is like 2 good songs on the cd. dont be fooled by the clips, for the most part the cd is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"This cd sucks what happened to afi on this one its all mainstream pop and this band has given up on punk and sold out too the emo pop rock on mtv!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mainstream. still good","review":"yea so they kinda went mainstream on this album. but so what.. theres those people that say \\" oh there on the radio now. so they suck\\".. sellout.? i disagree.

From a man that lists Ian Mackaye as a vocal influence, the garbage vocals on this album could not hold a light to Minor Threat. Many reviewers on this site call the transformation which AFI has undergone progression, but I think a better suited label would be change.

This is nothing but silly pop music for the pre-teen MTV set. It's seriously bad stuff, folks. Very painful to see a band like AFI stumble so badly and hit the wall. It's not just different. It's poorly constructed music being performed by a group of soul-less \\"pod-people\\" (formerly known as AFI)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band lost it a long time ago","review":"What a bunch of neutered, over-produced songs tailor-made for MTV.

AFI are better than most punk-pop bands but \\"decemberunderground\\" isn't even as good as their older stuff which also isn't very good. The vocalist is annoying and of course the guitars are too simple for my tastes. The bass however is not bad but isn't completely audible either. The single \\"Miss Murder\\" is average at best with a catchy but also very poppy sounding chorus. Hey, they're better than those fu**ers My Chemical Romance who ripped these guys off completely but nothing good at all. If you want an awesome album released in 2006 buy \\"Come Clarity\\" by In Flames, \\"Rio Grande Blood\\" by Ministry, \\"10 000 Days\\" by Tool, or even \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Music not PUNK!! Try Minor Threat if you need PUNK","review":"Miss Murder and Rabbits on Road Kill are gems. Don't be afraid to admit it.. Long Like Winter and The Missing Flame show the band venturing in somewhat uncharted water.. The more you listen you will realize how lucky we are to have a band that is as interesting and talented as A.F.I.. I do listen to their old stuff from time to time, but lets be real-- Sing the Sorrow is close to a masterpiece as we are going to get nowadays. Decemberunderground is more evolution, lets hope they continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some have mixed reactions, but this is a great album","review":"Ok, first let me say this is an awesome cd. The first thing some people might notice is the use of effects processors on guitar and bass. This might not give you that raw AFI sound that most old school AFI fans have come to know. Second there is more electronica from Jade(which by the way is well done and craftfully arranged) By now you should know that the band has been changing their sound with every new album. Let me start wrapping up by saying this: If you liked Sing the Sorrow you should definitly buy this album for it is the second half of the story.(Notice lyric on 37mm,your sins into me,a recurrence from Sing the Sorrow.) So it comes to this,if you liked Sing the Sorrow and are still a fan of AFI this album is a neccesity for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep, it's still AFI!","review":"It's different...but it's very good.

The first half of this cd is easily a 5 star cd, but around track 7 something in the formula fails. It picks up a few times after, but for something as hyped as \\"decemberunderground\\" there should be no \\"skip\\" tracks, and sadly there is.Check outKill CausticMiss MurderSummer ShudderLove like winter"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I myself loved the new cd. Yes, AFI changed their music drastically. No more did they sound punk, but to me, they sounded a little emo. Not only did their music change, but their appearance changed too. This was not a bad move though. It seems that all bands are leaving their pop-punk backgrounds, to a more emo or goth sound, becuase right now, screamo and emo music is the fad. I have to say that I think Love Like Winter and the Prelude are the best songs on the cd, and Miss Murder would have to be the weakest, even though that too is a great song. I loved the NIN's remix, \\"Head Like Hole\\" They put a new spin on a already great song. I would recommend this cd to anyone, even if before they were not an AFI fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"this sucks a lot. really sucks. there are about 3 good songs on it. i don't care about them changing; it's what they've changed into to appeal even more to the masses that is atrocious. i did not buy this album expecting a certain sound or for it to sound like a previous album; i was completely open to anything new and good. too bad, i only found 3/4 songs good. now they sound like a million other punk rock, teenage bands. Believe me, I'd love to say this album was great, but it just wasn't. it's disgusting and watching the band do interviews is also disgusting, because they seem really full of themselves now, especially Davey and Jade - the only ones who talk, anyway, like the other two members are incapable of speech."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?!","review":"Ok, I'll start by saying I'm quite a big fan of AFI. This is their 7th album release. I have all the 6 previous albums. I think the sound they made was quite unique - anthem-type hardcore punk. I respect hardcore punk, not new modern pop-punk like Good Charlotte and Angels and Airwaves for example. AFI's new album though, have dissolved into a branch of modern pop-punk junk. Emo kids will eat this up. With the poppy choruses, and the intelligent lyrics (that was sarcasm), old fans will be disappointed. If you want lyrics like \\"DON'T SPEAK MY NAME!\\", and 6 choruses of \\"Under the summer rain, I burned away\\" (in Summer Shudder) look no further. AFI has indeed, burned away.AFI have weakened into a radio friendly band. Banal and predictable. Gone are the anthem days of \\"Now The World\\", \\"Silver and Cold\\" and \\"Days Of The Phoenix\\" to name a few. However, if you're a 13 year old emo kid who appreciates the 'profound' talent of Fall Out Boy then you'll love this generic album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their greatest...","review":"I am usually not one to call a band a sell out, or talk about their glory days before they made it big. But I have to admit AFI's second major label album is another let down. As soon as I heard Miss Murder on my XM Radio I knew the band was going once again for the MTV audience. Then came the \\"Fred Durst like\\" growl/yell thing Davie did at the end of the song. The rest of the album has its ups and downs but all together if they make a great video it might warrant them a VMA. I just wonder what happened to the AFI from the \\"Art of Drowning\\" days and before, where their music was straight up power-punk, and truly intoxicating. This stuff is fluff, and yes the MTV crowd will buy it and make them good money. But that's a fickle crowd, I hope they don't let the rest of us forget how good they can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not the same old, but it's good.","review":"If you look at AFI from the first 7\\" to Sing the Sorrow you can't honestly say they have been releasing the same style of music for 15 years. The initial work was very straightforward CA punk and the later albums, especially Sing the Sorrow, have taken a more orignal voice and added elements from hardcore, pop, gothmetalstuff, and the music era we all love to hate - the 80's. But c'mon, they are one of the hardest working bands in music today and this album is a testament to a very creative, orginal, and talented band. Does it sound like the music they were putting out when I was still in high school? NO. Is it good anyway. YES.Also, for all of the people so shocked at the \\"screaming\\" on this album...have you listenend to their best record Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes? Davey wrote the book on melodic screaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"daffodil","review":"I rate this business a 5 but I rate Amazon a 1 on their ability on getting the right address for shipping"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good collection","review":"The only movie I didn't like was \\"Anything Else\\" - it wasn't bad, but not hilarious as \\"Small Time Crooks\\" and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roots Of Rhythm","review":"Wow!

Like several other reviewers, I did find the many, many, many characters quite confusing at times, but once into the rhythm of the work, found I could handle it. The author probably overused obscenities here and there. I do have friends that are just as bad in real life, but not everyone! I felt character development was good even though some of the characters were not overly endearing. This is an interesting work and I certainly am not sorry I read it. Perhaps it is not for everyone though...each of us has their own taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story! Read it in one day!","review":"This was my first Sandra Brown book and I thought it was excellent. I see that other customers didn't agree but I thought this story was original and entertaining. I was upset to find out that Paris and Dean had a relationship while she was with Jack. I know that's how we got the story of everyone moving to Austin but still. It was rather upsetting. Other than that, I thought the book was great. I didn't have any idea who Valentino was. I had some ideas but I was mistaken. Then I thought I knew in the end but again, I was wrong! For me, it wasn't as predictable and sometimes it is so hard to find good novels that aren't predictable. I'd definitely tell others to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello, Darkness","review":"I love Sandra Brown stories. She never fails to delight.

Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating and suspenseful!","review":"This is the type of novel that I love to read from Sandra Brown. The storyline is excellent, the action is wild and the romance is hot!! Readers are snared from the beginning with a sinister phone call to a radio-talk show host, followed by the kidnapping of the daughter of a prominent citizen. And even though you may think you have everything figured out and know who the psycho is - you don't. Not until the very end. The story takes you behind the scenes of a how a radio show operates, as well as into the teenage underworld of sex, drinking and drugs. Although this is truly a work of fiction, I think its a must-read for parents of teenagers because it stresses the importance of communication and keeping close tabs on these young wannabe adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful Thriller","review":"While the contents of the book is disturbing. It is a very good novel. With suspenseful characters such as Paris,Dean,Stan and others. Ending is excellent. While some of Sandra's Brown novels have been lackluster in the past. This makes up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's between bad and just ok?","review":"This book. I can't say it was the worst book ever, but I was bored reading it. I could care less about Paris, and if you don't like the main character...I am not the best at figuring out who the killers are, but this one was SO easy, I thought I was wrong. I love that he is a red herring, but still obvious. Was she trying to be coy? I don't like her coy. She needs to stop that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank Goodness","review":"I was shocked at how much I disliked Brown's last book, \\"The Crush.\\" I was afraid she'd lost her edge. With \\"Hello, Darkness,\\" she was redeemed in my eyes. Is it the best she's ever written? No, but it was classic Sandra Brown. The ending was the best...It bounces you back and forth between suspects like a ping-pong ball until you're not sure WHO did it. I have no problem recommending this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bestseller? Not to me.","review":"The premise wasn't bad, but the writing was. Nothing gelled as it should: The hero/heroine, Dean and Paris, had no chemistry, it was obvious from the first what had happened between them in the past, and the drawn out way it was presented only tortured the reader. And Dean? Too smooth, too even, always ready to do the shrink thing, he had no guilt, and I'm forced to wonder if he had emotion at all. His 'anger' in certain scenes was forced and unbelievable.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"These stories are pointless... ...","review":"I was very disappointed with Hello, Darkness. Envy brought Brown to the top of my favourite writer list and Hello, Darkness brought her back down to average. There is nothing but horror in this story. It is another one of those stories where the story makes sense even if the murderer were someone else. These stories do not encourage logical thinking but random guesses and they are indeed pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"A Delilah-like radio program, affluent teenagers with too much time on their hands, parents without a clue, and a dull hero and heroine. That's all that pretty much makes up HELLO, DARKNESS. I usually like the romantic suspense books that Sandra Brown writes, but I found this one to be a big snooze. The characters were either weird or dull as dishwater. I wanted to like it, I really did, but it was excruciatingly boring. Toward the end, I was just skimming to put me out of my misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I didn't buy this book.","review":"I'm a huge Sandra Brown fan - I've read almost everything she's written, and I usually buy her next book as soon as it is released. I happened upon this book at the library and grabbed it.I was extremely disappointed. There is exactly one compelling theme in this book - the relationship between Dean and the heroine. I did like how their past was revealed little by little, and I found their pain and relationship very realistic.But, the plot surrounding this book is just voyueristic and gross. Rather than finding the mystery interesting, I figured out very quickly that she just kept dragging us in to a suspect, and then throwing fact about another suspect the other direction. I felt jerked around, and not like facts were being revealed naturally. I didn't even care if they ever found the kidnapped girl by the end. There were details in this book that would give any abuse victim flashbacks, and for no real purpose other than to shock and horrify."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not Brown's best but still worth 4 stars!","review":"I am a huge fan of Sandra Brown and I freely admit that I enjoy all of her books. Hello Darkness is no exception altho not a 5 star story it is most surely worth 4 stars make no mistake about it! Buy it and judge for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello, Darkness","review":"I have enjoyed Sandra Brown's writing in the past, but was disappointed in this piece of fiction. To its credit, it did have suspense, and was hard to put down. The insight to the DJ profession was interesting, but it was a stretch that this DJ, Paris Gibson, was involved in (what seemed) all the police investigations and interrogations. Too many potential villains: Lancy Ray Fisher/Marvin Patterson, Gavin Malloy, John Rondeau, Stan Crenshaw, Brad Armstrong, were there more!? If Gavin Malloy told his father 'there is one more thing I need to tell you,' just one more time--it was going to send me over the edge. Too much detail about the Sex Club escapades, and yet the death of the victim was basically 'skipped over.' And did everybody have a crush on Paris Gibson, despite the sunglasses for the sensitive eyes? Sandra Brown can certainly tell a story, and I will probably read another of her books in the future. Hope that I can give it more 'stars' next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sandra brown","review":"very good book. typical Sandra Brown...lots of characters and a page turner. gets your attention from page one and gets better as it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"Kept me involved from beginning to end. Would consider this one of the best Sandra Brown has written. Definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I have dearly loved most of Sandra Brown's books so I couldn't believe it when this one was a clunker. I felt like I was reading a Mary Higgins Clark book because of the way it skipped around to so many different characters. And then it wasn't nearly as good as Mary Higgins Clark's mysteries. I would rather read a book from the viewpoint of one or two people so that I can really get to know them and feel their emotions. The way this was written, I didn't care about any of the characters at all. I just hope her next book is back to her regular standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 2-star rating is generous.","review":"I can't even begin to give a description of the story b/c there were too many characters, twists & turns and I'm sure I'd only confuse you if I tried. This book started out strong, but then became ridiculous. Nearly every male character in the novel was a pervert and had some kind of sexual behavior problem. I'm not being sarcastic, it's true.The only compelling part of the story was the romance. The situation seemed realistic and the feelings were genuine. With that said, I still wouldn't recommend this book. Brown's books either completely suck or completely rock. If you're looking for a good suspense by Brown, read WHITE HOT. That book was fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really 4 1/2 stars","review":"This book gets 4 1/2 stars from me because I could not put it down. I had to know how it would end. There were so many twists and turns. I liked Dean and his son Gavin and it really delves into how people grow up and how things from their past can and do affect them. The reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because I thought the main character Paris could have been made more \\"real\\" to me. There was so much going on in the book that I think sandra Brown did not spend enough time developing that particular character. Otherwise, I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a suspenseful read especially if you have time to do it. This book is not one that you will put down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful disappointment 1 1/2 stars","review":"This is my third Sandra Brown novel and this was easily the worse one. I don't know why all her male romantic leads have harsh, haughty personalities, always spewing multiple obscenities at the beginning and close of every sentence, and the classy heroine always finds them irresistible... Women?I gave Brown's \\"Envy\\" 5 stars, so that's the reason for my disappointment. This novel has absolutely no one to cheer for (unlike Envy's Maris), very predictable stereotypes, little imagination,(unlike Envy's book within a book) the only bright spot for me was the last page. Do yourself a favor, skip this one and read \\"Envy\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"peters out at the end","review":"This novel was in the same style as many of Sandra Brown's books. It had a lot of the disturbing elements that she uses and which tend to stick in my mind for a long time. I agree with a lot of reviewers that after following the story of the young woman who was abducted, the book really just dismissed that part at the end. I also did not develop any affection for the main character, Paris. I thought she was weak. I would say this book was mediocre at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"College book","review":"Daughter needed for college. Book was priced a lot less than buying from the college.

Some of the concepts are basic because he has to make the book appealing to a wide audience but I found the hidden gems of information useful. The organization of the book, a series of 77 concepts, is excellent. There are no references to low limit games, which is refreshing. The author makes a point of avoiding discussion on low limit because, and I agree with him, low limit has too many exceptions to the rules of normal conduct. For poker players like myself who wish to dabble outside the realm of Hold'em, the pointers on Razz, Studd and PLO are very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated information","review":"If your looking to get an edge in poker you are definitely going to need some other source of information.

Transfering music is an incredible frustration. Contacting toshiba support is an incredible frustration. Using the Toshiba Gigabeat is punishment for a crime you didn't commit. I have a Toshiba computer, it is easy to use. How could Toshiba flub this product so badly. I think they looked at an Ipod, and tried, conceptually, to copy it. What a mistake. The Ipod is made by Apple. The whole Apple company reminds me of Canada. Look at Canadian zip codes, they make sense to someone, but not normal people.

The screen is incredible - so bright and vibrant! The only downsides are: it has been discontinued (or will be shortly) in favor of the \\"S\\" series Gigabeat, and since it's not an IPod there are virtually no accessories. Where as an IPod connects to most new car stereos directly (where the stereo controls the IPod), the only option here is to go through an AUX and use the units controls. Likewise with most speaker systems. However, for half the price of a 30 GB IPod and to come with 40 GB, that's a small price to pay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing!!!","review":"I was shopping for a cheap MP3 player that could hold my entire music library, and this seemed like a good choice...at the time. But the entire layout of this player seemed spiratic and illogical, it was very hard to find what you wanted. And you can't erase folders once they've been put on. You can erase the files in the folders, but not the folders themselves, so it quickly became cluttered with empty folders, which was inconvienent to search through. And reading the manual (I am one of those manual-as-the-bible type people) was just as confusing as the player itself, simple things could not be found in the manual, and not worth the time to try and find out. After about 2 weeks of being fed up with this, I bought a Philips Go Gear, and have been happy ever since. But this player has made me loose a lot of faith in Toshiba products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toshiba MP3 player","review":"Very good mostly, except for the software. It's not very user friendly.

I've never been able to run \\"Gigabeat Room\\" without it crashing while refreshing (otherwise known as deleting) my library. It's saving grace was that you could use windows media player... But only Windows Media Player 10! So if you did the sane thing and went up to 11, the gigabeat now words with absolutely nothing. Now it's an expensive paperweight or external hard drive. If the company still made patches and updates it would be totally worth it, but they've dropped their old product line for the latest and greatest and if you try to contact Toshiba, they'll get you a software update that doesn't do anything to fix the problems above...

Claire Forlani makes the story much more pleasant to live through.I was thinking on giving this DVD three stars just because of the music but sadly Amazon again forgot to inform that there were no subtitles.

The first two issues in this volume are really good and I was excited but then it hits a wall and just doesn't go anywhere. One issue I literally skipped because it made absolutely no sense what so ever and I have no clue why it was an entire issue. Also, two of the issues in this book aren't even written by Moore and one of those issues is completely useless and doesn't move the overall story anywhere. That same issue also made no sense to me.

Sales were slow and not much critical notice was taken of the book until Alfred Noyes gave it a glowing review in the Sunday Times, making _Dusty Answer_ a bestseller almost overnight. Its heroine, Judith Earle, is an intelligent, earnest girl who becomes entangled in the lives of five cousins who have occasionally visited at the house next door to Judith's; Judith played with them as a child, and years later, comes to know them again as she enters adulthood. When they reenter her life, she falls desperately in love with one of them.

The effect is pure rapture.This entire compilation exemplifies the commonalities of spirit and aesthetic that bind all humanity together. Irrespective of race, creed, or color, Mr. Ibrahim's delightfully transcendant hybrid of Ellingtonian piano jazz and African inflected rhythyms remind us that true communication is possible, and music may often be its most faithful messenger.Recommended highly for music lovers of all persuasions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful taste","review":"Others seem to be complaining about this tea's weak taste, but I think it's just right.

All this is another cheap way to get Rod's Mercury material. Don't get me wrong, a lot of this stuff is among his best work, but how many repackagings of his years at Mercury need to be released?

Audra McDonald has been my favorite female singer since I heard her sing: the sheer emotion in her voice completely blew me away. For that reason, I was disappointed in this CD. Only in two songs does McDonald use even a fraction of the emotional potential I feel is in her voice, and in many songs her voice is comparatively bland. Wonderful talent, not-so-wonderful CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated talent and snoozer of a CD","review":"In my opinion, this woman is one of the most overrated singers of our generation. Theres no arguing that she has a beautiful classically trained soprano voice, as do many other broadway stars, but her range is very limited. Hand her something broadway or something classical and she's right at home, but she fails at anything else. With her reputation, you'd think she would steal the Dreamgirls concert; however, she was the weakest element, appearing totally miscast and even lost. I'd imagine that any serious forays into the pop world would be even worse. Not that she has to crossover of course, but I do believe the Streisand comparisons are an exaggeration. She is an excellent actress though.Nearly every song on this CD sounds the same, slow songs bereft of energy or passion. Certainly buy this CD if you are a big broadway fan (chances are most of them already own it) but others should probably pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golden Ears","review":"A Moose from California compared Audra's \\"Bill\\" with one done by Jane Monheit. I took his advise and listened to both. Audra sounds like a church choir singer making an attempt at jazz. The Moose from California has a tin ear when it comes to quality and soul.This is a sad recording as far as jazz goes. It should be in the cabaret bin. Absolutely!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Over-the-top at times, but incredible skill and timbre","review":"This is my first album from Audra McDonald, so I will not make the error of determining her ability based only on this album.McDonald has a classic Broadway voice, and one that can be pictured in nearly any Disney production or classic stage work. Whether it is my adapted ear that hears the \\"belter\\" style as abrasive, or it is an actual problem wit McDonald's voice, there are points in this album when I feel my own larynx growing tight just listening to her! But that is traditional Broadway sound, and these classic pieces are performed quite well and within the suitable genre.I would only challenge her to work to understand the difference in perceived timbre (sound quality) from stage to studio recording. What sounds beautiful on a large stage, in a theater filled with people, can sound harsh on a high-quality recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious Audra","review":"There need to be more stars than five for this one! Incredible voice,phrasing and music arrangements.Absolutely beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harold Arlen has never sounded better!","review":"Audra McDonald, one of the most talented singing actresses of our time, scores hit after hit on HOW GLORY GOES, her second solo CD. Unlike her first CD, which featured compositions by the latest generation of Broadway composers, Ms. McDonald has found fourteen songs - well-known standards, newer compositions, and gems from forgotten shows - that feature a wide range of styles that all suit her voice perfectly. Especially good are three of five songs on the CD written by Harold Arlen: \\"Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home,\\" \\"I Had Myself a True Love,\\" and - the highlight of the recording - \\"The Man That Got Away.\\" Ms. McDonald's connection with the harmonies and rhythms of these pieces, even when the lyrics are somber, transforms each into a joyous, soulful celebration of musical theater at its best. Three other favorites: Jerome Kern's \\"Bill,\\" Jeff Blumenkrantz's \\"I Won't Mind,\\" and Stephen Flaherty's \\"Come Down From the Tree.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"How GLory Goes is Glorious","review":"Rarely does a solo artist have a 2nd cd that surpasses the first. Audra McDonald does! From the opening number, \\"Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home\\" Audra's voice is beautiful. Her voice shows tenderness in the song \\"I Won't Mind\\" and breaks your heart in \\"The Man That Got Away\\". Singing songs from past and present Broadway shows, as well as original compositions, Audra's voice masters songs from Johnny Mercer's \\"St. Louis Woman\\" and Truman Capote's ill-fated, \\"House of Flowers\\". For those who liked Audra's first cd, \\"Way Back to Paradise\\", (and even those who didn't) or have heard her on the soundtracks of \\"Ragtime\\" or \\"Carousel\\", Audra's voice reigns supreme on this cd. Absolutely beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Audra does it again!","review":"Absolutely amazing! If ever there was a performer to follow, she is Audra McDonald.

After discontinuing the colors for a while, Pentel went ahead and changed the models and they are now weirdly shaped and don't work as well, from what I hear.If you can get your hands on the old models, no matter how you do it, they are the best mechanical pencils! It's a shame they discontinued in order to add that silly comfort-pad or whatever at the head.In high school, they were always stolen from me and I guess I never really kept my guard up, so I regret not having paid attention. I still use these pens to this day (a decade later). Our science teachers always used the blue ones...Anyway, that said, five stars to the old ones, three to the new. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite pencil","review":"The quicker clicker is my pencil of choice, because, as thin and light as it is, it still remains quite sturdy.

It's a solid and reliable narrative, an honest and well-written book for the layman as well as for the expert.The only shortcoming, I would say, is the shortage of photographs, maps, etc., to support the narrative.

The martial rhythm which sets the stage is appropriately snappy and conductor Inbal keeps the pace on a steady and even keel throughout. Though the Frankfort orchestra lacks the heft of the majors, all timbres are clearly delineated and the sound reproduction is crystal clear -- orchestral ensemble is exemplary. The explosive fortissimos, including the two massive hammerblows in the tragic finale and at the hair-raising final bars, are splendidly chilling! For those to whom it matters (conductors and musicologists debate about it and apparently Mahler was non-committal), the Scherzo movement is placed second concluding Disc #1 followed by the Andante beginning Disc #2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush sound for big Mahler classic","review":"This is a wonderful recording of one of my favorit e of Mahler's symphonies.

The book tells of the lives of infantrymen in combat in France, Germany, and Holland from the point of view of a medic who served with them in the same unit. Mr. Hickman based his book on notes he made in the early years after his return from the European theatre, and the story is as fresh as if it had happened yesterday. He writes with immediacy of cowardice and extraordinary heroism, of terror and boredom, of the horror, excitement, valor, and humor of the battlefield, and of the men whose lives he saved, and of those he couldn&#65533;t save.

But \\"Confessions\\" stands out -- not as eerie, just as charged, but with a danceablity and a rhythm that is missing from so many of their other discs. This isn't the music to seduce by -- it is the one to make you throw back your ragtop and cruise down the highway with the speakers cranked and the wind in your hair.

Dr. Grip does that well-- it is comfortable to hold and allows me to write a long time without fatigue.

Even with a thin layer of rubber/foam in the cradle, it is not enough protection.I nearly got electrocuted with this holder. I removed the rubber gasket which helped to allow the phone plug to connect to an electrical outlet better(more snug).

The stories are all about military technology in the near future, and most of the stories ring very true. Coonts is also the author of one of the stories (unfortunately, perhaps the very least plausible one). If this book has a weakness, it's that Coonts or his publishers chose to break each of the stories into very short chapters with large headings, typeset in such a way that it's difficult to see where one story stops and the next begins, but that's a very small fault in a very good book.

In addition, the eraser is a very practical length so you don't need to replace it every month. The only reason I've ever had to buy new ones was because kids in high school would either steal them, or I'd lose them. The one I have now has been with me for 3 years, and the lead hasn't slipped once. I've tried many others pencils, but this is my all-time favorite that I've used for years.I highly recommend this buy.

I really like the large rubber grip, but it does have a hard time fitting into pen/pencil slots... fortunately, though, this isn't a problem for me.

Her performance of Chopin's Ballade in G minor is especially noteworthy, played with much empathy for the score (It's a pity she hasn't recorded all of Chopin's Ballades and Nocturnes.). It's easily the most memorable recording of this work I've heard, and still a first-rate account inspite of its age. The Liszt and Schumann pieces are just as splendid too. Denon's sound quality is exemplary, on par to what one would expect in late 1980's digital sound from the likes of Deutsche Grammophon and EMI.

It's wonderfully written and makes use of fairy tales from around the world to make it clear that there are fundamental aspects of our unconscious that we all share. However, I read it hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the shadow's role and was disappointed in that sense.

Genie's actions in this novel could have easily killed her, especially one you learn her secret connection with the other heroine, Missie Abrams O'Bryan(aka Verity Byron). Missie is an admirable woman, who survived through the Russian Revolution and the Great Depression. She also knows all the Ivanoff secrets which a megalomanic German and a sadistic Russian will kill to get. Almost all the main characters in the novel have multiple identies, and this is an interesting part of the novel, but the prose is a bit flat, and Genie is just plain unlikable, which is this novel's fatal flaw.

I really like the large finger grip, but it does have a hard time fitting into pen/pencil slots... fortunately, though, this is no problem for me.

EP's first song \\"All Night Long\\" (\\"we're not 21 but we still can walk that walk...ain't gonna buy a single drink as long as there are men cause the girls gotta get out every now and then\\") is TOTAL girls- night-out country exactly like Frank was looking for.

It comes with 2 discs, the first is the complete game of Growlanser II, and the second is the complete game of Growlanser III. Both are great games. These games are in classic turn-based RPG style which plays phenomenally. Good customization options when you level up add to the enjoyment I got from playing the games. Growlanser II has more focus on gameplay and less on exploration, where Growlanser III has more exploration and the story moves slower. However, the music, graphics, and voice acting are better in Growlanser III. As you can see both have advantages and disadvantages, but in the final analysis, both are outstanding games in their own right, both play similarly, especially in combat, and both are worth the investment of purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Affordable wireless, but........","review":"Very affordable product, and I found it incredibly reliable under Win 95/98...but alas, not support for NT...or worse yet, no support for Win 2000"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book has flying trains, babies, guitars, and great drawings.

Very well written dialog and insightful. Just because a movie dramatizes human relationships and their complexities doesn't therefore mean it's a \\"soap opera.\\" In fact, the writers were amazingly deft to keep the stories moving, intriguing and honest. It took me a spell to get used to seeing James Garner on the big screen as I'm a big Rockford fan - and maybe Steve McQueen would have been better.

Same friend looked at it and can fix about anything. Still cat get it running.

While hammering it into the ground, which was soft following a night of rain, the black cap instantly shattered into multiple pieces, nearly hitting me in the face. After continued hammering the top of the stake flew off.I contuned to hammer the stake into the ground only to watch it peel back completely down to the screws holding in the chain. At this point, one good pull by my 150 pound Great Dane(or even my 12 pound Pug)and the chain would have lifted right out.

The dome has a small leaf design etched around the base and the dome is just the right weight, not too difficult to lift. Looks beautiful on the table, highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought it would be...","review":"This cake plate is exquisite.

I am a long-time Suave House fan. I still bump Coming Out Hard and Tela's Piece of Mind. Suave House seems to have gotten lazy and or not motivated to put out quality music. The only high points on this cd are Eightball's solo song and PhsychoDrama. If you in the Chi-town area or if your local mom and pop can get it, pick up PsychoDrama's Greatest hits. You can hear the talent that this group has. They are the tightest group out of the Chi you've barely heard off. Tony Draper what are you doing???? Hickman is lyrically nice too. I'm keeping this cd till I can burn a few songs then off to the used cd spot it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Milton H. Erickson, MD has influenced generations of behavioral health practitioners. Among them was the great Jay Haley, perhaps the best known of all the strategic therapists. If you ever wondered where Haley's greatest influences were and what in the great Erickson's work most impressed him, you'll find it in this classic.Among the many aspects of Milton Erickson's work and therapeutic episodes described here includes the work he did with a woman with a weight problem (which Haley offers as an example of Erickson's unparalleled flexibility in psychotherapy) which serves as one of the finest examples of strategic thinking, assessment and taking into account the client's values and motivations in therapy I have ever encountered.You may find yourself quoting and/or thinking often about what Haley cites in this efficient read if you have worked or been involved in any part of behavioral health."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncommom Therapy","review":"Ericson's methods and thought processes was truly uncommon. Casual reading usually causes a response, \\"wow, how clever. Take notes, understand the principles and put those principles into practice. The many volumes written about Erickson attest to the uniqueness and success of his techniques. Today, most \\"therapy\\" is conducted with the use of drugs. Erickson's therapeutic techniques have very few side effects and certainly faster than psychoanalysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have two choices - Either enjoy this book or enjoy it!","review":"Milton surely had a keen interest in people as well as a fantastic intuition. The stories are mind blazingly wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to Erickson's methods","review":"Quite an interesting read, there are plenty of examples of Erickson's unique methods. However, there is little about hypnosis. That is by no means a shortcoming, but some would expect a book on Erickson to be heavy on hypnosis. Haley shows that Erickson was a man of varied approaches, always choosing methodology based upon the circumstances, not a preset frame of reference. Well worth the money and the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Swan House","review":"I must say that I was disappointed in this novel. I loved Swan House, so when Elizabeth Musser's, Dwelling Place was published, I immediately bought it. It was a little too religious for me. The main character of the book called her parent's religious talk, \\"babble', and I felt like the religious parts in this book were also \\"babble\\". It dragged in the middle but grew a bit more interesting toward the end. I also could not get into Musser's writing about France in the late 1960's. Although I was too young to experience the Civil Rights issues during the 1960's in the South and more specifically, Atlanta, I could still relate to those stories in Swan House. I know I am being candid, but if you loved Swan House, Dwelling Place will disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dwelling Place.","review":"I loved this book. The details Ms. Musser shares put me right in the middle of Atlanta, Georgia. I could see the beautiful places and smell the flowers. Ms. Musser is not afraid to be real about her stories as far as tragedy and things not working out. I have read many sappy stories where everyone is happy and everything works out. I know this is fiction, but it lends itself to being believable. I really like the truth she writes in her fiction about how things really are. The racism, the bullying, the terrible things that were done to blacks in the south. Ms. Musser has become my favorite author in 2012. I can't put her books down.

The in-wall cable is high-quality HDMI and I got no interference running it directly from the receiver to the projector in the wall. After installing the plate, my projector flickers and cuts in and out. I guess I'll just go with a cheap cable pass-thru plate. Blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem Connection","review":"I made the mistake of using two of these connectors; one at the wall mount for the AV receiver and one at the wall mount for the LED TV. While installation was easy, there was so much signal loss that between the three cables (AVR to wall, inside wall, wall to TV) the TV could not pick up the signal. I tried about four different kinds of cables, and found only one manufacturer's three foot cable that would transmit signal to the TV. If I inserted an L connector, that was enough interference to destroy the signal. I assumed my problem was the AVR or the wall cable which was a Monster M1000. After I read the first review here, I removed the cables to go connectors, and replaced them with simple pass throughs. It completely solved the problem. Now all cables work regardless of length (including an 8 foot monster cable). Unfortunately, it took me too long to figure out the problem to return these connectors. I would never use them again or ever recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book for Titanic Fans","review":"This is an extraordinary book that I bought myself for my birthday, being a fan of all Titanic motion pictures, the Illustrated Screenplay gives us the whole idea of how the big Titanic movie was made. It includes several scenes that were deleted due to pacing, and others that were never shot. People, this movie would have lasted about 4.5 hours if it hadnt been cut! Still, I would have loved to see those scenes since several of them were key elements to the movie. In addition it includes Cameron's point of view on the movie, Titanic History and much more. Not to mention the dozens of photos of the movie, including of those never seen scenes. If you liked the movie, BUY this book, you won't regret it. Now I am just hoping that a special DVD of Titanic is released in the future with all these cut scenes...and there wouldnt be any problem shooting those that were left in the dust...they are the masters of digital photography!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's weird to have seen the movie and now to read the script","review":"I really liked how I have seen the movie so many times and now I have the chance to read the script.

It is jam packed with superb photos on good quality paper. It was also interesting to read a real \\"screenplay\\" with all the deletions (which are interesting to find out about), ad libs by the cast, moving of scenes etc. I really enjoyed this movie and reading the script brings the movie to life in a different but totally absorbing way.

The only option is to listen to an entire CD from start to finish. So don't plan to listen to this on anything other than a dedicated CD player...The presence of this copy-protection mechanism isn't disclosed anywhere on the outside of the album.The music itself is only so-so.

Then I heard what sounded like Flaccid Rock to me- just boring folkrock.Then I listened to this and found out what people were raving about. This is great psychedlica-folk-weirdness that is pretty but not precious or too-sweet. In that respect, it's like Broadcasts' \\"Investigation of Witch Cults\\", in that it's almost more psychedelic than some pieces from the real psychedelic era, probably owing to the more-advanced technical and recording capabilites of today's studio, as well as a lack of any need to sound commercial in any way, due to the rise of independent labels.So, yeah- get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dungen - self-titled (Subliminal Records)","review":"Looks to be Dungen's first out of (I'm guessing) six CD offerings.

Personnel: Gila Storm - vocals, Gustav Ejstes - guitar, keyboard, flute & vocals, Alex Wiig - sitar, Marco Lohikari - bass, Linus Gustafsson - saxophone and Fredrik Bjorling - drums.

The story is a twist on several familiar fairy tales - with a somewhat happy ending, although the little girl wouldn't say so. The moral?

(the lead singer sounds like Randy Newman with the flu?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"File under Joe Grushecky","review":"After reading the hype and Bruce comparisons I a purchased this record. As Lloyd Bentson once said, \\"Senator, I know Bruce Springsteen, and you are no Bruce Springsteen\\". While the song structures and melodies are o.k., this record lacks the Boss' heart and inner-conviction, too busy trying to imitate and definitely not worth the generous hype. Always beware of the \\"new\\" Dylan or Bruce tags, they're probably just a record company marketing ploy to sell records like this to suckers like me.."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band doesn't know how to rock!","review":"This CD was VERY disappointing. It's just bad. No musicality, boring clichéd lyrics, no passion. The vocals sound almost highschool-ish. One thought kept going through my head as I listened to it - \\"Yet Another CorporateRock Experiment\\". I.e. it's obvious to me, when you finally give into the hype and listen to Marah, that they are just another corporate country/rock formula band - just another insipid \\"revival\\" band, playing lackluster country-rock to appease middle-aged babyboomers who are afraid to finally let go of old, tired music.Sure, if Marah was actually a good band, this revivalism would be excusable, even enjoyable. We all love the classic rockers - Springsteen, etc. But man, if you're gonna rip off a musical style, AT LEAST BE GOOD AT IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"Frank Zappa once said that pop music's saving grace is its audience's lousy memory; people will think something is new because they forgot the artists who did the same thing in the past. No one has forgotten Springsteen, however, and because Marah sound so much like his early albums, it's hard not to compare. The sound is there (the singer could be a stand in for the Boss), and on the first few listens, I thought I'd really found something. But the songs aren't good enough to sink in. There are some interesting lyrics, but a bunch of lousy ones, too. Maybe a good band will be inspired by this E-Street banjo sound and take it to the next level. Maybe Marah will mature a bit and take it there themselves. If you've got the cash, check it out, if you're scraping the bottom of your piggy bank, think twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the hype about this CD?","review":"I read numerous reviews about these guys, from semi-well-respected publications (at least in my book). After listening, I'm left wondering...what is all the hype about? Can't reviewers find any better albums to talk about? Musically, they aren't bad to listen to, but there isn't anything on this album we haven't heard before. For many of us dying to find the next, great new band to listen to, and to inspire us, this isn't the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"A solid album with strong pop sensibilities underlying mid-tempo rock. If you're looking for weepy ballads or head banging, you won't find it here. What you will find is an album with about 6 or 7 really strong songs. Perfect it ain't, but it's hard enough to find the talent to pull off that many gems these days.\\"My Heart Is the Bums on the Street\\" has an infectious little groove, and \\"Round Eye Blues\\" has the lyrical sensibilities of a Tim O'Brien book (it works on a couple other levels too). Other standouts are \\"Faraway You,\\" \\"Point Breeze,\\" and \\"Barstool Boys.\\" Root around online for MP3 of their live version of The Replacements \\"Can't Hardly Wait,\\" also.

This album is bad! First time I heard it, I thought it was a spoof on something, maybe a Weird-Al type album. But no! These dudes are supposed to be real!Marah's sound on this CD is similar to what would be produced by a bunch of embarrassingly drunk frat boys on ''open-mic night'' at the local sports bar. No innovation, no emotion, silly self-important vocals, and it certainly doesn't rock enough to be called ''rock-n-roll''. I've lived in Philly for 18 years, and, trust me, Marah does NOT represent my city musically, nor even literally - many Philly references on this album, names, places, etc, are completely fictional.

Vincent Crane has a much harder edge to his sound than Keith Emerson of ELP (whom I also think is great).

I am just saddened that he let his darkness get to him back in 1989.I hear Keith Emerson all over this disc yet it is not him, not a copy of him, just a similar style. While Keith took his direction in a more classical style, Vince Crane stuck with his dark blues/progressive vision and played it to the max.This is great stuff and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some bad information","review":"I bought this book hoping to get a good understanding of animation fundamentals.

One section of the book deals with current psychology and provides some comparison on issues such as psychological development (Jung) and highlights a concept that \\"women's spiritual experience\\" is not represented in historical tradition.

I am very open minded when it comes to movies. I like everything documentaries, adventure, Sci-fi, etc... so flicks like this are often in my Que. But, this movie was boring and tedious. Hipster couples talking about there stupid hipster poop over and over till you just want to jump through the screen and punch them saying \\"Grow the hell up!\\". It's a nice try by the film maker but it is obviously playing to a different crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unknown Hair Band..","review":"I recently Discovered this band.Bought the cd and was surprised how goodthis cd is.Songs like Heartbreak,Heartache,Renegade are just Great Rockers.This cd is a Gem,If Anyone who reads this should buy this it'sworth it.Especially if your a die hard like me,and love the hair stuff-get it you won't be Dissappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mirror ball","review":"Mirror ball is basketball-sized and hangs by a good sized metal eye bolt. Motor casing is a little flimsy, but sturdy enough to hold the ball. Weak link is definitely the spotlight. Color lenses are nice, but light is just too dim to be useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"My most recommended album","review":"I bought this CD on a whim, and as soon as I put it on, my jaw dropped. This is a stunningly beautiful, dark, moody CD. Well written, great instrumentation, and most of all, sung with one of the most haunting voices I've heard for a long time.I am recommending this CD to all my friends and family who love music as much as I do, and so far I've not heard one person comment who wasn't also bowled over by it.Based on this CD, I have now purchased the rest of Oh Susanna's catalog, and while none of them are quite as awesome, in my opinion, none of them have disappointed me. This is a much overlooked CD by a criminally overlooked artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"You better not have two left feet or be a beginner...","review":"I bought this DVD because it said it included \\"beginner modifications so anyone can do it\\" on the packaging. I tried it once and only made it through the first 10 minutes. The warm-up with weights did have modifications (don't use weights). However, the aerobic steps were very complicated. So much so I could not begin to keep up. Admittedly,I have two left feet, but this was so complicated I will not even try again. If you do not have experienced in aerobics or have trouble picking up complicated moves, buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Firm Workout","review":"I'm a HUGE Firm follower and this DVD is good. If you are already a firm follower, it will be an easy DVD to follow. If you are a beginner, it will be a good one to set the pace. The moves are easy to follow. It's not as difficult or challenging as some of the others, but I still enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to follow at first","review":"This workout moves really quickly without spending time to explain but after doing the workout several times, I got the hang of it. I also like how the ab exercises are unique and work parts you are not used to working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Solid Workout","review":"This is my first The Firm workout and I am happy with it. I didn't get all of the steps right on the first try, but I expected this and you should, too! It will get easier as I use the video more and learn the workout. I actually think the cuing is pretty decent, which is a high compliment from me because I workout with a toddler underfoot. The cuing is better than many exercise videos out there, but I can see room for improvement on that item to give instructions on right/left foot, etc. It is easy to follow, the cardio steps have good flow, it uses weights and cardio in combination, and I was really sweating by the end! Overall, a great workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Sculpting","review":"The sculpting segments are a great workout. Every muscle in my body burns afterward.Not crazy about the cardio, however. It is so fast and poorly instructed that I get frustrated and end up hopping in place. Emily isn't my favorite instructor. Her voice is often monotone and it doesn't match the speed and intensity of the exercises.Overall, I enjoy this workout and hope to catch on to the cardio a little more each time I pop the DVD in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I don't consider myself to have two left feet, nor am I an aerobics expert. As someone somewhere in the middle, I found this to be far too complicated to get through. The cueing is truly awful and the instructor doesn't take time to intro the moves and get you comfortable with the routine. Maybe the strength routine is better, but even after multiple tries, I couldn't get past the cardio section, so I really wouldn't know.With so many better, user-friendly and well-produced products on the market, it's not even worth bothering with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"cuing where?","review":"Time and time again I give this workout a try but the step always get me upset. The warm up trows my off, when she says double I don't know what I am suppose to double. The plus side is that I do sweat a lot and that we do squats and lunges. She also includes an ab section. I am very disappointed, I wish I would have saved my money for a different Firm workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not liking this one","review":"I wrote a review for this before, but have changed it since doing the DVD a couple of times. While Emily seems to be a good instructor (Cardio Sculpt Fusion aka Total Body Lite), this DVD outright is terrible. Her cueing is subpar, especially in the warmup. There were a lot of step touches, pivots, punch punches, etc. She only goes slow a couple of times, then ramps up the speed like a guinea pig on acid. The strength training is okay, but doing the lunge/row/overhead press combo was tough on my back, plus she was never specific on what leg to be using. So I just alternated legs. Her cardio was okay, nothing exciting. I had to modify some of the bouncing around. The ab work was probably my favorite- a variety of moves in different positions. I enjoyed the standing ab work as well. Overall this video was sub par, especially if you have two left feet and have trouble keeping up with all the step changes. Defintely try something by Alison or Rebekah instead if you want consistency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Energetic!","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by the Firm series, this video is no exception. Emily is fun without being overly aggravating. Some days I just want a quick workout instead of the usual grind and sweat. This is it. The choreography is a bit much, but it is worth sticking with and learning how to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love the Firm, but I'm very disappointed with this and the other new Firm DVDs. Some of the four-limb segments are good, but I find the aerobics segments unnecessarily complicated and they don't even raise my heart rate. With my older Firm DVDs, I always feel like I've had a workout; with these new ones, I don't. Also, these new routines feel harder on my knees (because of twisting more than impact) and back. I have minor back problems, and I find myself modifying the moves in these new DVDs to protect my back from being strained/\\"put out.\\" And I miss the fannylifter/transfirmer. I don't know if these changes are because Gaiam now owns the Firm, but I really hope they go back to the more intense, more straight forward routines. I would return this one and get my money back if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing perspective","review":"A different perspective on the study and practice of herbs as useful plants.

The description says its size is appropriate for children from two to four years old. Perhaps... for a prodigiously large two year old :-)My daughter liked it so much that she did not want to take it off after she tried it on. At the Christmas show where she acted a squirrel, the costume received compliments from parents. I think that the picture at Amazon.com does not quite do the costume justice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"After glancing at some reviews, I had high hopes of getting a more in depth and precise understanding of digital copyright law. What I found though was a book, while effectively advancing some broad arguments, did not provide me with the kind of in depth detail that I would expect from a first rate book. At the end of the book, I cannot say that I better understand what is legal, what is not legal, and what is unclear in the modern age of digital copyright.If you want an overview and critique of the context and process in which copyright laws have been passed, then this book might be for you. But if you're looking for a detailed explanation and investigation of current copyright laws, I think this book will leave you hanging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Product","review":"The BallQube baseball holder was exactly what I needed.

I promptly bought several copies for all of my friends. This is an amazingly enjoyable read and now that it is back in print and AVAILABLE, buy it. You won't regret it. I just bought another copy to send to my friend in Germany as it was out of print for several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully romantic novel!","review":"The premise of this book is very creative and romantic, namely that a goddess of the moon comes to earth every full moon to be with her earthly lover, who is a very unusual character in his own right.The story's form reminded me of parts of Somerset Maugham's \\"Razor's Edge\\", where most of the characters are living petty lives filled with trivial pursuits, even though they form a group of friends. But the main character, as in \\"Razor's Edge\\", is a unique and extraordinary man. Only at the end of Lunatics do the group members put aside their pettiness to help each other.Definitely worth a read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed even though I didn't wanna' be :<","review":"I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED Blackburn by Denton and figured I'd equally love everything else he'd written, but it really felt as if lost interest in this book about 3/4's of the way through it.

I was afraid it would drag, but when I finished the 6th tape, I wanted to know more about Jerry and his horse, Fan. Who did Jerry marry? Did he have cowboy sons of his own? Did Fan become a stunt horse? Read the reviews of the printed version to learn more about the story; I don't want to give any of it away. It is a wonderful odyssey tale for anyone who loves the wide-open spaces of America. There is an interesting link to the \\"Lonesome Dove\\" saga and Charlie Goodnight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!!!","review":"Even after reading the other glowing reviews for this product, I still wasn't sure that this would live up to the hype for a preschooler who knew most of the shapes. But it did! The \\"songs\\" help reinforce shapes, like heptagon vs. hexagon. My daughter is singing the songs and talking about trapezoids like it is a commonplace shape that all 3 year olds know.I bought this DVD to test it out on something my daughter basically understood before purchasing the DVDs in the series which cover new concepts for her. Needless to say, we have gotten 2 more Munchkin Math DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"out of date topic & procedures","review":"Manual bookkeeping in lot of detail but we live in a computerized world.

An author who sees things from all angles of what arelationship should consist of. This book takes us on a journey into the woman'smind while revealing all the secrets of men.

I am biased on the issue of Ronald Reagan, I am a huge fan of his. I wasn't angry just because the book was mostly in criticism of Reagan, but I didn't like that it showed more bad than good, and I think that that is unfair. However, after reading through the whole book (an encouraged practice before making a judgement, and writing a review), I found that, while I believe that Kenneth Walsh is anti-Reagan, he did an okay job of portraying the good side of Reagan as well, but by no means sufficient. I don't think that this book is what it says it is: an unbiased portrait of the Reagan legacy; but rather, a censure in disguise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, funny pictures.","review":"The modern language and entertaining pictures make this fun for me as well as my grandchildren."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only ONE reel sent, not SIX.

Other reviews said it would take a couple days in which you may see an increase in mice, but then they should disappear. Well I gave it 3+ weeks and I still have mice. I plugged it in right where I know they are entering my apartment, so not as if it's not in the proper placement. I'm back to using inhumane glue traps, but that is the only thing that seems to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted money","review":"I'm starting to think this thing actually attracts mice.

Nice variety of papers to play with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware Shipping Damage","review":"Everything was great except the boxes of photo paper inside the shipping carton were not protected. Consequently one corner of each box was bashed and I had to return the entire order.

It is not one of my favorates, but does have 3 out of 4 favorate songs. I love \\"A Man Has Needs\\" (we do, girls), and \\"I Am Cow\\". I like \\"Rocks and Trees\\", but mainly because during a dark depression the worms singled me out and made me feel good about myself. They have great plays on words, the4y have hidden puns (that alot of people miss), and are able to laugh at us and others with out being hurtful. One one of the space shuttle missions, the worms were played (\\"Dangerous\\" on a diff. album. They are fun and make great gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-wrenching Documentary","review":"I had read quotes from critics who said this \\"drama\\" [my quotes] was a regrettable adaptation of historic events by amateur film-makers who had slapped together a potentially fine story, with poor editing, music, and technical support. While my wife and I did find some technical rough spots, we soon realized that we were watching a true documentary with here and there a dramatization that made the events more comprehensible. We were amazed at learning the details of a history which we had only vaguely known about. Many of our previous miscopnceptions were set straight, and by the end of the film we found ourselves profoundly moved. A must-see film for Jews (even non-practicing ones like ourselves), and recommended for all others with an interest in human history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great For Minorities / Woman Entrepreneurs","review":"But I'm not a minority or a woman.

The only thing that bothered me was the vocals. However, after the 3rd or 4th listen they grew on me. It was hard for me to grow accustomed because I have never really heard a singer that sounds like that before. In fact, I would go as far to say that he makes some of the songs. In the climax of \\"Spring Divorce\\" (which is my favorite song) he screams \\"Are you scared? Are you scorned? Are you sick? Are you bored? Do you feel cheated? Do you feel lost? Is this not what you signed up for?\\". The definate high point of the album for me. Other great songs include: Belly Full of Hell, Dancing On The Face of Pan, and Dying by Degrees. This is a definate must buy for fans of Bear vs. Shark, Blood Brothers, and These Arms Are Snakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Planes Mistaken For Stars","review":"I remember hearing these from my friend two years ago. While it's not the same band I remember hearing (I didn't catch them when they first started), they've definitely matured from great to even more great. The vocals have changed quite a bit, but it's still great.\\"Belly Full Of Hell\\", \\"Dying By Degree\\", \\"Pigs\\" are probably some of my favorite songs by this band.

Was appalled by the quality. It looks as though it's been photocopied--and on a cheap machine! The print is splotched and broken, evidence of a multiple-generation copy.

He tried to change his style or something, but it just sounds like babytalk or someone whining in half the songs. The other ones, it sounds like he's trying to outwit someone as HALF-witted as 50 cent. Esoteric could've destroyed any mainstream fool in moments with his style and speed in freestyles, but that level of hardcore raw rap has dropped with this album. 7L i was never a huge fan of anyway, but I did respect many of his beats.

Therefore, i figured no way they would charge me 30 bucks for one tube! I was right. I was sent 24 tubes.Now, about the product itself. It works great and leaves your lips with a nice tingly feeling.

One thing that you might want to know before buying this is that on Bring Me to Life there is no male voice already recorded on there to sing the other parts with you, so you might want to find someone willing to accompany you if you want to perform it or anything. Also, on Tourniquet, it can be difficult to sing the first phrase of the song as there is already a recorded voice singing that part. This voice does not sing in the same rhythm as the one you hear on Fallen, so it can and most likely will throw you off. The same goes for Haunted, but it's not as bad. Still, this CD has karaoke versions of Evanescence songs that you probably won't find on any other CD, including Breathe No More, Farther Away, and of course, Haunted and Tourniquet. This CD would be great for any Evanescence fan to have so I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Karaoke CD Evanescence vol.1","review":"On CD : good quality sound, good musical performanceOn Amazon : excellent serviceThank you for all.

Ms. Berg has usually been able to rise to the top of the genre, giving in-depth presentations that were wise and complex, but with this book she joins the ranks of the paperback mentality of chick lit. Scratch the surface, have someone die, have someone in therapy reliving the sins of childhood. Yikes. Avoid it if you want a good deep read. If you're reading on the bus and just want a movie-of-the-week rendition of a complex issue, by all means, have this twinkie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best book, by far","review":"I like Elizabeth Berg's novels. Usually, they are emotionally right on target. This one, however, is off base. She's writing about deep issues between a daughter and the mother who abused her. As a psychotherapist I think Berg has over-simplified the issues; and, as a result, the whole book felt flimsy to me.The end seemed unoriginal, and unreal. It didn't fit with all the prior emotional intensity. It was almost as if Berg got tired of the book and decided to wrap things up in a bow.If this had been my first book by Berg I would not read another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth Berg Shines Again...","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that I am a huge fan of Ms. Berg's writing - I have rarely found a writer who is able to capture the level of detail and nuance found in her books. I also find that each book has a \\"theme\\" - usually involving some sort of family crisis which precipitates a major upheaval in the main character's life. This book is no exception, and she deals sensitively (and humorously, at times) with the issues of family secrets, dysfunctions, and ultimately - forgiveness. I always find myself devouring her books (usually within a day) and coming away with a deeper level of understanding of my own life and relationships. I recommend this book highly to anyone who has ever struggled with \\"family issues\\" and longed to find the road to forgiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do a lot better Elizabeth","review":"I work in a library and couldn't wait for this book to come in. I think I've read nearly everything Berg has written but was so disappointed in this book. Perhaps because I had just read a true-crime book about real child abuse, this story seemed hollow and sloppily put together and never rang true. The characters were undeveloped and too shallow. Was this written quick to satisfy some contract with the publisher? Sure seems like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring as hell","review":"I was not at all impressed with this book. I was in suspense waiting to hear of that horrible things Caroline had dealt with and how they would be handled by her mother, but the descriptions were rather bland. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it Over Yet?","review":"I found myself not caring what happened to any of the characters in this book. They were totally unsympathetic but, still, there were some horrific issues and I wanted them resolved before the book ended. Imagine my surprise when I turned the page and discovered the book had ended. No resolution. No confrontation. Just a vague sentence that left me truly disliking both the characters and the woman who created them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in emotional depth and character development","review":"I loved Berg's earlier works, like Talk Before Sleep and Range of Motion, but this latest book is not worth reading. Now that Berg is putting out a book each year, she has sacrificed the sensitivity and depth I saw in her previous works. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Was The Mending?","review":"The main character, Laura, has an unbelieveable view of the world. The male characters are so stereotypical and two dimensional that they serve no purpose in the story. No wonder she is unable to deal with any family problems. The whole book is spent dancing around the relation between her sister and mother who are also underdeveloped. Once we finally identify the problem the book ends with the solution of going shopping together. Wow! If you are looking for a way to mend do not waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Berg?","review":"I'd read Berg's writing book and decided to check out one of her novels. I believe, at least according to other reviewers, this isn't the best one. The story was okay, but the writing and characterization were fair. I was very disappointed after reading her book on writing (Escaping into the Open)--which was delightful.The Art of Mending left out the \\"art\\" part of it. It was difficult to finish because it seemed to be a rough draft--where the characters were just beginning to be fleshed out, but not quite there yet. There was no real climax. It read more like a boring memoir. And it didn't ring true in many places. The mother never seemed like a real person, just a pawn to move the story forward.I'm sure Berg is capable of better, so I'll read a couple of her other books. But this one fell flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Elizabeth Berg has been a favorite author of mine since I read RANGE OF MOTION. Since then, I've read all her books, and although some haven't been quite up to the bar she set with her first couple of books, I've never been truly disappointed until now. THE ART OF MENDING simply isn't up to her standards. The characters, the plot, even the writing seem to belong to a lesser author. I finished the book--after all, it was Elizabeth Berg!--but by the end, I felt cheated. RECOMMENDATION: WAIT FOR THE PAPERBACK."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's too bad.","review":"let me preface by saying that i am an ardent elizabeth berg fan, however, this book just does not meet the mark she set for herself with such fantastic pieces as \\"durable goods\\" and \\"joy school.\\" the writing is still classic berg, but i find it stale in this work because there is no story to ground it. the story is weirdly predictable and i found the characters unimaginative and uninteresting. it seems as if berg was trying to take a cliched story and turn it into something prolific by throwing in some futile last-minute twists and shockers. however, those methods fail, as they always do. it is too little, too late. berg is at her best when the writing is clear and honest and driven, and here the focus of the book is muddy and boring, not to mention trite. i am let down, yes, but i look forward to a brighter berg future. after all, every author has an off book once in awhile, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You call that an ending?!","review":"I bought this book because I had just read a book by Elizbeth Berg that I loved (Say When). This book started great and I was flying through it. I suddenly realized that I had at most 10 pages to go before the book was done and there was absolutely NO WAY the story was going to have a solid ending. I was right, it didn't. For the amount of emotional build-up the novel had, the ending was so completely ridiculous. Laura's sister, Caroline, sopposedly endured a horrible childhood due to her mother. The whole entire book was about the injustices Caroline suffered at the hands of her mother and about obtaining her siblings acknowledgement of such things. And then it just ended. Caroline suddenly forgets her YEARS of misery (that we spent PAGES reading about) and then the book is complete?

I can honestly say it was a likely candidate for the world's worst book. If you haven't read this book yet, DON'T. If you own it, all I can say is don't read the last chapter.

Kaye's books were very good and interesting for maybe the first 10, 15 or so. But when the Plague trilogy started, you could tell she was only doing this to get money. How ridiculous was that trilogy? Back to the last book, I can't get over how awful it was! If you haven't read it yet, don't read it at all, it's a complete waste of money and time. I picked 1 star because that's the lowest possible rating. If it were an option, I would have given it negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amy, On Her Own","review":"This book is very unrealistic. I did not like it at all. It was a horrible way to end a fairly good series. The main character, Amy, is faced with yet another life shattering problem. The loss of the extraordinary genetic ablilities that she was blessed with. She and her genetic mate (Andy) must find out why this is happening. When everything turns out to be fine, all of the Project Crescent clone are happy. That is, except Amy. She feels like she has turned into a new person. She decides to get her powers back. The procedure that allows her to do so also enhances other qualities that she did not have before. She turns into a super-hero (she can fly and everything). None of the other clones get the procedure, making her the only clone let with super ablilties."},{"rating":"1","title":"a star just because of the other books","review":"i would have really given this book one star, but since i loved all the other books i gave it an extra. THIS IS THE WORST BOOK IN THE WHOLE SERIES!!! i mean, why would amy want to be the only clone left? it doesn't seem right. you need all the clones! and no guys she ends up with. the whole moving to malibu when nancy and dave got married was totally dumb. i was sad when they got together. and amy saving teh world? this isn't superman. i think if marilyn kaye made the right decision of making this the last book, because if all the future ones are like this...that would be very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series is great, don't get me wrong.","review":"But this book...it just....how should I put it, sucked!

I was twelve when I started reading and am now fifteen...Marilyn Kaye's ending was atrocious. The entire, miraculous three pages she spent to end the tale probably took about twenty seconds.

So, yes, the tunes are long and complex but not all that great to listen to. The one glorious exception is We All Need Some Light which comes darned close to to classic Genesis (\\"Entangled\\"). Given the skill of the players it makes you realize how difficult it is to replicate the lushness of the classic Genesis/King Crimson/Mellotron sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Noodling","review":"First: I am a huge fan of Spock's Beard and to a lesser extent progressive music in general. One of the reasons I like the band and many of Morse's projects is because it is just plain good music. I am not one of those prog-rock guys that listens to nothing but odd-time-20-miunte-jam-fairies-on-the-mountain tunes. If you are one of those guys (and you know who you are) you will dig this album. For me, it was a few interesting ideas and textures, but the majority of the music didn't really seem to go anywhere. No question about the talent involved, but it just seemed that in terms of the songs, production, etc. it is a poor substitute for Spock's Beard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Wow!

(Hey buddy, no offence. I just STRONGLY disagree with you!)Actually there is just one draw back and that's the last track. A bit too freaker! But the first 59 minutes of the album triply make up for this one. And hey, if you're into Yes's \\"Relayer\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Umma Gumma\\" then you don't got a thing to worry about!But,if you're anything like myself and a few buddies of mine; if you really do like \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\", \\"Trick of the Tail\\", and \\"Selling England by the Pound\\"; if you enjoy true progressive rock: This is the album for you!Enjoy!CMC"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best art rock","review":"I never thought I would listen to something like this at the turn of the century. What a wonderful surprise. If you were missing something that could sound like Yes'\\"Relayer\\" perfectly mixed with ELP's \\"Brain salad surgery\\" and with a touch of Genesis and even the Beatles, well, then the moment arrived: buy this album, it won't let you down. As a reviewer said, it is simply sublime. Now, I know that we have some modern groups like \\"Magellan\\" that play art rock but without giving up prog-metal riffs and power chords. But this is quite distinct, anyway, cause this sounds almost like \\"lovely old-fashioned seventies' art rock\\". Moreover, it doesn't look like Trevawas's Marillion or Portnoy's Dream Theater at all (well, i don't know Flower Kings nor Spock's beard yet). It is completely another thing. Ok, summarizing, what i do actually know is that when I listened to this it reminded me why i love music so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Progressive\\", not progressive","review":"This is a studious tribute to the classic Prog Rock sound of Genesis, Yes, and ELP of course. But what this CD lacks is the magic that made these older bands shine.Yes and Genesis did what they did and the public called it Progressive. They were simply being progressive (lowercase p). SMPTe sounds like these bands. They set out to make Prog Rock. But it is not progressive. They lack the visionary and charismatic leadership that Peter Gabriel, Jon Anderson, and Fish brought to their bands. The singer (Neal Morse) has a nice voice. His voice and compositions remind me of the great power pop of Jellyfish (\\"The King is Half-Undressed). No magic, just exceptional musicianship.I do enjoy listening to this CD.

I won't go track-by-track because it is so consistent, plus the first track accounts for about half the (jam-packed) cd. Solid musicianship, outstanding songwriting, very dynamic in its highs, lows, mellow and blistering rock.If I had one wish, with this and the other Transatlantic cd, it would be that Neal Morse, whom I adore, would step back a little and let it be more of a collaboration. His style is stamped all over these songs, his is the voice for the majority of the lyrics, and in a lot of ways this could easily be mistaken for another Spock's Beard release. No, that's not a bad thing, but this was a chance for something more different.You can tell by the stars that I'm not letting that diminish the enjoyment.

The three more long and complex songs \\"All of the above\\", My new world\\" and \\"In held\\" are top class composition. The other two act more like some filler to complete the album.

The talents of these four gentlemen, coming from Marillion, Dream Theater, Spock's Beard and Flower Kings was fused into this production. It's living proof that prog rock is FAR from being dead: moreover it lives in productions such as this one, to make the concept available to the new generations who missed the Genesis, the Yes and the Pink Floyd of the seventies.It delivered a LOT of feeling, even during the first piece (which is almost 31 minutes long): something that some bands have failed at over and over, i.e. keeping the faith of the listener all throughout a 15-plus-minute-long song.This is a definite reco for your collection if you're serious about prog-rock and music at large."},{"rating":"2","title":"What dude?!?!","review":"First thought....

The sound is certainly \\"prog\\" and reminds me of Genesis and Yes from the early seventies. The CD's opening number \\"All Of The Above\\" clocks in at just under 31 minutes. The song soars with wonderful vocals from Neal Morse. Morse's keyboards take turns with Roine Stolt's wonderful guitar to create a unique sound that you won't be able to get enough of. Pete Trewavas is a revelation as he does his best Chris Squire imitation providing jaw dropping moments. Mike Portney does a great job of adjusting to a new sound and showcases his solid drumming skills. (Can this guy do everything?) Spock's Beard, Flower Kings, Marillion and Dream Theater fans should all enjoy this CD. The music is most similar to Spock's Beard and much less so to Dream Theater.

Roine Stolt's guitar playing is ever bit as captivating as Eric Clapton's, and Mike Portnoy is a drumming genius. Same for Pete, who may be a better bassist than (the great) Chris Squire is these days. Great songs. If you like progressive epics, and if you like The Beatles, The Who, Pink Floyd and the instrumental sounds of Yes, you will love this recording. Also get their second CD, \\"Bridge Across Forever,\\" as well as their \\"Live in Europe\\" DVD. The latter, without argument, is the best concert film ever.

Invest your money, and specially your time, in Isaac Bashevis Singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't meet expectations","review":"I had eagerly awaited reading this book but found it neither as bad as some reviewers have stated nor as perfect as others. The stories are thought-provoking, interesting and have nice touches. But the endings always left me disappointed. Other than a chance to learn about a different culture I probably wouldn't recommend the book to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another Blood Libel!","review":"An angry young man who finds libeling Orthodox Jews the best way to vent his personal frustrations, this author like so many others, misses the main point. A overwhelming majority of Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox Jews are extremely happy with their situations and live very satisfied meaningful lives. Let the author or some of some of his fans come spend a Shabbos in a Chassidic Community such as Boro Park, and will find out that fact is very different than fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and sad","review":"I have to admit: I was prejudiced. O no, not another book on Jewish culture. O no, not short stories.Yes, it is a book on Jewish culture and yes, it is a book with short stories. But the main thing is: it is extremely well written, it is at times funny (the Protestant guy who suddenly knows for certain that he is Jewish, the orthodox man who for once is allowed to visit a prostitute and ends up with a venereal disease) and at times deeply sad (the group of Polish Jews who accidently escape transport to the concentration camp and have to survive by pretending they are the acrobats they are not, the \\"accidental writer\\" murdered by Stalin).Every story in the book is a little gem, every story forces you to think. I look forward to Nathan Englander's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly Over Rated","review":"This was another book I was given by a friend who said \\"you gotta read it!\\" Well, read it I did and I am wondering what all the hype (my friend and the media frenzy) is about. These are pre-digested, tightly edited stories that are so seriously derivative of Isaac Bashevis Singer that it's outrageous! I can only imagine that the reviewers haven't ever read Singer's work.It seems that the appeal here is that they deliver an easily comprehended story. Listen, if you are interested in this kind of writing, read Singer, read Cynthia Ozick, read Saul Bellow and read the real thing, not a clever re-working of earlier, better writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written - a good read","review":"Nathan Englander's For the Relief of Unbearable Urges is a continuously appealing collection of short stories full of wit and creativity with a sadness hovering over each story. Orthodox Judaism, the common thread throughout all of the stories, is often the main focal point of each tale such as in one of the stories in this collection, \\"The Gilgul of Park Avenue.\\" As a non-Jew, it is very interesting to be able to step into the lives of the characters and see life from their point of view. Most of the short stories in this collection take place in New York, where Englander grew up. All nine stories are well crafted and educational introducing new language and different perspectives of the world from a traditional Jewish background. Although there are some shaky parts, I would recommend this collection to anyone who would like to read insightful literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"For The Relief of Urges, Better This Book, Than a Prostitute","review":"What can one add to the reviews above and below. Very little. The stories are fantastic, and we are witnessing the debut of a great story teller and crafter of words. Fate can be fickle, and Jewish fate can be even more so. How do you return to a routine after a bombing? How do overcome the dissonance of being an Orthodox pious Jew and working as a department store Santa Claus? What if you have your greatest creative epiphany in the moments prior to execution? I guess you just get on with it, read this book, and laugh. What else can one do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short Stories","review":"I never read short stories, but picked up this book because of the intriguing title. This collection is brilliant, a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"overhyped","review":"if you want to read great short stories without the hype and hyperbole read Ken Kalfus' \\"Thirst\\" and Andy Plattner's \\"Winter Money.\\" Two great collections that come with minimal endorsements and maximum pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"I quickly tired of Englander's mocking of Orthodox Jews and caricatures of women who just really didn't understand their husbands."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Jewish talent and some offbeat stories","review":"I was taken with several of the stories in this collection, which took me to a world (Orthodox Judaism) that I know little about. I noted the comparisons to the great Isaac Bashevis Singer with interest---and I would agree there seems to be an influence there---but the story of the Gentile who becomes a Jew during an epiphany in a NYC taxicab reminded me very much of one of my favorite stories, Philip Roth's \\"Eli The Fanatic.\\" Read the two of them together; they are excellent explorations of the same fascinating subject, finding religion---and an offbeat one, at that! I will be watching Englander's career; he could become another Singer, another Roth, or his own unique self."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Opening Story is STUNNING","review":"The opening story was startling--I've never read anything like it. It wasn't the tone or the voice that startled--they were familiar in the way that Malamud sounds familiar, in the way that a distant relative you've seen only once before sounds familiar when he tells you a story about your father as a kid in New Jersey. But what happened in the story--the actual story, was so clever and sad and original, that it was hard to turn away.There are many stories like this in the collection. The story about the wig . . . ah, well, I shouldn't say more. And then there are a couple of stories that couldn't hold me in the same way--I skimmed through them and moved on to the great ones. As a whole, a truly remarkable collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reasons for Historical Reliability of the Gospels","review":"The book is an excellent examination of why evangelicals can intelligently understand what it means to view the Gospels as both theological AND historical works. Dr. Blomberg includes discussions on the use of Midrash, form and redaction criticism, and a chapter discussing miracles. I suggest one take notes while reading the book in order to fully comprehend the solutions that Dr. Blomberg offers to many questions that occur in Gospels research. It is not a soft-brained devotional but a toughminded examination for those who are interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answers for hard Hard Questions","review":"Dr. Blomberg sucessfully defends the New Testament from attacks on it's reliability.

Nothing to write home about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't crazy about it","review":"I got this season because when it first came on TV I caught it in the middle and wanted to see it from the beginning. Minus one couple, this season was really boring compared to the other seasons. Didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who knew there were Boring Bridezillas?","review":"I was introduced to the show during later seasons. The current season (6) had become a bit too overly dramatic, even unrealistic (I still don't think any real bride, would smash her cake). So, I found myself longing for calmer, simpler days.Enter Season 1 - the result of subtracting the loud, uncouth, rageful brides and replacing them with quiet, tasteful conservative ones - sure they're nice people in reality, but they make for dull tv. This show was simply about wealthy New York women and the irritations that they go through as putting a wedding together becomes their full time job. So, the show is pretty much about people buying stuff ($4,000 dresses, $10,000 engagement rings, etc). This is how the dullsville that is Platinum Weddings was started.Subsequent Bridezilla seasons had set the bar too high of what a truly demanding bride is for me to be engrossed by this season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it should be","review":"This show is advertised as if you will see brides gone wild. You will see brides become extremely rude and aggressive. You will see brides bringing people to tears. You will see brides fighting with florists and cake makers and venues. You will see brides fight and insult family members and friends to the point of tears.NOT!The show plays it up that you will see brides becaome uncontrolable. But. There are very few arguments, insults, or anything at all happening that would even closely resemble the bridezilla monster this show is supposed to be about.Hardly any of the brides get too upset, or when they do, it's very controlled and mature.Another fault of the show is that too many couples are introduced and their stories dragged out for too many episodes. You get confused as to who is who.Honestly, this show is NOT what they advertise it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book for inspiration","review":"You will enjoy this book! I was delighted to find that there were several \\"how to\\" projects that emulate Leong's trademark look. He truly is an artist. The only reason that I didn't give 5 stars is that I think the book itself is poorly bound. I got my book on Monday and had only looked at it a couple of times when all of the pages came out from the cover (Tuesday). My friend had the same problem with her book. They should have used better glue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classical Book","review":"The classics are must read books. They are short cuts in developing your skills. The only drawback is sometimes its notation. If you want to have a strong background Set Theory by Hausdorff is mandatory. The book is very direct in its approach which requires some attention. Some of its topics are still advanced and no matter what is your field, they may give you some insights in your own expertise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypical Tripe","review":"Purchasing this book was one of the worst consumer decisions I have ever made. The Reverend appears to have some very deep issues that he needs to address. According to him, every interracial relationship is based on some whore-mandingo psychosis. He goes out of his way to invalidate every interracial relationship by using people that seem like worn out caricatures from decades ago.This book was so bad that I didn't want to resell it. Instead I placed it exactly where it belonged, in the trash bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please revise","review":"With all due respect, I think this book is a first draft of a subject matter that could potentially provide its readers with crucial information in the struggle for equality. Further research is needed to substantiate this writer's embarrassing attempt to summarize the social, economic, psychological, sociological, and historical, status of blacks and whites. Although this book was published in 2000, reading its pages, at times, reminds me of the binary logic that has haunted the United States for centuries. After conducting 300 interviews with interracial couples, Gardner disappoints his readers by documenting, what seems to be in the end, a troubling personal fascination of interracial sex.Perhaps the only saving grace for Pastor Gardner is that this \\"book\\" is titled an essay."},{"rating":"2","title":"A calling for all environmental advocates . . .","review":"Voice of the Planet is full of information relevant to any human being who is interested in continuing to use the resources of the Earth. The statistical and scientific information opens the readers eyes to the destruction and rape of the natural world. Each fact strikes at the heart of the reader. This book evokes such strong reactions from its reader than anyone reading it will be empowered to join an environmental cause. This book is an enjoyable and worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exemplifies disrespectful children","review":"The story has a rythm of Mamma calling the duckling \\"Quack, Catch up!\\" and the duckling responds \\"No! I won't catch up!\\". Five or six times this happens! SERIOUSLY!??? Is this the behavior you want your children to emulate????? I knew I didn't like it, but when I heard my 4 year old respond \\"No! I won't ___\\" to what I had just asked her to do, that was the tipping point and this book went in the recycling bin--not even donated, so as not to add to the generation of children already disrespectful to their parents/teachers. Perhaps if there had been some negative cosequence--such as the duckling had actually appeared FRIGHTENED when the alligator appeared--the story would have redeeming value. As it is, I highly recommend NOT purchasing this book--or even checking it out from a library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom of dawdler laughed all the way through","review":"Am I the only mom who always seemed to be saying, \\"Hurry up\\"? At one point, my oldest son said solemnly, \\"But I don't LIKE to hurry.\\" Somehow it was a revelation. Oh. He doesn't LIKE to hurry. Anyone who has dealt with a dawdler will find this book hysterically funny...and great fun to share with kids. Toni Buzzeo has put her finger perfectly on the situation--and her dawdle duckling is a real charmer who doesn't get whapped with some punishment at the end but realizes for himself that there is a time to dawdle and a time to get zippy! Fabulous toddler book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too negative","review":"If you are trying to teach your kids not to talk back, this is not a book you want!

The very first move, they are standing, he whacks the opponent in the sternum (nothing gentle about that) and then proceeds to throw him over his shoulder. So much for the gentle art of self defense. Typical macho idiot (although I probably would not say that to him in a dark alley).For a MUCH better book get the below:http://www.amazon.com/Jiu-Jitsu-Complete-NAKAE/dp/0806504188The book above.. teaches how a tiny lady can take down a humongoid dude with 1 finger.. . now THAT is the gentle art of self defense.Just no comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not as grotesque or titillating as you might expect.","review":"But it's not as professional, either.The main (male) character, especially, seems poorly done. The dialog makes sense (sort of) for 14 or 15-year old geeks, but these guys seem a little too cool for that, and they should be past at least a little of the testosterone poisoning guys suffer from at that age. Maybe it's just that the actors had to be adults, and they were not up to pretending to be high-schoolers. (That happens quite often, of course.)The movie plumbs the utter depths of male misogyny. If you didn't hate the girl who fascinated you in high school and wouldn't give you the time of day (much less \\"give it up\\"), the story, especially the ending, will leave you entirely mystified and repelled.To really LIKE the movie, you'd have to hate that girl a LOT, and maybe you shouldn't be free to walk the streets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Upsetting","review":"I have a very diverse taste in movies, and can normally find SOME good in a film.This one, I did not.I found it disturbing, and not in a good way.It was simply two kids raping a mostly-dead-sort-of-zombie girl, over and over and over. Just that. She stayed chained up for most of the movie, getting raped. I found it truly upsetting and wish I'd never seen it in the first place.I SUPPOSE someone of strange taste could enjoy this film, but I don't see how.I WOULD NEVER, EVER RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Predictable","review":"After reading the reviews and seeing the ratings that this film received, I had high expectations, but it fell flat...way flat. There really isn't anything positive that I have to say regarding this movie. I hated most of the characters and I would have been happy if they had all just died, so this boring movie would have ended sooner. The storyline is original, unfortunately it is also completely predicatable. Also, I watched this movie because I was expecting a horror/suspense film, but there was no terrifying moments and very little suspense. Overall, this film was boring, the characters were flat and unlikable, it was predictable, and a little stupid in my opinion. I would say don't bother watching it, I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN","review":"What a horrible movie. I'm a huge fan of supernatural flicks and horror films but this one was just disturbing. I bought the movie but im contemplating throwing it out.

How many women have rated this movie high? Men who like this movie and even call it arousing SCARE me much more than this movie did. Seriously, if raping women over and over is entertainment to you, even if it's \\"just a movie\\", then you don't even deserve a real girlfriend or wife at all.This is not good entertainment. You're better off watching a proper good film that doesn't pollute your soul and imprint your mind with filth for the rest of your life! There are some things in life you wish you never knew and never saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing new horror movie","review":"I read all the positive reveiws on this movie and decided to try it out for myself and am i glad i did.In a time when boring horror is being shoved into theaters its good to see some goods ones coming to dvd.This movie is part horror/zombie,part comedy and part coming of age and it works well on all of those.It also makes you question the line between right and wrong,whats sick and whats not and what a person does when pushed to far and rejected by someone they love(watch the end to see what i mean).I have to say this is one of the best horror movies ive seen in awhile,well worth the money to purchase and time to watch.Some parts will stay with you long after the credits roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every guys fantasy - sort of","review":"This movie was pretty weird. You can tell by the mixed reactions that it touched some nerves. Without giving away crucial parts of the film I can tell you that what drives this film is the interaction of some guys over a \\"dead girl\\" they find chained up in an abandoned, boarded up mental hospital. She's gorgeous, in a Morticia sort of way and naked and, well, kind of a zombie. Well, boys will be boys and the natural things ensue but this chick is far from natural. The actors act their parts believably even when they are being incredibly stupid. Worth a watch and the ending has a satisfying twist. Sorry I can't say more but I really feel that would be giving away too much. Recommended, but probably not for a first date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I was expecting a lot more from this movie - most of the characters had little redeaming value, making them hard to relate too and in the end you don't care what happens to any of them.

In the beginning they find this girl chained to a gurney inside a room that has been locked for half a century. What would anyone do, serial killers/rapists included? Hmmm, possibly wonder how this girl got inside and is still alive!? Oh no, not the two heroes in this film, not one single question is ever asked about this naked girl. Their immediate response, \\"let's DO her!\\". They further destroy any semblance of a believable reaction when the two heroes start pimping her out to the jocks at their highschool. Naturally not a single one of them ask the question \\"HOW\\". They all just immediately start raping her.

The characters were so dumb and predectible, and the story line just dragged through the whole movie. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE!

I've watched 1000's of horror movies in my life and I just didnt like this one. One could infer many things about the movie and/or plot, but I had a difficult time thinking much past the overwhelmingly graphic scenes of two young boys raping a half dead (zombie) girl.I don't discount violence if it is for the sake of an interesting plot or integral for telling a more diverse story, but my opinion is that it just wasn't there in this movie.I will say on a positive note, the acting wasnt bad for mostly young unknown talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Low Budget Adult Horror","review":"Interesting expose' of juvenile male sex obsession.

Did anyone get the idea that Johnny became an undead when he fell upon the bathroom floor? And why did his guts fall out? Did the same thing happen to TJ and Wheeler? They were bitten to. And what about the dog? Did it become an undead immortal? It would have closed the plot hole if they had showed Johnny lying in the hospital and the doctors trying to figure out how he could possible still be alive.

One wants to pimp her out and the other wants to free her. Then the pimp gets a replacement friend and the humanitarian friend sets out on a rescue mission to free the dead girl. The only thing that made the movie moderately entertaining was that those who fornicated with the dead girl ended up dead.

I see no huge difference between this film and \\"Lar's and the real girl\\" apart from the fact that this girl used to be alive but is not anymore.You cannot rape a zombie people, zombie's do not exist.When faced with the same situation as a young teenage boy, curious and keen for experience who knows what could happen.That's the point and premise of the movie.Carpe Dium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Horror!!!","review":"This is in no way a horror flick. It was actually grotesque. I appreciated the male actor that didn't want anything to do with the dead/undead girl but even in the end he ended up with a dead/ undead girl.

How you could you even sell a movie like this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie sucked!!","review":"Basically, you'll be watching a bunch of immature, low self esteem teenage boys rape a dead girl over and over. At some point, you may think that the characters are going through a phase because they are in high school. But, honestly, all the characters display mental issues, home life problems, and basically it's really about their morals and knowing the difference between right and wrong. The rape scenes are quite disturbing if you analyze it from a humanistic and moral standpoint but if you can't then, eh, it's just a movie. There is NO explanation as to why this girl is dead and still alive. It's not that she's even a zombie needing Brains for dinner.

By the time I was halfway through the book, I wish I'd had someone black out Stan Lee's punishingly unfunny, obnoxious commentary with a marker. Also, those familiar with desktop publishing will take exception to the lame, cookie-cutter, public domain computer graphics that pepper every page like discarded, randomly arranged confetti.
