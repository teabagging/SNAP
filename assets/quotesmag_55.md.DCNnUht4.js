Evocation is a very powerful form of magick, and when performed correctly, can be as much if not more, potent than sex magick or sacrfice.This book was a collection of words, and only words, with no knowledge to share.The material reads more like a self-help book from the psychology section, dealing with fears and phobias that pop-up during the manifestations of that which is invoked. It is foolish to even perform such magick if the conjurer is set in the mind to believe the force is not external, but internal, and this defeats the entire purpose of invoking a force of nature much older and stronger than ourselves for the goal of attaining something. I'd say, 'back to the drawing board.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Foolish hypocrisy.","review":"What a fool.

Even if you are not experiencing any 'midlife crisis' (or think that you aren't), you MUST read this book. And I would highly recommend it for all 20- and 30-somethings as well.

I think that this book, along with Macauly's classic work, are the best books in this area for sparking an interest in the subject of castles, be it history, architechture, or modelling. To the woman who found the illustrations shocking, I say that there is much more graphic violence on TV or in movies.

The text is also very good and many specific terms of the period are explained.

It does what its advertised to do, which is darken things like the sky and reduce reflections. Before you buy this understand that this is gonna make you lose a couple stops when shooting.

The Farooq vs. Ahmed Johnson script was all hot air and no moves, with exception to Ahmed's tasty powerslam on the table of one of Farooq's \\"Nation of Domination\\" people. Suprisingly poor was the Vader vs. Undertaker match. Neither of them really seemed to have their heart in it.

Well none of these things are true. This band is a boring, lifeless, incoherent replica of about 65 million other crappy death metal bands, namely Cattle Decapitation. I know there are people out there that go nuts for this kind of stuff, but it all sounds the same to me. I was totally turned off to this album after listening to about 15 seconds of the first track, and I gave up all hope after about the fourth track, I think, I don't know, every song sounds exactly the same, and I don't really know where one stops and the next begins...I am a fan of this genre of grindcore, if done interestingly and proficiently, but unfortunately, this is not.

I listen to a helluva a lot of different music, and I'm not normally into \\"gore\\" anything. But when I heard that some guys from In Quest were involved in Aborted (at least the singer, obviously), I had to check it out. Not having followed the band through the years may be why my point of view is different from these other guys.From the get-go you can tell what you're in for. Some (sometimes humorous) horror movie samples, death-metal style riffs & drumming, and a combination of hardcore screams and growls. Going back to the guitar and drums... Both are done quite well. It's good enough to make most musicians a little jealous. I also like the vocals more than your average growls.Anyway, check it out, listen to the samples, buy it, and blast it through a hi-fi stereo for best results. Repeat twice daily for two months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gore, this is great!!!","review":"This is precise gore/death metal.

Instead of a heavy duty plastic case, it was a flemsy piece of crap. This however is not the worst part. Some of the DVD's do not work and that is in any system I have tried them in. The DVD's that do work are terrible quality and I think it is because the seller probably ripped the DVD's, made cd labels and then pawned off a \\"new\\" collection on me.

WTF!","review":"Is my 21st Century opinion of what should be a great 1960s tribute. Richie Haven's rich passionate growl and thundering guitar taking possession of classic Beatle and Dylan music was what I was expecting. A shout out and howl to the 1960s, if you will. Little did I think that the most prominent musical era I would hear on this disc would be the artificially indulgent pop of the synthesized machine-drummed 1980s. I wonder if legal restrictions prevented Havens from playing his guitar while recording this music. Seriously, the cheesy synthesizers are a travesty. Hiring Bobby McFerrin to imitate synthesizers on these tracks would only be slightly less annoying. What a let down. What a bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"Driving home today I heard an interview with Richie Havens and he played a couple of songs including Here Comes the Sun. So I went on Rhapsody, and when I saw this album I figured that it would be great. It's awful. The only good songs are those that are simply Havens and his guitar.

Every song sounds like a Pepsi commercial or movie soundtrack during the travel montage. You will forget each song ten seconds into the next song. Its that generic. Heavy keyboards, guitars buried in the mix, and Appice's unspectacular drumming sounds like a drum machine. This is a very pale and very weak immitation of Survivor's \\"Vital Signs\\" album. If you like Survivor clones, then the search is over, here is a big one. Album comes in an \\"environmental friendly\\" (read cheap) cardboard cover. If CD are supposed to last forever, why do you need a degradable CD packaging? Guess they were anticipating alot of people throwing this CD away after one listen.

This album is 75% less heavy than their first release. The band really go for a more commercialized, melodic, lightweight AORish sound here. And you know what? I kinda like it! I mean this album doesn't have any where near the venom the first one did and it's not something I would blast on the cd player on a hot summer day but the thing I like the most about this record are the vocals of Mark Free. He really steps out and sings all of the songs very well as opposed to the first record where to me he sounds a bit hidden behind all the big drums and big guitars. I recommend this cd but be warned it's extremely different from the first one. If you want loud guitars and drums just stick with the first one. But if you want to hear the awesome vocals of Mark Free and you don't mind the music on the lighter side give this a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"this album surely sucks.

Stick to their first one. Its gold"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak overall effort with 2 gems","review":"Without Johnny Marr to compose and perform the music, Morrissey suffers noticeably. Here, \\"Our Frank\\" is a standout, one of Morrissey's best solo tracks (and with good, dramatic accompaniment), and \\"Sing Your Life\\" is likewise strong.Beyond that, however, the album is a dreary wasteland, with only 2 other even bearable tracks (\\"There's a Place ...\\" and \\"Driving Your Girlfriend Home\\"). Unlike some earlier reviewers, I don't feel that just because Morrissey sings it, it's automatically wonderful -- a good tune, varied instrumentation, and meaningful lyrics are also necessary (and too often lacking here)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can be appreciated, but not really enjoyed","review":"For a long time I was a staunch defender of this album against the many who seem to despise it. I think a lot of the music is really ingenious; the piano on Mute Witness could almost have been an instrumental, the lyrics on King Leer are very clever, and Our Frank and Sing Your Life are just great songs. The entire album has a very cohesive quirky mood which sets it apart from, say, the shapeless Maladjusted.What I realized recently, though, is that I don't really listen to Kill Uncle that often. I might think the songs are good, but when I want to hear a Morrissey album, I always reach for Viva Hate or Arsenal. I think this album deserves some credit, but I have to admit that you can't call it great if it isn't listenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surely not his best, but..........","review":"This album is not bad at all! 'Sing Your Life' is a classic, 'Driving Your Girlfriend Home' is pretty good, and the controversial(?!) 'Asian Boy' is one of my favorites.

I like this one - while it surely is not his best or his most career defining album."},{"rating":"1","title":"God awful!!! I think I just threw up in my mouth","review":"I love Morrissey and The Smiths but this is the worst album Morrissey has ever released and quite \\"frankly\\" the worst album ever.

Quite simply, this is the worst thing Morrissey has ever produced. He can only hope it goes out of print and every copy of the disc is lost as well as all of the masters of the songs are lost except for the aforementioned. Terrible. Burn it in a bonfire--don't buy it. If anyone disagrees with this assessment of the album they are neither a Morrissey fan nor a person of minmal intelligence. If they try to defend this work then you might want to throw them in the fire as well. This thing resigns me to a Neanderthalish \\"ugh.\\" Thank God he produced some brilliant albums after this or I would have begun to think there was place reserved in hell for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morrissey:a small talent requires a small review","review":"\\"Kill Uncle\\":Weedy instrumentation backing weedy songs,many intentionally 'comic' but unintentionally 'horrible'.Notorious for depth of lyrical plumbing viz.\\"King Leer\\".Low Point:\\"Found Found Found\\",love song for Michael Stipe."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Underated Effort!","review":"1991...was a memorable year for me. I can't stand it when people slag off this album. Certainly, \\"Kill Uncle\\" is no \\"Vauxhall & I\\" but it IS a wonderful effort in its own right. Someone stole my copy so here I am, ordering another again.Some of my favorite tracks include : \\"Mute Witness\\" \\"Harsh Truth Of The Camera Eye\\" and \\"King Leer\\" (I'll never look at Tizer the same way again.)It's a fun album, clearly nothing to be scrutinized under a magnifying glass. Enjoy it for what it is, nothing more.I'd definitely pick it over Moz's later efforts. (don't tar and feather me please)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite its reputation, a pretty good album....","review":"This is a good CD, though not great one. It has a lackluster production, like it's deliberately unfinished. It's a shame, as it has some great (and I mean great) Morrissey songs on it. Lyrically, he's still as awesome as ever. Asian Rut has a brilliantly sad, operatic tone to it. My favorite song has to be Driving Your Girlfriend Home with its great line \\"how did I end up so deeply involved in the very existence I planned on avoiding?\\". That's another brilliant Morrissey lyric. The Harsh Truth of the Camera Eye is a great song, but it's hindered by the lax production. I'm the End of the Family Line is very good, and the quieter production actually helps it. The song There's a Place in Hell for me and my Friends has another great Morrissey title, and the song is a great one too. If your a Morrissey fan, you need to get this one. If you're just a casual fan, you should download a few of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beginning","review":"Do not allow some other reviews fool you. There is a certain degree of consistency here such that you get an album feel. Indeed, I've come to expect certain songs to follow each other. Also, lets not forget that without this album, Morrissey would not have created Arsenal or Vauxhall. This album truly captures a period when Morrissey was in the process of reinventing himself, a time when he was arguably at the top of the music world.I would like to note that music aficionados are going to love \\"Mute Witness\\" and \\"Found Found Found.\\" The CD also ends with \\"Tony the Pony,\\" a song not originially on the album. Goodbye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kill Uncle","review":"Kill Uncle being Morrissey's 1991 release and his second studio album is very different and unconventional compared to his earlier releases. The lyrics are quite introspective and songs that stand out are \\"Our Frank\\", \\"Sing your life\\" and \\"There Is a Place in Hell for Me and My Friends\\". The book-let is quite spars but very nice with a nice clear photo of Morrissey and the lyrics are included with an easy to read font. It even has information of whom plays what on the album. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"probably his best work","review":"i agree with one of the previous reviews. i do not understand why so many people don't like this cd. i think that it is one of his best. every song is beautiful and just makes the album flow. i own it and strongly recomend it if you are a morrissey or the smiths fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"People With No Ear For Music","review":"Well to begin with, Morrissey was at the height of his powers on his second long player. I have heard many reviewers complaining that the album was simply worthless. What drivel, this album is quite beautiful, melodic and really masterfully rendered. What i've learned after his first four albums, is that Morrissey was The Smiths all along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely no hiss","review":"These headphones are amazing. There is absolutely no hiss. They also automatically turn on when you wear them, which is really cool and very handy. They are also light.I have only two complaints, but they don't detract from my 5-star rating. One, the cushion is too small for my ears, so after about an hour or two it does get a little uncomfortable. Two, the box has a picture of two people, both wearing headphones and using one transmitter. However, this configuration is not really supported by Panasonic, because you can't buy just another pair of headphones. It would really nice if Panasonic would sell another headphone and a recharging station at a lower price, but they don't.UPDATE: J&R; occasionally has these headphones in stock, although they have been replaced by theRP-WF6000. I bought another pair anyway, and I'm happy to say that the new ones are identical to the old ones. That is, both headphones pick up the IR signal from one base station."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with the higher end Pioneer or wired Bose","review":"I bought these headphones based on glowing reviews and a desire for a quality wireless set of headphones. I found these very disappointing. I have not set up the digital cable, but with my laptop headphone connection the sound has entirely too much treble with little to no bass. There's so much treble that it hurts your ears and makes you cringe, and the pads on the headphones hurt too after 30 minutes. Even adjusting the EQ and the different sound modes doesn't make these headphones sound any better, and having tried the $400 true surround Pioneer wireless headphones I'd rather go with those or a wired Bose because these heaphones are not what they're cracked up to be. If you don't like bass or depth in your sound, then these are for you. Otherwise, avoid like the plague and don't buy em."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I Need To Know About An Animal","review":"I love being able to go to one book of reference to find something I want to know about something.

The design is clunky and outdated but it seems to work well.

The details of the power supply you need are unclear, so here it is: Any voltage between 4.5 to 6V, not sure of the minimum amperage but the one I got (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00934CNHC/) provides 4.5V (or 6V) at 600mA, and I used the 2.5 x 5.5mm tip with the center positive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scale makes a great bookend.","review":"The product arrived promptly and there was no visible signs of damage.

First, in their rebuttal of my first rating, PC-GURU claims I never asked for a refund of the return postage I paid to return the broken scale I first received. This is absolutely NOT TRUE! I did request they pay the return postage in my e-mail about receiving the broken scale, and they did not even acknowledge the request except to refer me to Amazon policies stating I would be responsible for returns. Amazon itself refunded my postage. Second, PC-GURU claims they sent me a replacement quickly; this is also untrue. I sent the broken scale with signature confirmation per Amazon instructions; the replacement took TWO WEEKS to arrive at my home. I STAND BY EVERYTHING I SAID IN MY ORIGINAL REVIEW AND RATING OF THIS SELLER. NOW I ADD--WATCH OUT!!!! PC-GURU LIES! Order the scale from someone else--it's a great scale, but PC-GURU is NOT trustworthy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice inexpensive scale","review":"I bought this brand of scale because it was recommended in an article by Jill Santopietro in a column written for the New York Times. So far I find it easy to use, fast acting as ingredients are added or subtracted, and best of all consistent in the weight it calculates. I can't attest to how accurate it may be not having reference weights to test it with. I should give it 5 stars but at $28 there probably are costlier scales with greater accuracy which I could not justify buying but would love to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"bargain scale","review":"I paid almost half price for this scale from amazon between shipping and the list price from another online store.

This thing is much sturdier than those that can be found at Target, WalMart, etc. The buttons are covered by a shield, which is nice because they don't get gunk under them. However, the shield ALSO obstructs the LED, so the act of opening it to power on & off or tare/closing it completely to see #s is something you have to get used to. The construction also seems a lot nicer than other scales in this price range, and the surface wipes clean easily. Quite a bit bigger than expected, it's not as \\"pretty\\" as some of the other models out there that are slim and shinny, but I plan to keep under the counter anyway (very limited prep space!) so not a major issue for me. Working great so far, seems accurate, no major qualms!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Accurate in the Least","review":"I bought this to weigh out product to package in one pound increments. It really isn't accurate enough to do that. It jumps around by POUNDS. If it's off by an ounce, OK, but we had to bang on the table underneath the scale a few times in order to get it to arrive on a measurement. When you have to do that every time and you're weighing out 50 bags of protein powder, it's not worth the time. We ended up just eyeballing it. I tried it with heavier objects with the same result: it can't pick a weight. I expected more from something that has so many positive reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beth","review":"If you are interested in the historical, philisophical, and cultural dimensions of Paganism, Clifton's book is the best on the market.

So I have no problem giving Speck, the company, a positive recommendation. It's nice to see a company that will stand by their product - a rarity nowadays.Everyone who is thinking of buying or has bought this product needs to see this review.

I recently purchased a Mac, and like others have mentioned, I wanted to protect my investment. I love the case. I didn't love the assembly instructions, but it was easy enough to figure out. The bottom half of the case is snapped into place first, then the top half goes on. It is important to ensure that the \\"hooks\\" on the bottom half wrap around the back of the computer before securing the sides. As suggested in other reviews, I \\"personalized\\" the computer by slipping a decal between the computer and the top half of the case. The range for opening the screen is very good.

A decade later, I still enjoy them even as my tastes have matured with exposure to authors like George R.R. Martin, Peter Brett, Joe Abercrombie and many others. Nostalgia keeps me coming back for the occasional re-read.Imagine my excitement when I saw the entire series available for my Kindle.Unfortunately, not all Kindle productions are created equal. This volume was obviously scanned and converted to electronic format via OCR and then very little to no attempt to edit for OCR/Scan errors before publication. Examples of this permeate the entire book, making for an extremely disappointing and frustrating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Well, Finally after all the other previous books in the Death Gate Cycle, many of the seperate storylines are starting to get wound up like never before.

No longer are the dwellers just from one of the character's memories. Now you actually get a big feel for what is soon to happen with the sundered worlds.....I will not say that this has been the best I have read in the series so far.

Someone else volunteered, in their review that that it was the Factory Records Logo.Wrong, buddy. Plain wrong. The circle 'f' is the Fractured Music logo.

I quite liked the cover of Velvet Underground's Sister Ray and at the end Ian declares \\"you should hear are version of Louie Louie\\". This contains what I think is the only known live recording of Ceremony performed by Joy Division before they became New Order and recorded the song.

I like to fry them, so it's important for me that the spatula itself be sturdy, but that the tip is flexible so that it can slide underneath the egg without breaking it. I guess I didn't read the other reviews carefully enough, but looking at the picture, I thought that was the case. In fact, the entire turning part is made of a hard plastic. It's still possible to flip eggs with it, but they don't turn out nearly as nice as with my old turner, which recently broke. In addition, the first couple times I used it, the egg was sticking to it, making it difficult to make scrambled eggs as well.The construction of the turner itself seems sturdy enough though; if you're looking for just a hard piece of tapered plastic on the end of your turner, you should be fine with this one.

With other games you have a lock on ability for your enemy, so with one push of a button you can find him.This game has a werid alt.map that only shows the enemy in respect to your airplane.This just becomes very confusing and not fun to deal with.So,if you like games that lack in graphics and are hard to figure out,this is the game for you,but if you don't then keep looking because there are alot more games out there was much more to offer.

Yesterday, I got it out and nothing happened. Like everyone else has said here, I hear the clicking motor sound but nothing happens. It did its job while it worked but this is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after a few uses...click click click","review":"Like the others reported, I've used this a handful of times in 2 years - went to whip cream with it at Thanksgiving and it clicked but didn't operate. It didn't stop in the middle of a hard job - it just decided to stop working sometime in the past year since I'd used it - what a waste. Don't buy this from a third party - don't buy it all! ...maybe there's a theme here, i'm wondering if there were a bad \\"batch\\" of these and we all bought them at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead In Less Than 2 Years","review":"Like others, we bought this unit new and in less than 2 years it stopped working. As others said, we hear the motor click but it doesn't run. Called KitchenAid and because the unit is more than a year old they will not do anything to help. This is a complete rip-off. Not sure I'll ever buy KitchenAid again. Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ceased functioning after few uses","review":"I used this hand mixer rarely, as the countertop KitchenAid big mixer gets the bulk of duty. However, after less than ten light duty uses over two years this hand mixer quit working. I can hear clicking of relay, but no motor. This is quite discouraging and the device is out of warranty - it still looks brand new. Thumbs down to this product (KitchenAid KHMQ9WH) and its identical twin (different accessories) the KitchenAid KHM9PWH. Move on and find a more reliable mixer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"I have a several handheld mixers and this is the best by far. I do alot of baking and this is it. The speed is incredible I strongly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's my favorite mixer, but it stopped working after a year","review":"This is great! It's much more powerful and versatile than my smaller hand mixer, and for the small stuff much more convenient than the stand mixer. The electronic control makes it easy to use, and it comes with 4 kinds of beaters.Update: I've changed the review to 2 stars -- It seemed like a great deal at the time, but mine stopped working after a year. Probably a problem with the electronic controls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted or expected","review":"This mixer is lacking in power and the attachments are flimsy. It would not stand up to serious mixing before the metal in the attachments would bend out of shape. I replaced a 35 year old 100 watt mixer with this one, much to my regret. It is a mixer to be used only for light mixing. KithchenAid does not make the power rating in watts available on their literature, therefore it is hard to tell what amount of power you are getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead too soon","review":"I experienced the same issue as other reviewers. I haven't used this mixer much since I mostly use my stand mixer and bread machine. I took it out to make pizzelles this week. It clicked but won't turn on anymore. I am quite sure the beaters are properly attached. I ended up using my inexpensive, 11 year old Hamilton Beach hand mixer.I bought Kitchenaid expecting it to last a long time but I am very disappointed with this so-called professional line product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lifespan","review":"I purchased this mixer in December 2007. At first it was great. For the past few months, however, it has been increasingly difficult to turn on and now the mixing blades seem loose and noisy.

It has been stored in its original box, in my kitchen cabinet, for the past 3 1/2 years. I just tried to use it over the weekend, and it was completely dead. The On button clicks, but there's no response from the motor. I tried plugging it into three different outlets, just to be sure, because I found it very hard to believe that an appliance could be broken without having been used. I thought KitchenAid was a reputable brand, but this negative experience has changed my mind. In fact, I purchased a different brand of mixer as a replacement for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very reliable","review":"Bought this mixer in May 2007 when my wife was interested in making cakes at home. We chose this one because we thought KitchenAid was a decent brand and the products might be very reliable. The mixer worked very well when we got it. My wife used it for about less than 10 times and then she lost her interests in making cakes. We put the mixer in box in the cabinet for more than two years and recently took it out and wanted to use it but found the mixer would not work. Maybe we are unlucky but we will think twice if we buy products of KitchenAid again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 1/4 years","review":"Bought in September 2007. Very light use, maybe 10-20 times total. On Jan 23, when my son and I tried to make daddy's favorite sugar cookies for his b-day, it refused to come on. Didn't quit mid-mix, no warning signs that I recall - just refused to start. Click click, as another reviewer wrote. (by the way, we did finish the cookies, using a food processor. But the clean-up!) Of course no way to take the darn thing apart to look for a shot fuse, eg. Boooooo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This is first time to buy hand mixer and I like it. I use it when I make cookie dough and whiping some eggs. I like it mostly, but I have to hold it quite strong so that I give 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"The mixer itself is very nice. Unfortunately, it comes only with the beaters and a, useless, whisk. The beaters are cheap, made-in-China-s... , and came apart on day two. Fortunately, I had some old beaters which fit and didn't have to send the mixer back. On the other hand, I will never buy this brand again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT HAND MIXER!","review":"I don't have the space for a stand mixer and I have gone through hand mixers like crazy because most of them just can't handle big batches of cookie dough. I have five kids and I bake a lot. It has been a big frustration because the last hand mixer I bought lasted through one batch of chocolate chip cookie dough and died on the next try. The one prior to that one lasted no more than five batches.....and the list goes on. these things are just not made to be able to handle it like the hand mixers of yesterday - except this one!!! this one is definitely more powerful and durable. This will last me a long time, I can feel the difference in it. If your'e like me and bake often but don't have the space for a big stand mixer than this is the mixer for you!! I do wish that the beaters were a little bit more heavy duty, but they do seem to do the job just fine and they can always be replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I own the KitchenAid stand mixer and love it but it is so heavy to drag out for small jobs that I just wasn't doing simple baking. That has now changed.........this hand mixer is powerful and a joy to use.

I used the section on direct-contact heat exchangers to design a contact condenser back in 2002. The text is still relevant, the examples current and useful, and some calculation methods still not covered properly in more advanced text. I should point out that although some of the equations are old, they are simplier to use than newer text and require fewer inputs. Besides, when are you going to need calculations accurate to beyond 90%?If this review was helpful, please add your vote -- Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Question of Quality","review":"I bought this for Christmas for my grilfriend and she loved it. Within 2 weeks, in which she did not wear it that many times, it has a sizeable rip in the back between the soft ribbing. I thought for the price it would at least last a couple of years with simple wear and tear, but it did not even last a couple of weeks. I am disgusted that the qulaity is that bad for something pretty expensive. I am not sure if it is worth sending it back with the price of shipping it back and then again to receive it.

It has lots of detail (probably more than I really want) on many different kinds of trusts, but it never attempts to put everything together to give you any idea how to start coming up with a comprehensive plan. I realize that I need an adviser to come up with an actual plan, but I was hoping that reading this book would give me some ideas of where to start. Unfortunately, that was not the case. It describes each tree in the forest in (sometimes excruciating) detail, but I still need a map of the forest. Ideally, I would like some examples of paths that people in different situations might take through the forest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but expensive","review":"I used GoToMyPC for about six months, but recently discovered LogMein.

So I assumed that although it was not cast iron,it would be heavy in weight. I WAS VERY DISSAPPOINTED, when I recieved it. It probably weighed less than half that. It was the right size as stated, but not heavy duty enough, that I sent it back.

It would be great if the company was more accurate in their description of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ortho Bed Wedge","review":"Frankly, this product just does not work for me. The flat top is proportionately too long and takes up too much space on the bed; to make it work even half way effectively, pillows are needed to fill in the space and on top of the slanted part of the wedge itself.

In comparison to my Makita 14.4 NiMH (which someone so conveniently relieved me of..., without my knowledge or consent) it definitely is the way to go. I work at a woodworking store, and PC has been great to us and our customers. Very rarely do I see any Porter Cable equipment returned.Two reasons it didn't get a 5 star rating. It's heavy.

I wasted $600 on the Porter Cable junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damianr","review":"I actually thought this was the album of the same name, however it is only the single song (with one other), so it's fine as it is, just be careful, as the whole album is available for not much more money (which I have since bought)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Little Blips","review":"Firefox AK is actually a one-woman act from Sweden playing a unique style of music. There is too much melody and detail given to the guitar to make it purely electro, yet too many danceable beats and synthetic arrangements to make it pure pop.

Cute yet intelligent, Madame, Madame! is a rare kind of solo debut that really shows the versatility of the artist.My favorite tracks include the fast-paced \\"Love To Run,\\" which borders on IDM, \\"The Draft\\" which is dreamy synthpop, and \\"Cardiac Arrest\\" which really demonstrates Firefox AK's heartfelt guitar skills.

THIS Weissmuller Tarzan movie is one of the only GREAT films in the whole run since the silent films up to the present! TONS OF ACTION to satisfy by today's standards. One of only two or 3 Weissmuller movies where Tarzan and Jane sport the more true to the books skimpy animal skins. In an age when seeing wild animals on theatre screens was thrilling, this movie SOCKS IT TO YOU! Weissmuller shows you why he was the lord of the jungle.

Their last tea kettle was another brand and the spout cover broke off after only 6 months of use. It also did something very dangerous - once the water was boiling, as you started to pour, the water would burst out of the spout. Almost like it was exploding out of the tea kettle.This tea kettle does not do that. You put the tea kettle on the fire, bring to a boil, it whistles, you remove from the heat and pour the water. Simple and safe.There is only one complaint and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. The lever that pulls the spout cover open is underneath the handle.

Best to stay away from this one until it grows up a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Graphics","review":"The game has unbelievable graphics, you feel like you are there.

So much fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EA, what have you done...?","review":"Been a loyal costumer of EA's NBA Live series for many years, but that may change after this year's NBA Live 07. The much-hyped free-style controls are incredibly difficult to master, and if you're playing against the computer, which I often do, you might as well throw in the towel. As has been mentioned in previous reviews, it is extremely difficult to make any kind of open shot (and this is in rookie mode), while the computer CAN NOT miss. I played one game as the LA Lakers vs. Atlanta. The 1st half score had the Hawks beating me by 45, and I'm no novie to how video game basketball is played. Josh Howard is NOT good enough in reality to score 33 in that half (anyone who follows the NBA knows what I'm saying). Also, had Kobe on 3 open-court fast breaks, no one around him; he missed 3 consecutive open dunks. That doesn't happen in reality. Enough venting, I'm off to pick up NBA 2K7."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPOINTMENT","review":"I have purchased the NBA LIVE franchise since it's inception. So, I was really looking forward to this year's model with it's improved graphics and with the aid of the Xbox 360. The graphics and presentations are first rate. But it appears the gameplay was intended mainly for the Xbox Live segment. At any level, playing against the computer produces only frustration. Trying to score on the inside is almost impossible while the computer scores at will. There are other gameplay changes that have ruined a game that in the past was the best. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled","review":"You should really.... NOT buy this game even though I did not buy the game on Amazon, I'm trying to help all of you who are trying to decide hmm should I get NBA 2k7 or Live well it right now is a prety obvious choice NBA 2k7. Live is ment so much for those with live for those without live. Such as u need Xbox live to activate ESPN integration, yeah like anyone ever told me this. So if u are trying to decide wich one get 2k7. Lives graphics are good but 2k7's tops it and the jumpshots for live are'nt that good. And the dynasty mode is not any cooler with the more depth draft and team practices. Live 2003 was good but Live 2007 SUCKS.

From the Dynasty standpoint, the game is really realistic and the ESPN integration is really cool. The downfall is during the game, you can blow by anyone and dunk on anyone which is not realistic at all. It's quite fun to play, but not realistic. So, if you are looking for the overall most realistic basketball game out there, I would look elsewhere. If you are looking to just have fun and really enjoy a nice basketball game, then I HIGHLY recommend buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game stinks...

Depth and texture abound with great Gorno lyrics (and an awesome cover of Boy George/the Culture Club's \\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\\"--Don't let this turn you off--it's deep and it's a total trip)! It's a classic first half but from there the level drops a little, although there are still good songs to come.I really think the Femmes peaked with this release. It was produced by their drummer at the time who then quit the band after it was released! The band has never been the same since. Thus ends another lesson on chemistry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the only wildlife book for your trip to the Galapagos","review":"I've been to the Galapagos with a few copies of each of the other books available for the trip and a University class of biologists and geologists.

I worked as a grip for the classroom scenes. But only for a few days because I simply could not stomach the out-of-control egos of the Hale Manor Collective. I also have to point out something very shady going on here. A few days ago, someone posted an honest review of this movie that the Collective did not agree with. A quick side note, the reviewer hit the nail on the head in saying that the reviews came from the people involved with the movie. When the DVD's listing first appeared here on Amazon, an e-mail was sent out for everyone to post reviews. When the negative review was posted, another e-mail was sent out telling us to \\"bury it\\". The good reviews that are on this page are not honest, they are all phony and posted by the various members of the Hale Manor Collective. And frankly, that really stinks and is really unprofessional.

This time though, the box was removed to save space in shipping, and the paints, canvas and instructions were placed in a smaller shipping box. This was a gift, so when the gift arrived, the birthday girl had no idea what the finished product was to look like, as the reference to the finished product was on the box that was removed.

I have contacted the company via email and they state they have not received the undelivered product yet!(01/21/11). Once the item comes in they can then cancel my order and I will have the chance to re-order if I desire. Their company procedure is not very customer friendly. I would prefer if they update the address and re-send the painting automatically. They have my payment in full and the correct address to send it to.

I bought this album on a whim when I was in France in 2002. I actually did not care for it then, but I discovered it again a few years back when I was in college. I know that my musical tastes have changed considerably from what they were in high school, so it wasn't really surprising that I feel in love with this album. Some people may think the album's a little vulgar but I think it's unusually good. The sound is very kitchy and Arnaud's voice is so enthralling, it can be enjoyed without understanding French. I would have to say 'comme je vis', 'je vis a 50%' and 'fait comme on t'a dit' are my favorite tracks (but it was really hard to pick)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheesh !

After laboriously removing the fabric to re-glue the foam head to the stick and refastening the fabric, the same thing happened.Now.... I am sure there are going to be people reading this who will think (or comment) that we should be standing behind our son at all times guiding him to play gently and respect his drum and mallet, and if you are one of those people, feel free to ignore my review.

Assembly is not trivial even for an experienced and mechanicaly inclined person such as myself. Then the disappointments started. I had a difficult time adjusting the table to level since moving one leveling screw upset some other corner. When I had the table level, I adjusted the gap between the sliding table and the saw. With the gap straight, I found that the table was no longer level. Around and around this sequence went. When I finally had the gap straight and the table level, I tightened the mounts and slid the table. That was when I noticed that the table doesn't stay level through its travel. This was the final straw of frustration, so back the table goes to get my money back. For this kind of money, I would expect better performance from DeWalt products. I still love my table saw, but the sliding table is junk since it won't hold stable through the travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor mitre gauge.","review":"This attachment is a waste of money for one simple reason: The mitre gauge flexes left to right when set so there is no way to get a perfectly square cut. It doesn't matter how tightly locked in everything is, the fence on the mitre will move. I called Dewalt directly to see if there was a fix for this. They told me they were aware of the issue but that it was not a significant variance to warrant a manufacturing correction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"My experience so far isn't different than many others. I like the table a lot. Like many, I'm sure, I lifted the nasty up there by myself and thought I was going to lose 11 of my 10 fingers for the momentary insanity. As luck would have it, I remain whole--in body anyway, but it is a pretty heavy table. Anyway, it was packed well and undamaged when I got it. My only complaint so far is the same as you've read here. The miter gauge has play even after I went through the prerequisite rituals of tightening anything that looked like it might tighten. I tried rigging something, and I tried facing the table toward Mecca while prostrating myself. Finally, the only thing that worked was getting online and buying a worthy replacement for the miter gauge. I'm taking the dewalt miter gauge in the house and see if I can't work my way through the system to see where it's breaking down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Addition","review":"I got this with a new DW746. I really like this slider. I had a Sliding miter table on my Craftsman 21829 so I was a big fan of the concept. This one is a big step up. It is much sturdier and has a wider and longer capacity. The shipping was harsh on the packaging. Fine tuning the set up was finicky as well. I took off 1 star for those 2 issues. Now that I have gotten it set up I can reliably get square cuts along a 30\\" crosscut and keep my fingers well out of the way.I like the consistency, the reliability and the safety of this add-on. Although it is not a necessity, it is a nice addition. The other feature I like is that there are two tabs in the miter slot that get tightened to hold the miter gauge in place for the sliding table. These tabs can also be used to hold shop-made feather boards thin strip jigs in place in the miter slot.So in summary a well made nice to have accessory for your saw. Based on the price it's justified more if you do a lot of panels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dewalt DW7461 Heavy Duty Sliding Table Accessory","review":"After looking at a few of the add on Sliding Miter Tables, I chose the Dewalt model because it was made for my saw. Additionally, it was the best constructed model in the group investigated. Very robust and accurate. You will need an extra set of hands as this unit is heavy. It would be difficult to lift and set in place by yourself. The unit also comes with a Dewalt Miter Gage so you are ready to accurately cut miters, etc., with this package. Easy to use. No flexing to deal with so all cuts are square and accurate. The kit also comes with an anti-tip bracket that mounts to the saw side below the sliding table accessory.

Many of us went to fine Ivy League schools and came to realize that \\"the best and the brightest\\" mantras of these institutions were a bit of a fib. Not these Wellesley girls. They bought it and apparently travel through life jam-packed with an unusual sense of entitlement and a curious feeling of intellectural superiority.

The stop sign on the bus didn't last an hour, and for days my toddler was coming to me with various bits and pieces to put back together.

There was actually melted plastic around the rubber clutch. In the future, instead of just oiling it, I'll disassemble the unit (being careful to not slice my fingers on the blade) clean the hole and shaft, then lubricate and assemble.

This table has none. Spend you money on building your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor top covering","review":"While the fit with the rest of the saw (I have all the other options as well) is good, for the life of me, I can't figure out what DeWalt was thinking when they put the top covering on this table extension. The basic idea of an outfeed table is to support longer materials so they slide through the blade more easily and with less binding. The very first piece of rough wood I ran through the saw tore through the flimsy covering, rendering it useless. I wound up covering the top with high density plastic to get a nonbinding surface. Now the rest of the covering is detaching from the table, so I will have to replace the surface again. My recommendation: if you buy this, plan on immediately resolving the issue with the top or you will regret it later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not big enough....","review":"Your outfeed table should be at least as large as the main table of the saw. This one seems quite small to me. Also it takes up floor space and only serves one purpose. I built an outfeed table a little wider than the table of the saw, with storage below, and a router table insert built in to the top. Makes more sense in a small shop where you have to optimize the use of all your space. I used 3/4 in plywood for a subbase and covered it with 1/4 hardboard. When the hardboard gets messed up (glue, dings and dents) its easy to unscrew that piece and replace it with a new one. Cheap too, I figure I have about $50 in the table and an hour of my time.

I've been stuck at many a table where everyone played essentially the same way: tight and solid. The winners (and there might not be any if you stay long enough) will be the person or persons who just happens to be getting the cards that night. Try bluffing at one of those tables!

In general, Jones recommends playing many hands more aggressively (i.e. raising instead of calling) pre-flop than in the first edition.

The 14.4 was too heavy and awkward for me. The 9.6 is perfect for me. I even find my husband using it when he is working in awkward positions.

However, this performance is a clean miss and, to my ears, unlistenable. There is a great symphony here, but you would not know it from listening to this performance. While I have not yet heard a performance of the 6th I would call \\"definitive\\", the best I've heard is Karajan's with the Berlin Philharmonic. I also really like Blomstedt's with the San Francisco Symphony very much. Celibidache's with the Munich Philharmonic is also excellent.

I wired it for 220 (which I recommend) and it has plenty of power. The fence is solid and accurate. I also recommend the mobile base which works flawlessly. In fact, I ordered 2 more of the castor sub-assemblies ($25) to put on other machines in my shop. Put the base on the saw first as it comes out of the box upside down - much easier.The dust collection system, although not bad, could be better.The worst design flaw is the hassle of having to take off the guard/riving knife assembly by removing 2 nuts down inside the saw. This takes about 10 minutes and would take only a few seconds if it was a \\"snap-in-place\\" design (which should be pretty easy to design, I would think)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed.","review":"I purchased this cleaner about 3 months ago, I have used it twice and not it doesn't work at all anymore, No one seems to know what is wrong with it and Now I can't get any time of reimbursment for it.

I discovered this album in the 80's after listening to Mike Rutherford (Genesis) state that he considered \\"Your Love Is Forever\\" - a track on the album - as one of his all time favorite songs.I totally agree, it is George at his best and sadly, one of the least aired songs out of his collection. The album is full of great tracks and is a must for Harrison fans.

But honestly, this is one document that just doesn't cut it. Talk about awful, pitiful lyrics that have no meaning and sometimes do not make sense. A lot of songs sound like no effort was put into them or they were improvised or were just there to fill a 10 song album. Production sounds just like a 1970's disco jam session, Harrison's guitar isn't even showcased at all and his chord progressions sound simple enough for Ringo Starr to play them after 6 months of lessons. Skip this and buy \\"all things must pass\\" which is the white album of Harrison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Faith: What a memoir should be!","review":"Jimmy Carter's, Keeping Faith, is one of the most intriguing Presidential memoirs. Its story isn't bogged down with boring numbers or percentages, just the facts being told in a fascinating manner. From Carter's description of his administration the reader develops an understanding behind the Panama Canal treaties, the Camp David Peace Accords, and the Iran hostage affair. It's not difficult to understand why the Presidency is such a stressful job.

Too bad the rest isn't","review":"I recently caught the video for \\"Crazy\\" by Seal on VH1. After years of having heard this song on the radio and not knowing who it's by, I finally know. That song is amazing. As for the rest of the album, I can't say it has much of an identity to speak. of. Seal definitely has similar vibe to Sting (check out the vocal similarity on \\"The Beginning\\"), but \\"Crazy\\" is the ONLY good song on his debut. The rest of the songs are dull and have no hook. Buy the single instead. If you loved \\"Crazy\\" like I did, check out \\"House of Stone & Light\\" by Martin Page and \\"Just Another Day\\" by Jon Secada. They are both excellent songs that have an identical style to Seal's \\"Crazy.\\" Who knows, you might even like these better than \\"Crazy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"futuristic folk","review":"it goes to show that this cd holds up after almost 10 years (!). the reason? just amazing songcraft, arrangements, and production. despite the sleek production, seal's heart still shines bright throughout. standout tracks include 'future love paradise', a song that would suit jimi hendrix just fine; 'crazy' with its lyrical wishes for everyone 2 just let down their hair once in a while, perhaps as a necessary balance 4 life; 'violet's dreaminess...the whole cd is rich in sound and heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great album!

I recommend saving your money and investing in another, Human Being would be my recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Signed, Sealed, Delivered","review":"With his impressive physique inherited from his Brazilian and Nigerian ancestry and a voice so smooth it conjures up the memory of Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield and Smokey Robinson, Seal was destined to be a huge star. This wonderful album includes his Adamskiless version of Killer, along with his UK number one Crazy and further delights like the club movers The Beginning and Future Love Paradise. Produced by Trevor Horne of Frankie Goes To Hollywood fame, the album's slick arrangements lend full justice to his sensual voice and sophisticated hook-filled songs of yearning. A very impressive debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Comprehension","review":"I have bought everything i could get my hands on from Seal, starting with this CD, which will blow you away. His lyrics are truly breath taking as you can feel the pure and honest raw emotions coming through. He purposely does not include the words to the songs, so that each and every listener can interpret them for their own personal meaning. Buy this CD and you will feel connected to Seal after listening to his outstanding descritions and emotions that shine through each song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, inspirational, emotional, and highly recommended","review":"To Forgive Divine by Melissa Lea Leedom is a superbly written love story about lasting bitterness that can leave poison that cripples relationships and life itself, in contrast to the healing power of forgiveness. Presenting the irony of a man and a woman who witness the transforming power of the love and forgiveness of Jesus, and must come to terms with their own Christianity despite their lingering grudges held against each other, To Forgive Divine is original, inspirational, emotional, and highly recommended reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to get his viewpoint.","review":"This is a well written book that held my interest. It gives the story of Meadowcroft from the archeologist responsible for its excavation, and places it in the context of American archeological history and the author's own biography.

Clinton had the Army Corps of Engineers dump tons of gravel on the Kennewick Man site! By denying the Solutrean hypothesis, about which Dr. Dennis Stanford of the Smithsonian is writing a major book, whites of today are supposed to continue feeling guilty for \\"stealing the Indians' land\\" since 1492. Thor Heyerdahl's last two books -- such as \\"The Hunt for Odin, \\" and never even translated into English, although he was world-famous -- were also full of bitterness over the p.c. academic crowd ignoring his life's work, which proved that whites explored the Pacific on rafts in ancient times. When you make a solid case for 30 years, and are ignored, anyone would get polemical."},{"rating":"2","title":"A boost for PreClovis peoples","review":"This is an excellent book and very well researched.

Either the author can't spell, or wants to use 'in the hood' type of language. No thank you to slang and misspelled words - every time I pick this book up, I get angry. I wish this type of entries would be saved for something other than books considered the best of American children's poetry. You've got to be kidding.

It looked like a boring line game. Actually it's a fun and addictive game of trying to capture this creature called Qix into a boxed area. It's a very smart idea and I really liked this game a lot. The graphics are very simple, but the game is a classic. You try to make lines and box in the fast moving Qix.Here's a good strategy to use with this game. Start out by making a line across the whole screen, like a tower. Then press B and the directional pad to connect the whole area and make it dark (A is for fast lines and B is for slow lines).The game gets more hard as you go on. It's cool how after you win a certain number of levels there's a cool little animation with fireworks.

Here, we're first introduced to the Bear entity which at first appears purely malignant and evil, but is developed most interestingly as the story develops. As in the earlier book, we become involved in the political intrigues of the historical period.There's more humor, grisly though it sometimes is, in this book as the bear spirit encounters and then possesses Hugo. This humor is welcome, because the number of characters with their various intrigues does become a bit much, especially with a couple of inordinately long chapters that leave no convenient breaking points.There's less emphasis on the relationship between the woman Regeane and her wolf identity, and I miss that.However, fans of the original book should welcome this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"The first two books of this trilogy were very entertaining.

There is definitely an emotional depth compared to his earlier ditties: compare almost any song to \\"Oliver's Army\\".OK, not every song hits the mark but how often does a lyric sheet read better than the average book of poetry?There are several exceptional tracks - Unexpected #4 (which he may never better), After The Fall, All Grown Up.And even the \\"weak\\" tracks are interesting and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mighty EC Strikes Again","review":"When you're as talented as Elvis Costello, you're allowed to take chances.

However, he does receive a good amount of recognition. \\"Kiss from a Rose\\" is included on the soundtrack for \\"Batman Returns\\", the movie. There is a lot more behind Seal than just his good sound. Not only does he write his own lyrics, but he also writes his own music. This fact alone shows that he is talented. Anybody who can write their own music and make it sound good is worth listening to. Seal is also refreshingly different from the classic pop sound, and also from the classic rock style. His style is unique, but he does not sacrifice music for originality. Most groups who try to sound different only succeed in sounding terrible. I would suggest at least listening to Seal, even if you never own one of his CD's. You may be surprised by his style and enjoy listening to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Second Classic","review":"While the songs on this second self titled LP aren't as uniformly brilliant as those on his debut,and the overall tone is more somber than before, this is still an essential recording. The first single \\"Prayer For The Dying\\" is actually a better song than the much lauded \\"Kiss From A Rose\\" (overplayed through most of 1994-95) and stands only second to the astonishing \\"Bring It On\\" which opens the LP. The sound and textures here are a tad more organic and acoustic than the first album and lend the songs a nice warmth. \\"Don't Cry\\" sounds a little sappy to me now, but the sentiment is still nice and his \\"duet\\" with Joni Mitchell \\"If I Could\\" is a pleasant, if inessential addition since you can barely hear her underneath the production.

What has happened to the fun, inventive lyrics of the Crash Test of the past. Brad appears to have attempted to take a spiritual stand point for these songs. All I can say is that by the end you will be praying for deliverance. I never thought the near silent interludes would be so welcome on a cd. However, it is most definately one for everyone's collection. Just prepare yourself before listening to be dragged through 17 tracks of depressing music that sounds near enough the same thing.

While Brad Roberts' signature baritone is in fine form, the songs on this CD are extremely depressing. I actually like melancholic songs, but this is melancholy overload. A good title for this CD would have been \\"Songs About the End of the World\\". One or maybe two of these songs would have been OK if the rest of the material was more varied; the palate really needs cleansing after a few of these songs in a row.I agree with a previous reviewer that people with emotional problems should stay away from this CD. I'm a pretty happy person and it depressed me.This poor review has nothing to do with the band's changing styles - I don't mind that at all.

I actually like the (sort of) title track, \\"The Unforgiven Ones\\", but the album has very little else going for it. Even if you like dark melancholic music, the songs quickly start to sound so alike that you often don't even notice that one ended and the next one started.

David Fromkin is to be commended for writing a complete investigation of such a difficult topic that is both scholarly and accessible. Unfortunately, I think his conclusion - that Germany and Austria intentionally provoked the war - is highly dubious.Fromkin succeeds in building a case that the militarism of the German general staff created a situation ripe for war, and demonstrates that the assassination in Sarajevo was an excuse rather than a reason for war. Nevertheless, his conclusion seems to absolve the allied powers of any guilt. Interested parties should read Niall Ferguson's The Pity of War for another angle - Ferguson argues (far more convincingly, in my opinion) that it is the British and not the Germans who bear the greatest responsibility for the great war."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didnt know that.","review":"David Fromkins tome left me with a far better understandig of what my Grandfather was wheeled and dealed into just to satisfy the EGOsof so many detached so called responsible persons.The whole idea that so few could cause so much misery.Mr Fromkins presentation are what fiction writers strive to relate.I highly recomend this to all whishing to better understand the folly that almost distroyed the optimism that was so hopeful befor the misery it begot instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is it possible?","review":"Europe's Last Summer by Fromkin is, hands down, the worst book I have ever read about World War 1. Given the sheer volume of material available today, It is difficult to understand the lugubrious prejudicial flapdoodle disgorged by Fromkin. Germany, says Fromkin, decided upon war before the Russian mobilization of July 30th. Kaiser Wilhelm, says Fromkin, decided on war to avenge his friend, Archduke Ferdinand. Not a shred of evidence is cited to support these absurdities.The incriminating Isvolsky/Sasonov correspondence; the damning words spoken by the Czar and Sasonov just before ordering mobilization; Bethmann's strenuous efforts to moderate Austria; Poincare's refusal of Buchanan's \\"direct conversations\\" proposal - none of these are to be found in Fromkin's palace of poop.

This is a very readable popular history book, excellent for beginners on the topic. As pointed out by another reviewer, I ran into some excessive repetitions too but did not find them that irritating. I felt that some more information on seemingly secondary events (such as the Balkan wars, state of the Ottomans, etc) could have been included.The book is not the result of a special research or new findings by the author; it is a narration of events that gave way to WWI as told, reported and recorded by historians and researchers. There is no asserted thesis or a claim and that is how a book of this type should be.

Allen Carr does not go into detail on handling the insecure feeling. However, I read the book again, bought a CD by Bob Griswold on quitting which you can listen to while you drive and got a prescription for Chantix from my MD. The CD was very important because Griswold actually tells you what to do when you get the insecure feeling which comes when you are quitting an addiction to nicotine. The Chantix makes it easier to get through cravings. And Griswold is right - the cravings don't last more than 15 minutes and after a while, you don't have them at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Years Today!","review":"As of today, April 1, 2011, it has been FIVE YEARS since my last cigarette (no foolin')!

Certain chapters--even passages--are worth reviewing for reinforcement after you've made the decision and are smokefree. Clearly, Carr (a former chain smoker himself) has a passion for helping nicotine addicts understand that you really don't get \\"pleasure\\" from a cigarette--and this philosophy is weaved throughout the book in varying ways. The chapter about not gaining weight seems to be promising, but actually doesn't get to the heart of this particular concern for women in a direct fashion. That said, however, Carr's \\"Dr. Phil\\" type directness is never preachy and I'm thinking of looking at another book he's written. By the way, it's been nearly a month as a non-smoker and I surprisingly feel like it's been a bit easier than I expected. Hmmm.

The point is made but not shoved down your throat.As far as the second have of the title about not gaining weight, well I think the book fell short there.

The book even eludes to being able to quit without gaining weight, yet he gives no advice on preventing weight gain. The book is filled with repititious fluff throughout. He even discourages the use of substitutes like candy or gum. If it weren't for jolly ranchers hard candy, I think I'd pull my hair out some days. Positive thinking is great but smokers need a good strategy to combat the tough days and the author was not helpful at all in explaining the best ways to get through those days.

My only complaint is that the 2 injection-molded halves of the housing form a sharp seam completely around the perimeter of the drill.

It's hard sf, it's literary - it features rounded sympathetic characters, the vast scale of space opera, suspense, intense sex, lost loves, ghost programs, psycho killers, contract assassins, intergalactic carnivals, aliens, virtual worlds, a singularity, human-machine blendings, science funding battles, subtle pop references, condensed visual imagery, 3 different narrative streams...and a universe of \\"more...and more after that.\\" Wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites now ...","review":"When I finished this the first time my first thought was \\"nice try at a fusion, keep reading Gibson and you might pull it off next time\\" .... but I couldnt get it out of my head.

Its really brilliant, it works on so many levels and theres always more to discover:Just like one of the central premises of the novel \\"there's always more\\".

This is the most interesting part.The other two parts - the reprobate character basically just giggles at saying fcuk a bit and runs across a procession of women with all the personality and use of blowup dolls.The K-ship captain character is a cipher until the end.One virtue is that it is short.If it is supposed to be slightly arty, it mostly fails, some of it coming off as second rate Eric Idle, even.One poor, and boring book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sublime read","review":"Super realistic and surrealistic at the same time, this novel has a feel to it as the the world itself - virtual islands of meaning in the overall absurdity transcending human understanding.

You appreciate literary genres other than \\"straight\\" SF.2. You are not overly disturbed by descriptions of sex.I noticed that a lot of the negative reviews focused on the sexual content of the book, and felt the need to set the record straight. If you don't have puritanical attitudes towards sex or SF, you'll love it. For me, having temporarily tired of the dry world of classical SF (Clarke, Bear, Niven, Asimov, etc.) and the happy shiny universe of Star Trek and its ilk, this book was a breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Confusing","review":"Imagine if you will, turning on your high pressure garden hose only to find you havent got control of it.

I couldnt understand a word of it until the 7/8 chapter until the threads of the tale started to become clearer and then by that time you have a grip on the plot (which I find disturbing). it ends.It would be better to read the other reviews of this book seriously before making a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rather dull book","review":"It's rare I don't finish a book, especially one that comes so highly recommended, but I made an exception with this one. I found this book dull and disjointed and I just didn't have the patience or the time to persevere to the end.

I can't say I remember \\"the graphic ... pornography\\" another reviewer mentions either. Perhaps that would have made the book more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile","review":"I read sixty-one pages of this novel, the second half of these only because positive reviews hinted at something of speculative fiction value somewhere. Even if there is it's not worth the effort.

The inexplicable and deeply interesting events of the plot somehow follow one another into deeper madness, yet never confuse or put off the reader. The net result is an easy-to-read, intricately composed piece of literary fiction pretending to be sci-fi.Awesome: 8.5/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Panoramic","review":"A serial killer and a tantrumic sentient ship named Seria Mau (releasing her inner child). \\"Chinese Ed\\" the \\"twink\\" addict.

It took me a long time to finish -- three times as long as I'd usually need for something this length. I was awed by his use of language. I've never read such lyrical science fiction before. However, the characters are ALL unlikeable. Not just difficult like Lisbeth Salanger -- I mean outright unlikeable. This book is very cerebral and if you're looking for a lot of action you might be disappointed. I was enchanted with Harrison's subtlety. He didn't wreck the book with too much exposition or idiot speeches... he trusts his readers' intelligence and imagination. That being said, I have attempted to re-read it and never re-finished it. It's a lot of work, and generally reminds me that I'm not as deft and skilled a novelist as Harrison. However, I highly, highly recommend it for anyone who likes genre-bending, SF, and good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mash of poorly written good ideas","review":"The book has three good story setups ruined by an overdescriptive style and lack of a coherent plot. The story takes place in three future time periods.The first storyline is a modern-day Lovecraftian horror and really doesn't go anywhere -- even though this thread ultimately is the gateway to the stars for humankind. The second explores a fellow living his life through drugs and simulation tanks. The third explores the degenerative humanity of -- what is essentially -- a Guild navigator from Dune.If you can wade your way through the first 100 pages or so, a story eventually comes together but it's slow in coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome Setup, Complete Lack of Payoff","review":"The first 100% of the book is made up of vague sketches of the nonsensical situations of entirely unsympathetic and uninteresting characters. It does not give the sense of being complicated or difficult to understand, just that there is simply a lack of any coherence there to be understood. It is thoroughly unengaging, but rides on the promise that there will be a climactic revelation which causes the rest of the book to make retroactive sense.Unfortunately, this does not come to pass. The anticlimax explains nothing, and in fact only serves to explicitly disclaim explanation of many events. One is left with nothing but frustration at having wasted a few hours on such a pointless slog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond science. Beyond reason. Beyond your wildest imagination...","review":"According to the front cover, this book is \\"Beyond science. Beyond reason. Beyond your wildest imagination...\\" I would like to add, \\"Beyond me!\\" I just couldn't make sense out of this book. Other people seemed to like it, so maybe it's just me. The three plot threads connected in some vaguely interesting way, but the plots themselves did not hold my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much aimless wandering","review":"I stopped reading after 150 pages. There are three interwoven tales. The first of a serial murderer who wanders around trying to evade a supernatural monster, and his half-crazy ex-wife who seems to get off on the prospect of being killed. The second of a high-tech pirate ship that wanders around, kills a few people, tries to find out something about a mysterious device. The third about two men who only seem to wander around aimlessly. And the prose, which initially felt interesting, seems to wander around aimlessly, too. A pity, since a nice SF world shines through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call me illiterate but I was bored","review":"After 2/3 of the book, I dropped it, and read the last 5 pages to further assure me I had not missed anything worthwhile.

This book creates a whole universe of stuff with no explanation. Sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately unsatisfying","review":"The book starts intriguing enough - 3 different narrative threads with vastly different environments, which the reader is thrown into with no explanatory passages. The writing is mesmerizing at times with dreamy sequences thrown in for a good measure.All threads seem to be wandering somewhat but ultimately headed to some distant endpoint and each journey seems unpredictable and magical, until...The last 1/10 of the narrative comes hard and fast, tying in all threads, answering all questions in a hurry. Unfortunately, Mr. Harrison chose a 'nuclear' option, ultimately denigrating every player in the book, robbing them of any true reason and motive, making every event and every decision into no more than a puppet show.The answer to everything, it seems, 'it doesn't matter much'.And so is the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious book","review":"Adding my voice to those who've already summed up the book's many flaws.

One of the blurbs decribed it as an \\"...sf novel twinned to a stunning mainstream novel\\", which sounded intriguing. What it means in practice, though, is that there are spaceships -- and there is also a lot of dreary, disinterested sex, and all the characters are loathsome. Oh, well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourite authors","review":"I first picked up 'Signs of Life' at my local library because, admittedly, I'm a huge fan of Dave Mckean and he did one of the covers.It turned out to be one of the best random book choices I ever made.While 'Signs of Life', 'Course of the heart' and 'Things that never happen' are a little more up my usual type of sci-fi alley than 'Light' is, I enjoyed it immensely. Harrison's mainstays are the fragilities of human relationships and interactions, self image and what it means to be just a drop of water in an infinite and, ultimately, unfathomable skein of existance. His use of lurid colour and surreal symbol is beautiful.Other authors I'd reccomend are Gene Wolfe and Cory Doctorow."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting for the \\"ah-ha\\" moment--it never came","review":"There were some interesting elements in the book, but the main murderous character was very hard to relate to. I just didn't get it. I kept waiting for it to make sense. There were skeletal aliens, weird robocop moments with a human bred into a machine control unit, and a lot of murdered women. I pressed on through the book in hopes that I would get somewhere, get some interesting new viewpoint on the world or have some epiphany about something. There was no return in it. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So hip it hurts","review":"The author tries desperately to write an interesting, complex novel, but fails miserably. The writing is awkward, the characters unlikeable and uninteresting, and passages of misandry and misogyny pepper the novel without enhancing the plot (to the extent that there is a plot) in any way.Interestingly, the copy of the book I purchased was misprinted such that it started with page 19 and ran to page 50 before re-starting at the beginning.

Not sure how this made a best of list."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 Words or Less","review":"At first, it's a struggle to know what's going on ... certainly complicated by a brilliant physicist and paranoid killer main character. No spoiler: this is in the first few pages.However, keep at it, go with the flow, and it comes together. When that happens, the beauty of Harrison's universe becomes apparent in its weird multi-dimensional glory.This initial confusion is part of the experience, expected from good hard sci-fi. This world is not easily explained. It's not very pleasant. Yet in the end, this is a good novel with some amazingly written passages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many oddities and complexities","review":"I just couldn't tough it out, and had to set Light aside. I'm a scifi lover, and the occasional cyberpunk book is great, but this novel tried to weave in too many oddities and complexities.

I kept waiting for it to become good, but it never did.The first downside of the book is that it doesn't really have a plot. Harrison just throws us into the life of three people who are loosely tied together in the last 25 pages. There's no progression, no story line. As one of the other commenters said, the plot is \\"fractal,\\" and I think that's a very good description.The second downside is that there's a significant amount of explicit sex. This is definitely an R-rated book.On the plus side, Harrison's world is well thought out and rich in details. His view of the universe is that it's so complex that no one can really understand it, and he does a good job of expressing this. The technology is also interesting, and \\"Light\\" is a good example of hard sci-fi.That being said, the positives do not overcome the negatives. I did not like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview of CMC considerations","review":"A good overview of points to consider for drafting CMC sections.

The special chuck holds bits solidly, even when drilling in concrete all day. The drill has a special \\"spindle lock\\" feature which locks the transmission when you press the button so you can really get the chuck tight. It is heavier than the 18 volt DW997, but for real heavy duty work the weight should not be that big of a deal.

Only thin wall tubing seems to be exempt from this. Cutting thin wall seems to be the only good use for this type of blade.The tool itself is not designed or made that well. The base is cheap sheet metal and doesn't look like it will take a drop or any abuse. The clamping system does work, but the miter accuracy is compromised by the design. After putting out some big bucks for the DW872, nine cuts out of ten, I find myself using my old Makita 10\\" wood miter saw with an abrasive blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dewalt Better Stick to Wood Cutting","review":"This is one of the biggest disappointments in my 45 years of buying and using tools. The table is light and tinny. I have yet to get a square (top to bottom) cut out of it. It wanders to the right a good solid 1/8 inch while cutting 1/2 by 4 bar stock vertically. The blade that came with the saw lasted only about as long as a quality abrasive blade. Because of the great amount of time required for fit-up, due to the inaccuracy of the saw, along with the short life of the blade and it's expensive re-sharpening costs, I cannot see how this can be a money maker for any one. DeWalt makes excellent wood cutting chop saws as well as a good abrasive cut off saw, but I cannot reccommend this to any professional metal worker."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for steel","review":"Saw shipped quickly, instruction manual is useless, blade was ruined after cutting 15 pieces of 3/16 x 1/2\\" 304 stainless. I read the reviews and spoke to Dewalt sales before purchasing this saw, and I was assured that the saw would make good quality cuts and would hold up in this application. Cut quality from part #1 was terrible, and the slower I cut, which was recommended, the worse the cut quality became. The fence and vise work well but I experienced the blade wandering up to 3/16\\" on my little cuts! Dewalt said they would replace the blade, so I could make another 15 cuts and then have to buy a $100 blade? I have been waiting for a week for an RMA# to return the saw, and I had to get nasty, DEWALT DID NOT WANT TO TAKE IT BACK! Save yourself money and stress, this saw is garbage. Dewalt stuff is almost always outstanding! This saw is garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timesaver","review":"I had a stair rail job that had 1/2 inch powder coated steel rods parralleling the hand rail.

There are some amazing performances on this disc.Now on to the bad: Although the concept of letting the fans shoot it is very cool and enjoyable, the editing could have used some work. It jumps from shot to shot every few seconds. Also, there are too many weird effects thrown in that give it less of a feeling that you were there. Also, the setlist could have been better. The 3 instrumentals right in the middle of the concert seem to slow it down and make it tedious. They could have used those 3 songs to play some more of their hits, such as Fight For Your Right or Hey Ladies (which are strangely missing from this otherwise-complete setlist).Overall: This is definetly worth a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Was Great and I Am In It !!!","review":"The concept was great, the performance by both the Beastie Boys & Mix Master Mike was awesome AND my performance made this movie worth 5 stars.

Finally found the Betterly Tru-Cut insert system and that is the way to go. Its a solid machined piece of high quality aluminum, made for this saw. That means you can still use your factory blade guard and splitter. It has a removable phenolic center, so you can make zero clearance inserts for about any size blade or dado.

After enjoying those, when sudoku exploded, I got bored with the standard 9x9 grid really fast, so it was great to see a book (this one) with a variation on the original. Here is a warning, though: the 16x16 games take FOREVER and require a lot of patience to do it methodically.

With that being said, the contents of this book and others like it really should be taken in with caution, and should be considered a variation of science fiction at best.

If you buy the product, check it closely, and get in touch with Gitcorp as soon as you find any problems. They can be very slow about responding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mac vs PC","review":"I have a Mac at home and the DVD Rom had difficulties with my Mac. I'm on OSX and when I tried to read the PDF file, there was a transparent MARVEL logo across the center of every page that was annoying. When I tried to move onto the next issue, it would be missing and I would have to reload and start the disc again.When I took it to work and put it in my PC at my desk, it worked great, no transparency and a better presentation of menus for usage overall, so I guess I'll be reading this at work when I have time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great content, but...","review":"I had already purchased the 40 Years of XMen DVD and loved it. However, when I got this disc, it would only display the folder of the 1960s. I exchanged the disc, and checked the new one before taking it home to make sure I could see all the folders. When I got it home I had the same problem. For some reason my desktop and laptop could only see that single folder. I ended up reading the disc on another computer and copying the files to two single-layer DVDs, but I was really disappointed that I couldn't read the original on my desktop. Functionality was the same and the contents were a tremendous value."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the great Avengers epics but...","review":"This DVD-ROM is a great way to get all the great Avengers epics from the past 40 years (the Korvac saga, the Kree-Skrull War, the big blow out against the Masters of Evil, etc.). You get to see the team form, see the return of Captain America to modern times, see the line up change and change and change - a hallmark of the Avengers book.The only reason I dropped this one star is the fact that the seven Giant Sized Avengers volumes from 1974/1975 are missing. These were like annuals back in the day but the main book often had issues that lead into them. Further, a pivotal event - the marriage of the Vision and Scarlet Witch - appeared in these Giant Sized issues. To leave them out is just criminal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow I love it.","review":"Ok I gave it 4 stars just for the fact that you cant actually hold them in your hands and read them . I do have them on my laptop so I guess that kinda works. Whats great about it is the price. 30 bucks for 40 years of comics.....get real!!! I did have some install problems at first like others have but when I took the disc out and reloaded it it fixed itself. I think it was a Adobe update but it did it for me so no biggie. My only problem now is when am I going to find time to read all of the issues. Oh and one more thing you can save the disc to your hard drive so you can save it at work and read at lunch without having to bring the disc with you. Highly recomended if you love comics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical Issues - I wouldn't buy this","review":"I'm having the same issues as the reviewer above - my computer only sees the 1960's folder. I have all the Gitcorp releases and this is the first one I've had any problems with. Very disheartening. Customer service has NOT been any help whatsoever. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT UNTIL THE TECHNICAL ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED BY THE MANUFACTURER.(The 1960's folder IS, of course, wonderful.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"$170-$200!!

The router handles smoothly and doesn't feel \\"cheap\\" in any way. The low price does make itself felt, however, in the lack of bells and whistles that are found in higher-end routers. There is no dust extraction system, no soft-start, no multi-position turret.The most serious flaw with this router, though, is its depth gauge. In a nutshell, depth adjustment is far from accurate, and is best described as \\"eyeball and guess.\\" If accuracy of depth is important to you, you'll have to make several practice cuts in scrap followed by minute adjustments to get it right. In fact, if accuracy of depth is important to you, you're better off with a different router.Still, you can't beat the Skil 1840 for value. If you're on a budget and just want a quality router without the extra features, this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inexpensive plunge router","review":"This router has done everything we have thrown at it without any trouble.

It's an excellent read for a customer service representative and I'd recommend companies getting the book for each of their employees. It covers some customer service basics, how to handle certain situations, and is really a great overview of what great customer service is and how to deliver it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Service? Try Working the Front Line....","review":"...then you'll see how easy it is to give good customer service. I noticed most of the reviewers are managers and Human Resource trainers, not the people actually on the front line. Just try getting screamed at, cursed at, things hurled at you, and called all kinds of different names from an irate customer. Also try wading through the asinine company policies that tie your hands and keep you from helping the customer the way they deserve. Along with a lower than you can live off salary, and you have the average customer service rep and what we have to deal with every day.This book misses the mark in so many ways. It caters to people living in a dream world and have high enough positions that they dont have to deal with the public. But I'm sure they think this book's ideas are \\"neat-o\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Never too many Civil War Mariners!","review":"It's fascinating to me that a small charge of nautical (and semi-nautical) Civil War novels has recently reached the book store shelves after the subject's near neglect for decades. Mr. Trotter's first book of a new series does justice to the subject and alongside of James L. Nelson's \\"Glory in the Name\\" will serve to sate any Civil War nautical buff on the subject. Mr. Trotter quite obviously has the historical chops as well as a the knowhow to construct an engaging characters and a moving, riveting plot. The follow up to \\"Sands of Pride\\" is due out any day now, so grab them both. The second in Nelson's series is also due soon, so now is the time to cast anchor with a host of great American characters and two great writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Read","review":"I enjoyed reading about the Civil War from the perspective of North Carolina since most of the attention in books from this era is usually focused on Virginia or South Carolina. The only problem I had was the number of characters to keep track of--good thing there was a \\"Cast List\\" in the front. Even though the text was a bit technical at times, the prose was refreshingly adult. Can't wait for the conclusion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I was glad to see the original actor back, but the story was absurd, and the tone was not the same as the first movie or any of the delightfully campy sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair!","review":"This movie I would have to say is AOK. I still am a very big fan of the origanal. The 2nd one I would say didn't make that much cence. Although I still loved the 2nd. Some of you might wonder what happend to House 3.

(Try Greenspahn's \\"An Introduction to Aramaic\\")A better title for this book would have been \\"An introduction to Syriac Scripts\\". And it does it well. The bulk of the book concerns itself with the Eastern Syriac (Nestorian) script. For each letter, the stroke order is shown, and room is alloted for practice. After the alphabet has been introduced, the Estrangela letters that differ from the Nestorian are given. (The Serta script is not given). There is a small section on vocalization, and rules for spirantization. There is little or no grammar given.All in all, a good introduction to the script. Valuable as a \\"pre-primer\\" to more advanced Syriac grammars such as Thackston or Muraoka."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit deceiving&#65533;","review":"This is a great book for those who wish to study Syriac script. I say that it is deceiving only because the title simply states \\"Classical Aramaic\\" and does not hint at what period is involved here (until you buy it of course). This book seems to lump the evolution of Aramaic and its periods together, then making the reader believe that it is spoken today just as it was in \\"Jesus' time\\" (which is false). It does outline the periods, but doesn't tell where this book fits in to it all. Great for Syriac script study, but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Cordless screwdriver without a doubt!","review":"I have used this screwdiver for years of reliable service and then gave it to my daughter who continues to get good service from the tool. I have tried several Black & Deckers which have failed due to low torque, battery life and user interface. If you want a tough, strong, reliable cordless screwdiver, get the Skil. If you only have light work and a tight budget the 2.4 volt Skill will work. If you are a contractor, you probably want the Dewalt 920K-2 7.2 volt ... ; but, for the normal homeowner, the 3.6 volt 2207 Skil is the one. You won't be sorry. I bought a new one today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Workout","review":"This is a DVD of a dance class filmed at Bally Total Fitness. There is no step by step instruction.

If you are looking for step by step instruction to learn the moves this DVD is probably not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I spent $7 on this DVD and still feel ripped off. It was a tape of a class at Bally's with little instruction. The dancers in the background weren't even good and there was a 7 year old in there! I don't want to spend money to watch a class. I was hoping there would be combinations or something, and there weren't any. I turned it off before it got to the end because I got so bored. The shoulder shimmies lasted forever, to the point that it was just ridiculous. I haven't decided if I am going to keep it or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like taking a dance class","review":"This video has the look and feel of taking a dance class at Bally's. It's pretty informal. You get to practice quite a few bellydance moves over and over, so it's good for drill work. I think it's rather long for a single workout, but you could break it down into segments if you wanted with your own warm up and cool down. There's no routine in this DVD, just moves you can use for improvisation. Amira's performance at the end is a nice one. I just wish that you couldn't see the Bally's customers watching ... it was pretty distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"happy customer","review":"I bought these to use as chocolate sea shell party favors for my daughters Lil mermaid party, they were prefect.

This is hands-down the best album of the 90's(along with Nevermind)and certainly the most creative.From the first track to the last, this disc is like a great book that keeps you on your seat, waiting for the next adventure. Not to mention that this disc probably evokes every kind of emotion that humans can experience. Must have for any music lover.

I was pretty apalled.This is one of the best rock albums I've ever heard. Very little can a band showing off so much diversity, from funk to hard rock to something just psychadelic. Not only is every song great (from the tunes that got airtime like \\"Suck My Kiss\\" and \\"Breaking the Girl\\" to deep tracks such as \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\" and \\"The Righteous and the Wicked\\"), but the continuity of this album is out of this world. The tracks are perfectly placed, and work together to paint a bigger picture. In fact, I would place a bet that they were written to go together, because the beat, key, and feel of every song works with those before and after it. If you haven't heard this album yet, it's totally worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"FONKY LIKE A MONKEY","review":"You've gots to get this, homes...The funk lives.

I've always had a special place in my heart for The Red Hot Chili Peppers, especially for this album. I don't mean to just say I like this because it's regarded as such an important album either. I sincerely think it is a fantastic record. In addition to the epic and highly acclaimed Under the Bridge, such tracks as Breaking the Girl, Funky Monks, The Righteous and the Wicked and Apache Rose Peacock abound in captivating grandeur that is truely breathtaking. This is just such a great album, I'm getting excited as I'm listening to it while writing this review. Definitely go out and get this one, I recommend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chili's Seminal Recording","review":"By far and away the best album they've made and superior to the chart-driven material they produce now. Both a rock and 90's classic, they will never produce better. There are no fillers on this album, no tracks you could skip on.

Virtually perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL YOU NEED","review":"Everyone likes saving money right? Ok, here's how to save money if you like the RHCP, buy this album from their catalogue only! If you must listen to the new stuff, turn on any popular radio station for no longer than ten minutes and get your fix. This album falls into the very exclusive \\"masterpiece\\" club. Every and I mean EVERY song on this album is perfect. The songs flow in unity from start to finish. This album sounds like nothing before it and nothing after it, besides every RHCP release which follows. Which brings me back to saving money. Now there's nothing wrong with the RHCP releases after this album there all good but only one or two songs from every album stands up to the complete Blood Sugar album. Its almost as if they release new albums to suck in new young fans that haven't heard the album before the new one.

They are extremely talented musicians and like most true artists, their craft is in tune with the social and political tone of their time.I LOVE this CD.

If Californication is the first RHCP you have purchased, welcome! Now go back and get everything else. Crank up your stereo and listen to Flea's funky rockin' melodic bass, Anthony's nasty, crusty, blunt, loud chops, John's independent guitar style and Chad's thunder romps.

It also has nastier lyrics than the previous ones. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic funk-rock","review":"This is one of the Peppers' greatest albums because the lineup with Frusciante peaks, and Rick Rubin's clear production lets the music shine. The album starts off real strong, hits some radio-ready tunes (with Under the Bridge and Give It Away), hits a little filler, and then closes strong. Flea's bass playing is never as good as it is on this album.

I'm personally a bigger fan of their newer albums, but I do enjoy their old stuff too. And the fact that they're able to keep mixing things up and making great music no matter what. Especially after all these years. IMO, they seem to get better with age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have work of genius","review":"RHCP are one of my favorite bands ever and are the best live act I've ever seen, and this IMO is their strongest album. Filled with raw emotion, crazy lyrics, and a great overall vibe, Blood Sugar Sex Magik is one of the best albums out there . Anthony is amazing, with his creative lyrics and soulful singing, John's guitar work is funky and gorgeous, Flea's bass parts are, of course, outstanding. Chad's drumming is awesome too. These guys carry a timeless, distinctive and unique sound that is great over a decade after this album was created. Unlike a lot of bands I listen to, RHCP really makes you feel good after listening to them- something that really proves their talent.My favorite songs are Suck My Kiss, Give It Away, I Could Have Lied, and If You Have to Ask. This CD really marks the new era of the chili peppers and really earned them a whole new level of fame. Buy this cd, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really is \\"Red Hot\\".","review":"Whether you view this album as the end of their early years, or the start of their later years, either way it's their best one. Though I actually like the two albums before it more, \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\" is the longest, most diverse, and overall greatest of their releases. It's the album that's the perfect match of their young/fun energy, and their more maturing song writing skills. Besides including their breakthrough to the masses hit \\"Under The Bridge\\", it also has \\"Give It Away\\", \\"Breaking The Girl\\", and \\"Suck My Kiss\\". Plus my personal faves \\"Power Of Equality\\", \\"BSSM\\", and the excellent \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\", which is one of my top 3 \\"Chili Peppers\\" songs ever. Even though they have recently mellowed some, this 1991 album still funking rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"um yea...","review":"hmm... i was just introduced to this band a couple weeks ago not knowing anything really about them. After spinning this album once all the way through I couldn't really understand what all the hype was about? All the guitar and drum work was really fantastic but the lead singer... man, do i even have to say it? he just sucks. His voice is so annoying I can't get past a minute on any song listening to this no talent bum. I don't mean to offend but seriously...this band needs a new lead singer. And if he writes the lyrics too ahaha..wheeeew...that crap definitely has to go lol. Its ashamed to see a great band like this be hindered down by bad lyrics and vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Overrated Album From An Underwhelming Band","review":"I remember this album well; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer', as it was released well before \\"Under The Bridge\\" made them the bandwagon band of the year, but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right--they never had a good album.For every song worth listening to (\\"Suck My Kiss\\", \\"Give It Away\\"), there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded. This album was and remains a perfect example of why bands shouldn't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can.On top of that, the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief. Some friends and I got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album, and Kiedis was so off-key, it wasn't funny. They drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals, but the damage was done. People were walking out in droves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basicly A Waste","review":"Blood Sugar Sex Magik was the album with which Red Hot Chili Peppers broke through to a less limited music scene. By many, it is still considered the band's best album, so I looked forward to enjoying as many as 17 great RHCP songs.But no! Apart from the hits Under The Bridge (still a superb song!), Give It Away, I Could Have Lied and Breaking The Girl, plus the last minutes of Sir Psycho Sex, this album has not much to offer. The other 13 songs all sound like (unworthwile) imitations of Give It Away.This funk-rap-rock dominates the album - so if you are not into that style, buying Blood Sugar Sex Magik will be a waste of money. I recommend Californication, even though it is more commercial, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funkylicious","review":"The Red Hot Chili Peppers are one ecclectic hip cool band. And this is comming from someone who grew up on classic rock from the 60's and 70's. The steady bass and drumming coupled with the funky guitar licks and the varying singing/rapping vocals adds up to an excellent set.Many highlights abound ranging from the New Orleans driven Apache Rose Peacock to the politically liberal Power of the Equality to the softer tunes(Breaking The Girl, Under The Bridge, I Could Have Lied) to hard core tunes(The Greeting Song, Give It Away). I even like the speedy one and a half minute Robert Johnson cover They're Red Hot.This release isn't as melody driven as their By The Way CD. However, the funky stylings on this Blood Sugar Sex Magik release certainly can get your groove going. And that is certainly a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psycho is right!","review":"I couldn't let the opportunity to post a review about THE album that made me pick up a bass guitar go by. I used to have a copy way back when until I lent it to a friend of mine (who subsequently moved and was never heard from again) I finally was able to source another copy recently. In short the album is jaw-dropping. I am hard-pressed to pick a favourite from the album, but I think Sir Psycho Sexy, Funky Monks and Give It Away will always be up there. In short, whether you play a musical instrument or not this album drags you kicking, screaming and partying through 75 minutes of pure funk/punk/rock excess and the world would not be complete without it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums of All Time","review":"This is easily the Red Hot Chili Pepper's best album. Every cut featured is awesome. I can't say enough about this album, everything just fits perfectly and Frusciante's guitar playing is excellent, get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Chili Peppers at their all-time best!!","review":"Blood Sugar Sex Magik is perhaps the greatest album they've done yet. It went multi-platinum in the first week it came out! If you're a hard-core Chili Peppers fan like me, you have to add this to your collection. Anthony and the boys jam out on 17 tracks of the pure funk that we've all come to love. You have to get this CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums of the 90s","review":"This is my all time FAVORITE album by the great Red Hot Chili Peppers. In fact, this album should have won Album of the Year. But it was probadly too explicit for the Grammy voters during those times. If it wasn't for these guys and this album, half of the bands you hear today wouldn't exist. Think Fred Durst and his band. Chris Rock was RIGHT!! This band is funky and BAD. So what if they are white? They were the best. And this album still gives me goose bumps and makes me ROCK!! Anybody with a slight taste in good music will like this album. Get it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"this album is one of my favorite albums out of a few hundred cds. anytime i put it on, it never fails to satisfy. these guys are some of the craziest, funkiest guys around, and they put that fun lovin' stuff into their music. all of the songs on this disc will lift you up and put a smile on your face while you rock out. i know for sure this is one of the albums my kids will listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure genius.","review":"From the moment I heard Fruscainte's guitar on the opening track...to the final few words on \\"They're Red Hot\\"...I didn't move a muscle. It is one of the single greatest rock/funk/somewhat rap albums I have ever heard. To go from a party-heavy track like \\"Give It Away\\" to a smooth, touching ballad like \\"Under The Bridge\\", is a rarity in today's recordings.Stand-out tracks-Breaking The Girl, Suck My Kiss, I Could Have Lied, The Righteous & The Wicked, Give It Away, (the best track on the album) Under The Bridge, and Sir Psycho Sexy.But don't let that list fool you. The entire is pure listening enjoyment, no matter what style of music you prefer.I highly reccomend this to anyone who likes just good 'ol American music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Item for your collection.","review":"This is definately their best work. I think it set a mark on this type of music when it came out. Pure Genious. Every track is masterfully different. They have such a range of talent as shown in songs like Breaking the Girl and Suck My Kiss. I'd go as far as saying this is one of the best albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spreading the magik","review":"Red Hot Chili Peppers before the album in hand is, for me, a pretty bad band. It seems like they always knew what they wanted to do, but never got around to doing it. and then there's \\"Bloodsugarsexmagik\\".... I won't beat around the bush: I think it's a total masterpiece. Mixing the right dose of sex, gentaleness, funk, rock and rap, the peppers never sounded {or will sound} better than they do on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I will make this short. If you know what good music is, and you haven't bought this CD, buy it NOW. Absolutely incredible from beginning to end. The feel of this album is incredible, and I have never heard anything else that remotely compares to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most technical pop album of the early 90's.","review":"With the release of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, The Red Hot Chili Peppers elevated themselves into the stratosphere of musicianship. Rick Rubin, producer extraordinaire, arranged for hours of extended jams every day for weeks in a secluded mansion before recording. This led to the insanely catchy hooks that saturate every single track on this disc. Flea and Chad are truly one rhythm section, anticipating eachother's every move. John's guitar is full of funky licks that accentuates every nuance of the meter at just the right places. Anthony's vocals are in thier prime here. This is the Red Hots at the height of thier creativity, I'm afraid. So if you are a fan of One Hot Minute, Californication, or By the Way and do not own this disc it will truly be worth every cent you spend on it. It is one of those that makes you wonder how you got by without it. It is also one of those that make you wish that there were more just like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"yep","review":"not my favourite bands...under the bridge has great lyrics! the vocals are terrible! the melodies are too much rap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"totally unremarkable","review":"want to know why the music industry is suffering? when this is one of the \\"better\\" bands out there, this isn't saying much. the album is just blaze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get \\"Californacation\\" or \\"By The Way\\"","review":"This may have one good song on it BUT there best?

Someone recommended me this album saying this is their best one, and that this is something metal fans might enjoy. Instead, I find this album to be one of the most ridiculous I've ever listened to. I don't wanna listen to even one song on this album again, and I've placed this CD where it belongs - the trash can. The artists sound like amateurs; the vocalist is god-awful, guitar sound is very muddy, and the guitar playing is bad, and the song writing is very loose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning: Highly Addictive Album! Unusual and Great!","review":"Where do I start, this album is packed with great song after great song. Each song is different and wild. \\"Under the Bridge\\" is such a personal song and people are drawn to personal experience. How can a group release 17 songs that are so unique and great? The Red Hot Chili Peppers are very wild and off-the-hook, so beware. If you have an open mind and you want to experience some amazing music, pick up \\"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic\\". This is the kind of album that I find myself listening to over and over again.

Apparently \\"real\\" RHCP fans like only their 80's funk and BSSM. I however loathe that stuff and embrace what they have evolved into.

Fantastic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Superb!!","review":"There is really no way to describe this album that could do it justice. The funky sounding basslines mixed with the hip-hop sound of Anthony Kiedis voice makes this album a memorable experience. Tracks such as \\"Give it Away\\" and \\"Under the Bridge\\" provide the albums roar power whilst tracks like \\"I could have lied\\" provide a more gentle aprroach to the Chilli Peppers. The opening track (\\"The Power of Equality\\") gives a fantasic start to the album with its funky sound. If you havn't bought this album already.....then buy it now!!!

This is not an action movie, thankfully, but rather a psychological and emotional ride.

With local stuff you just never know and I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and found Tin Can to be well done and thoughtful, in the science fiction tradition of Ray Bradbury or Asimov, where it's not all about the action but about the people, relationships, the psychology of what is happening in the film. That said, it's also artistic and well acted. This isn't a Transformer type film or Zombies with lots of special effects if that is what you are looking for. I liked it a lot and was really glad to have the opportunity to see it and write about it for the paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the rental","review":"I am often generous in my reviews, but I can't be so with this unfortunate stinker. I usually enjoy 'B' movies for an escape, but they need some redeeming value. Tin Can has none.

I checked Consumer Reports and decided the try out the Braun because it was rated higher than the triple header. After about a week's adjustment time, I am much happier with the Braun. The shave is definitely closer and smoother than my triple header, and the time to shave seems to be a bit faster. The Braun is noticibly noisier, but that does not bother me.I got the model (8995) with all the bells and whistles because, well, just because."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't be beat !","review":"This is the best shaver on the market.

The razor works well and shaves close, closer than prior models IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Shaver","review":"I recently purchased a new Braun Electric Shaver. I had been using a Braun shaver for many years. Although I was satisfied with the old one, the new shaver is light years ahead of the older one. I am getting shaves like I never have before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This is worst shaver that I've every owned. The shaver has all these gadgets, probably why it costs so much. Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver as advertised. The shave was never close, no where near as close as my Gillette \\"Fusion Power\\" razor, and I broke out into a rash after every use. I'll never purchase another electric shaver. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charger-Cleaner Base Problems","review":"I own two units and both failed to stay down when the shaver required charging. Braun was good enough to send me two charging units that stayed down for a while and then failed. I now have two expensive discharged Braun shavers that are the most expensive I ever purchased and the least productive. If Braun sends me two durable charging-cleaning units I will raise their one-star evaluation. I hate it (times two)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great shaver","review":"I got this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it. He said it shaves so close. He is thrilled with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best shaver out there!","review":"Used Braun Flex Control (6550 model) for the past 6 years. Recently switched to Braun 8995 360 Complete. What a difference 6 years make in shaving technology! Best shaver that I have ever owned. The shave is so close and precise... Wonder if any shaver can get better than the 8995. Well worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Highly Over Rated Braun","review":"I have one of these Braun 8985 systems and it is absolutely the worst shaver I have owned, way behind a Remington and a Norelco. The active foil doesn't extend to the end of the head instead there is more than a quarter of an inch of gap to the end of the head. Consequently it will not shave up close to the ears around the jaw line. This shaver continually misses hair and requires me to \\"Scrub\\" my face with it to do a ho-hum job or resort to a blade for best results. I had a Wahl shaver before I got this one and it does a first class job the first time and only cost me a little more than 10% of what I spent for this beast. When I'm not particular how I look, I use the Braun, but if I want a good close comfortable shave I reach for my Wahl. I certainly don't want their newer model. When this Braun thing goes toes up I'm going back to my Wahl, sorry I left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun 360","review":"I have gone from blades to foil and have been using a rotary for the last 20 years. I read a consumers report on razors and they recommend the Braun. A little pricey but the best shave from an electric I ever had. They say your face has to get use to it. But on day 1 I got a better shave in half the time. Very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun 8995 Shaver","review":"This shaver has met all my expectations. It cleans and recharges itself automatically. The shave is close and nick free. The only slight negative is the cleaning time per shave could run to 20 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST!","review":"This is absolutely THE WORST shaver I've had in quite a while. I paid a premium price for it and it never saved decently from the beginning. I had to go over and over several spots and I would still find hairs sticking out when i was done. I went back to my used and much less expensive Norelcos and they still did a better job than this razor when it was new.Recently purchased the Panasonic ES8249 and couldn't be happier. Finally! A razor that actually does the job and with no fuss. Don't mess with the Braun! Go for the Panasonic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I purchased two of these approximately year ago one for house and one for corporate apartment. Less then 4 months starting having problems with getting them to make contact in the cleaning charging station. I used wide range of items to try to hold the shaver in place; and now nothing works. They are not worth the money; plus you have to continue buy the cleaning solution. Not long after I started having the problems with Brauns I purchased a Panasonic wet dry shaver for travel purposes. I actually used the Panasonic more than the Brauns; it shaves cleaner closer and definitely a lot easier to clean and you don't have to buy any cleaning solution-had zero problems with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 590cc is not the 8995!!!","review":"This item is the series 5 590cc not the 8995.

Still not bad overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"What About the Neck?","review":"Works great on face, but Im still using my Schick on my neck. This is absolutely useless on the neck. It is great for guys with sensitive skin, and those with problems with ingrown hairs. I've had it 4 months, and only one ingrown hair. Worth the money if you deal with shaving your neck by other means."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift","review":"very speedy shipping during the last week before christmas ordering. son loves the razor, 1 month use now no problems great job very satisfied"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent shaver","review":"I've never liked electrical shavers because of 1) their inability to shave close to the skin, and 2) I had to open and clean them it every time I shaved. I tried this one, and, now I am using it every day. It has solved both problems. One of the best shaving machines I ever had. It may occasionally miss a hair if it grows parallel to the skin but in general, it will give you an excellent performance. Always use cleaning cartridges, and you do have worry about cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shaver","review":"I have used this shaver about 15 times so far. It works great. My hair is thick and hard to cut. This shaver cuts 95% which is fantastic for me. I follow through with a regular razor and my shave is excellent. This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever purchased. So other shaver has cut this close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels Like a Great Electric Shaver","review":"I have only owned this shaver for a month, but I like how it feels against my skin. It gives me a close shave on most of my face, but it leaves some stubble along my lower jaw line. I believe I can live with that, but I did pay over $150 for this shaver. Come on Braun, you can do better (or is it the Gillette blades??). I am also hoping that my face will get use to the Braun and maybe solve that problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jury is Still Out","review":"I have had the razor for about 5 months now and I am still undecided about whether it is a good deal. It does not really provide any closer shave than other models that cost far less. The extra \\"holes\\" in the screen sounded like a great idea but I haven't really noticed they make a difference in closeness of shave. Also, the screen gets hot pretty quickly and I have irritated the skin on my upper lip several times. I had high hopes for this product but I think my three year old Panasonic did a better job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shaver","review":"Now that I've used the 8995 for 3 months, I've determined a few things:- Not quite as close as my Remington triple microscreen I have been using for the last 10 years, but close enough- Shaves quicker, with fewer missed hairs than my old Remington- Auto-clean is nice. Saves a little more time- Sometimes a stray long hair escapes the cutters and you have to engage the sideburn trimmer. It's pretty sharp and uncomfortable on your neck, but patience works best. The Remington had a better long hair solution, but then again it allowed more long hairs to escape.Is it worth 2-3 times as much as a top Remington? Maybe, but it's a keeper for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money. Base has defects.","review":"I bought this for my husband after his rotary electric razor failed after many years. Going from a $30 to a $170 razor raises your expectations however, he says this razor shaves no differently from the cheaper one AND it requires the continual purchase of cleaning solution. In addition, shortly after receiving it the base unit would get stuck in cleaning mode and would run all night. Its bad enough waiting 1/2 hour for the cleaning process to complete but all night? We're not performing surgery with this razor. There's no need for cleaning solution after every use. The other razor worked just as well just shaking it out, and didn't suck electricity 24/7. Amazon wont let you send it back so we had to mail it, at our cost, to the manufacturer for a refund. Have not received it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY CONTROL","review":"I purchased a Braun 8995 with the automatic cleanser on 7/1/2007. Shortly thereafter, it wouldn't charge. It was repaired on 8/8/08. In less than months it was already beginning to malfunction. Currently (7/28/09), it won't turn off, charge, or clean.For the price I paid ($157.59) I wouldn't recommend it unless the the warrantly would be AT LEAST 2 years. Now (7/29/09) a day later), I learn the repair center is out of business and Amazon won't accept for return the liquid-filled cleaning cartridges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greater razor, lousy foil","review":"I really like the 8995 razor, it does a very good job shaving. The problem I have, the foil tends to break every 2-3 months. When I add that expense in, it tends to be very expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Shaver For The Price!","review":"Although I bought this product for my boyfriend for Christmas, I did get his opinion on it. He stated that this razor provides an extremely close shave! He also said it was the first foil razor that he has owned that is not painful to shave with. He really likes the cleaning feature, as well as the digitized display that provides information like shaving times, when to clean, etc. He said this is the best razor he has owned. I am so happy that I purchased this and highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the heavy bearded","review":"I don't recommend this product for men with heavy facial hair. This unit tends to leave a lot of unshaved patches after a thorough use. It will not get a close shave either. It's good in a pinch when you're short on time and have to shave on the go. Men with a light beards should have no problem with this shaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun 8995 360 complete Shaver","review":"Used the Braun Shaver 8995 and did not like it. Sent it back after 5 days because it kept Shutting off and did not charge right in the clean and renew system. Had to use to much pressure on the face to get a close shave causing Razor Burn especially on the neck. Also they say to clean Renew it everyday which is ridiculous and will hurt the battery without letting it run down low before charging.Norelco suggest's to rinse clean every day under faucet and use the jet clean system every 2/3 weeks when the battery is at it's lowest so as to get the best perfomance out of the Battery.I always used Norelco rotary shaver 5865 and now ordered out the New Norelco 9170XLCC and can not beleive the closeness of the shave without so much pressure on the your face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"This is my second submission. Amazon did not publish my previous one. First problem, you MUST shave BEFORE you wash/shower your face! Does that mean I must change my way of life? Second, the flexing head proved much of a problem since is slipped and jumped over my skin. In the \\"fixed\\" mode the shave was never as close as my Norelco 8138XL about a third of the price. I needed to go over and over the facial area, pressing lightly and then firmly trying to cut the hairs but the result was unsatisfactory. I wish I can return this to Amazon for a credit against any other purchase.Please publish this now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the 7000 series","review":"For years I've used the 7000 series Braun shaver...I made the decision to upgrade to the new 360 shaving system...and yes, there is a difference...A must closer shave forBraun 8995 360 Complete Men's Shaverthe cutting heads are different...the shave much closer...also, may I say the cleaning system is superior Braun CCR2 Syncro, Activator, Flex XP, 360 Complete cleaner refill kit...J...Balboa, CA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much money for a poor shaver","review":"Having had previous Braun razors, I decided to try this one given all the advertising hoopla. After about 2-3 months, I called Braun & told them I was very unhappy with the unit. They sent me a new set of blades.After about 2 months, the cutting was just the same as previously...very bad! I reverted to my old Norelco (about $40) got a new set of blades (about $20) and got a far superior shave than that from this expensive Braun. It was too late to return to Amazon and was stonewalled at Braun.I suggest that anyone contemplating purchase of this product think not only twice but three, four or more times. What a wate of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"This appears to be a high quality product and I am not writing a bad review it just is not for me. I have a very difficult face to shave and over the years despised my Norelco for always eating my face, causing me to break-out on my neck. This does the same in a less effective shave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This is the first electric I've owned that makes me not want to use a blade much. If it doesn't shave as close as a blade, it's damn close, plus it's fast, takes me less than 2 min for a shave. Even does a good job on my neck. Battery life is good and the cleaning function works great. I only clean and charge about every 10-15 shaves though, I just remove the foil and tap it a few times or brush it after each shave. I previously had a Braun 7000 series, and this unit is superior, it's better at getting longer hairs and seems a bit closer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I bought this razor when it first came out. Thought for $180 it would be the best ever. Its a piece of junk. I had to have it repaired at my expense 3 times. The entire unit is designed poorly. In the fixed position, you need to tug and pull your skin to get it shaved. In the flex setting, you get nothing.The people that gave it good reviews must be the few lucky ones. I HATE it, and would urge you to read many reviews before you buy this.Panasonic makes a much better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun does it again","review":"I bougt my first Braun shaver about 12years ago. The original battery finaly died when it was left on a day or more.so i bought this new one,great shave outstanding quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"After using a Norelco rotary shaver for several years, I wanted to get a closer shave. Using Consumer Reports as a guide, I purchased a Braun 360 Complete, which was the only shaver with \\"excellent\\" shaving characteristics.Right from the get-go, it never took all of the hair off my face. I've tried slow shaving, pulling my skin tight, and all of the verbal suggestions that Braun's customer service folks provided. It typically takes me 12 to 15 minutes to get even a modicum of an acceptable shave before walking out the door. And as for the hair under my chin, on my neck, not once have I gotten an acceptable shave.Perhaps for a very light beard, it may work, but it was a huge disappointment for me. I've since swithed back to my Norelco, with new blades, of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Indignity","review":"In the first instance, this razer does not shave all that well. When my old razer died, I bought a $25 dollar Norelco as an emmergency replacement. After upgrading to this...and giving my face time to adjust...and doing several variations of side by side test...I was suprised and dissappointed to see that this razor takes longer and doesnt shave as close as the $25 Norelco, particularly for day to day use. (The Norelco seems to do poorly if days are skipped, as on the weekend, while this doesnt seem to matter as much with the Braun.)While the side-by-side tests might warrant one star alone, consider how you would feel if you tried to use this thing to shave your bald head and 80% of the hair taken from your face immediately dumped on your head. Not a one time thing, it just doesnt hold shavings properly. Even in routine facial use it does leak some shavings, which isnt cool for a razor in this price range.Avoid. Dont get sucked in by the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good shaver - but expensive","review":"Definitely the best electric shaver I have so far. The cleaning is very convenient, but you have to pay for the liquid refills every three months.I am glad I chose this, even though the price is high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun still not a Remington","review":"I went from a Remington to this Braun about 6 months ago. Immediately noticed the clipping blade/mechanism is not as powerful or effective as the Remington's. Now I rarely need to shave every day so it is often the case I will use the clipper to trim it down. With this shaver it was simply not possible and i have anything but a thick beard.I find the shaver is adequate if the hair is standing straight but if you have irregular facial hair at all (growing along skin or flatter) it completely misses the hair, even the clipper does not get it all.Thankfully Walmart takes anything back and i was able to exchange for the Remington Titanium for less than 50% the cost of the 360 and for my face it is twice the shaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"At least for my beard it doesn't work.

He has always been a Braun shaver user and was pleased with the Braun 360. We were a little disappointed that the new line of Braun shavers is not wet/dry because he likes to shave in the shower. My husband is Asian so he has a light beard. The cleaning system with this shaver is great and I think it will last a long time. The manufacturer recommends changing the cleaning solution monthly. But with his light beard, he has used the shaver every day since Christmas and now it is early February and the cleaning solution is still registering as full. The shaver works great and leaves his face nice and smooth. We are both happy with this Braun 360 shaver, too bad it is not wet/dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very close shave","review":"The series 5 (8995) shaver produced a very close shave for me. I used a Norelco shaver for thirty years. I thought that I would try the Braun to see if it would be a closer shave. I believe that it is. I wanted the series 7, but went with the series 5 due to price (about $60 difference). I am very pleased with the function and feel of the shaver.

I do a lot of trim work with hardwoods, and I would love to get 1/2\\" from the blade with my high powered saw. Guess I'll stick to my table saw for now.

He loves the stories and the pictures - both of which are simple but engaging for early readers. Most early reader phonics books struggle to craft engaging stories using the limited vocabularies available to their young audience. Clifford Phonics does so brilliantly.The other big advantage of this series is that is just that - a series. Whereas most phonics programs have one or two sets of books, Clifford has six. The series is graduated in steps of appropriate difficulty, which has kept my son interested and challenged. His reading has progressed remarkably well with the Clifford series. Not quite yet four years of age, he has worked his way up to Level 5 over the course of approximately ten months.

It is very heartwarming but, at the same time, Zevon (always an excellent songwriter) varies the mood rather then making every song so sad and somber.The first 4 songs of this are enjoyable (especially \\"Whats Good\\") but the rest is so depressing that it becomes quite ponderous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reminiscent of fledgling teenage guitar lessons.","review":"Lou Reed, and the customers who help him sell, just can't seem to find what they are looking for.I would like the priveleges removed from the person who sent, and therefore subjected me to listening to, this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"the thesis: a solid lou reed album","review":"Never have been a big Lou Reed fan, he was always just so-so in my mind.

Then they play a rarely played treat- Layla. Of course, Duane Allman was a big part of the original Derek and the Dominoes version so the Allmans are revisiting a part of the band's history here. Duane never did a live Layla but Clapton had been doing them for years. This is the best live Layla. you'll ever hear from anyone.

Even it was published in 1998, it is still much better than many other trading books. I found some new books published by Wiley are really bad. Many of them are only for absolute beginners. The contents of this one are quite mathematical and technical. So it is helpful for traders at higher level.

Interwoven with the trials of harsh military academy life are the glimpses of a family beyond the breaking point: the alienated sisters, the larger-than-life father, the harsh white stepmother, and the fading memories of a long-dead mother provide a gripping emotional background. Furthermore, the reader learns quite a bit about both West Point and the changing attitudes of the 1960's. The irony is that once Ting gains acceptance within the military despite his Chinese heritage, he is alienated from the outside world of the anti-war movement by his uniform. It was quite powerful to see the boy from the mean streets of San Francisco grow up into a man of honor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gus Lee","review":"This was a very exciting story.

Seriously flawed yet the best at what he does. That might be a whole lot easier to swallow if he weren't a psychiatrist. Up until the half way mark I was able to stomach the unbelievable plot and that's why it got two stars but after that it became ridiculous. Between the flashbacks to an abusive childhood and kinky sex there is a wonder at all that oh yeah he figured out who was murdering everyone. If you want an interesting, plot twisting, all the facts laid out kind of mystery then don't get this one. I have yet to figure out what the title has to do with the book.... maybe it's one of those deep psychological things."},{"rating":"2","title":"great surprise!!","review":"My first book by Ablow was a great journey through some sick and twisted minds that this book has to offer. Every character is flawed in one way or another which makes the whole cast very interesting. The plot is not too complex, however within the first few pages you get sort of 'sucked in' into the story and it's very hard to stop reading. I was reading this book until the early hours because I simply couldn't put it away. I would appreciate a little bit more character development. I still have no idea how old Clavenger is or what he looks like (maybe I have missed it). Overall, Great book from cover to cover. Will gladly purchase the other books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Psychologist discovers his own issues while learning other","review":"I really liked this book.

I have to believe that the author was sharing with us insight into his own perspective of the world, his own experience. It just all rang so very true. I thought it was a well crafted, intelligently thought out mystery. I started reading it and literally could not put it down until I finished it. In the tradition of Jonathan Kellerman, I found myself empathizing for the doctor and delighted at the twist at the end. I somehow feel like I know this man; and I certainly wish I had another book about him to start reading right now!:) Thank you, Keith; you did a wonderful job:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy every sense of Denial!","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed this murder-mystery! Frank Clevenger, a forensic psychiatrist, tries to track down the murderer. This drug-addicted, sex derived man gives the story a definate twist. With his girlfriend working in the hospital amongst sinners and subjucts of prey, gives Clevenger enough reason to take this case seriously. I found myself deep into this book, as if I was trying to find the killer myself. For a non-reader like myself, I highly recommend this book, for it includes murder-mystery, romance, drugs, and real-life actions. With all this in one book, you can't go wrong with Denial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely impossible to put down","review":"What a blast! Just plucked this book from the shelf and couldn't have enjoyed it more. Lots of ideas presented that really make the reader think.

The author apparently decided if he included lots of perversions the reader wouldn't notice the lack of a story. The main character, Frank Clevenger, somehow stumbles through an almost constant drugged blur onto what's going on and takes an absurd course of action that brings a conclusion to a waste of time spent reading this book. I won't dwell on the sex, drugs or gambling which accounts for the bulk of the 358 pages, but instead on the lack of any twisting, turning or surprises, as the ending was predictable and really not much of a mystery at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin mount","review":"Great solution for the suction mounts that never stay attached.

However, it was pretty undistinguished as far as romance novels go. I liked the begining with the girl and the young man before they became adults. Piper however, is a bit hard to beleive, never into girly things, but as soon as she tries she masters it, but still a tom-boy. I think she is a little bit too much of everything. Gabe on the other hand is pretty interesting, and I liked his insecurity in his physical apperance, it was really rather refreshing to see a guy worry.

Because this one has plenty of probelms. It is a very light weight, low powered, tool that lacks precision. When plunge cutting, the base and motor-housing do NOT remain on course. The very light weight columns connecting the base to the housing do not hold with adequate precision. Thus the machine tends to cut \\"u\\" shaped mortises. There is a lot of wiggle in this machine.It has no speed control. Only a quater inch collet, that has a tendency to come loose while routing. A very flimsy guard.

The Skil 1823 fails to fulfill the third function and so cannot be used for routing. The plunge mechanism tends to lock the base up to 1/8\\" off kilter and allows the base to wiggle back and forth. It is not just that I got a lemon. Every Skil router with this plunge mechanism that I've tried behaves the same way. The flaw is designed into the tool. No other brand of plunge router I've ever tried permits the base to move this way.I exchanged it for an even cheaper fixed-base Ryobi router that has done its job well for several years now.Skil was once synonymous with the circular saw but has squandered its reputation on frustrating tools like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovejoy","review":"Having lived in England and watched this series over there, it was great to see it again.

And what a relief, to get a break from the sped-up, full-volume, overproduced, profanity-heavy style of current tv dramas. Though it is pitched quite differently than Gash's books, I suspect this show appeals to people who tend toward reading rather than extensive tv viewing, who enjoy stories that cultivate the imagination rather than pound in the propaganda with either shouted exposition or childish sentimentality. McShane's Lovejoy enjoys life, it's why he always has partners in crime--ok, \\"crime\\"--and why nemesis Charlie Gimbert detests him. The regular cast is pure gold. To this city-bound viewer, there hasn't been a better tv vacation than the Lovejoy sojourn in rural East Anglia since All Creatures Great and Small's Yorkshire dales and Poldark's Cornwall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series, poorly organized DVD","review":"First, I love Lovejoy. I have video tapes and have been waiting for the series on DVD. But this DVD version is disappointing. You can play all the episodes in order, or you can play scenes from each episode.

It's the first album without Dee Dee. It's the first album with C.J. It's the first live album released in the US. It's the last album released by Sire Records. Other than that, how is the album? Pretty good, actually. It is a typical solid Ramones concert of the era. The songs are played faster than the studio versions, as usual. C.J. does an admirable job of taking Dee Dee's place, even singing \\"Wart Hog\\" about as well as Dee Dee did. The set list doesn't really have any surprises, other than one big surprise.

There's a fair amount of repetition as well. The most noticeable problem, though, is that every other page is blank.

I'm at a complete loss to figure out why anyone would do this; I don't think I've ever seen it done before.The information in this book would probably make a very good FAQ file somewhere, but it's not worth $18.95 (especially since the book itself says $16.00 on the cover)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious story and involving mystery","review":"It's five stars for its mystery category but it would be four stars in the general category.

Some of the things he says and situations he's in are uhh..priceless. The setting of the story, a little bookstore in Greenich makes it all the more fun. This is still my favorite burgler book, but that's because it's the first one I read. The funny thing was I picked this book off the shelf because the NYC skyline was on it, and after reading the backcover.. I thought it'd be good for cheap entertainment.

This is a sometimes-confusing mystery involving a series of events that sees Bernie burgle an apartment, return the booty and then re-enter the place to plant evidence after finding a corpse in the bathroom.

He blows you away right from the start (as does the band) but by the time the Dylan classic 'Blowin' in the wind' is played inside out in a truly amazing rendering of this song, he grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go anymore. This is a CLASSIC rock album, although Live Rust is more famous. Trust me, this is Live Rust tenfold. Cortez the Killer, Crime in the City, Powderfinger... it's all here. But you will be coming back to Blowin' in the Wind, just like me. Recorded on the verge of the Gulfwar, Young gets angry and gets the song done in just the right way. Think about what could have happened in the Gulf War, close your eyes and set the volume to 12. This is not a song, this is a work of Art, deserving to belong in every self respecting rock collection. Impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music-Bad sound( Side one )","review":"I don't know what the problem is but side one sounds as if it was recorded on a old tape machine that was located far from the stage. Side two is Okay so I wonder if it is a one shot production error.

I was looking for some of the original recordings that I used to listen to on 8 track. It turned out that all of these songs were recorded more recently.

The songs on this album are sung by a much older Brenda Lee and it sounds like it.

His strong sense of structure of his 3 books within a single book, explaining his and his families life with apartheid. Malan's journalistic skills are evident in his narrative through his detailed examination of events, especially in Book Two when many murders take place. Although Malan's intent on writing this novel may or may not be justified as some view him as a complete \\"liar\\", My Traitor's Heart still captivates the struggles between white and blacks during and after apartheid with precision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this book.","review":"I have just finished reading My Traitor's Heart, and all I can say is that I cannot wait to read it again. It was an unbelievably honest account of South Africa and how an average white middle class person deals with the injustices of the world. This is not just a book about apartheid, it is a book for anyone who grapples with living in the first world, while so many are dying in the third. This is quite possibly the most honest book about the world that I have ever encountered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great then, great now","review":"When I read this book ten plus years ago it blew me away, both as political and narrative non-fiction, and as excellent writing.

It may no longer be in print, and it may not be perfect, since it only covers the episodes up to the departure of Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe) But up to that point, it is full of facts and information about all the arcane references stuck into the dialogue.

Also, since most bossa nova is written in lead sheet form (\\"Corcovado\\" is poorly written in The Real Book) it would be helpful to include a lead sheet along with the arrangement so that the student who is not familiar with bossa nova can get a better sense of its brilliant comping style and beautiful melodies.

Might be another star or two if you did not need to use it in beds."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"I found the sound quality to be very good, I mostly listen to r&b; & hip-hop which actually requires more than just \\"thumping bass\\" for a fulfilling sonic experience. As another commenter noted, if you live in an apartment you will never be able to avail yourself of full bass or full volume.However, the wiring for 1 speaker shorted out within a month or 2 of my purchasing the product. 2 years later, the whole entire thing stopped working. No sound came out at all. The power was still on, the little blue light was still illuminated. But there was no sound. I used other speakers, nothing.I know that $50 is not a great deal of money, but if the unit is only going to function for 2 years, it should at least function perfectly within that time. But I also think it should last at least 5 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers!","review":"Great speakers for the price. Easy set up. 38 Watts.

Sadly, the filmmaker spends too much time interviewing marginal people who are obviously loons. More chilling is when he focuses on people with credibility who embrace the same deranged beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protocols of Zion","review":"I gave this review 4 stars because of the concise nature of this documentary recounting Anti-Semitism in America.Very clearly this was conveyed within this DVD. I am glad that I did not pay attention to the myriad negative reviews on Amazon before purchasing this DVD. I wanted to see this documentary for myself before rendering any opinion.Mr. Levin painstakingly points out the prevalence of Lies and deceits over the ages. Overall, this was not boring to me and the clarity of the cinematography and the audio was crisp and to the point. I urge clear minded thinking individuals to view this, as I have and come up with their own synopsis of this documentary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hidden Hypocricy","review":"All the while this film bemoans anti-Semitism, Marc Levin's father has the nerve to downgrade the Catholic Church by making fun of the sign of the cross.

In order to prove this, they go and find the nastiest, sleaziest white supremicists they can find, and stick them in front of the camera.That's what this film does with anti-semitism. It talks about a document called the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and examines it in detail. This document is discredited and is believed only by the kooks and flakes of the world. And it's those flakes that this film goes to great pains to seek out and interview.And so Levin \\"proves\\" that there is rampant antisemitism in the United States. Whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly Unwatchable","review":"Ever Again was not a particularly well done documentary, but it's a work of genius compared to this drivel. It seems most of the other reviewers have been soft on this film because it is against the evil of Antisemitism. This film fails to make a coherent argument. The director jumps from scene to scene with no flow or direction. There are numerous tangents that go nowhere. The director likes to hear himself talk and ends up in verbal fights with idiots while he spouts stupid platitudes. Worst of all, the director seems to believe in a great all encompassing corporate conspiracy not much different than that expoused by The Protocols."},{"rating":"1","title":"crapp","review":"i give this dvd ..-1 star..no information about the protocals of zion.its all about alan levin.he isnt going to say its all true is he? ..crapp dvd..waste of money and time and electricity watching this B S.....crapp.......this B S only aroused my suspicion of a protocols of zion for world domination............"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISJOINTED and CONFUSING","review":"I bought this video for my local high school video library, to introduce the students to the fraud of the \\"PROTOCOLS\\".I assumed from the title it would expose \\"THE PROTOCOLS\\" for being the forgery and fraud that it is, and this video just does not do that.IT was disjointed, and confusing, jumping from just a tiny bit of PROTOCOL history, to 9-11, to MEL GIBSON'S \\"PASSION OF THE CHRIST\\", to the ISRAEL/PALESTINE conflict, to anti-Semitic hate groups, to a scene with prisoners.SOME scenes had me curious if this was pro or anti \\"PROTOCLS\\".IT just does not make the connection of the \\"PROTOCOLS\\" to modern day anti-JUDAISM.IT would have been much better to stay with its title, the history of THE PROTOCOLS, and the fact that it has been proven more than once as a forgery and a fraud."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned 2 copies","review":"I received a copy that had no sound and I was sent another copy that also had no sound.I returned both copies by mail at my expense and requiring a signature for delivery.I never received an answer from Them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Leave it to the Jews to figure out a way to turn 9/11 into something about them !!!!

I own two of these, bought them together. Wish I could send them back, and Netgear just won't have anything to do with them. Within a couple months, they were locking up, dropping connections. I personally think its because these are fanless, and seem to overheat very quickly. I am amazed that Netgear thinks that a switch should be unplugged when not in use... a network switch is always in use.As far as performance goes, these switches are unable to sustain anything over 200Mbps.

If you are looking for an economical 16-Port GB switch the GS116 is an excellent choice. Simply plug it in and it works! I have installed the switch down stream from my 4-port cable router. The auto-sensing port configuration works as advertised. No problems intermixing 10,100,1000 devices.

Bought it as replacement for original clip that came with headset, but this one does not hold firm to the headset cord. The device \\"attaches\\" in two places. One clip is the alligator clip that attaches to your shirt, and that clip is great, works perfectly. But the part where the clip attaches to the headset cord is not strong enough to hold firmly to the cord. As a result, the headset cord slides throught the clip and the weight of the cord pulls the headset tight on your head, which is what the clip is supposed to prevent in the first place.So IMO, absolutely worthless, as is. In order to get it to function, made one wrap of tape around the phone cord at the spot I wanted the clip to stay, then reverse wraped the tape so it stuck to itself with the sticky side out. Now the clip would actually grab. Not the end of the world and more trouble then it was worth to send back, so I didn't bother. But annoying that it didn't function out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Spring","review":"The button isn't spring loaded so it doesn't hold the cord in nearly as well as it should.

Now it grips the wire tightly and can still be adjusted, opened, and closed.The clip that attaches to your clothes seems substantial enough.

James Ingram is blessed with one of the smoothest, purest and most breathtakingly gorgeous voices in contemporary soul, R&B and pop - this CD proves this perfectly. Sadly, James' duets with other artists were far more successful than his own solo albums but this CD pays proper tribute to one of the best male vocalists of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best place to start for an healthy dose of this smooth cat","review":"One of the smoothest, most passionate soul crooners ever to step in front of a microphone, the career of James Ingram has been hurt somewhat by the fact that his individual albums are often uneven and often filled with material that is much less special than his voice. He's also achieved great success as a wildly popular guest artist who has been the male lead on a number of memorable duets. This collection does an adequate job of collecting most of his essential singles, but it's also relatively small, missing a couple of great songs, and so far, there has not been a proper James Ingram anthology of 20 or more songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power Of James Ingram.......","review":"Is his voice, which is great, and does not only shivers women but also for me as a male listener.

Maybe they don't know yet that DVD technology allow for subtitles as a choice option, and maybe their budget was too short to get them right (one quarter is accurate, one quarter is approximate, one quarter is absolute fancy, and one quarter has escaped translation.

I also took for granted that the best audio facility would have been employed re-record the track of a film this important cinema history. Well, I was wrong on both counts and badly wrong at that. It's almost as though someone found a 16mm print that had been left outside in a garbage dump for twenty years and mastered it rather than go through the expense of restoring this masterpiece. It is simply the worst looking print and worst sounding track I have ever experienced on VHS or DVD.

Anyway, LOLA MONTES might carry the high cachet of a master's masterpiece, but I could barely keep my eyes on this story of the grand courtesan of Europe, Lola Montes, who left Liszt, loved King Ludwig, and wound up in the middle of a circus with Peter Ustinov wearing the tall silk and cracking a whip, the audience shouting out indelicate questions, and her life being replayed in a series of flashbacks. The lovely Lola, played by the monotonous Martine Carol, may have led a fascinating and compelling life, but it failed to generate a spark with me.The thing does look good though, as far as I could tell. Nice framing, editing, layers of action, that kind of stuff. When this Fox/Lorber dvd wasn't showing off its scratches and flares it was fluttering across the screen. Even with a pristine print and a perfect transfer, though, I don't think I'd care to sit through this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the whole story!","review":"Having taken a day trip to Nevada City, Ca., I was surprised to learn that Lola Montez had lived there and the house is still standing. There are also a couple of plaques in the town commemorating her living and entertaining there. Since I was pretty fascinated about her life and ended up reading alot about her life. Unfortunately the movie does not show her life at all in California and only mentions it. This was the main reason I rented it on Netflix but was very disappointed with it.

If you like Snoopy and Woodstock, this is one of the few, perhaps only, Gameboy games that feature them. Snoopy saves various Woodstocks and he has to maneuver through various obstacle courses (blocks, arrows, etc.) without being hit by one or more balls. There's a lot more and there are about 100 different screens. If you lose all of your lives, you can continue to play at whatever level you were at anyway by choosing 'Continue' (don't have to go back to the easy level), but your points do go back to zero. The only Gameboy my 5 year old likes so far! Good old-fashioned Gameboy fun. Kind of like Packman on steroids, but with Snoopy in charge. Great music, different on each screen.

This is a standard platformer with extremely sluggish control, no secondary weapons, and slow movement. Plus, your whip loses power each time an enemy hits you. This is a pain.

They all 3 are great,fun adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the 64 Castlevania's...","review":"This is a completely dumbed-down version of Castlevania- Belmont has NO abilities in this! No jumps or charges, no use of weapons like the axe or cross, not even whip-spinning. There is horrible slowdown when there are more than two enemies on screen at once, which is surprising given how simple the game is. It also lacks any kind of level progression like pass codes, so you start at the beginning every single time you play.

I play his CD in my car while driving and find his music to be very soothing. Listening to Yiruma's beautiful music makes this 40+ something year old want to get my own piano and take lessons - not that I could ever play as well as he does, but I find it very inspiring.

The drill itself seems solid and well built, even after a lot of use.The circ saw is powerful enough and well balanced, but battery life can be an issue if you don't plan your charges in advance.The recip saw is nice enough and well balanced, if a little heavy (I had to do some tight cutting above my head and holding it up there was a little tiring after a while).The flashlight? Well, it just sits there. I suppose it would be ok, but usually both of my batteries are taken, either by a tool or the charger.The standout here is really the drill, followed by the circular saw. The fact that I don't have to drag a cord around is simply wonderful, and the 18v tools provide more than enough power for the things I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than OOM-MOW-MOW","review":"I bought this because I wanted to have Papa-oom-mow-mow and Mama-oom-mow-mow on a CD. My vinyl copies were worthless without an investment in equipment to convert them into an MP-3 file. When I received it I was very pleasantly surprised. The Rivingtons offer up a brand of R and B that you don't find anymore- fun and soulful. The two aforementioned tracks are worth the price alone, but most of the other cuts are either fun in the style of the Mow-Mow cuts or just rock-solid R and B. Classic stuff.

I'm so glad Cindy used their stuff or I may have missed out. I would have paid full price for this one.

Here are the pros and the consPros : Great headset if you get one of the few that aren't defective.Cons : The problems that many have are --microphone doesn't work properly-when you adjust the microphone volume it makes a LOUD screeching/buzzing noise (very annoying)-if you have a big head like me it will hurt your ears after 10 minutes of use. Steel series said it fits 99% of people, I think thats crap.-cheaply madeOverall : If I were you I would buy something else, like a sennheiser or something. Even my $[...] plantronics headset is better than this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointing","review":"There weren't any reviews of this headset available when I purchased it. I have owned many different gaming headsets in the past and this is by far the lowest quality headset I have ever purchased. The mic has been the major problem. You have to place it nearly in your mouth to be audible. I have tested it with different applications and computers with the same results. The adjustment on the left earpiece no longer locks in place and completely slides up and down. I hate buying products where it is completely obvious that the manufacturer was trying to maximize profits while completely disregarding their product quality. I would estimate $5 in electronics, $5 in materials, $5 in manufacturing & packaging. Thanks SteelSound, I now know what to expect in your products and will not be purchasing another one again. At least you saved me $100 on your mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality headset","review":"I got Steel Sound 5H as Christmas gift and three month later I'm ready to throw it away.As previous person reported microphone produced poor sound from the beginning. While retractable microphone is a good idea, it tends to twist away from your mouth making things even worse.

Plastic adjustment strap stopped latching in place so they do not keep my adjustments.Overall it's a bad electrical and mechanical design."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Sucks...","review":"This game sucks.

This is an album i passed up because of the 'professional' reviewers trashed it more often than not. I was drawn back again and again because of simple curiousity. I grabbed it, crossed my fingers, and placed it in my cd player. Unbelievable. Those critics,in my opinion, are dead wrong. Vocals, at least this time, DO add to the blue man group. These 'creations' are well crafted and colorful. So much fun to listen to. Their 're-do' of DONNA SUMMERS' \\"I feel love\\" was juiced up so strong that it actually overshadowed the original. So much power in this music. So much energy. And a nice selection of songs with incredible vocals. This is truly a great follow-up album from a group i will now stay true to with their every release. D*MN the critics."},{"rating":"1","title":"overshadowed","review":"if you found yourself loving their studio album, audio, and are expecting more of the same, don't waste your money, or set yourself up for disappointment. in this release, the Blue Men i have come to love take a back seat, and give the lime light to artist who stand well on their own, but don't come close to the talent found in this trio who's name on the cover is overshadowed by those artist featured on this release. I bought this release for the Blue Man Group, not for artist using their talent to further their own career."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Feel Love","review":"I wish I could give this album MORE than 5 stars. I first saw the Group in NYC and had a great time, so when they came to Toronto I went to the Complex concert. It turned out to be a maxed-out version of the NYC show and the best live performance I've ever experienced. Even the warm-up bands were great. So, I went out and bought every CD they ever made and even every CD that any band that ever toured with them ever made. My musical universe just got a whole lot larger. Although I feel that there are too many labels for music today, sometimes they are necessary. This music is definitely high energy \\"rock-pop\\". If it were a drink it would be a vodka-martini. If it were an animal it would be a large, sleek cat. If it were a colour, it would be an electric blue. (How about a large sleek, electric blue cat drinking a vodka martini?) I wish they'd make a DVD of the Complex concert.

Pulling pre-approved audience members on stage to put plugs in their ears attached to drumsticks, while someone off stage makes silly noises.

For one thing, they even expanded on their rock tunes, and they focused on a larger percussion section and even more electric guitar riffs mixed in the music. The lights were incredible, and the effects were awesome. The only downturn was when they had warm-up bands play for an hour and a half! Of course, they appeared on The Complex album and weren't bad to listen to. I think that it is safe to say that The Complex is better than Audio because now they expand their musical abilities to even higher levels. BMG even gave way to some heavy-metal tunes. Let me say it this way-if you are looking(or listening)for a treat, Blueman Group is the group to see(or hear)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Man Complex","review":"Fun & Exciting.

The first album had no words at all, but this album has vocals on almost every track. It's got a lot of slow tracks, but there are a few really rocking tracks as well. My personal favorites are Tracks 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 13. This album has a very high replay value. I could listen to this at least once a week"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their own worst enemy","review":"While this album is satisfying on its own, it is no match for the first time seeing or hearing BMG. Their formula is largely retained, except for the obvious addition of vocals. Some of them feel like a stretch or a superfluous add-on, but they are not as distracting as I had feared. BMG remain propulsive, danceable, and intelligent --not too many bands of which this can be said. I'm really interested in how this all incorporates into a live show, and just what the performance/music mix is like. Maybe the hardest thing is having ANOTHER secret band \\"discovered,\\" like when David Byrne showed up on the cover of Time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome","review":"I bought this CD as well as \\"Audio\\" after a Blue Man Group performance in Las Vegas. It is some of the best music I have ever heard, the ingenuity of the instruments make it so unique. The vocals in The Complex don't take away from the music that Blue Man creates. Anyone who appreciates rock and/or percussion will love these cd's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PVC Pipe Dreams","review":"Saw BMG on their Complex tour in Syracuse, NY at the Landmark Theater and since then have become a fan of theirs. With their percussive instrumentations most songs sound very tribal, but the song Exhibit 13 (a tribute to 9/11) is very touching and moving. The guest artists featured on some of the tracks are the right kind of mixture to what would only be 3 guys with blue grease paint on their face beating on plumber's piping, however, getting paid a pretty penny for it. My favorite track on the album is The Current with Gavin Rossdale doing vocals. A couple of other favorites are the ones with Tracy Bonham on vocals. She was one of the lead-off groups at the live concert for BMG and she and really sing. I recommend this album highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indeed...","review":"Put it in, turn it up and enjoy. No, it isn't the show, neither is Audio, but you can hear/feel the innovation and energy the BMG put into this Disc.Strange Instruments, Big Drums and a mix of other insturments combined with the insturment of voice make for a nice immersive listening experiance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait - hauntingly familiar yet fresh","review":"Blue Man Group's newest album is a sure fan pleaser, and is a must buy for both old and new fans alike. Those who are familiar with the group will immediately recognize the 'tubular' sounds that BMG has made famous over the years, but that is not to say that the group hasn't continued to stay on the edge. It was an excellent decision on their part to bring in outside groups to add vocals to their pounding rhythms - and the product is an album that grows more and more enjoyable with each listen. Those who are long-time fans of the group are encouraged to give the album a few listens, as some of the new sounds may be slow to take hold.Finally - it should be noted that this album truly is *better* than the original, as it not only brings the music from the incredible stage show to life, but it brings the EXCITEMENT of the stage show right to your home stereo. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary extra","review":"I found the base raises the sharpener too high on my workbench.

The value here is that in most later (upper division) math classes there is a major benefit to knowing even a little of the material from some of the other upper division classes. On the other hand, this book simply will not help you learn how to do proofs. After going about half way through the book and working on the exercises, I realized that I was no better at doing proofs than when I began. The \\"hints\\" to the exercises in the back of the book are really no help at all for self study. I usually know the right strategy, what I really need to learn is the correct way to express my ideas as a proof, and this book does not provide very much guidance on how to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice prose, not so nice mathematics.","review":"I used this book for a transition course to higher mathematics and found it lacking.The positive aspects of this book are the friendly writing style and the wide variety of topics introduced that are essential to other higher mathematics courses. This book can serve as a nice introductory reference to \\"refresh\\" certain topics; it may also be used to spark interest in other interesting aspects of the field.However, the books friendliness was counterbalanced by being completely unhelpful in the exercises. I thought the exercises were completely unhelpful and what's worse unrelated to the examples given in the respective section. I would not recommend this book for someone looking to get an substantial introduction to abstract mathematics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not alone nor in the Dark","review":"I could not even give this movie a B rating.

It's another one of those forgotten 80's slashers like \\"Madman\\" and \\"The Prowler\\", that were overlooked at the box office, but are such a pleasure to find on the video store shelves. What I like most about \\"Alone in the Dark\\" is that it's not just your usual teens-in-peril-here-comes-the-masked-killer movie. There is an actual storyline here, with a pretty cool plot, and one really great twist. \\"Alone in the Dark\\" does a great job of building up suspense, which is a lost art that you don't get with today's films. Instead of things jumping out at you to get scares, \\"Alone in the Dark\\" creates a creepy atmosphere that continually builds throughout the film, with almost no cheap scares along the way.

This book gives a first hand view of the event from the men who were there and fought it. It is filled with acts of bravery, moments of tragedy and, yes, even humor. You are there to see average American young men as they meet war head on - no sugar-coating, no embellishment. Well researched and well written. Definitely worth the price of the book and the time spent reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"As soon as I put laundry on it, one arm bent, promptly followed by the other 3 arms. It had no strength and I am very disappointed. I'm from Europe where these types of dryers are very popular. Next time I will look for individually strung lines, adjustable height and more than 165 ft of line length. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intro to data visualization for novices.","review":"Westphal and Blaxton do a good job of introducing data mining concepts, but focus too heavily on data visualization techniques. A large chunk of the book is devoted to tool walk throughs, information that will be outdated soon. The case studies cover several industries, but fail to show the authors' methodology in action. The greatest shortcoming is the EXTREMELY brief discussion on neural networks, genetic algorithms and other non-visual analytic methods. If you are a beginner in data visualization, buy this book. Anyone looking for in depth (or even an intro) discussion on AI and statistics, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret Honor","review":"Not one of Griffin's best efforts. Little action and excessive attention to the boring details of aristocratic life on both sides of the conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret Honor review","review":"This is by far the weakest of Griffin's novels, and I have read them all. It is \\"the Rich and Famous in Argentina\\", filled with unnecessary, lengthy descriptions, situations which have no relevance to the plot, a rehash of too much of previous volumes, and just a matter of \\"treading water\\" for 600+ pages. I got to the end and thought \\"Who cares? Why did he write this? The plot did not develop at all.\\" I am very frustrated by this volume. I will give him one more chance, but after being burned this time, if he burns me again, it will be the last time. Can anyone tell me what part of the plot was developed beyond the end of the previous volume in this series?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good.","review":"This series is not his best, but I still find it hard to put it down.

I've read most of what he has written and I'm on the second time around for The Corps and the Honor Bound series. When I complete them I reread the Officer series. I can't get enough of them. Come man write a new one in The Corps series."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Interlude to the Next One","review":"I have long been a WEB Griffin fan. His one fault in my opinion is that he writes each book to stand alone. Consequently, the deeper into a series of books you get, the more time he has to spend to rehash what you may not have read. One of the other reviews panned Secret Honor for only having 1 shot fired in anger. Since each story must have a beginning, a middle, and an end, it makes sense that books in a series do also. This is a \\"middle book\\" and sets the ground work for the future books. I still found it entertaining although I wish the author would quit using the full name and title of each character as he brings them into the chapter. He must get paid by the word!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too \\"Ho-Hum\\" for me!","review":"Although I am an avid reader of W.E.B. Griffin military books,this whole series is turning out to be a real disappointment to me. I hope that the current book is the last of this series. The story line involving an American Marine of Argentine descent and his involvement with the O.S.S. and struggles to keep Argentina out of W.W.II as a German co-belligerent is awfully thin and contrived. The character development usually present in most Griffin books is sadly lacking here.The characters are,at best,forgettable and terribly shallow. This is probably the worst effort yet by my favorite author;it is the only one of his books that I didn't feel the urge to re-read. Two stars is generous. If you started this series and feel the need to wrap it up--O.K. read the book. Not a good intro to W.E.B. Griffin for a new reader..."},{"rating":"2","title":"WW2 in Argentina.","review":"Again WEB Griffin provides information about areas of conflict not writtn about. With its polyglot population of Italian, German, and British immigrants it must have been a hotbed of intrigue. He brings it to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"READING CON BRIO","review":"Griffin proved himself to be a champion of military suspense with \\"Honor Bound\\" and \\"Blood and Honor.\\" Brace yourselves for a roller coaster of thrills because he's done it again.In \\"Secret Honor,\\" a German general plots the assassination of Adolf Hitler. At the same time in Buenos Aires the general's son is targeted by the SS following a botched Nazi operation. OSS agent Cletus Frade knows them both and he knows the truth. But, Frade is branded a rogue agent by the OSS. All three men are in peril.As always, Tony Award nominee Lang reads with brio. His stellar performance is the perfect showcase for this astoundingly well crafted story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SCAM on his followers","review":"I always have looked for Griffin's next book, so I picked this one up immediately, only to find that it repeated 75% of the previous one in the Honor series and left the reader nowhere. There are even direct copies of paragraphs from the previous novel (which I enjoyed). In order for him to keep up the production tempo of his releases, I am sure he has a staff of sub-writers, but he needs to find some who don't plagiarize his old writings. Summary--boring, too long and no story conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of his works","review":"i was quite disappointed by this book-slow moving, little intrigue, more focused on the sex lives of the subjects than the development of the plot - not as impressive as his usual work - had to force myself to finish it"},{"rating":"1","title":"secret honor","review":"Of all Mr. Griffins books that I have read this is the most boring, it would take a computer to keep up with all the German surnames. I read about three quarters of the book and threw it away, I found no suspense, no action, no plot, nothing to keep your interest. I read as much as I did hoping for something. I will admit I haven't read the previous two books of this series, I can only hope that in them there is something to make this book \\"work\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff.","review":"I eagerly await Griffith's war series books. But this one takes the first 100 pages and more to bring new readers who haven't read the first two books in the series, up to date. Unfortunately, this is done with a series of very boring meetings between groups of the participants, Nazis, Argentinians, Americans. Booooring! After that has put the reader to sleep, the book doesn't go on to great action, but just slow moving on the part of the participants. I was very disappointed in the book, especially since I bought it in hardcover, not being able to wait for a paperback version. Hope the rest aren't like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spinning in Place","review":"I have read all of Griffin's military books and I have to say that this one was a disappointment. In short, it accomplishes nothing and doesn't really move any of the major plot lines along. Frade's marriage has had a big setup for several books but is almost a footnote and the OSS is simply the same-old/same-old. Graham's verbal assault on Frade in his own house is so silly as to beg, \\"just try it buddy, it's the results that count.\\" It also has to be read with a reference to Nazi rank structure handy in order to keep track of everyone. I just didn't feel I would have missed anything if I skipped this book and read the next one when it comes out. Hopefully, we'll see some closure on some of the story lines. If I want open, unending stories that go nowhere, I can always read The Wheel of Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret Honor, few Secrets","review":"Posted reader-reviews by Kelley and Anthony, fellow West-Coasters are essentially accurate judgments. I rate it 2 stars rather than 3 because it's so much less intriguing than any previous Griffin (Butterworth) novels, in this series, The Corps, or possibly anything but the Philly PD books. As for historical inaccuracies, I right away picked up on the \\"Army Air Corps,\\" but that's almost obscure; many people don't realize Hap Arnold changed the name to US Army Air Forces in mid-1941. Many other \\"errors\\" seem to be continuity or proofreading errors, getting times wrong, as with the invitation to see Peron at 7:30PM but arriving before 6. Not as good as the first two in the Honor series, we still need to read this, I just wish it had been incorporated with #4, so we didn't have to pay to read about a couple of months in the life of Clete Frade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listening to tape takes a lot of concentration","review":"Some books on tape are easy listening for long car trips. Some involve more complex plots and/or ideas and take more concentration than is safe when driving. I suppose tapes have to be judged by slightly different standards than the books on which they based. A book like <Secret Honor> has so many characters, so many plot threads and twists, that the listener wishes he could look back to remind himself about who a person is or what event is being referred to. Even in its abridged format (6 hours), this novel is pretty involved. Frankly I began to give up half way through. I did like the reader however, and the sporadic use of background music and some sound effects helped somewhat. The plot began very nicely, holding my interest, but then too many things began to happen--and none of them were particularly exciting--to characters with whom I felt little or no sympathy. For those who like this author or sprawling spy novels, this tape is recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret Honor","review":"A very disappointing book. I did not find anything about a plot to kill Hitler and there was less intrigue and less suspense than what is found in the Boy Scout's Handbook. The 2 main characters succeeded in impregnating 2 Argentinian naivettes and that seemed to be the highlight of the \\"story\\". A couple of plane rides around South America resulted in a smidgeon of activity but other than that it was \\"Yawnsville\\" all the way. The endless, needless repetition of the Kraut's formal titles were boring and only added to the author's \\"paid per word\\" remuneration. The reviews on the book's rear cover were obviously written by people who have never read the book. Especially vapid is the Kirkus Reviews' \\"gibber-al\\" comment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to the library or wait for the paperback","review":"This was an effort to finish. Absolutely no excitement, little intrigue, and not much else, unless you count two shotgun weddings. Shows what really went on in Argentina during WWII - nothing exciting! I never cared for this new series anyway, and hope next time Griffin gets back to The Corps or the Badge of Honor series. Assuming he hasn't just plain lost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"This book gets the second star only because of the previous books in the \\"Honor\\" series and the books in \\"The Corps\\" series. There is almost nothing that happens in this book that couldn't have been covered in the last 10 pages of the previous book or the first 10 pages of the next book. 50% of the book was a summary of the previous 2 books! Don't waste your money on this book; you can catch up in the next book easily. Mr. Griffin, please do better next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why write this series at all?","review":"I am sorely puzzled. The master who wrote the Men at War, Brotherhood of War and Corps series seems to be floundering. His latest book is poorly researched (Himmler NEVER was \\"Reichsprotektor\\", EL bitcho, etc.) and very badly edited, with words missing in the middle of sentences; both the Spanish and German language quotes are atrociously misspelled; time and again the reader is jarred. It appears that a few years ago, the writer had a good editor and at least a German-speaking advisor at his disposal; alas, no longer. This book is far from the military masterpieces of the Corps, Men at War, Brotherhood of War and even the Badge of Honor series. Too bad. Two recommendations: 1. Drop this series, it isn't worth to be bought. 2, Go back to the Corps, where you shine, Mr. William E. B....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I have read all of W.E.B. Griffin's books, including the Badge of Honor series written under a different name. I enjoyed all of them even though a few got into too much detail. This one is the most confusing book I have ever read. Every character has a foreign/hyphenated name further complicated by nicknames and code names. In one ridiculous instance, he even named two women Dorotea and used the sentence \\" I don't know if Dorotea knows if Dorotea is coming\\". Add to that a triple dose of his historical minutae and myriad details about every aspect of everything. The plot wanders all over the place...Terrible book- I will never buy another one of his books again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret Honor","review":"Griffins book Secret Honor is a big dissappointment, I would suggest he has become a troll of commercialism. No plot, no suspence, no excitement, no story line. This book reads like a soap opera, a high school student could have written a better story. It seems Griffin is relying on his name to sell this book, also his other novels in this series are somewhat dull and redundent in character. I hope he wakes up, I will not purchase or recommend any more of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope he gets better soon","review":"I have been reading W.E.B. Griffin's books from the beginning. The latest, \\"Secret Honor\\" is by far, the worst he has ever written. The last two books have been very difficult to read. I normally get his books one day and will have them read withing two or three days. No so with this book. It took my three months of forcing myself to sit down and read it. The story want dumb, it just didn't seem to go anywhere. I like Clete and think more should be done to develop his charter. The ending was a non event. I found nothing thrilling about Secret Honor at all. I rate it 1 star and that is being too kind but there isn't a 1/4 star I can use for it. Come on Mr. Griffin, let's have some more excitement , the police series is good as is the Marine series. Has all you money softened you up? Do you just want to retire and live on an island?"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no one like Carl Barks!","review":"This book is one of the finest Barks' comic books ever made. The story brings you to the Klondike and the beginning of Uncle Scrooge's career and also introduces his one and only girl friend. The whole story builds around Scrooge's thrift and the lure for more riches and has a surprising ending! It is definetly a must for all people who like humor, a good story and great images."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carl Barks at his best","review":"\\"Back to the Klondike\\" is one of my favorite Uncle Scrooge stories. If you want to begin reading Uncle Scrooge stories, this is a very good place to start.That Amazon keeps this in stock is something you shouldn't take for granted; I have had a tough time finding these Gladstone volumes anywhere else. If you like, read \\"The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck,\\" by Don Rosa after you check out this album. It will exponentially increase your enjoyment of each book.Barks' storytelling and composition epitomize the notion of beauty in simplicity, a trait you don't find in too many comics today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Too Fast and Rarely Personal","review":"As a huge Paul Tracy and CART fan, I looked forward to reading this book about one of the most controversial drivers on the circuit, hoping to get an up close and personal view of the driver and what makes him tick.I was disappointed. Mr. Ferriss seems to spend most of the time waving the Canadian Flag, sugar coating interviews, and reporting race results that could have been gotten from the newspaper and enthusiast publications. Compared to the driver's actual life, this book doesn't even come close to having anything controversial. In actuality, for the length of the book, there really aren't that many quotes from direct interviews with Paul. It appears to me, that Paul had very little input on this book project. We do learn that Paul wants his privacy.If so, why bother writing about him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Talking Heads C.D.","review":"I will not be collecting any more Talking Heads compact disks.

At least we'll always have \\"Sand in the Vaseline\\", a 33 track, 2-cd set that is more than generous. This gives you the big hits \\"Psycho Killer\\", \\"Burning Down the House\\", and \\"And She Was\\", as well as other favorites \\"(Nothing but) Flowers\\", \\"Wild Wild Life\\", and \\"This Must Be the Place (naive melody)\\". Plus their cover of \\"Take me to the River\\", and the song \\"Memories can't Wait\\", that was covered by \\"Living Colour\\". This possibly could have been narrowed down to a single disc, but for someone who wants that, there's the \\"Once In A Lifetime\\" import. Either of these are a must for the casual fan looking for one collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Estrangement vs. emotions","review":"I borrowed this compilation and I realised they weren't just another wise-cracking \\"experimental\\" new wave band - they had melodies, ideas, even emotions. Their cover of Take Me To The River is absolutely inspiring, and the catchy tunes like Girlfriend Is Better or Once In A Lifetime really get you jumping up and down. At some points, David Byrne's voice gets annoying and the music seems a bit soft-weight, but after one or two such pieces the third is always a masterwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a compilation album, It's pretty good.","review":"Talking Heads are my favorite all-time band and this compilation album captures pretty much all of their classic material as well as some previously unreleased material. However, as with most comp albums, it does come with its share of disappointments. First of all, no tracks from the lost album, The Name of this Band is Talking Heads, are on this collection. That means that Talking Heads fans that don't own the tape or LP of this album will still miss out on the song \\"A Clean Break,\\" which is a great piece. Also, there is just simply not enough live material on this CD altogether, which may not have been the intent of this release, but it's still disappointing. If you only want to own one Talking Heads release ever, this is a good buy. I should also mention that Talking Heads are working on a 4 CD anthology of previously unreleased material that may be a better buy than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff grows on you!","review":"If you're confused at first, don't worry. I (and I am not alone) first heard some interesting cuts on the radio, bought this set, found most of it unbearably annoying and put it away, gave it another chance a few months later, and got addicted. It's wonderful stuff, and this is a good collection of this great band.That said, there are a couple of songs which didn't make it on to the disc which should have, but I guess that's a fan talking. All the major hits are here, and there are only about two I'd remove from the set. Very, very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quieter Talking Heads","review":"What I love about the Talking Heads is their eccentricity. With David Byrne as the fearless leader, the Talking Heads produced countless epic tracks and albums. But nothing quite measures up to a live performance, and I think that comes into play on Sand in the Vaseline. The album has a quieter sound, sometimes even to the point of sounding subdued. While it does contain some of the greatest hits, these are not the greatest versions of those hits. And while I still love the Talking Heads, I would recommend almost any other album by them over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent collection, could use a few remixes though","review":"The collection is good nonetheless, spans a number of good tunes and time. However, this band was popular during the remix phase of dance music...and I've heard some of the remixes (especially 'burning down the house') and have to say that they do deserve a spot on this 2 disc collection. Other than that it is well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Art","review":"The art is terrible. All the characters are ugly; one wonders are these the gods?

The reunion special is indeed included on Disc 2, despite what one reviewer says. And, the icing on the cake is that the episode \\"The College Man\\" retains the use of the Van McCoy song \\"The Hustle.\\" Some other publishing companies who are notorious for music replacements (a la Paramount and Fox) can learn a lesson from Sony, who does not seem to mind forking over a little extra cash to turn out the kind of quality product that fans of TV shows on DVD REALLY want.

Bonnie Franklin is dynamite as the courageous, independent, divorced mom of two and many of the story lines are just as relevant now as they were in the 70s.

The day I stop moving to this disc is the day I need to be taken out back and buried, because I'll already be dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"industrial at its best","review":"i bought this quite a while back i think it was in 1992 together with the earlier released \\"the mind is a terrible thing to taste\\". i still remember when i first listened to \\"the mind...\\" i was blown away. i listened to it for a week without even touching \\"psalm 69\\". when i first tossed it into my stereo i thought it just couldnt match \\"the mind...\\". hell was i suprised. after the brilliant opener \\"n.w.o\\" the album even accelerated with the brilliant \\"just one fix\\" and it didn't slow down till the title track. from there the album changed the direction a bit into a less agressive (which doesnt mean that it wasnt agressive anymore it still kicked) more industrial influenced style. overall the first half is VERY good (even better then \\"the mind...\\") but the second half slows it all a bit down. i think it is good this way because full speed 70 mins album would be kinda annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh my god","review":"this album is so damn good. when i first got it, i sat at work thinking about it all day. then i ran home, listened to it, and layed on my couch drooling with musical joy. i can't believe how good al j. is at writing music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of this world!","review":"This was the first album I 'd heard of Ministry and industrial rock But it took me apart Great stuff the whole album especially JUST ONE FIX!! which happens to be my ANTHEM!!

I personally rank this behind \\"Land of Rape and Honey\\" and before \\"Mind...\\" in terms of favorites. If you have heard anything from Ministry's last 2 CD's, I can pretty much guarantee that you'll love this CD.Starting with NWO, the music is hard and heavy and never lets up. Even the last two songs, which traditionally for Ministry were a bit on the experimental side, are pretty dark and foreboding. If you like Nine Inch Nails but wish ole Trent was a bit heavier with the music you probably would like this. It's like taking heavy metal music and adding various samples from movies and television and mixing it in a blender. Only you're listening to it while the blender is on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mnistry album","review":"When this record came out it established a new sound, the heaviest thing ever heard at the time!

You do not get bored because it is relatively short and it alternates between sets of ab work and sets of chest work.

As a follow-up to \\"The Real Thing,\\" it was a commercial disappointment (I don't know why), but an artistic milestone. It's one of those albums you listen to and then try to get everyone you know to do the same. Never will you hear so many musical styles coexisting and enhancing each other. Take the opener \\"Land of Sunshine:\\" you have a slamming funk track interspersed with Mike Patton's operatic bellowing - and it works! Each song has some pleasant little surprise just waiting for you (and often many surprises). \\"RV\\" is certainly the best song ever written about trailer trash (\\"...getting stupider.\\") \\"Midlife Crisis\\" and \\"A Small Victory\\" should have been major hits in a perfect world, and \\"Everything's Ruined\\" is simply mindblowing in its inventiveness. Every track is aurally fascinating and make for one of the most adventurous listens in music history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Matters","review":"Wow, I love this CD.

Faith No More, thank you for ANGEL DUST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you own only one album, this should be it.","review":"I bought this album sometime over the summer. Nobody recomended this to me, I'd never heard any of their stuff, and I wasn't familiar with the band at all (unless you consider their poster hanging in the background in Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey.) I simply bought this album because I'd seen it on that movie. The first listen proved well and then as I began to listen to it more, it grew on me. I swear it keeps getting better every time. All of the songs are unmatched and there are no fillers. Faith No More proves that they can do their own thing and it sounds great. This album doesn't get redundant due to the variety of each song. As for the band... the drummer is great. Just listen to his pace and how he keeps up with each song. The keyboard sets the atmosphere, the guitar is medicore, however it does sound very good, and the bass will groove you. The thing that should really grab you is the vocals.If you enjoy FNM, check out Fantomas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike Patton's Faith No More masterpiece","review":"this was one of the first albums i ever owned. i've always been poor so i've never been able to buy everything i ever wanted. hey thank god for the internet. wink, wink. anyway this is faith no more's best album right here. and what a wild album it is. it's heavy, loud, mad and wonderful.

I'm a sucker for an organ and singers forgetting where reality is.Each song is glorious."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top 10 favorite albums of all time.","review":"I bought this album when it came out in 1992.

A friend of mine to this day still talk about how excellent this ablum is.Every song is great. Stand-outs: LAND OF SUNSHINE, CAFFIENE, MIDLIFE CRISIS, RV, MALPRACTICE, A SMALL VICTORY and JIZZLOPPER.I wish they hadn't broken up. I wish I could've seen them in 1995 and 1997. At least I saw them supporting this album! They will be missed, since I hear they broke up soon after THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Epitome of Odd","review":"A minor masterpiece of schitzophrenic rock. Mike Patton's excursions in Mr. Bungle set the stage for this album, Faith No More's bravest and most experimental. It starts out sounding mostly in the traditional hard rock/FNM vein, but quickly moves on from there to far more dangerously experimental waters. From hilarous excursions and vocal madhouses like RV, Kindergarten, and Be Aggressive, to pseudo-progressive rock songs like Jizzlobber, this is the Faith No More album to own. Few major-label releases are this wild and brave, and not many are as satisfying. Look to pick this up if traditional-sound rock music is simply not your cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"When you think of FNM most people think of their smash hit \\"Epic\\" and if thats the only song you've heard from them you might be a little confused how the style changed from 80s into a more experimental sound. Angel Dust is a fun, dark, and wacky ride of good Rock music. I think Mike Patton showed how creative FNM can be and he surely proved it with Angel Dust. This is a must for anyone who enjoys experimental rock music. Buy this you wont regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their last masterpiece","review":"This album is one of my all time faves. How good is this thing? Fnm couldn't even top it or come close to it again. This record is definately not for the narrow minded listener. This is for the people who like a good challenge and like to have their ears stretched a little bit. Believe me, if you're patient with this record you won't be able to put it down. It's almost as addictive as angel dust but with twice the kick."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best FNM album!","review":"This is the most amazing Faith No More album. Mike Patton shows the power of his voice by rapping, screaming, and singing in many different styles. Not only are the vocals anything less then extrodinary, the guitar riffs and bass lines are amazing. And the drummer, Mike Bordin is very good as well. He's drummed with the likes of Korn, and the legandary Ozzy. One of my favorite aspects in the band, is definately the idea of having a keyboard in a heavy metal/hard rock band (it's kind of hard to label them a single type of music.) If you truly want to experience a great album, buy Angel Dust. It is a breathtaking, landmark album."},{"rating":"2","title":"What else could be said: GENIUS","review":"What can one say after reading the praising, but true reviews prior to mine. But I had to give my opinion. Angel Duast is perhaps the best modern piece of music, of all! I am very much into classical music, but FNM have managed to satisfy my need for melody. Just listen to Patton's voice in Smaller And Smaller (where do they find those harmonies and melodies); it is so epic and full of meaning and feeling... The guitar rifs on Caffeine... Every song is perfect...The album ranges in musical styles, but somehow it all works. Just compare RV to Jizzlobber. I think that every FNM album since 1989 is exceptional, but this is simply a musical classic... BUY THIS RECORD, IT DESERVES EVERY SUCCESS IT CAN GET..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start to finish... a perfectly constructed moody, funky disc","review":"If anyone thinks they listen to real ground breaking cutting edge music ( without it being to avant guarde, artsy fartsy or too abstract ) BUY this album I gaurantee it is amazing, it is everything at once, jammed pack full of atmosphere mood and power , yet somehow is the catchiest thing you'll ever hear....what amazes me...this album came out 6 years ago...talk about ahead of its time...a true masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top cd's of all time...","review":"This is one of the all time best cd's from any group, ever!!!

It's expensive, and it's awesome.

Blah, blah, blah. It's undeniably their best CD. It's a great disc when every single song is memorable and fun, along with excellent musicianship and Patton's voice. I never get tired of this cd. From thrash to funk rock to gospel sounding vox, this cd is amazing! Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the more under-appreciated discs of aggresive music","review":"4 1/2You'd be hard pressed to find any band making art-pop-metal this interesting this early in the 90's, and onward for that matter. Unfortunately after the deceptive popularity of their previous radio smash \\"Epic\\", interest in the criminally underrated quintet declined as quality rose. This remains a near-flawless, visionary work; the kind of album that took a little getting used to, transitioning from TRT's friendlier pace, but never ceased to offer gifts which kept giving once initial objectivity was sought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful, Pretentious, Self Indulgent, Drug Addled Crap","review":"This will disappoint anyone expecting a band that sounds like Faith No More on Epic. Basically, the guitar player wants to be in Metallica, the singer wants to be in the Commodores, and often tracks sound like two different songs are being played simultaneously. This is one of those \\"look at us were better than heavy metal\\" albums that arty people like Deep Purple did with a philharmonic in the 70's. Such bands could get away with it after a string of hit albums, here Faith tries to do it after one hit album and the fans abandoned them. Mid-Life crisis is a great song, at least sounds like Epic, but everything else is awful. \\"Aggressive\\" has cheerleaders singing in a bad attempt to manufacturer a jock anthem, \\"RV\\" is a boring ballad, \\"Kindergarden\\" and the rest have one chord grungs riff out of place with the songs. Spend your money on the numerous Greaest Hits this band has to get \\"Midlife\\" and avoild this gawd awful mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"i finally bought this after hearing so many good things about this album. but now that i have it, i dont think its really as good as everyone says. the songs arent funny, the music is boring. the only good song is midlife crisis, and that is still medeocre at best. i dont understand why people like this album. to tell you the truth, i think mike patton sounds terrible on this album. he sounds much better in mr. bungle, and that band is just so much better anyway. the only good thing patton has done is mr. bungle. anything else by mike is not really worth listening too. i dont consider him a musical genius like many others do. there is so much more out there that is so much better than this. i find this album a waste of money. it got two stars for midlife crisis.I have now said my two cents, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't aged well","review":"FNM were never innovative; everything they did the Chili Peppers already did years earlier. Want proof? Then listen to \\"Uplift Mofo Party Plan\\" and \\"Freaky Styley\\" and Angel Dust won't sound too original anymore. All FNM did, was turning up the amps. Just like all the Nu-Metal bands who claim to be influenced by these pseudo-art rockers. The only saving grace for this album could be strong songwriting but there are hardly any worthwile tunes among them being \\"Everything's Ruined\\", \\"A Small Victory\\" and the faux-prog of \\"Jizzlobber\\". There's even a trashy country-rock song to further bolster the band's make-believe eclecticism and creativity to camouflage there lack of musicianship and originality (take for one Jim Martin's thickheaded \\"No more than 4 chords!\\" punk-attitude or Mike Patton's tiresomely transgressive Anthony Kiedis/Yamatsuke Eye-imitations) because the rest is 08/15 hard rock, highly derivative of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review #71","review":"I've browsed the other 70 reviews and have been overwhelemd by the stars. I have to tell you, however, that Angel Dust is the worst album ever created. My first college roommate played it every day (along with Empire from Queensryche) and it never grew on me. This is an educated review. Why? - I've heard this stinking album over and over and I hate it. I'm glad FNM is dead and buried."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As Mike Patton Gets","review":"Considering some of the truly amazing work that Mike Patton has done (The Real Thing as well as his Mr Bungle work) it's a pretty amazing feat that this is the one work that tops them all. I enjoy Mr Bungle's first CD a little more, but this one is probably better in that it effortlessly combines rap, hardcore, Native Indian chants and pop without sacrificing Mr. Patton's peerless vocals. In fact, this is probably the work that best shows off his silky smooth vocals, particularly on Land Of Sunshine, A Small Victory, Midlife Crisis and Kindergarten. He also shows a harsher side on Malpractice, Caffeine and Jizzlobber. No matter how his vocals are used, he drives tons of soul into each of these finely crafted tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of its time","review":"The most striking trait of Faith No More's Angel Dust is how everyone else is just now catching up. Both the music and the lyrical subject matter are far ahead of its time. \\"Land of Sunshine\\" explores themes recently taken on by Radiohead's OK Computer album and the book and film Fight Club. As for Jim Martin's guitar being \\"too low\\", as pointed out in an earlier review, just listen to Korn, Limp Biskit, Slipknot, and all the other current metal bands using 7 string guitars to attain that low sound. Much like Godflesh and Prong, Angel Dust has yet to receive the credit it deserves for breaking new, interesting ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angel Dust - MFSL remastered","review":"I just bought this MFSL-remastered edition of Angel Dust, Gold CD, ultradisc II. Compared to the \\"normal\\" release it seems that dynamics are worse, it sounds very compressed. I really don't understand what are they trying to do with that ... I don't like the remaster.

Quite possibly the biggest influence on rock music since Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Faith No More effortlessly mix a myriad of music styles and serve up the insanely eclectic ANGEL DUST. From rap to rock, funk to death metal, country to electronica, every song on the album is worlds different from the next. There is no continuity, no structure...

Love all her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Shepherd Moons\\": a rest stop for a voyager...","review":"\\"Shepherd Moons\\" (the title track) was named after the moonlets that the Voyager probes spotted in Saturn's rings. The album begins with a fitting kind of naturalistic wonder, and then takes turns in unexpected, often melancholy, but equally naturalistic directions. (It has been said, truthfully, that naturalism and paganism are simply two sides of the same coin. This album certainly proves the point.)If one plays Enya's CD's in order of release from front to back, one gets the impression of following in the steps of the artist's own journey through life. The last artist whose work gave me such a strong impression in that sense was John Denver. If John wore his heart on his sleeve, Enya wears hers on a chain around her neck. I don't play this album very often -- there are others by Enya which I believe are better, and certainly less melancholic, than this one -- but it bears the seeds of greater things to come, and for that I appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This music is so beautiful!","review":"I love the way this music is so soothing and calm, and at the same time it is lively and good spirited.

However, it fails to have any real value so far as inspiring or contributing to the New Age musical genre. It's just more swelling synth tones and \\"ooh-aah\\" kinda vocals. No talent and it gives new age a bad name !"},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the Same Great Stuff","review":"Ok, first off, Enya rocks. If you don't know that already, go buy her compilation album, Paint the Sky with Stars. It will enlighten you. If you already know how good she is and you aren't desperate to buy everything she's ever done, there is something wrong with you.All right, so maybe Enya isn't for everyone. But you will likely appreciate her if you have ever been truly moved by a dreamy piece of music. She is soft, soulfull, and dynamic. And yeah, so her music all sounds the same, but when it's so good, how can you complain?Highlights from Sheperd Moons include \\"Carribean Blue\\" (my absolute favorite song ever!), \\"Evacuee\\", \\"Lothlórien\\", and \\"After Ventus\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"whimsically lost in the fog","review":"I like this Enya album because she sings many of the songs in Gaelic and you are left with the pure, simple aural intensity of the sounds.

What else can I say but wow?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music from Above","review":"When I first heard her first single \\"Orinocho Flow\\", I wasn't crazy about the song, and am still not. But over a decade later I borrowed several Enya CD's from a friend and was blown away. The most emotional and beautiful track on this CD is \\"Evacuee\\".Though not every track is equal to the next, many of her songs are incredible, on this CD and her others...they touch your soul like no other songs can. If Heaven has music, then this would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice follow-up!","review":"This is a good follow-up to Enya's 1988 hit album \\"Watermark\\". While \\"Shepherd Moons\\" sound isn't as haunting or as captivating as it's predecessor, it is still a good album that provides a rewarding listening experience. The best songs are the title track, \\"Caribbean Blue\\", \\"How Can I Keep From Singing\\", \\"Ebudae\\" and \\"Afer Ventus\\". If you're just discovering Enya, it is recommended that you start with \\"Watermark\\" or the \\"Celts\\" first, then buy this one afterwards, as this is a slightly more acquired taste. This album is a good purchase and would make a good addition to any music collection, also great when you want to daydream, relax or forget about the outside world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy on the Ears","review":"This music is energizing and soothing at the same time. A lot of it is in old Celtic but still sounds great even if you don't know what the words mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Mouths of Shepherds.","review":"\\"Shepherd Moons\\" is GREAT! It is tranquil, solemn, and peaceful. I love the musical tones and colors she uses on this album, creating a masterpiece of songs. If I compare this CD to an artistic era, I would compare this CD to Picasso's combination of his Blue and Red periods. It is enigmatic, calm, pious, and nurturing. I enjoy the songs of \\"Shepherd Moons\\", \\"Caribbean Blue\\", \\"Ebudae\\", \\"Book of Days\\"(which is used in the movie \\"Far and Away), \\"Evacuee\\", \\"Marble Halls\\", \\"Afer Ventus\\". I also enjoy the song \\"Smaointe\\" as well. It stirs a feeling of sadness, but it's a sadness that enables my heart to feel peace within the storm of sadness (this is an abstract interpretation). I enjoy the Uillilean bagpipes the song includes. They give the song a Celtic pride. I could listen to this CD (and the rest of her other CDs) over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shepherd Moons Enya","review":"I ordered online via Amazon.com and used One Click for easy & fast check out. CD received within five working days. Quick and easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for sleeping, but that's about it...","review":"if you are looking for an album to lull you to sleep (which isn't always a bad thing), then you'll probably dig this. However, it fails to have any real value so far as inspiring or contributing to the New Age musical genre. It's just more swelling synth tones and \\"ooh-aah\\" kinda vocals. Don't get me wrong, Enya has talent; but I really recommend you go with Clannad or Loreena McKennit instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well.....","review":"To be brutally honest I enjoyed The Celts and Watermark a lot more. They had songs that spoke to me more deeply. But SM is still Enya all over and I love listening to it. Ebudae, How Can I Keep From Singing, and Book of Days are particularly moving(although I have trouble trying not to associate Book of Days with that horrible movie \\"Far and Away\\"!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good","review":"I love this album! Of the three Enya albums I own this is easily my favorite. It is relaxing and is pleasing to listen to while one passes the time or as background music for some other activity. I personally like to listen to this album while I pracice yoga. It is an overall calming album without becoming boring and montonous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiant all the way through.","review":"I have had this C.D. for some time and still find it immensely enjoyable. I do however find it rather amusing that some listeners rush to call the over-all album \\"pagan hymns\\", as did the \\"music fan from Los Angeles\\". He/she musn't have been referring to \\"How Can I Keep From Singing\\"! Granted, this album is by no means a Christian album and therefore appeals to a wider range of individuals. The Celts have deep Christian roots and for those wishing to explore this further musically, I suggest Maire Brennen's \\"Perfect Time\\" or Iona's \\"Journey Into The Morn\\". Both of these recordings are available through Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shepherd.","review":"I'm sure there are some who say all Enya albums sound the same, but I believe this is truly one of her best. I hesitate to say it's better than \\"Watermark\\", but I'll call it my second favorite. This is a wonderful mix of songs. Some like \\"Caribbean Blue\\" and \\"Book Of Days\\" border on smooth pop, while others like \\"Lothlorien\\" and \\"Afer Ventus\\" are lush and hypnotic. Her arrangments of vocals and piano/synth practically lull you into a dream-state. This is obviously in every massage parlor in the country. \\"Angeles\\" is another track I love, and like the rest of the album, it really sounds angelic. However, I think the song I enjoy most, is the simple yet moving \\"No Holly For Miss Quinn\\". New fans might just want her \\"Best Of\\", but they'll indeed be missing some excellent songs from \\"Shepherd Moon\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Look at the Modern \\"Pyramid\\"","review":"When I first saw this book, I knew that it had to be on my Christmas \\"wish list.\\" Upon receiving it, my excitement knew no bounds for this is an exquisitely produced homage to the skyscrapers of the past, present, and future.

I found that it added little to the author's other published tomes and to his articles in journals like HBR. Although the basic concept is sound, the implementation challenges are dealt with as you'd expect from an ivory tower-based profesoor and are several steps removed from the challenges that most of my real-world, and smaller company clients, need to address.

It is virtually incomprehensible to staff, encourages the worst kind of navel gazing, and moves government away from its core mission of protecting and promoting public health and safety to hundreds of possible sub-measures of dubious value. Thousands of staff hours, at the public's expense, were expended trying to make sense of an approach that even the paid consultants couldn't explain in terms the average legislator could understand.This is REALLY BAD STUFF."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise and simple","review":"This book takes a very broad and complicated subject and boils it down to the very basics.

The crisp writing and nuanced characters stand in stark contrast to the silly, gadget-ridden flicks that feature 007 as a one-dimensional quasi-superhero (that is, until the excellent Casino Royale, with Daniel Craig as a very human Bond). After perusing Gardner and Benson--and quickly discarding them--I stumbled upom Colonel Sun. This is, so far, the one true continuation of the Fleming Bond (certainly not the recent Devil May Care). While staying true to the literary Bond, Amis deploys his own style, which is somewhat more embellished than Fleming's (this is not a criticism of Fleming in the least, just a comment on their respective styles). The result is an excellent, well-paced read that foregrounds the Bond I have come to love: Fleming's wonderful, dark, very human creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bondworthy.","review":"I heartily agree with other reviewers about the other writers. Gardner's attempts at Bond stories are uninspired at best, boring at worst. Benson's are downright pathetic -- unbelievably bad. But Amis' effort was, if not perfect, worthy of the standard Fleming set."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids were mesmerized!","review":"Hap Palmer's videos and songs are of the highest quality.

The controls for adjusting the time and the alarm are awkwardly placed on the back, and seem to be poorly connected, as I often have to press the same button two or three times to get a response.Otherwise, the reception of my local station is fine.

It's content, the pictures, everything is a true dedication to the work of Jonathan Larson.The book begins as a biography to the creator of Rent, Jonathan Larson and his original vision of the play and of life itself. Reading his story was quite inspirational. If only he were alive to see his success and how he has touched many people's lives.The remainder of the book is the whole libretto for Rent complete with pictures from a stage performance. The presentation of the libretto and pictures is wonderful. Honestly, I was in complete awe the first time I saw it.There are also in-depth interviews with the cast and people behind the scenes, and some rare photos.This book is the Rent fan's necessity.

It also includes the entire liberetto and pictures of the original Broadway cast performing. You feel like you were involved in the production of the play as you are reading it.

Jonathan Larson is a creative genius who lives by one rule, live each day to the fullest....No day but today!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is so awsome","review":"This is not just the story of RENT and its creation, but the story of it's creator as well. Jonathan Larson's story is just as moving as RENT is, and this book gives an awesome insight into the life of this amazing composer who was taken far too early. This coupled with interviews from more people than I can count makes this a highly enjoyable read. The book also includes a whole bunch of pictures one would not see anywhere else, and the libretto, so the entire experience is bundled up in this one big black book with fake duct-tape binding. It was such an enjoyable read and made me cry just as much as the show itself.

When i first took it out of the package, it a had a huge gash on the inside of the &quot;vinyl&quot; cover. Then, after a few days, the top drawstring material had turned the base of the plug for the headphones that comes with the iPod black. IT TURNED IT BLACK!! the cloth had rubbed off black dye onto the plug! And then, after a week or two, the &quot;vinyl&quot; (your lucky if its low-quality plastic) began sticking to the front of the ipod, leaving ugly little air bubbles. Also, if you keep it in your pocket, lint gets in easily and sticks to the plastic. And not to mention insertion! It took a few minutes to get it in, and after 5 minutes, the iPod was crooked! i had to take it out and put it back in to fix it. The reasons I gave it 1 star was because it DOES protect the iPod's steel backing from being scratched and 0 stars wasnt an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this item!","review":"I bought mine the day after I bought my iPod because a friend had told me the shiny little guys scratch easily. All seemed good; I liked the neoprene non-slip surface for working out. Operating the controls seemed clumsy at first but I got used to it. It was worth the hassle to be \\"protecting\\" my investment. Today I noticed that a hair had slipped inside the plastic cover, so I took the iPod out for the first time in 4 months to clean it. I found that the screen is completely scratched with fine wear marks from the plastic rubbing against it. (I had noticed the screen getting harder to read, but figured the plastic had gotten dirty.) The back of the unit is also completely scratched. I may as well have been throwing it in my backpack unprotected!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's got to be a better case!","review":"This case does not protect from scratches!

Like most cases, it colected a lot of dust, but that is the least of my worries. also, the ipod is impossible to get out of the case without (A) scratching the Ipod and (B) permanately bending the case so it doesnt fit right. Keep looking for that special case, its out there somewhere. I hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Provided Carrier, Like a WetSuit!","review":"This case is great. I use my iPod in the car and at work, and I like to be able to rotate through songs quickly and easily. The case that comes with the iPod is hard and opaque, so you can't push the buttons or turn the wheel.This case has one transparent plastic side and a cute belt clip mounted on neoprene (think wetsuit material) on the other. The drawstring at the top seals the case, protecting it from most damage.This case has served me well for the better part of a year, and has kept food and drink out of the buttons! The only concern I have is that sometimes moisture gathers between the face of the iPod and the clear plastic. If I take the iPod out and use a cloth to soak up the water, it is good for another few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate it!","review":"I was excited to find this case at Target (none of the other stores seemed to have ANYTHING), and I kinda liked it at first, but it's really more trouble than it's worth.<br />1.

The songs are lilting, almost nostalgic, sometimes with a haunting undercurrent, that do have that title feeling of returning back to some comfortable place in the distant past. Nice album. For my own tastes a bit too low key for the most part (a couple of more upbeat numbers are in there), but, none the less, very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"This is some top-notch jazz. First of all, there is wonderful interplay between these three very creative instrumentalists. Secondly, the recording is very clean and natural. Turn it up to the appropriate volume level and it sounds like they're in the room! The only drawback is the vocal on Homebody. After all of the top-notch instrumental musicianship, the singing is a little mediocre. Nothing against vocals in general. As an instrumentalist myself, I have grown to respect greatly the art of singing well. It's not easy. That's why I usually leave it to the vocalists. But, this is Bill Mays singing. He's not terrible, but his piano playing is way better.

It is very useful to have a little bit of background of naive set theory (although the book does go through a terse introduction to this). It is a great introduction to independence proofs and forcing. I highly recommend it.Judging by some of the other reviews, it look like there may have been a printing that omitted some of the mathematical symbols. I ordered mine from Amazon several months ago, and it was fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"The symbols ARE missing","review":"Perhaps there were different printing runs, but as the first reviewer experienced, my copy lacked the symbols for membership, subset, quantifiers, etc. It really does make the book useless.

The controls are as slippery as games like Pagemaster and Decap Attack on the Sega Genesis. This Alex Kidd guy is weak as hell, the slightest touch sends him to heaven, literally. The stages become a maze after like the 7th stage, and the Rocky Mountain stage is one of the most grueling things you can accomplish in your life because of the awful controls. The theme of this game is also dumb, like why the hell would someone want to play a game where they play rock, paper scissors all day. The only way that this game can be beat is by trial and error, you would have to be extremely lucky to beat it without dying. The music is awesome in this game I would admit, but in a overall sense, this game isn't worth digging up to reexplore.

But I was very disappointed in this one. The best description I can come up with is \\"confusing and boring\\". The characters are uninteresting and the plot uninvolving. Her attempts at humor (usually very adept) fall flat and the whole thing feels incredibly silly. I had to skip long dull sections just to make it 3/4 of the way through the novel before giving up. I hope this isn't a taste of Jones books to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent for a Sequel","review":"I liked it, but Deep Secret was better. The planet hopping and time changes made it hard to keep track of some details. Also, the ending didn't really give much closure, and was more rushed than hers usually are. I liked the flower system though, and the new characters are right up to her usual standards. It is probably like many of her other books and will get better upon rereading as details are picked up that previously weren't noticed. If you're a fan definetly worth reading.

When I read The Merlin Conspiracy, I was expecting a lot more than I got. The book, to me, was extremely boring and monotonous. It was very hard to finish, and I had to skip many pages at a time in order to complete it. In my opinion, this book was not an example of an exeptional science-fiction/fantasy book. The Merlin Conspiracy is not a book that I would reccomend to sci-fi/fantasy fans who are expecting a lot from reading this. I would, although, reccomend the Merlin books by T.A. Barron and the Deltora books by Emily Rodda. The Merlin Conspiracy by Diana Wynne Jones gets a simple two stars from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"you don't want to miss this","review":"This is Diana Wynne Jone's lastest book....The book is fast moving with funny characters, especially Mini the elephant.

Overall you don't want to miss this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Merlin Conspiracy....sounds like a cool book, right?","review":"To start out with, it's not nearly as good of a book as it sounds like. I got the book thinking that it would be awesome, but, once again, I was wrong. The book is very hard to follow, switching through two different, yet very much alike, stories with little explanation of why until very late in the book. The story starts out kind of boring, then builds up, and just when it seems like it's going to get really cool, it drops back to boring. To put it bluntly, this book is nothing great."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO CHARGE in this!!!!","review":"Theorigial fixed cahger lasted me over 10 years and the screwdriver is great.

I was familiar with most yoga postures, but here Gary Kraftsow has elaborated a highly effective compendium of the best yoga postures - and certainly the safest. Do not let the apparent simplicity of the practises mislead you: this is someone who has done some very extensive research and the practices are amazingly easy to perform yet powerful! I really do think it is wise to follow Gary's recommendation of doing the first practice for some weeks before moving on to the other two. Everything is presented in a simple, relaxing way.

This mornig I woke up in pain about a 6 walked in the living room hunched over and put on the DVD. Gary has a very gentle and thoughtful approach to the yoga series he puts you through. I held the poses a little longer, the bottom line is when the roughly 30 minutes was over the pain went from a 6 or 7 to about a 2. No drugs no need for chriropractic care or massages just a simple series of exercises by a very bright and passionate guy.

I felt immediate results and the instructor takes the time to show the techniques and give info on why people are in pain. The DVD also gives you the options to vary the intensity of your workout. It's also very relaxing and I feel so much better. It will save you alot of money if you've been seeing doctors or going to classes to don't give you focus you need for these problem areas.

Instead, this DVD was more of a lecture about the style of yoga. Since I already know about the style through some wonderful experiences, I simply wanted to do a workout rather than be lectured to about a workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful before buying this DVD.","review":"As a middle aged woman just starting to do yoga, this DVD was too difficult. There are no modifications of the postures for someone who is just beginning and may not be as flexible as the people who are demonstrating. Once the work-out gets going, the positions are repeated too quickly and then it goes right into the next one at a fairly rushed pace. Having to stop/start the DVD was distracting. Yoga is supposed to be partially spiritual in nature and I just found this to be more frustrating than helpful. It was disappointing to spend almost $25 on this DVD to find this out (and to have to pay return shipping for a partial refund.) I would recommend a slower paced yoga DVD if you are new to yoga, are older and/or have painful hips or knees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viniyogatherapy VERY HELPFUL!

I can't say it's in depth, because that's one thing that it isn't: don't expect it in your Black or Green Belt's curriculum. But if you stick to the title, it will reward its readers (mostly managers, I'd hope). It deals in very clear and easy-to-follow words (even for those of you that have been out of school for many, many years) with what is Six Sigma, what it entails (in terms of cost, benefits, cultural mindset change), how to implement and sustain, etc. It even devotes an entire section to an overview of the statistical tools required to get your arms around Six Sigma for the first time.Again, I'd not use it as a reference for in depth matters, but as a primer on the topic, I think it does an excellent job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good tools, but heavy on dogma","review":"While this book has a number of useful tools that can be adapted and/or replicated, it lacks objectivity and a degree of critical thought that lead me to question the author's credibility. If you can sort out the objective material from the \\"brochureware\\" hype, then the book is a passable read. Phrases like \\"Six Sigma statistical tools work like magic to uncover what you don't know\\" are commonplace. Unfortunately, very few of the potential short-comings and limitations of Six Sigma are addressed. And since they are barely discussed, there is no presentation of remedies or caveats for said defects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money or Time","review":"I bought this book thinking it might be useful to hand to some of the manager's in my company who need to gain a better understanding of Six Sigma. While there are some good points to the book, there are many serious errors in the book. These errors will give the reader bad information and possibly hinder their ability to effectively support Six Sigma project teams. Two examples where the book provides inaccurate or misleading information are in descriptions of process capability and DOE. In summary, this book is a poor introduction to Six Sigma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unused vs. \\"New\\"","review":"Although the book appeared to be unused, it was obviously not \\"new\\" as advertised given its yellowed pages and a musty smell as if it had been kept in a damp storage area for several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"the first six sigma book I provide to my clients","review":"This is a perfect entry level book for mid/top managers willing to know the basic about Six Sigma.

Six Sigma does have, at it's core, some statistics - it would be useful for anyone trying to learn the approach to understand a few of the basic statistical concepts. There are mistakes in the few numerical examples that are offered, probably creating more confusion than insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not credible","review":"Thought I would get a good overview of the topic, to understand what it is, so I can decide when to dive in deeper.But after reading the first two chapters the author has lost total credibility, and I won't waste my time on the rest of the book. It talks all about the wonderful savings Six Sigma will give you, and totally ommits that there is cost involved in doing it. If done well, yes there's positive bottom-line impact, but especially as a manager I want to know what the ROI is, and not just get glory words on the upside, but also a realistic view of the downside.What killed it for me was the side bar that assumed that if a employee costs $50K, and her activities produce $100K in revenue that the ROI of having this employee is 100%!! If the activities would have produced $100K in net profit, then this would be more accurate.

It is still relevant in a number of ways, not only because it is still very funny by modern standards, but primarily because it is a look at life 500 years in the past through the eyes of someone who lived that experience. Read the history of the author, Cervantes: his life was truly amazing! I think the primary reason some people disparage this book nowadays is because they fail to understand the climate in which it was written and the \\"chivalry books\\" that it lampooned.

Although the choice of using current slang may be a controversial one for some readers, it succeeds in giving the story an immediacy and restores the humor that was missing from more genteel translations. The novel is interesting because the two parts, written at different points in the author's life, have distinct styles and narrative structure. Just when the reader begins to fear that the plot will involve an endless string of ill-fated choices on the two protagonists' part, the second half of the novel introduces some devilish supporting characters to stir up trouble.

I've been using it now for over 6 months and love it... It's my go to tool for cutting drywall. It's easy and quick... For me it slides just fine across drywall (no need for rollers like one reviewer suggested) and its lightweight... I truly cut drywall in half the time with this... I've never been good or fast at cutting drywall with a tape measure as my guide (as seen by the pros), so this is a great alternative... The only thing I've found is that the lower you insert your blade down the ruler, make sure you have your knife pointing at a downward angle as you cut across the drywall... Otherwise, if you're not carefull you'll end up lifting the tool off the edge of the drywall (Hope this makes sense, but if not, you'll know what I mean after a cut or two)... Bottom line, if you cut a fair amount of drywall, but its not your living, then use this tool...

The guide rods are cheaply plated and are going to rust real soon, making it hard to slide the guide for depth. The holddowns are secured with wingnut, stamped metal wingnuts, at that. I can't vouch for the usability or accuracy, having not used it at all.I intended to replace an old Craftsman with this. Even rusty, the Craftsman is far superior, forged aluminum, threaded rods and knurled nut holddowns. I bought the Skil 1825 router about a week ago and am so far pleased, considering the price. The span on the old Craftsman wouldn't fit the span of the Skil router. I will redrill the old Craftsman base and change the spread, if possible. Otherwise, go for the Bosch edge guide at $30+.

Despite the title of the book is \\"For Teenagers\\", this book can be appreciated for anyone who wants to master the art of good table manners.Mr. Hoving, the former chairman of the board of Tiffany & Company, will walk you through the proper table manners in a step-by-step approach. He will also address alot of common mistakes and \\"don't\\" in numbers of illustrations; for example, don't leave your spoon in your coffee cup! This book covers different meal courses like the soup course, the fish course, the meat course, the salad course, as well as the dessert course. Overall, I find this book is very interesting and helpful. I highly recommend for people looking for a quick and easy way to learn good table manners.(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 5-Nov-2004)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not All There","review":"I rate this book very low for its lack of information and explanations. And for my expectation of \\"Tiffany's\\" to be a premiere source of information.It seems the book was written as a refresher course with the assumption that some basics were covered perhaps in another text.The illustrations are quite poor and some are not clear, especially on how to hold utensils. There was no mention of the use of glassware.There were a number of typographical errors and archaic phrases such as \\"mashie niblick\\" that left me wishing I had found another resource.Lastly, I would have liked information on how to determine the number of courses or the meal to be served by observing the table setting.Perhaps this was a good resource in it's day, but it needs a lot of updating, in my opinion.I'm only sorry I cannot offer a better book since I thought this would be all we'd need to learn table manners and etiquette...alas"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...

For those of us who were too young to see this powerhouse quartet play live, this album is about as good as it gets.Unlike some live albums, the band sounds great here. The production is great and the playing is tight as can be. It's Led Zeppelin at their very best, without the studio sheen, playing many of their biggest songs: \\"Immigrant Song\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", \\"Going to California\\" (that's merely the first disc) and many others. It's a truly awesome compilation of an incredible live band.\\"How the West was Won\\" captures one of the greatest bands ever at their artistic peak.

I cranked it up.... but somehow it just didn't measure up to what my minds eye recalled. It was a great show, the Fourth album was out and I bet they did just about everything from all four albums. LZ opened with the Immigrant song and I believe they might have closed or encored with Moby Dick or Bring it on home. There was also a nice acoustic set in the middle. The show ranks right up there with a few more I was able to see"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"If you've never heard Led Zeppelin live in their prime, the early 70s, you will be floored by this album!! Taken from two California gigs and fit together to make one three-hour concert, this album sparks, roars, crackles, and sets everything on fire. The times for \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" will scare some people (both well over 20 minutes), but they melt away like wax: filled with solos, a blues medley, and just fiery playing, you will be stunned.It always seemed strange that Led Zeppelin, one of the best rock bands ever, was so under-represented in the live album departments. The previous one was \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", which I'm not very fond of. The puzzle is complete.

The acoustic stuff sounds incredible. Plant is is in good voice hittin' the high notes. There's a real spirit coming thru on these tracks. The drums don't sound like a Jimmy Page production. More like Bob Rock (Def Leppard, Metallica). Maybe what they had to work with as far as recording it put up some sonic limitations. There are some great tracks. Disc one is probably my favorite, as well as the acoustic stuff. I have bootleg stuff that blows the more extended stuff (Dazed & Confused, Whole Lotta Love ect.) away. Still a treat to hear, and great for all fans without the resources for sifting thru all the bootlegs out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this because of great reviews, nothing below 4 stars. I have Mothership and have owned the old albums, but I am comparing \\"How the West was Won\\" to \\"Mothership\\". HWWW has little bass, which was biggest disappointment. The studio cuts rock with clear deep bass while HWWW does not. Second, the long versions become tedious, especially Dazed and Confused. There are long stretches where they are just tapping drum sticks. I can't imagine what the audience was doing. I have never been to a concert where this would have been tolerated in silence. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"The only thing better than a \\"new\\" Zeppelin album is a new, live Zeppelin album. I can't believe how good these tracks sound.

Disc 1 contains many of the band's most famous songs, like Immigrant Song, Black Dog, Over the hills and far away, Stairway to Heaven, and Bron-Yr-Aur-Stomp. They all sound amazing, truly legendary! Disc 2 opens with the 25 minute Dazed and Confused, and ends with the 19 minute Moby Dick. Both these songs are so amazing you hardly notice that 20 minutes has passed when the song is over. Disc 3 begins with Whole Lotta Love, and then goes on with some classic Led Zeppelin. In all, this is a truly great cd from the best rock band ever. I was a bit dissapointed because some songs were missing, like Misty Mountain Hop, In My Time of Dying, Achille's Last Stand, ect. I go on for days naming all the songs that are missing, which is why they aren't on the cd. There is simply not enough room.

Lets not forget the amazing John Paul Jones and the late John Bonham (who totally rocked). I highly suggest that you buy some old blues records to gain more respect for what Led Zeppelin did. Then you will see how and why Led Zeppelin won the west. They owe alot to the great blues artists, who paved the way for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long-Awaited Release","review":"This album is a compliation of two California concerts. This is Led Zeppelin's first live album since \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" soundtrack, excluding BBC Sessions. Zep is not afraid to improvise, and \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" occupy 45 minutes alone. These recordings are very different from the quiet studio recordings; the guitars are at full blast, the drums crash, and even the muted noise of the audience can be heard. There are countless surprises in this album. Among other things, \\"Black Dog\\" begins with the intro from \\"Out On The Tiles,\\" as it usually does when performed live. This album contains many great songs like \\"Black Dog,\\" \\"Stairway To Heaven,\\" and the ever-popular \\"Immigrant Song.\\" Why bother with bootlegs when you can have the high-quality sensation of a concert in your own home? This is a must for any fan. I would recommend this and BBC Sessions if you want awesome live albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kickin' ...","review":"I'll keep it short. FINALLY.

It sounds great and it really showcases just how mighty Led Zeppelin were, in their prime. Just wait until you hear the version of the Immigrant Song on this set. It ROCKS! I wasn't sure about buying the DVD, but after listening to this disc, I'm buying! It puts any of the previous live recordings of them to shame, mainly because it is like a freeze frame of when there was no other band that could touch them (and personally, I don't think any other band has reached these heights since!). If you have always appreciated Zep's music, don't even hesitate. If you are a kid just dicovering them for the first time, I can't really think of a better starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"At long last....","review":"Zep has finally released live material that does their legend justice. As a fan since 73 I was disappointed in the Song Remains the Same soundtrack and wished there were more uninterrupted live concert segments in the film of the same name. There are many excellent Zep bootleg CDs out there but here we have the crystal clear Jimmy Page treatment of sound. The DVD has even more amazing sound- you must have that as the companion to the CD. The only drawback is that after seeing/listening to this music the current [...] state of the music scene is even more apparent. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masters of Rock","review":"Get this album (and the DVD, for that matter). Zeppelin in their prime. The sound is fantastic and the band is tight (as usual).

Because I doubt whether history will bring us in the future another band like Led Zeppelin. \\"How The West Was Won\\" is something every rock fan from around the world should listen to. Believe me, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"For years I heard the hype about live Zep not being fully captured on Song Remains the Same. Much of this hype is repeated in the many reviews here. This band was my first great rock band love, and Jimmy Page is why I play guitar and own a Les Paul. I was so excited to learn of this release and grab the discs. But--wow, the band was weak at these shows. Jimmy is sloppy, random and soul-less, and Bonham and Jones can do no more than pound loudly along under him. I wondered if I had just outgrown the band, so I just listened to No Quater and The Rain Song from Song Remains the Same, all of Presence, and the studio Dancing Days and The Crunge-- No I haven't outgrown Led Zepplin, they were brilliant. This release, though, is just for the those who like it very loud and very simple. I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"im not sure about this one","review":"This is a very mixed up set in terms of quality of version. Some of these it's like, \\"Yeah, this is alright.\\" Some are like, \\"Eh, whatever.\\" And some are like, \\"No, that was bad.\\" Like the acoustic songs, Robert Plant sounds kinda like he's bored! Now maybe its just me, but I don't like it when they drag out Whole Lotta Love. It's one of those songs where it's just fine at the length that it is. The only REALLY good song here is Immigrant Song. If you want to get it, go ahead, but don't really recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the hype","review":"Um, excuse me, but in all this excitment over the \\"long overdue\\" live CD from Led Zeppelin, have we overlooked the outstanding \\"BBC Sessions\\" released in 1997? For my money, the BBC sessions are much tighter and exciting than this overblown three-disc set. Don't get snowed by the hype. \\"How the West Was Won\\" is nothing more than \\"Song Remains the Same Redux,\\" giving us yet another(!) 25-minute version of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and another (!) 20-minute version of \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" which sound pretty much like they did when released last time around. There are a few highlights, though -- \\"Black Dog\\" sounds edgy and mean. The live versions of \\"Dancing Days\\" and \\"The Ocean\\" are as energetic and rollicking as the studio recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Zep CD I always wanted","review":"I don't have a whole lot to say. This is one excellent CD. It's all the live songs I've always wanted but could never get. The song selection is fantastic. Jimmy Page is superb and Robert Plant does a whole lot more singing than on Song Remains the Same. Bohnam is incredible on Moby Dick. Buy the CD. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Audio version","review":"For a LIVE 1972 recording the sound is excellent - 24 bit stereo and surround!!! Essential for hardcore fans.

It is truethat they were a better studio band. But for fourguys to have the kind of live power that they did,is a testiment to how good they were.The 'Whole Lotta Love' medley, does get lost initself, and I thought John Paul Jones' bass could'vebeen punched up a bit. But as a whole, How The WestWas Won is a good set from a great band..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect timing for this live album!","review":"As a member of the third generation to experience Zeppelin, this couldn't have come at a better time. The BBC Sessions came out six years ago, and all LZ fans have been waiting for a compilation that contains the best of the muddied bootlegs we've been listening to for nigh on thirty years. The reviews are all true: this is the band at the top of their game, with all four men at their musical peaks. Standouts include the \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" medley, \\"Rock And Roll\\" and one of the earliest performances of \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\". Buy the DVD, for that and this album eclipses \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" and finally puts to rest the notion that Zeppelin was a mediocre live act.

Instead of all the mix-matching in pursuit of some sterile \\"perfection\\" that is the very antithesis of what Zep was all about?Sure, HTWWW is phenomenal, far better than TSRTS(tho No Quarter is sorely missed) or anyone else's live album. One can only imagine the reactions from the fans who were hearing the HOTH material for the very first time.But I sure feel bad for the people who will never hear the between songs banter, including a lecturing of a security guard; or the Louie, Louie/Everyday People/Thank You medley, for starters. Just a travesty that medley was left off.But, yes, this is well worth buying just for the blazing performances of Over The Hills, Ocean, RnR, Black Dog, & Dancing Days, which are all far superior to the studio versions.The bootleg is called Burn Like A Candle. Well worth looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"...Speechless.....","review":"OK, I'll try to keep this short.

Not so with How the West Was Won. With these tunes, put together by Jimmy Page from some 1972 concerts, you hear the songs in new ways. The guitar riffs, drumming, and Plant's singing add a new texture and dimension. I never thought I'd want to hear \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" -- that overplayed song that every high school band drove into the ground -- again. Check out the version on this collection. You'll love it all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Zep CD","review":"2003 is, in my opinion, quite a year for live albums- Sammy Hagar, The Who, Kiss, and new live albums from Tom Petty and Bob Seger coming out later this year- and this live set from Led Zeppelin is no exception. I have heard many of these on my local classic rock station, but not this good. As far as my ears can tell Zep were a better live band than a studio band. Every instrument is given a workout- Plant improvising on Sice I've Been Loving You, Page's countless guitar solos, John Paul Jones' bass solos, and Bonham's 18 minute drum solo on Moby Dick. If you love rock or music go to the store and buy this NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PINNACLE OF LIVE RECORDINGS","review":"I cannot believe I am the first person to express my opinion on this absolutely amazing live recording. To start with anything you may have read about this piece of music is absolutely true. I have never been privileged to hear what I consider to be the most astounding \\"live\\" recording ever issued. I never saw Led Zeppelin perform live in their heyday but after absorbing this effort I am able to feel the impact they must have thrust upon the listener. This is hard rock at its absolute finest. And every instrument can be heard most distinctly. Of course you have the thunder of John Bonham's drums, the masterful playing of Jimmy Page, the steady thump of John Paul Jones's bass and of course the most distinctive voice of Robert Plant. Anyone who remembers those great artists from the seventies should purchase this outstanding recording. It is both breathtaking and astoundingly beautiful.

I have a new computer, but I like the NFS series and I hadn't played this one. It's a keyboard racer and it's an arcade game, not a simulation. That said, it's really fun despite being made in 2005. The way the game is set up you work your way up with better cars, better upgrades, and better competition. The police chases are fun, but can be frustrating as you need to do A LOT of running from the police to progress in the game. If you run for 7 minutes and get caught you get absolutely nothing. The longer you run from the police, the tougher it gets. I recommend this game if you like the series. It runs flawlessly, but I have an i5 processor, 8GB DDR3 RAM, and a 1 GB graphics card so it's to be expected.

It does have some useful information but it's so misplaced within the text that you kind of have to know exactly what you are looking for to find it. Even then it leaves you hanging. This book proceeds to tell you things like (and I quote) this feature is \\"one of the most powerful methods available to administrators\\", however it \\"is beyond the scope of this book\\".Don't waste your money on this book like I did. Instead pick up any book by Mark Minasi like the one in the Sybex \\"Mastering\\" series. That guy is just plain awesome. He is probably one of the most talented technical writers I have read.

Along with Valerie Sinasons anthology Treating Survivors of Satanist Abuse and David Sakheim/Susan Devines anthology Out of Darkness it is a must for everyone that want to learn about the subject.Ritual abuse is a strange topic - it must be one of the few subjects where psychotherapists had a vanguard role in exposing a hidden problem. In contrast to those sociologists - most of them with only armchair experiences of the subject - that dismiss all evidence and like to talk about \\"urban myths\\" Noblitt and Perskin write from their professional contacts with the victims of ritual abuse.

For a start, the keys are very useful and work well, the illustrations are so accurate that I never feel the need for coloured pictures, and the descriptions are really detailed. When you are faced with such a diversity of trees as you find in North America, you definitely do not want to go without the help of keys. Just leafing through picture books and comparing illustrations and matching them with the text (often not on the same page) is extremely frustrating, especially in genera like the pines, oaks, cherries ...

Sometimes it pays off well with original music-- sometimes it's a lot of more of the same-- sometimes it's indulgent play that might have been fun to produce, but that doesn't mean you have to buy it. You should hear this album first before you lay down good money for it. It's a hodge podge and often crosses strains the border between jammin' and just screwing around with a guitar making noise.

Contrary to some of the earlier reviews posted here, this is NOT art and in no way does it resemble even the most radical Coltrane. Anybody with an electric guitar and a six-pack of beer could have recorded this with the same quality.Yes, Neil Young is a musical genius.

There music is not made for the weak or the upwardly mobile. This music is rock for the working class. they are from baltimore as far as I can tell. more ac/dc than billy bragg. these guys arent socialists; they're welders and garbage men and other dregs of society who are trying to relax after work by thrashing your eardrums, and they run their songs as neatly as they can run overhead lowhydrogen rod. If you want to hear some good music and your near the DC or Baltimore Beltways come see iron boss and tell them they suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This is the leakiest harmonica I have ever experienced. I got this for my godson who is six and probably wouldn't know the difference, however if you actually know anything about how harmonicas should sound, this is a joke of a product. I had a pocket pal when I was a kid, and I don't remember it being this bad, but that was before Hohner farmed out its cheap harmonica production to China. Pay $10 more and get a real harp even if you are a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS SWEATER!!! I bought it for my self and i can't stop wearing it!","review":"I LOVE THIS SWEATER!!!

The products I received are of inferior quality: they are thicker, heavier, the height do not match, therefore I had to return the products. As a result I paid for the shipping and handling as well as return shipping costs without purchasing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Plate, different from original","review":"I originally got these plates in 1999 when I was getting married. They have held up well. But I needed to replace some chipped plates so I ordered these. The color of the blue band is slightly lighter than the original. They are also thicker and the depth is different so they don't stack with old. Overall, the plate is great, especially if you are not trying to mix in with older ones. But it is frustrating to have them be different when they are the same brand and pattern. I will get used to the difference but the buyer should be aware that they are not a perfect replacement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good album with a great sense of harmony and rhythm.","review":"I don't give it five stars because that's reserved for the finest albums in history. This is good, but it's not Kind of Blue.Having said that, this is an album for musicians. It has wonderfully layered textures and uses Siberry's haunting (Sarah McLachlan-like) voice to maximum effect. I have to admit, I really don't listen to the lyrics for the first few months I own a disc. I buy it for the music, and wait to see if the words matter.This disc was made for dark purple rooms and a little self-pity and to be played at a volume where the bass can thrum in your ears but not your chest.If you are a fan of McLachlan, DiFranco, Annie Lennox, or any other non-R&B \\"diva\\", I have to recommend this album. Likewise if you enjoy Faith No More, Chicago, Pink Floyd, or any other band built on layering textures and sounds.This is a mini-moog and harmonizer party, but it gets in your head, so that's a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of the ways that love can be manifested are found here.","review":"Sad, angry, lost, pleading, hopeful, unspoken, cherished, sensual: you get it all, beautifully expressed and performed. This album did have to grow on me--it is very different from the rest of Jane's work; but it continues to move me profoundly after many years. Buy it, give it a chance, and then give it another. Remember it when love touches you or leaves you, and come back to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"It's not you, it's me...\\"","review":"Have you ever met someone and thought they had lots of good qualities but somehow the spark wasn't there and you never really connected? There was nothing you could really put your finger on -- he/she was a good person, attractive, smart, etc. but it just didn't click. This album is like that for me. I can't say anything is particularly wrong with it, other than that it seems overly sentimental. She has a good voice and it's well produced, but I just don't want to listen to it.Can we still be friends?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scott","review":"This was the CD that proved that end of the year 10 Best list are useless. This work was grossly ignored by the critics, possibly because, as others have stated, it take many listens. Having played all her albums to death I was at first dissapointed, but in the years since it has sat in my cellar like fine wine to be savored, aging gracefully. Her masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Temple.","review":"I have been a fan of Siberry's since When I Was A Boy was released. This, I feel, is her best cd. Here, she sings about love in many different aspects. Musically it's engaging and mesmerizing. Siberry and Eno collaborated on this effort and it's a classic. You can listen over and over and still get something new out of it each time. It's simply a beautifully evocative recording. This is a must have for any rock collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"All the candles in the world wold not be enough...\\"","review":"'When I Was A Boy' is an extremely difficult album to pin down. Though you might compare thematically and musically to Tori Amos, Sinéad O'Connor, and/or Laurie Anderson (and can't we agree that in '93/'94 Brian Eno was one lucky guy, first working with Laurie Anderson and then Ms. Siberry), her style is wholly peculiar in its breadth. Check it out for the heavenly duet with k.d. lang, but keep it for its unrivaled mastery of both the beautiful and the weighty."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Tori Amos is Kate Bush's kid sister...","review":"...Jane Siberry is the crazy aunt they kept locked in the attic - odder and infinitely more intense than Kate at her oddest.

This album might be one. The first time I heard it I thought it was pretentious at best, and quite possibly insufferable. But the album wouldn't let me reject it. I listened again. Bit by bit, it grew on me. And then I tumbled all the way. There was a period when this was the only CD I wanted to play, over and over.People have made connections between Siberry and Kate Bush and other artists. You might as well throw Laurie Anderson in there. Like Anderson, Siberry can be extremely likable while taking you to some spooky places.If you want an entry point to the album, use the one that worked for me. The duet with K D Lang, \\"Calling All Angels,\\" is just stunning. The lyrics are poetry. The melody will haunt your dreams. The performance will almost surely leave you a changed person.Quirky? God yes! And that can be a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring Condoms","review":"I don't mean to make of Jane Siberry's majestic talents a burlesque, but be forewarned: I was sitting with a friend one night and he decided to introduce me to this album. Halfway through \\"Temple,\\" we were naked and wrapped all over each other. So just be careful, folks. This is one powerful recording. It is full of magic and will undoubtedly enchant any listener with half a soul. Jane is certainly in touch with the gods of comedy, tragedy, love and loss. But I'm still grateful that I didn't have a baby to name Jane after that night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking in spots, but there are a few too many angels","review":"This music is about erotic obsession, death, and overflowing love, with a little bit of new age sentiment mixed in. There are woo-woo monologues where the singer is telling someone she sees helpful spirits hovering around her, and in another song she's sitting vigil by a dying parent's bedside, imagining a gentle farewell to their soul. But just when I think she's getting too silly, there's an emotional passage so heartbreaking that I can't listen to it without breaking into tears. The Joni Mitchell-like \\"Love is Everything\\" is unrestrained emotion, so much that it practically dares you to listen to it and not turn away."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was looking for a book that would give me daily inspiration, but instead found a book that was of very little help to me.

Most of the days, the entries are not worth my time. Yes, I knew the book would be rather new-agey, but this is way more new-agey than I expected. There are very few practical tips.

I have broke a few nails doing this, it would be nice if they came up with an easier way to do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it appears","review":"I tried to reorder the original pads for this steam mop--the ones they show in the photo. Instead I got these green replacement pads that have ridges in them and streak the floor. Of course, returning them would cost more in shipping than it's worth so I'm stuck with false advertising.

Other Bissell replacement mop heads are 2 for $19.99. This one was 2 for $9.99 so I thought I had stumbled on a good deal. It did ship promptly. The first time I used the new pad it got holes - YIKES! that's five dollars to wash the kitchen floor- waaay too exspensive. The question is: are these pads some kind of cheap knock-off? They look exactly like the pads that came with the Steam Mop as well as other replacement pads I've bought (but not from this vendor). My opinion is - don't buy these cheap pads the $19.99 ones last a lot longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement pads","review":"These replacement pads were paired with the Bissell 1867-7 Steam Mop as a 'better together' deal. These covers are not the same as the ones that came with the mop. The ones that came with the mop have elastic around them, plus the draw string, which makes them easier to work with. The replacement covers seem smaller and do not have elastic so they are awkward to work with. Once you get them on, they work great but I'd be happier if the replacement covers would have been the same as the ones that came with the mop."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT DRY THEM","review":"The mop is a great product, but once you dry the pads they shrink beyond the point of wanting to ever use the mop again. I avoid mopping the floor at all costs because it is such a hassle to get them on now. I am either going to have to buy new ones or use something else to clean the floors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Dry these pads after washing....","review":"I LOVE the steam mop, but the replacement pads shrink in the dryer, making it next to impossible, and downright frustrating to get them to fit back on the steam mop properly. Bissell needs to redesign these to have elastic or something on them so that they go over the mop and attach easily. It takes longer to fight with the pads to get them back on the mop than it does to clean my entire kichen floor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong item received","review":"I ordered the new white version of the pads but received the older green version which were no good.

We are not happy with the Bissell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy into the philosophy","review":"Never performed qualitative research prior. Thought this book would be a helpful introduction. Very heavy on the theoretical side, as in making a solid case for why qualitative research is valid. I already accept its validity, wanted to know how to assess it and make it go smoothly.

I'm a professional painter, and used all kinds of extension poles in the past.. including the Purdy quick release poles. There is no other extension pole in my opinion that compares to the Sherlock poles. They are very light weight, and they've thought about everything. The pole is made to have the wooster roller frames snap into place without having to screw them on. In case you don't have a wooster frame, It will hold just about any other brand's snap on roller frames ( which alot of other manufacturers don't do ), and if that isn't enough, they've placed an attachment screw to the end of each pole to make sure you're never out of luck.

There may not be a single stereotype or bad pregnancy joke ever made that Rabbit Test doesn't turn upside down, giving a new light and making you think. It does take a keen sense of the ridiculous and ability to laugh at yourself. I know the two ladies laughed with positively unholy glee at having the jokes turned against the male of the species....

My husband purchased this ring for me for Christmas at my hinting and prodding. We were NOT pleased when we saw the condition of the ring on arrival. It's appearence and overall design was VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE PICTURE THEY HAVE SHOWN. The bands were very thin and flimsy- not a good characteristic to have if it is a puzzle ring.

So many of the first-person accounts/magazines/reference books out there seemed to me to be so outmoded, conservative, or targeted to a suburban reader.Hitched is modern, urbane, sharp, and right on the mark.

It also has a pretty good and comfy handle.Easy to resharpen and remove dings on a whet stone due to soft metal.CONS:Very flimsy and soft metal is used in the knife's construction. I have seen this knife's blade dent because of cutting a simple thing such as a prailine (which a standard Whustof or Henkels would not do for not much more money).OVERALL:This is absolutely an ameture housewife knife. NOT good for industrial work at all. It is, though, a decent \\"back-up\\" knife if there is something to hack-up that you dont want your more expsneive knives (assuming the reader works in an industrial kitchen) to touch or possibly get damaged.My advice, pay an extra 20 bucks and buy a low-mid range Whustof or Henkels... something that is not stamped steel and has a full tang.I hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome technology","review":"I was a little reluctant to buy this fearing the technology might not be adequately developed.

Both cost $50.00 or more but only have about an hour's worth of real content. In both cases you are not just paying for instruction but for \\"bonus\\" advertising by the artists. In both cases if you just stick to the manual or instructions on the DVD, though it would take longer than a visual/audiodemo (that is the one I hoped for but did not get), you find the same info but far, far more of it.Maybe it was just my particular copy of Church's DVD, but another problem was that about 10% of the far left and 10-20% of the bottom sections of the DVD were not visible!!

It is now March 5 2009 and we still haven't recieved the picture we sent in to make the video back yet. Again more phone calls,more lying about shipping dates.

He tried it on and was delighted with it and he also looked good in it. The brim is not as wide as a traditional western hat but still has the look he wanted. This hat comes with a chin strap which he removed. This appears to be a good quality hat. The size I ordered was large. His head is really in between the large and the extra large. The large could have been a tad bigger (he is 6' 2 \\"\\" tall.)but given the sizes of the extra large, the extra large would definitely have been too big.

Sure enough, 2 of the 6 pins holding this toy together were broken upon arrival. Instead of going through the return hassle, I just moved the 4 good pins to the corners for now to keep it secure, and I'll look for my own hardware to fix it myself.

This product is definitely made of inferior plastic material. I am just returning it for a refund and not having a new one sent from this vendor.

As a kid, I would put my face in it to get the impression on the other side but I wouldn't dare do it with this one! So besides the sharp pins and the questionable quality...

He loved it but accidentally dropped it on the carpet within minutes of opening. It disintegrated and metal pins were everywhere, which my other four yo son decided would be fun to pick up and throw. Complete disaster. My 5 yo was very sad. Great idea, but significant design flaw in product in that the clear acrylic front is connected to the body by cheap plastic pins. These break without much effort at all. Once broken there is nothing to hold the metal pins in. They go everywhere. Makes you wonder what they possibly could have been thinking when they made this.Summary: looks great on the website and kids love this product, so seems like a great idea to buy it, but do not buy this one.

I shopped around and found the best price with Crazzies and you definitely get what you pay for. This item was definitely defective, with bent pins that would not fall into place, scratches on the plastic face, and the box looked like it had been used in a game of floor hockey. I would have sent it back but it was not worth the hassle. I suggest buying from a reputable place, or from somewhere you can view the actual product. It was also much smaller than expected, but Crazzies did not reveal the dimensions- they just called it \\"large pin art\\".

But this one lasted all of a day. It was made incorrectly, there was too mach space between the 2 black pieces, so the pins would come too far out of the back black piece when it was turned over all the way, then not settle back in properly. Within a day, half the pieces were stuck in the \\"out\\" position. Amazon refunded me my money, and I'll try again with a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and dangerous.","review":"Very cheaply made--one of the black plastic screws holding it together arrived broken. But worse than that, all the metal pins had jagged, sharp edges! Most pin art toys at least have blunted tips, but this was was painful, sharp, and dangerous. Ouch! I don't. Know if this was an anomaly, but if it was, it's a dangerous one, especially for kiddos! Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can Cause Injury","review":"My husband was trying to show the kids his funny face when pressed against the pins and he received a scratch across his eyelid. That's when we noticed upon closer inspection that the back of each pin is rough and jagged. They are not smooth and rounded like the ones we had when we were kids. I don't know if we just got a bad one itself or if they are all like this, but I would not recommend this to anyone based on our experience. We are still looking for a higher quality one that is safe to use, but this one is not safe. The back pins really feel like you're resting your skin against a lot of sharp pointed nails and they look like it too. If you decide to buy this anyway, be sure to check the pins before letting any children play with this so they can't be hurt. If I still had the box and receipt, I'd have returned it.

What a loon!","review":"I read all kinds of books and some of them are enjoyable for a while, but I can take them or leave them. This is one of those rare books that I REALLY couldn't put down. I was reading in the morning, with a timer set so I could stop in time to be ready for work. When the timer went off I had to reset it because I could not put it down. I cannot remember the last time this happened- I could just not let it go. I felt like I had entered Christopher's head. Reading this book also gave me some insight into autistic students who attend the school where I work. I have not seen through the eyes of a person whose behavior is outside the norm like this since I read the Noonday Demon. I have recommended this book to everyone I have talked to since I finished it on Wednesday and I highly recommend this unusual and gripping story to you as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than I could have imagined","review":"This is a world I had no idea about, well a small idea about, but now I think I understand a lot more, thank you Mr. Haddon.

You lose yourself in the mind of this autistic child.","review":"The idea is brilliant, although seemingly impossible to pull-off: write a first-person account of the complicated life an autistic child.The dog's apparent murder \\"investigation\\" is the channel that you navigate down from inside the mind of this boy who you immediately lose yourself within, but the story is about loss, love, parenting and the complicated world that seems much simpler inside the confines of this child's mind.Simple prose with a beautiful story that you lose yourself within. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me think of my brother","review":"I found this book in the library by accident, I love dogs and was intrigued by the book's cover showing an upside down French poodle. My brother is severely austic. I can barely stop reading the story. Unlike the author who said that he is mildly autistic, I can excuse the book for not having the main character express his emotional side. Just writing about the way that people who are autistic may think gives me confidence to think my ideas may be true. I can understand him more through this book. My real person-brother does have intense emotions. When my mother dies and he was living with her, our cat, Happy Days had to be pried from his fingers. This book is a big start for me. I will be ordering Mark Haddon's other books and searching for more books, fiction or not on autism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"Written from the perspective of a teenage boy with autism, the story allowed me access to the inner workings of a mind many of us never understand. I was delighted with the story even when it momentarily confused me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly compelling and emotional journey","review":"I am not a big reader. I purchased this book for something to read on a long plane flight. After recently reading \\"The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\", it seemed that another story of one's mind may be interesting. And was it. From the moment I opened the book I could not put it down. Not only was I captivated by the thoughts of this kid, but had a growing appreciation for the challenges someone with this condition has, page by page. The story was written in a light and easy reading way, where I just flew through the pages. It was humorous at times, and at times felt deep compasion for Christopher. Have to give this 5 stars as one of the best books I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curious","review":"I thought this book was very amusing. At one point Christopher writes \\"I rolled back onto the lawn and pressed my forehead to the ground again and made the noise that Father calls groaning.\\" After I read this sentence I could just picture Christopher slowly rolling onto the ground and moaning. I think this sentence also helped the reader understand how someone with Asperger's syndrome doesn't understand something as simple as what a moan is. He states that the noise he was making was what his father called moaning, not a noise that he knew himself to be moaning. I love how descriptive this book is without being too descriptive. I think a good example of this is when Christopher was trying to describe the way his head felt when a police officer was asking him too many questions, \\"They were stacking up in my head like loaves in the factory where Uncle Terry works.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"RUN.........!","review":".....DON'T WALK, to get a copy of this incredible book! An amazing, superbly crafted tale, \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime\\" opens the mind of an autistic child, Christopher, to the reader. His bewildered and beleagured parents, who try so hard to do what's right for their son, are wonderful characters who mimic their real life counterparts with sympathy and finesse.You WILL be sorry if you miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"I thought that this was an engaging, fast-paced read and a truly interesting character study. I would recommend it to most anyone.The only reason I didn't give this novel 5 stars was that I was a bit bothered by the main character's total and complete lack of emotional response. I have worked extensively with autistic children and have a hard time dispelling the myth that they are robotic, unfeeling creatures who lack human emotion. I can't speak for every child on the autistic spectrum, of course, but in truth the vast majority of these children demonstrate the capacity for loving relationships and strong emotional bonds, even if this is expressed in an atypical way. I felt that Christopher's emotional disconnect from his family was sad and not necessarily representative of most autistic kids.That point aside, an interesting story told from an intriguing point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent read","review":"I have so much respect now for parents of Autistic children. I knew it would be hard to raise one, but with the author's experience he gives an excellent picture of the far-reaching effects of an autistic child that the average person would never consider. And you want so much for him to be loved & accepted. Would definitely recommend this book! However, I disagree with Amazon's suggestion that if you like this, you will like \\"timetraveler's wife.\\" I just could NOT get through that very, very long book - did not hold my interest at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"quirky, interesting, and at times hilarious!","review":"This book is a rare treat. Christopher is a protagonist who elicits the reader's empathy, gives us a rare glimpse into the autistic mind, and his literal and straightforward dealings with other characters in the book had me in several fits of convulsive laughter! I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good summer read","review":"This is a very enjoyable read, with a fresh perspective from a unique narrator. I worried at the outset that the first-person voice of the autistic narrator might become too precious or oppressive, but I needn't have worried. Hadden deftly handles the challenge he set for himself in presenting a consistent, authentic voice which, in light of the narrator's inability to understand jokes or interpret feelings, is ironically funny, insightful, and empathetic. I also think this book will appeal to, and is appropriate for, young adult readers. I have recommended it to my 13-year-old son, and I think it will provide a great foundation for a discussion with him about human relationships, loyalty, betrayal, our efforts to understand each other, the challenges we set for ourselves and, of course, the novel form itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"See the World through a Different Set of Eyes","review":"This book was so original! I picked the book up only because it was a Today Show Book Recommendation. It was very good. Mark Haddon is an excellent author. It must have been very difficult to tell the entire story through the eyes of Christopher, an autistic boy. By reading this book, you come to realize how these children go through their days - from their thought processes to their unbearable touches. It was a serious book, but there were lots of funny parts to chuckle over. Overall, this was a great book; a little predictable at times, but still very good. It has all the emotions of a good book - sadness, laughter, and joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a good story","review":"This is a well written book that captivates and entertains all the way through. It's a quick read, and is fast moving and very funny. The author's ability to provide insights into the workings of the brain of a young autistic boy is excellent - it all makes such perfect sense and ought to be read by anyone who has contact with someone with autism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too short","review":"Having some experience with mentally challenged (30 yhears), I found this book to be very realistic. It was like being in the mind of that young man and felt like a completely honest portrayal. I enjoyed it very much.

And how he dealt with being special... I found it interesting.I loved how he knew to calm himself. But I hated how he used \\"and\\" way to much.9"},{"rating":"2","title":"Curious preaching from an otherwise interesting read","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel. I found it engaging right from the start. It was interesting to see things from a different perspective. I got some insight, I think, into a very different way of looking at life. Christopher would, indeed, be a handful.My problem with this book and why I would not give it a rave review is the atheism kind of tacked-on here and there. It feels false to the character. It feels like the authour saw an opportunity to preach his view of religion and was not faithful to the character in so doing. I found that disappointing and distracting. It is not integral to the story, though, so it's easy to overlook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I received this book on a Saturday afternoon and finished reading it less than 24 hours later. I could not put it down because I found it fascinating on so many different levels.I learned a lot about the perspective of a person who has Autism. I also noticed the similarities of a person with Autism and ADHD which I had not been aware of before.The best part was that it was just a really great story that kept me in suspense. I had to find out what happened right away. It was like watching a movie from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable accomplishment","review":"This book will remain in my all time favorite section on my bookshelf when it is not loaned out. I am not a good writer, so I could not begin to tell you how remarkable this book is. It is empathetic, funny, happy, sad...all at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engrossing listen (Audio version review).","review":"I was thankful for the traffic this morning, lengthening my already long drive so that I could enjoy a few more chapters.I'd recommend this to anyone who is not bound to a rigid story line, and truly think this is a better book to listen to, than to read. I would be tempted to skip bits if I were reading it - something that's impossible in the audio book... and those bits are all part of what makes this book so engrossing. (Where will Christopher's story take us next?)The narrator, too, is a wonderful bonus, gained as a result of the audio edition. He provides the right tone and voices - far better than my own inner voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernaturally clever!","review":"Mark Haddon has written a very clever one-of-a-kind novel. I loved it. It's thoughtful, surprising, funny, and moving. Yep, it's got it all. It's as good as the title suggests.And if you're looking for another great, clever read, check out Jennifer Paddock's stunning novel, A SECRET WORD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"So this was a very swell book I usually don't like mysteries but this one caught my attention, Christopher and I are similar we both are ADHD and get easily distracted I liked how he would be talking about one thing then switch to a completely different topic some people didn't like it but I thought it was cool I would deff intake recommend others to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book!","review":"This is a unique book in the way it is written. It gives good insight to the thought process of those dealing with autisim. It's highly entertaining, and a very quick read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried SO HARD to like this book ...","review":"Alas, while fascinating to understand the perspective of a child with special needs, it's just not entertaining. Read this to be edified, and to be grateful to be who you are and capable of all you can do ... but do not read this book for entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curiously Good","review":"True, this novel was different from anything else I've ever read. Possibly that is the reason for its popularity. I'd think that most people would want to know more about autism, what with it on the rise, though I did have to admit that I wasn't totally sympathetic for Christopher. My dog, however, did get my sympathy.The form of the book is unique and the story short. Not the best book I've read, but certainly something you should try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curious Incident is Curiously Refreshing","review":"We bought this book for our son who was expected to do summer reading for an Honors English class, otherwise I probably wouldn't have picked it up. I have no knowledge nor experience with autism, so my thoughts are simply based on my reaction to this book. I enjoyed it thoroughly! It captured my attention in the beginning and held it through the entire fairly quick read. I loved the illustrations which really helped me understand Christopher's thought processes. The story resonated with me. It was easy for me to relate to Christopher because I've come to believe most people exhibit some of his behaviors, regardless of a diagnosis of autism or not. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read!","review":"I read this book years ago, and I have purchased many copies since then as gifts for others. I am an avid reader, but I have never read a book that was narrated in such a fresh and creative way. I give this book five stars, but I cannot say the same for Haddon's other books... in fact, I don't think I would even give \\"A Spot of Bother\\" ONE star. That's okay though, because I am glad that Haddon was able to capture my interest with \\"the curious incident\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Thumbs up!","review":"As a teacher, I found this book to be very informative. For the first time, I really feel like I am better able to understand what goes on in the mind of some of my autistic students. Yes, I've read books and watched videos on the topic, but this very entertaining book gave me some great insight! A quick read, informative and very well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time","review":"This book makes you laugh, cry, and stand up and cheer for a 15-year-old autistic detective. He starts out trying to solve the murder of a neighbor's dog, but with self-possession that most would envy, faces life's critical challenges. Children and teens who experience the world differently not only have to bear the slings and arrows of their peers, but also, many times they have to put up with parents, educators, counselors, and others who are either ignorant or overwhelmed trying to understand, help, and provide for them. I rooted for Christopher each day as he solved problems, accepted what he could not change, and heroically worked on making his world better against long odds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and Memorable","review":"Actually I would give this one 4.5 stars if I could. Haddon's book is original and endearing; it's narrated by an austitic boy whose quest to find out who killed the neighbor's dog leads him to make shocking discoveries about his own family. Parts of this book made me laugh out loud and parts made me want to cry. Christopher helps open the readers eyes to the fact that having a disability doesn't mean leading a less fulfilling life.It's definately worth the read, and it's a quickie too; I finished in one night. I would also recommend this title for high school aged readers and book clubs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing Perspective","review":"This was recommended at Audible.Com, based on my daughter's interests. I listened to it this weekend (initially because my daughter has Asperger's)and found it to be delightful. I very much enjoyed the point of view. It seems so rare to see a protagonist with some kind of disability. My daughter loves that Percy Jackson is dyslexic & has ADHD (she too is severely dyslexic, which is why we LOVE audiobooks) because she can identify with him. I hope we see more characters like the young actor in Breaking Bad that has cerebral palsy, not played for sympathy, but as part of the diversity of our population."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept but not enough substance","review":"The story starts out very interesting. A 15 year old with some form of autism is trying to figure out who killed his neighbors dog. It is written from the perspective of the child with autism and while this is what makes the book unique, it also becomes somewhat of a tedious book to read. The mystery of the book runs out about 1/2 way through and there just isn't enough of a plot to make up for what occurs after that point. I have a nephew who has some of the same problems and when the main characted is acting out in certain ways I can very much see my nephew in that. The novelty of this point of view wears of quickly for me and that along with about 20% of the book just being random facts mentioned by the main character make this a forgettable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into Autism","review":"Christopher's first person account of his story is the best reason for reading this book. If you want to know what goes on in the mind of an autistic teenager, read this book. Mark Haddon is to be commended for his delightful work, and since the book has become so popular, I'm sure the public will understand this developmental problem in a way that doctors and educators will never be able to explain in a better way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo","review":"Mark expertly leads us on a tour inside the mind of a fascinating (implied) autistic boy. He pulls you in with the first paragraph and doesn't let you go until the last sentence.Lessons in frustration, anger, separation, naivete, understanding, misunderstanding and so much more are interwoven within each page.Thank you, Mark, for writing such a powerful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"I hardly ever recommend a modern novel to everybody, preferring to stay in the realms of 'classic' fiction, but I can unequivocally say that everybody should read this novel. It showed me that autistic people have much in common with \\"normal\\" people, and that they might be more normal than us. I was moved by this book: the autistic boy's observations of the world around him, untainted by cynicism, were like looking in a mirror for the first time and seeing that, no, all is not well with the world. Even so, the book is not depressing; rather, it is revelatory; nor is it preachy for the cause of autism. By showing that autism is a human condition, Mr. Haddon has done the human condition a favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Autism is No Excuse","review":"Wow. What a chore. My wife recommended it so I began reading it. 50 pages in I put it down. The short, choppy senteneces, the long, pointless tangents, and plodding story were too much for me to bear.Next thing I know my brother is recommending the book. His taste is usualy impeccable so I give it another shot. Same problems as before. this time however, I forced myself to finish it hoping against hope something, ANYTHING would make the experience enjoyable. No dice.Using the mentally challenged kid as narrator obviously worked for some - not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"personally, i thought this book sucked","review":"i was really hoping to like this book, but unfortunately it did nothing for me. the main character was interesting at first, but ultimately just annoying. i admit, the book is very different and unlike anything i've read up to this point, but umm....that doesn't make it good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pros and Cons","review":"I think it was a good book that taught me ,someone with no experience or knowledge about autism, alot of things. It had a good charater ,Christopher, that you could sympathize with. Yet somethings ,such as the explicit language, that made the reading experience less enjoyable. I think that considering all things there are more pros than cons which in my opinion makes this good book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible- not written well at all","review":"Don't waste your money, it was almost as bad as Life of Pi, someone trying to fill up pages with text, going into detail of things that shouldn't be detailed and then continuing on with the story line. What a waste!, If you want to read well written books I'll suggest: The Kite Runner, The Poisonwood Bible, Lovely Bones all well written- I can tell..no struggle to fill pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dog was dead ....","review":"This book is as dead as the dog. It is filled to the brim with random facts that don't progress the story at all, and make you frustrated as you try to see the link. This book has the feeling it was written by a very intelligent 3rd grader. Your reading about a dead dog when suddenly the writer starts going on about how the stars exploded in the big bang.This book is given such good ratings because everyone wants to be politically correct and not be mean to the mentally challenged writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Twaddle","review":"I read this one as a part of the book club - I've seen the book around and was interested but found it bitterly disappointing. There are gimmicks galore - the chapter numbers are in primes, there's several puzzles inserted into the text - but very little, if any substance. Additionally by writing the story from the point of the autistic teenager the author is limiting himself to a subset of language, emotions, etc - I'd have been much more impressed if the author told the story in the third person. We're all grown ups here, we can handle it.Don't bother, in short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful","review":"I had high expectations for this book, I really did. It did have a great cover. However, it was bad. The big joke was the back cover comparing the book as similar to Catcher in the Rye. The only thing similar to that book was that the narrator talked directly to the reader. That's about all the similarities I saw. Seriously people, if you're getting this book to find out more about autism, just rent rainman and save yourself some time.Towards the end of this book I was just thinking to myself: \\"Get on with it, I get it, he has autism.\\" Don't waste your time on this. It's an example of manufactured hype. This is my first book from the \\"Today Show Book Club.\\" If they liked this, it will be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"if there were any case i could give no star,i would give NONE definitely.i cant believe hw come its a bestseller,seriously!!the book was used as my school-based reader when i was grade10 and i simply found it reli boring and juvenile.i read a chapter or two and simply quited.believe me its for kids under10."},{"rating":"1","title":"The curious book","review":"I feel that the reviews (NY TIMES) have way over hyped this book that is at best a light read with some good ideas. This is in no way a novel. I found it to be mediocre juvenile fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypical, contrived story","review":"My son has autism, we live with autism, my friends are parents of children with autism, from my viewpoint Mark Haddon's book was an dispassionate rehashing of a younger Dustin Hoffman's Rainman character in London...not completely disagreeable, but I found it insulting and limiting to people with autism. In the search to keep the story interesting, Mr. Haddon uses Kurt Vonneguts' clever drawing style. I wish there was something new and fresh here, but it was a tired cliche of unconscious people doing unconscious things in a dirty dark world. Even the writing style was arduous like freshman writing for college composition class. yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"I read this book because it recieved so many good reviews, and was very disappointed. I thought the plot was dry, I didn't care about any of the characters, and there was absolutely no suspense. Unless you want to understand how a autistic person thinks I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curious Praise For This Book","review":"Actually I don't think it deserves even one star. Our Book Club read this book and not one member gave it much praise. It is a painful book to read. I am not sure why anyone would read it pr for that matter why anyone would waste time writing it It is narrated by the main character, a 15 year old boy who has autism. It is like listening to someone sing in a monotone. Read a medical book to learn about autism. Not one of our members really even wanted to finish the book. Would definitely not recommend it to anyone except maybe my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be outta the loop...","review":"While I admire the author's attempt to portray the life of an autistic boy, I found myself skimming though the book. I got very tired reading about Christopher's descriptions of life and things. The pictures, graphs and charts were a bit much. I couldn't believe how QUICKLy the book ended- I was like \\"That's it?\\" I think this got such rave reviews because it's a \\"Different\\" sort of genre- but don't expect it to be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, fun read","review":"I was initially turned off by this book because of the fact that a dog was found dead with a pitchfork in its body. But the book is good anyway (and I LOVE dogs). The main character, Christopher, is autistic and feels very close to animals. That's why he takes it upon himself to find out who killed the dog. He starts out by going door to door and interviewing people in his neighborhood.The mystery is eventually solved (although not by the above method), but along the way we get to know Christopher, who likes the number 2, loves math, and is perplexed by the way most people's minds wander. The author does a great job of getting inside this unusual character's head and making us sympathize with him. The ending is uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"guilt/fad reading...","review":"this book tried too hard to attain what all authors know is the holy grail of writing: creating something new. Yet the story is dull, the writing generic and elementary, and the story is cliche. My biggest complaint, however, is that the main character is portrayed as nearly stupid and compassionless. There is a notion that because autistic people have difficulties with communication and/or other social interactions, that they are just as awkward in their minds. This is far from true; what happens inside cannot always be translated to outside, but it does not mean that complexities are impossible inside. I would have preferred the story to show the complexities inside his mind and how he struggles to translate those to daily life; the boy from the inside out, not the outside in. Don't assume that what we see on the outside is basically all there is inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Boring","review":"This book is very very very boring. The greatest thing about the book is the way the author shows you how the boy thinks. However, the characters, plot, and ending all make you want to fall asleep in the middle of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding","review":"After lurching through the analness of this book, it was definitely a book that I could put down. Although written in the same vein as \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", and written from the viewpoint of a 15 year old emotionally challenged lad, it was droll, to say the least. Originally purchased for my daughter, I have since decided that it is better for a charity to make 50 cents from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never understood the hype around it","review":"I bought this book because of all the great reviews attached to it. However, I just finished it and I can't be but disappointed at it. It is a well researched book indeed, with all its maths and logic problem, but that is basically it. I didn't find it insightful in any way. I guess the way it was written was boring.A good book leaves emptiness in your life after you finish it, this one hasn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it wasn't a hard book to read","review":"The curious incident of the dog in the night-time, is about an autistic child named Christopher. Christopher is extremely smart, however, he can't understand human emotion. the book reads fairly easy, which is about the only good thing about the book. the author adds to the story alot of his atheist views, as well as alot of examples and drawlings that have no significants to the story. If you enjoy good reading, leave this one on the shelf. if you want alot of nothing, run out and buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of garbage","review":"I won't waste my time giving details. Suffice to say that this book is a steaming pile of garbage full of stereotypes, cliches and foul language. Avoid at all costs.PS. Has anyone else noticed how all the 1-star reviews have low helpfulness ratings while the 5-star reviews have high helpfulness ratings? No doubt this is the work of die-hard \\"Curious Incident\\" fans. As a person on the Eragon board said, you rate reviews because you find them helpful, not because you don't agree with the content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"MANY GIVEAWAYS. DO NOT READ IF YOU INTEND TO READ THE BOOK!Thank goodness this was a quick read! Typical of many British novels, I was left with \\"huh?\\" It almost seemed to me that the author simply got tired of writing and wanted to end the story. Perhaps I was reading to much into it but:a) What happens to mum? Did she continue her life alone?b) What happens to dad?c) What happens to the Shears? Will they continue to hate each other?d) Way too much hate going on between those neighbors and lovers. It was left open.e) A golden retriever? From a pet rat to a dog that will grow to the size of a small pony??f) Dad stabbed a dog because he was angry? Thus dude needs some serious help!A book about the quest investigate a dead of a dog? More about how this dude lives in a hugely disfunctional family system. Odd story. Pretty much a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too much story development","review":"There's not too much story development, the so-called \\"curious incident\\" has been solved around 1/3 of this thin bk. But what's special about this bk is to let readers understand why an autistic would behave in some socially odd way (eg shouting/crying out of no reason, afraid to go to new places, like to count things, having obsession over some things). It's written in the 1st person thru the eyes of a 15-year old autistic.i'm sorry that i threw it away as soon as i finished reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Even Finish It","review":"After reading all the reviews I thought this would be a great book. I am half way through and can't go on. I developed a dislike for Christopher's father and he way he treats Christopher. The book seems to drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was pretty disappointed by this book. The back cover makes it sound like a story that is absolutely nothing like the story is about. The main plot really has nothing to do with the dog, and not to sound offensive, but reading a book with an autistic narrotor is enough to give me a headache. There are so many added on random thoughts that it distracts from the flow of the story, and I ended up skippin to the ends of chapters. Had I known what I was getting myself into by reading it, I wouldn't have picked it up. Although if I was doing a study on autism, it would be a good book for perspective on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time","review":"I did not enjoy reading this book. I found it very confusing and boring. I understand this was written from an autistic persons view, but not being educated on autism, it made it frustrating to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did he know?","review":"Although there's plenty of reviews of this book, I had to write about some of my highlights because I enjoyed the story so much.I checked the author biography about 10 times while reading this book, wondering if he was autistic or if he specialized in the field of autism. He appears to be a neurotypical guy who teaches creative writing in England.The mind-bender for me was I fully believed the story to be written by a 15-year old austic boy, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Haddon blends the plot, characters and point of view to perfection.I highly recommend this book to grade-school teachers. I think they will enjoy it to the fullest extent, not because of the autistic POV, but to see how the boy thinks and learns (and trusts his teacher)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I was recommended this book in a book group, and it was great! Very easy read but makes you really think! It brings you into the mind of a boy who is almost trapped in his, lets you in on his quirks, and his pain. Definitely a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Likeable Book","review":"I think anyone on any level can relate to this. Its a nice short read and holds your attention throughout the book. I'm not so sure it lives up to its hype, but likely if you thought you'd found a book no one else had heard of you would have thought it a big win! If you are looking for a book to understand your autistic child, this is not the book you are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A coming of age story more than a mystery (a review of the audiobook)","review":"The mystery portion of this book is really a relatively small part of the book, but the death of Wellington, a neighbor's dog is the action that starts a starts a chain reaction that causes 15 year old Christopher Boone to go on the adventure of his life and wrap up any number of loose ends. I'd dare to say that we have some similarities with Huckleberry Finn in this book.Throw in the fact that Christopher has Asperger's Syndrome and you've got a remarkable book. Is it equal to all of the hype? Probably not, but how could any book be THAT good?I \\"read\\" this book as an audiobook and it was extremely well narrated by Jeff Woodman. He pulled this one off quite well.A recommendation for those interested in a similar book I recommend the sci-fi book \\"Speed of Dark\\" by Elizabeth Moon. It deals with an adult with autism in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perceptive observation and clever execution","review":"My mum is a teacher and often worked at special schools, taking my brother and me along to help if we had a curriculum day.I found Mark Haddon's observation of autism to be very perceptive and his use of maps, diagrams, puzzles and prime numbers to carry us along with him effective.His ability to challenge logical reasoning and the \\"normal\\" view of the world was also thought provoking.I was reminded of a line in a book by Roddy Doyle - when the mother is standing on the toilet screaming in fear because of a mouse at her feet, and her young son, hearing the commotion, comes to investigate, and seeing the mouse, over-joyed, asks his mum if they can get a mouse for Christmas. His mother, in a flash of brilliance explains, no (why not?) because it will scare the reindeer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start, but the ending wasn't worth the read","review":"I was very excited by the beginning of this story because it gave me insight into the minds of the autistic. The author did a great job of describing this character and reminded me of several autistic students that I've had as a teacher in the past. It seems though, that the author got too involved in the development of a great character and forgot to write a story. It just isn't a very interesting ride that the author takes you on. And, even if it was a story about how a character changes over time, he didn't accomplish this either. Don't waste your time with this one...I don't know what all these other reviewers could be so amazed by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it","review":"This book has a really interesting and unusual plot (a dog murder-mystery being solved by an autistic English boy--wow!). I give its author a lot of credit for creativity. However, I really couldn't immersed in the story and about halfway through I stopped reading. I wish I saw what everyone else does in this book, because I really wanted to like it.Don't let me stop you from reading it, though, because many of my friends loved it. Somehow it just wasn't my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant??! Hardly worth a look","review":"With sincerest apologies to anyone who is autistic, this book is horrid. First of all, the murder of the dog is solved halfway through - all that's left is a bunch of ramblings by the author about the autistic child's different way of seeing the world. Nothing new here. But, I've known autistic people who speak and write and who don't start 42 consecutives sentences or paragraphs with the word \\"And\\" .... as did happen in this book or at least until I got tired of counting them (there were more). In the last 40 pages or so, I only got the feeling that the author was trying to hurry to finish it and get to his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable book","review":"A remarkable book, offering a remarkable journey through the mind of an exceptional character. The book's hero and narrator, Christopher Boone, could easily have become precious or irritating, but Mr. Haddon strikes a difficult balance. Christopher is wonderfully sympathetic--I suffered with him throughout his difficult and courageous journey to London--but he's also tremendously hard for others to fathom. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit curious indeed.","review":"This may be one of the strangest books I have ever read. The entire time I was reading it, I couldn't decide whether I loved it or I hated it. I have never had a book evoke such a curious response from me.After a few strangely numbered chapters, I decided that anyone who can capture my attention and hold it with such a lack of anything actually transpiring, must be worth his salt. I think I ended up liking this book just because it was so very different than other things I have read.The story moves along nicely and makes you think about things that your average novel may not. At times I felt like I was inside the head of this boy, which is a true accomplishment since the book really does not make use of vibrant description which is usually how I judge how real a reading experience was for me.Over all I would Urge you to pick up this book and give it a try. You won't be sorry. It will give you something interesting to talk about in literary circles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable","review":"An excellent book told from the point of view of an autistic child.

I especially enjoyed the clear gems of wisdom embedded within the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"extraordinary book","review":"Beautifully written, heartbreaking but lovely, and exquisitely felt, this book resonated with me for days after I read it. I have passed it on to several friends, all of whom felt the same way about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, great audio-book","review":"I started listening to this book on audio and I really enjoyed the voice of the reader and how he portrayed the thoughts of the young boy in this story. I was then unable to finish listening to the story and i bought the book. Although there are pictures in the book that help you understand the main character's thoughts, such as maps and diagrams, I really missed hearing the voice of the reader from the audio-book. It is a touching look into the mind of a child with Autism."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye-opener!","review":"This is a story written through the eyes of a mildly autistic boy who is trying to solve the mystery of the neighbour's dog murder, and stumbles into a number of other \`revelations' on the way.The book is both moving and funny (in both a laugh-out-loud and a sad kind of way) with an original plot and simple but flowing language, which makes it very easy to read in one sitting.Seeing life from Christopher's \`simplified' and inherently logical point-of-view was a real eye-opener for me. And although that's not the purpose of the book, I think that every parent can benefit from this \`inside' view of a child's mind.Though it's probably not one of those books that will stay with me for life, it's well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful Read","review":"A quirky, bitter-sweet tale told from the perspective of an autistic teen. A very clever composition, written in a deceptively simple style. It helps to demystify some of the unusual behavior of a person with autism. The main character, Christopher, is likeable and unintentionally funny, but what really appealed to me was his childlike, guileless honesty, and his observations on behavior and life. A short easy read of worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"If you don't like Catcher in the Rye, don't bother reading this. I should have listened to the reviews I read comparing the two. Pointless rambling....."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK I'VE READ (In awhile anyways)","review":"This book was so lame, but I couldnt stop reading, it was like a car wreck where you just cant look away. Afwul! I thought it was going to get better, but it doesn't! SAVE YOUR MONEY! It was basically a story about an autistic boy who screams when anyone touches him & cant stand crowds or yellow. That's basically it. His father is also a freak & his mother leaves, which I so cannot blame her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. My son has Asperger's Syndrome, a form of Autism, and I had heard several recommendations for this book.I thought that the author's character portrayal of an autistic child was well-developed, and the story line itself was interesting, but all of this was outweighed by the incredible amount of profanity and cursing that took place in the dialogue.I was hoping that this book would not only be one that I would enjoy, but one that I could share with my children. Not so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny at times but over all, it was a dumb story","review":"I will admidt that I can't understand the challenges of having or being autistic.

Please don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"PARENTS BEWARE! FOUL LANGUAGE SPOlLS THIS BOOK","review":"It is sign of how low standards have sunk when this book has received so much praise. I am so frustrated that the author felt that it was necessary to liberally use so much obscene language in this book (no doubt in the cause of realism - but we all don't live our lives surrounded by people swearing). It's a disgrace that this book wins a children's fiction award. My daughter and I couldn't get through it. This book should have come with a warning for parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"uhhhh.....","review":"i read this book over the summer as a high school reading requirement. I read the whole book but I tell you that it was very painful to read...cause i can say 2 words about it...it sucks. I mean this book had a dry and plain plot with uninteresting characters. Christopher had no personality and his father was a major a**hole. I was tricked into thinking that this was a good book by the synopsis on the back. It was so boring i kept putting it down after ever 17 pages. Besides being boring this book had so much explict languge it's not even funny--they said the f word more than 60 times. Please avoid this book at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"the curious incident of the dog in the night-time","review":"I suppose that I will disagree with everyone else who rated the is book, but I could barely get through the book. I supposed if you're a math nut you would thoroughly enjoy this book, but math is one of the reasons why I thought it totally boring. About half way through the book I almost tossed the book in the trash. I only finished it because I have a policy of finishing what I start. I never appreciate that kind of language in a book especially when it's about a 15 year old boy, I supposed that's supposed to be realism, but all it does is put a stamp of approval to the teenage reader. I found that the further I read I hoped that somebody would do in the boy with the absolutely irritating manner. In my opinion, the boy belonged in a special school for problem children. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Delivery Device for the Author's 'Neat Thoughts'","review":"The story of this book is actually pretty cool! I like the whole dog-murder-mystery thing, it was a very neat idea.Unfortunately, this little bit of story is only filler, used in-between the author's little siderants about reality and science. It's cool, I guess any way to get a lot of people exposed to science and philosophical ideas is neat...but it's so forced that I found it a bit painful :(I think it's most interesting how the author chose to deliver these spiffy thoughts of his, though. An autistic character is a clever background reason to go off on 'smart' tangents. If only they were just-as-cleverly integrated into the story, instead of just scattering a story around them.Good book I guess, if you're into that sorta thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Terrible book! Couldn't even finish it! Writing was pathetic but the story was just plain stupid so don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simplistic","review":"I read this book because Amazon recommended it since I was a big fan of \\"The Brief, Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.\\" This book is nothing like Oscar Wao. The writing is so simplistic it drove me crazy. I understand it was written from the perspective of someone with Aspberger's, but it was frustrating nonetheless. I just don't feel like there was any real point to this story. I didn't walk away with any new insights or relevant thoughts. It was a really easy read, but overall, a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"I was so keen to read the book that absolutely EVERYONE was raving about. And to be honest when I finally did, Christopher annoyed me. When I compare Curious Incident to, for example, Catcher In the Rye, Paddy Clark ha ha ha..it just falls flat on its face. I can see what the author is doing-bringing a marginalised character to the centre of his novel...the way the boy is trying to find order in a chaotic world, how difficult it is for him to understand feelings and emotions, how pattern and routine play an important part in his daily life...BUT it ends there. The book does not leave me with a sense of...well, anything really. I was just glad to turn the last page and never have to look at it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse book ever!!","review":"I HATE THIS BOOK WITH ALL MY HEART. Don't get me wrong I love reading but this book was absolutely a torture for me, in fact it is the only book I hate. I have read more than 90 books just this year and I actually had to read this for english class, otherwise I wouldn't have read it at all. I mean I just could not conect with the narrator. Just like, No! I tried but I do not get how such a human being could exist. No jokes, no love, no believe in God or anything that is not logical. I don't understand how someone can live like that. I don't recommend this book to anybody. I do not understand how it became a best seller or how people recommend it to each other, and give four stars for it. But I'm happy knowing that I discourage people to read this. I especially tell people to never read this book. But other than this book, I love any other book I have ever read. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A rather mediocre book.","review":"Another example that what passes for good fiction these days is often just mediocre.The story is not well constructed, the internal workings of the autistic child's brain were often not believable and, more often, uncompelling. He could have done something interesting with this setup, but it seems cheap, hurried, and actually unthoughtful, considering its ambitions.And, really, in the end, it left with the feeling that it was just another cheap novel with more thought going into making it marketable than making it good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan!","review":"Hard to finish this book. Not a big fan! This book was not very good, I would have a hard time recommending it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Live Up to Hype","review":"This is another book that becomes the darling of book clubs around the country and turns out to be a big disappointment for me. Yes, it reads fast and yes, it's interesting to be in the mind of a person with autism. But I didn't need 200+ pages of it. I think the plot is simple and it's solved halfway through the book. The rest of the book, mostly the main character's train trip to London, I found boring and frustrating (which might be a point the author was trying to make: autism is indeed very frustrating for those who are close to the patient) after just a few pages. Maybe it's not a great thing that I'm not especially interested in autism and the troubles it causes for those who suffer from it and their close ones, but that must be why I didn't care too much for the book as a whole. Too much of a good thing, even if it was only 220 pages long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torturous Reading","review":"If you would like to know more about autism, don't look here. If you want to feel like you have autism, read this book. The story could have been accomplished in fewer than 10 pages with the same message. You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"And then...","review":"I bought this book because I thought it was a mystery.Because the title is based on a Holmes story.And then I read it.And then there was a murder of a dog.And then there were a lot of logical lessons and math lessons in between the real story.And then I skipped over many of these parts because they were boring.And then I saw that a lot of sentences in this book begin with \\"and then\\".And then I realized that with the main character being autistic, the author can write like a Special School person, and then I wondered if he could write a real book written like a grownup.And then I looked for a good ending.And then there wasn't one."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful!","review":"I had so much trouble getting through the book. I think the biggest problem was that the author failed to create sympathy for the main character. I understand he was trying to portray a child that is inflicted with a mental discorder, but he did not humanize christopher at all. As much as I wanted to like the kid, I just couldn't bring myself to relate to him in any sense at all. I wanted to smack the kid.The book uses simple syntax and is relatively easy to read, yet it took me twice as long to finish as most books because I could only take bits of it at a time. The only reason I finished was because I was hoping it would get better - I was wrong. The only thing worse than the lack of a protagonist is the ending that tried to be dramatic, but fell flat.I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A window into an autistic mind that leaves you exhausted and bored!","review":"I bought the book based on the recommendations of friends and family. After reading the many positive reviews, I decided to finaly start reading it. I honestly have to say I was very disappointed. While I rarely disagree with Amazon's readers, I have to say this book barely ranks a 2 star. Its an excellent window into an autistic mind if thats what you're looking for, but as a causual read, the author goes off on too many tangents unrelated to the plot. The characters are shallow, and the events that transpire are hardly exciting. It left me exhausted from the constant shifting of subjects, and irrelevant paragraphs. I am utterly surprised at the significant positive feedback this book has received. I dont recommend this book unless you have a vested interest in autism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put me to Sleep","review":"Everything about this book drove me crazy. It was dry for me and Yes it did put me to sleep. It's the only book i've ever read where i had to put it down not wanting to finish. I did manage to finish it though and i have to say it was one of the worst books i've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully boring, mildly annoying, and empty.","review":"I had to force myself to finish this book. I'm not at all certain what Haddon was trying to do with this story or this main character. I felt as though the story was told by an annoying, whiny, 10-year-old. I've not had experience with autistic children, but this cannot be the best example. Think Kevin from Parenthood crying over his lost retainer and this about sums up the main character, Christopher-- with one exception: unlike Kevin, Christopher is a math genius. The best parts of the book were the various references to math and logic problems (e.g., reference to Marilyn Vos Savant's column in Parade magazine explaining The Monty Hall Problem), and I'd rather get those from a math and logic game book. In the end, I did not care about Christopher, the dead dog, Toby (Christopher's pet rat), his mother, his father, or any of the other empty characters. Blah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i know..i know","review":"i know that having a 4.5 stars from 1033 customers will make my review outcasted..but honestly...i found nothing \\"wow\\" about this book...the writer has been around autistic kids and knows how they act and react...so he just describes that...From the book, you can learn about what is like being \\"autistic\\"..so..if i am interested in that..i will go and buy a scientific book.."},{"rating":"2","title":"autism for everyone","review":"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a great read, an empathetic look at autism, and a more-true-than-not representation of the complexity and unpredictability of family life. It just isn't a great novel. For all the attention paid to the workings of Christopher Boone's consciousness, the book remains more pretified documentary than literary creation. The maths and Sherlock Holmes references are a case in point. They provide a lively backdrop and interesting reading material, but they never seem to gell into a new force for Christopher--they never progress beyond the interesting behavior stage into something larger, something that truly changes Christopher's life and our own. So although the novel isn't heavy or moralistic; neither does it ever go beyond satisfying storytelling. Don't get me wrong; I couldn't stop reading. It's just that somehow, what i was reading never seemed to add up to something more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As much as my friends bragged up this book, I was really expecting something great and deep. Unfortunately, I found the main character more annoying than endearing. While I appreciate what the author was trying to do, I felt like the themes were being spoon-fed to me rather than being presented in an easy to understand way. I tried really hard to like it, and I understand the innovation of the entire story, but I found it more painful than compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like 'Dick and Jane' you'll love this.","review":"Maybe this is exactly how a boy with Asperger's syndrome would think and write (I admit, I have no idea), but this book was a little too easy to read. The story is pretty good, and telling the story in the boy's words is clever, but I got a little tired of it before I reached the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This is the most modiocre book ever written. It does nothing for the reader. If you have a couple of hours to waste, pick up this boring mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality book with a refreshing plot.","review":"When I first picked up the book \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" I was expecting a novel involving some suburban wife and her affair. I was pleasantly surprised when there was hardly a mention of a middle aged housewife and her troubles and tribulations. Instead I got a wonderfully written novel about the world of an autistic boy named Christopher Boone. Though this book has the basis of a coming-of-age story, it is told in a refreshing new set of eyes where the boy is not miserable and locked away but simply different. I personally am tired of the underdog story laden down with a heavy coat of depression so this was a cheery alternative with the same idea all the while though making me think about my own logic. I highly recommend this novel if your in the mood for a nice, uplifting paperback with a bit of a twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"very curious indeed!","review":"As the other amazon.com reviewers have glowingly commented, 'The Curious Incident...' is really a unique reading experience. Any book which is written in the first person, narrated by a teenager, a teenager with autism no less, has to be considered special. Fortunately the author treats this young man and his long-suffering parents with dignity. It never degrades to a tear-jerker, nor does the author resort to sterotypes.As for the story, well ... the title says it all. It is simply about a very bizarre incident in the life of this autistic young man and how he responds to it. It's equally humorous, sad and touching.Bottom line: the sort of book you'd loan to your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A curious little adventure","review":"I read this book along with a few others I'd been hearing about, and I want to say that though I enjoyed Christopher's tale, and his strange world, and his unusual charm, I can't see why all the fuss...It's a good story for what it is, but it certainly didn't seem great to me.I gave it a high rating because I felt I learned a few things about autism and how those who are identified as such see the world around them. I also enjoyed the scenes with his father--and the way they expressed affection. All of this was eye-opening to me and for that, I can say I learned something new (and I'm all of 52 years old!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting idea, well executed; uplifting for autistic parents and kids","review":"A first person narrative from the perspective of an autistic savant, this is a fine book. Successful on most levels and a satisfying read, it's well worth reading for anyone who knows autistic kids or parents, and these days that's a lot of people.I found parts of it quite moving, and parts quite depressing...but realistic depictions of daily British city life will do that. Haddon paints a solid portrait of our unlikely hero and it's hard not to end up loving the kid a whole bunch.A quick and enjoyable read with layers of emotional depth; well worth sharing with your adolescent kids. It's never too early to help them accept all types of people and all levels of intellectual ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thoughtful","review":"I have never really had any opportunity to interact with individuals afflicted with this unusual and often debilitating ailment. Mark Haddon's real-life experience with autistic children allowed him to craft this masterpiece by providing the perspective of a young autistic teenager's mind. Christopher's why of thinking - and consequently, his actions - make logical sense, but because he lacks a normal person's ability to make intuitive connections or understand the unspoken, Christopher has to rely on the imperfect set of rules he's learned about human behavior. Haddon is a subtle and sensitive writer, leaving it to us to draw the conclusions that Christopher can't.This is a book that I highly recommend to everybody - it is not only an interesting read, but also a great learning experience. Another great book (actually a series of books) that I liked for its educational values is \\"Why Some Cats are Rascals, Book 1\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Conan Doyle First .","review":"If you decide to read this book, it is a good idea to read the story by Conan Doyle, mentioned by Christopher, first.'Curious Incident' is not just a clever first-person narrative from the point of view of an autistic kid, it is also a clever reworking of Doyle's story, which makes it the more meaningful. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"This was a very good book and an easy read. The author did a wonderful job of bringing us into the world and mind of a young boy with autism."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Curious Incident of a Dog in the Night-Time","review":"The Curious Incident of a Dog in The Night-Time Vintage Books, a division of Mark Haddon Random House Inc., 2003, $12.95, ISBN: 1-4000-3271-7I find people confusing. This is for two main reasons. The first is that people do a lot of talking without using any words. (pg. 14)Christopher Boone thinks differently than most of us because he is autistic. Christopher grew up happily with his father and mother until she mysteriously passed away. At his school for kids with special needs, Christopher loves math. He hopes that one day his math skills will allow him to get into a \\"normal\\" school. Christopher's friend and teacher ,Sioban, helps him write about the murder of his neighbor's"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Autistic Brain","review":"Having worked with autistic children I was intriqued by the character of Christopher. Christopher's behavior, the pace of the story, the language the author chooses to show Christopher's perseveration as well as his tenacity to make something right all fit with the experiences I have had with autistic children. Christopher is likeable and the story is both charming and touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"An odd read","review":"Hard to say. This book is an odd read. It is certainly light reading, and faxcinating in it's perspective. The most interesting part of the read is living the part of the autistic youngster and seeing and feeling the world through his senses.This book is one you need to be in the right mood for. The first time I picked it up, I read 40 pages and was tempted to junk it. A month later, I picked it up and found it engrossing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting enough plot, but Christopher = TERRIBLE","review":"The first 100 pages or so was quite interesting and I was glued to this novel. By the time Christopher feared his father though, it was as if the novel did a total 360 turn; it became quite difficult to get through the pages and I found myself skimming through the rest of the book. Christopher's character became very annoying and unlikeable to me, for he was obviously selfish, cold, and detached from the attempts of both parents to reach out to him. I found myself sympathizing with his mother, since it becomes obvious that Christopher is quite a handful."},{"rating":"2","title":"personable guide to autism","review":"Christopher Boone would not be an easy person to know except through Haddon's book. Scared of hugs and people asking questions, Christopher braves the unknown world of across the street, the train station waiting room, and the open streets of London at night in pursuit of the truth of who murdered his neighbor's dog, and coping with the consequences of finding out.This is the kind of book that gets passed hand to hand and enjoyed by all. Clever, surprising, remarkable, insightful, and probably best for middle school and above, it's both meaningful and enjoyable on every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time","review":"I disagree with some of the reviewers who stated it was strange to read from the point of view of an autistic teenager. Although it was 'different' I wouldn't necessarily call it strange. I really enjoyed this novel and could barely put it down. It made me laugh and also feel for the character. I like how the book incorporated different situations. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is where the clockwork grows","review":"A stunning masterpiece. Takes you inside an Autistic child's mind. In fact, it makes the world new again.Read this book if you have ever read a book and enjoyed the experience. Because. This is where the clockwork grows."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written story about a dead dog","review":"This book was definitely not what I expected.I didn't know I was about to read Christopher's (a 15 year of boy with autism) story.That being said we follow Christopher on his adventure as he tries to figure out who killed the neighbors dog. The book is written from his point of view and seems very simplistic but helps greatly with character development. Although Christopher lacks basic \\"emotions\\", the book allows the reader to feel the emotions for him, and it works quite well. The book has many heartfelt moments and a few good twists.Christopher is very good at 'maths' and includes diagrams and mathematical examples throughout his book. Some of which are quite interesting.All in all an entertaining quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall, but I expected more","review":"As a novel from the point of view of an autistic child, \\"Curious Incident\\" is an ambitious attempt, but in the end, it left me curiously unsatisfied. The autistic point of view didn't \\"feel\\" completely true to me (though I don't pretend to have any special knowledge of its effects; I'm just speaking literarily). It seemed a bit consciously gimmicky. But overall, it was good. Just not quite a top-tier effort. Worth reading, but probably not worth re-reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Three People Tell You You're Dead","review":"... the least you can do is lie down. And when hundreds of reviewers tell you this is a great book, that should tell you something (and when the occasional negative reviewer sounds like an eight year old, maybe that should as well...). I couldn't put it down, and immediately started reading passages to my partner and urging my friends to read it. One blurb on my copy compared it to Catcher in the Rye and The Sound and the Fury. Well, much more the former than the latter. I'm neither autistic nor an expert on that subject, but I found the novel's observations about human psychology fascinating regardless. And it's very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great perspective","review":"It took me a little while to get used to the perspective in the book. As is obvious from the many reviews, the narrator is an autistic boy. Sometimes, however, I feel that his level of autism changes as he describes different things, but I'm hardly an expert on the book and this does not factor into my rating. I give it four stars because, to me, it has an average story written from a unique perspective. It is certainly a worthwhile read as it doesn't take long to go from cover-to-cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel by Mark Haddon","review":"It is a great, well written book that can be an inspriration to others.

Late one night, he encounters his neighbour\`s poodle, Wellington, viciously pierced through the heart. But Wellington\`s garden owner has already witnessed Boone fumbling with the catatonic creature and, consequently, he finds hiself in remission. Following his dreadful night in jail, he sets out on a mission to discover the culprit. However, Boone\`s social worker, Soiabhan, floods belief into his veins, with the result of a hastily whipped-together diagram of notes and answers.

Please ignore this book at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was surprised","review":"I first saw this book on the Today Show. The author has written several children's books, and this has been promoted as funny. I purchased it on audio cassette because I like to \\"read\\" in the car. The first couple of minutes were entertaining and funny. Some of the observations were just my kind of humor, and I was feeling very pleased with myself for ordering this. Then, to my surprised, I heard the F*** word. I thought that I had mis-heard, but a few seconds later, there it was again. I realize that this is acceptable practice in literature, but I personally do not listen to this sort of language by choice. I can't return the cassettes because they have been opened, but would not have ordered if there had been anything in the promo about the language.

Christopher holds an incredible amount of facts in his brain, which sometimes gets overloaded like a computer and crashes. To relieve this feeling he has a compulsion to count, do quadratic equations and sometimes groan.A truly unbelievable plot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but flat portrayal ...","review":"Being a parent of an \\"Aspie\\" being married to an \\"Aspie\\" and having \\"Aspie\\" traits myself, it was obvious to me that the book was written by an observer of Asperger's Syndrome/Autism. The book was a great observation but failed to present the rich inner life of an \\"Aspie\\" ... The main character's inner life was presented as being as flat as his voice where in truth it is very likely it is rich with imagery ... maybe even too much and confusing imagery. Communication is the problem ... not the mind's ability to create."},{"rating":"1","title":"started out great and but didn't finish well..","review":"The first 150 pages of this book where great. The story was interesting, smart and funny. The last 100 pages went downhill for me. It seemed to drag from that point forward - you didn't learn any new about the main character and it seemed to get lost in the details of science and math."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"That book is the tale of a young boy, Christopher who suffers Dawn syndrome. I heard somebody talking about the story telled in this book is false as Asprenger syndrom doesn't produce such behaviour as the ones described in the book. But I think that's not the point. Mark Haddon gives us the portrayal of a \\"not normal\\" boy, of his ideas and links and connections he makes among them. The author writed the book as though it is written by Christopher. He tells about him discovering his courage by making a journey we would say incredibly easy, but wich is incredibly hard and scary for him.I definetly suggest this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Poor Taste","review":"I'm surprised by the glowing reviews this book got. I really thought it was a terrible diservice to \\"aspie\\" people. The boy seems to not care about anyone and the adults in this book are all totally screwed up. I don't like the connection that people are bound to make that the parents of children with autism can't handle the complex life they have been given. While well written in a literary sense, this book leaves you sad and feeling as though people are truly pathetic. Not a good read at all and not at all a true vision of what autism really looks like."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night Time","review":"I didnt' really enjoy this novel. I liked the writing style, but I didn't like the story. I like reading classic books or plays. I don't like reading about kids with personal problems unless there is a lesson involed in it. Christopher Boone was a very spastic thinker and it was very hard to connect with the character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Since the book is about a 15-year-old, I thought it might make a great Christmas gift for a 15-year-old relative, so I bought the book and decided to read it first. I'm glad I did. This book reminds us how adults in the community can be so flippant with the use of profanity in front of children. The story puts Christopher in contact with a number of adults who use profanity while speaking to him, and I found that to be an inappropriate message for me to give to a young relative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started Out Interesting, but....","review":"Started out interesting and kept my attention but then got really long and tedious. About mid-way the book lost my interest and got really, really boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Runs Out of Gas Before the End","review":"This is, for the most part, a daring and successful attempt at writing a story from the perspective of a 15 year old autistic boy. The first two-thirds of the book are fantastic, and the reader comes to care for Christopher and his quest. However, the last third of the novel peters out and becomes predictable and even a little flat; but Haddon deserves four stars for a generally wonderful story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing...","review":"I had really high hopes for this book after reading the many online and print reviews. I've heard from numerous people who loved this book. I just don't happen to be one of them, I guess.Ultimately, I do not find Christopher to be a sympathetic character, and the writing style, told first-person from Christopher's POV, is highly irritating. Almost all of the sentences start with the word \\"And,\\" and it is normal for a sentence to actually be a series of sentences, strung into a very long paragraph that I suppose is meant to represent Christopher's speaking style. I will still admit that I read this book very quickly, and I was extremely interested in finding out what happened. However, I can't say I enjoyed this book. It irritated me far more than it entertained me. I suppose I should have given Christopher a greater leeway since he is autistic, but I just couldn't muster up enough sympathy for Christopher."},{"rating":"1","title":"no way","review":"don't believe the hype. this book is overrated at best, a exploitative and stereotypical cliche at worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"no need for the language!!!","review":"Right when i opened the book I saw the f word twice on the second page! Everytime I would turn the page there was a cuss word on almost every page! It is not necessary to use that language in this book.

Don't read this book expecting it to be cute and fun and clean!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simple","review":"The writing style is just too simple. Like, take this passage for example: \\"The dog was dead. There was a garden fork sticking out of the dog.

Her doctors always said she had 'autistic-like behaviors'.....after reading this book, I can safely say that my sister is most likely autistic. She has the exact same characteristics/idiosynchrosies as the main character. It was very educational and informative. I recommend this to everyone because, not only will it be interesting to discover what autism is like, it will open people's minds and hopefully allow people to have more patience with autistic people. Excellent-read it in a day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big let-down","review":"The number one thing I look for in a book is good writing. Sorry, but you will not find that in \\"The Curious Incident...\\". Of course, that is to an extent deliberate - the author is assuming the voice of a young man with Asperger's Syndrome. But the repetitive, flat, emotionless style drove me mad after the first 50 pages and there weren't enough compensations in the \\"mystery\\" plot - soon solved and forgotten about, or the adult characters - unlikeable and implausible - to keep me going. I borrowed this book from someone at work. They will probably think me cold and heartless for not liking it. Oh, well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most people seem to love this book..","review":"..but I didn't like it at all. I only finished this book because it was so short. The robot-like personalities of autistic people translate well on screen, but not in print. The story was boring and wooden and I felt no attachment at all to any of the characters. So many times I read a book, love it, and then see that someone gave it a terrible review. \\"How could they?\\", I think to myself. Now I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous","review":"The beginning of this book had a \\"grab you\\" moment, and that was the end of the interest. I had chosen this book for my book club without having read it beforehand and concensus among my fellow readers ... worst book read by our club. We all agreed that to live a life with aspergers, autism, etc. is extremely difficult for everyone involved. The book did give you a good incite into what goes on in the mind of someone afflicted, but there wasn't any cohesive plot to follow to make it interesting. We all felt that due to the lack of a good story, it made this book very monotonous. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"In The End, Just Boring","review":"Alas, I read the 52 or so pages of the excerpt with breathless excitement. However, after buying the book, it began to be a real slog to read it, mainly because of all of the irrelevant \\"autistic atmosphere\\" that the author felt compelled to continue to blast out in giant clouds throughout the entire store. I eventually realized that there was no story, and was a little sorry to see a book that started so promisingly spend its last fifty pages just choking out in the sand, like a river never reaching the sea."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unusual and striking first novel","review":"In addition to all the other unusual aspects of this novel, it's also worth noting that it is in some ways a postmodern, self-referential novel. The 15-year-old boy who is the protagonist and the first-person \\"author\\" refers from time to time to the fact that he is writing a novel -- i.e., this novel, and to Siobhan's encouraging words to him regarding his writing project. He demurs that he has no sense of humor so that the book cannot be funny. Of course, the irony is that it is funny in its own self-referential way.I felt that the book trailed off at the end and became less interesting. Still, this is a memorable novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Childhood!","review":"This Alice-type story was recommended by a friend and I'm glad that it was.

The story quickly engrosses you and the thought processes of the author writing assomeone with autism is so very interesting, informative, and even a teaching experience. I did think the end was a little too quick and maybe out of character but stillworth the read. I was so enthusiastic about this book that I purchased three more from Amazon for my adult children to read and pass along to their friends, also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic writing","review":"I got this book after I won a contest. I initally thought after reading the title blurb that it would be a boring yarn about an autistic boy and did not read this for about 2 months. Later as I ran out of good books to read , I started reading it & I couldnt put it down. Personally I prefer thrillers and whodunits but this book really hooked me in. The character development is fantastic. The way the book goes on through the perspective of the boy is great. I also read the Rule Of Four which tries to kill time by writing loads of rubbish about the characters. The authors of \\"Rule Of Four\\" should read this book to understand what character development is.This book would make a fantastic movie too. Not a Hallmark channel one but an actual feature film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary and Original","review":"This is a brilliantly conceived, extraordinarily moving, and vividly written novel. The story is told by a fifteen year old autistic savant who is brilliant at math and logic. He resolves to find out who murdered a neighbor's dog and in the process discovers truths about himself and his world. He also uses the skills of Sherlock Holmes, his favorite detective, to unearth clues that the rest of us would overlook. The word \\"novel\\" originally meant new, and this original book is certainly that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves 6, 7 or even 20 stars!!","review":"Everyone in the world should read this book. There are so many Christophers out there struggling to find their way. Maybe this book can make a difference so people can just let them live in peace and achieve their dreams. I am the mother of a 20-yr-old Aspergers son. A brilliant mind seeking each day to simply live in this sometimes difficult world. This book gives a rare, accurate peek into the autistic mind. It is amazingly accurate. Allow yourself the chance to go there.

You may find it utterly simple and a bit annoying at times but this is because the author is so successful. Haddon definitely makes you feel the confusion and disorientation of the main character. It has been a LONG time since I have read something and have felt this close to the narrator. Beyond amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun AND insightful","review":"I don't want to generalize too much, but to me, this book is just about as endearing as the movie Rain Man. Imagine all the pain associated with a divorce, and then try to imagine that from a teenaged autistic perspective! Complex though this may be, the author pulled it off nicely, and with a good bit of humor sprinkled in to carry us through the hard times. Some of the negative reviews on here are both comical and annoying...like the people who say the book is too easy to read, or they don't like the run-on sentences and math problems...and one even admitted that even if a person with autism/Asperger's would think that way, they could care less. Clearly they're the wrong readers for this book and probably shouldn't even be posting a review if they don't want some depth in their reading to begin with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"original!!!!","review":"I could hardly put this down, so engrossed I was in the originality of this book. It was quite unlike anything I have ever read and I enjoyed it immensely. If I had known of the hype surrounding it, I probably would have shied away from it, but I just happened upon it in the bookstore on a sale rack and tossed it in my basket. A very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Very good book, well written. Interesting to see things through the eyes of an autistic child. Quick and easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting at times","review":"The book provided what appeared to me (someone with no special knowledge or experience with autism) to be a realistic portrait of the condition. I did find the writing to be self-conscious in a distracting way: we, as the readers, are so clearly meant to be taken on a journey led by the author. In that way, I was annoyed by the book, because it seemed to be using the naive perspective of the lead character as almost a trick--hiding the ball from the reader. Because of the perspective, the book is limited and cannot really speak to universal truths. It is more like a parlor trick. There is value in sharing the perspective of autism with the general population, and I don't mean to belittle that, but it's almost like this book wants to define autism for the reader and give pat insights into the experience of autism that can be used by the reader to feel like they have contained and comprehended what is certainly a complex and, in many ways, unfathomable condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"One mom's perspective","review":"As the mother of an autistic three-year-old daughter, I was apprehensive to read this novel. However, despite the tears, I'm glad I did. Haddon wonderfully captures some of the idiosyncratic behaviors of the autistic, drawing in readers who want to understand what takes place in such minds. The minute details enable the reader to make a personal connection with a narrator who, ironically, cannot make his own personal connections in society. Today 1 out of every 166 babies born will have a form of autism. Hopefully, the popularity of Haddon's tale will create more awareness of the hurdles these children face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I couldn't put this book down. The character of Christopher was so loveable, and yet so frustrating, mirroring what it must be like to care for someone with autism. My heart went out to his mother, unable to hug or comfort her son, and his father, a divorcee grapling with raising an autistic child on his own. The novel is at once heartwarming, laugh-out-loud funny, and sad. This is definitly a must-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting point of view","review":"This book is written from the perspective of Christopher Boone, a 15-year-old autistic boy who lives in England. Author Mark Haddon shows an uncanny knack of getting inside the boy's head and relating things from his black-and-white world. His world must be orderly or Christopher has a hard time functioning. He does advanced math problems in his head in order to calm down in stressful situations. He is presented with a lot of stress when his parents disappoint him, each in a different way. He feels forced to make his way across England on his own to elude perceived danger and he overcomes situations which are fraught with frustration for him. His parents show a lot of compassion at times, but his idiosyncrocies sometimes get the best of them. This is an amazing book, which probably shows the reader more about the way an autistic person thinks than would many textbooks on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book","review":"I though this book was an excellent book. It starts off with a boy, Christopher, and he is autistic. For him to perform a simple task takes a lot of time and energy. He can't be touched and he has to find out how everything is done. He's very intelligent. He knows all the prime numbers up to 7,507 and capitals to countries. The book starts out with him finding a neighbor's dog killed. He gets so upset about the whole situation and wants to find out who had done it. To become a \\"detective\\" Christopher has to overcome his autism to communicate with people and find out the mystery. He keeps a journal and writes down everything that he thinks about. The book is written from his point of view. You experience all of his thoughts and theories. The book will have you thinking and reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"normal = not smart ?","review":"I'm a ESL school student and this book is my reading class's textbook. I'm so glad I had a chance to understand autistic people's thinking. It's a very amazing experience. This book is so special, and so interesting. If you didn't read this book yet, you have to try. You'll like it. (^ ^..)I think the \\"normal\\" means \\"not smart\\".

I found it for 25 cents in a resale shop. I'd never heard of it, but it sounded interesting, so I bought it. What a revelation! What an astounding work. I've given away ten copies or more since reading it. It's one of those books that, while you're reading it, it makes you look at the world as with new eyes. Everything you see and everyone you meet seems new and amazing. This is a remarkable book. Read it and give it to everyone you love who loves to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read with lasting depth","review":"A quick read, this is a fascinating look into the mind of a boy with autism. Because it is written from the perspective of the autistic 15-year-old, we are able to imagine what it would be like to view the world from an autistic perspective. Christopher is hyper-sensitive, emotionally untouchable, mathematically bright and inquisitive, yet lovable. This book has depth that lasts far beyond the reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern Literature Is Rubbish","review":"This book is not original. It is not particularily moving. It is not innovative, and it is most certainly not thought-provoking. The New York Time's glowing review compares it to \\"The Sound and the Fury,\\" but where Faulkner's masterpiece uses mental disability to comment on the Southern lifestyle and the human condition, Haddon's novel merely declares the typical message that \\"being autistic is tough, but in the end things can turn out okay.\\" When I finished this book, I didn't have to sit and think about it; it had little more heft than a typical Mitch Albom story. In addition to its thematic mundanity, \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" overuses its quirky devices, contradicts its narrative style, ruins the plot of \\"The Hound of the Baskerviles,\\" and inaccurately explains the Monty Hall Problem. Literature is all but dead, and praise of books like this is dragging it even further away from redemption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery & Comedy","review":"Dead dog and an austitic boy.

I never thought about yellow being such an obnoxious color before. It's interesting to experience the world as seen by a child who's mind is wired differently from most. The combination of the pragmatism of the hero and his unwitting solution to his family's problems make this story unusually simple on the outside and complex on the inside. It was a pleasurable reading experience, not unlike \\"A Girl Named Zippy\\". Perhaps unfairly I compare The Curious Incident to \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". With such a lofty benchmark, 4 stars is pretty high praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing the world through a different pair of eyes","review":"By examining the subjects' thought processes, good literature can bring understanding and empathy for others. Mark Haddon writes this book in the 1st person as if the author were an autistic teenager. By doing so, he brings understanding to behaviors that might otherwise seem bizarre and frustrating.

Really enjoyed the first part of the book, how the author gets inside the mind of an autistic child- perceptive, concrete thinking, obsessive-compulsive, number-oriented. I've never read anything like this before.For some reason, I abandoned this book 70 pages from the finish line. I put it down for a little while, then just completely lost interest in it. It was a good book, but there was nothing in it which compelled me to complete it.

I found it to be sweet, engaging and drew me in within a few pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very different and amusing read, but.......","review":"There are several dozen excellent reviews here, so I'll try to be brief. This is a VERY different read. The author has written the main character as an autistic boy and, through the mind of this boy, can expound on things that might otherwise be considered controversial or at least unconvetional. This was very refreshing. The author draws you in with what appears to be a straightfarward, even predictable, plot. It's also a little amusing that the main character describes things like \\"red herring\\" just as the author is about to throw you one. But the last quarter of the book simply doesn't bring closure and what it does bring is a little disturbing and unsatisfying. Either the author is already planning a sequel, or he had a very hard time thinking up the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting look from a different point of view","review":"The look inside the mind of an autistic teenager and how he reacts to the world around him as well as a realistic approach to the ways others react to that character makes for a fascinating and fun read.I read this while on vacation and highly recommend it as something you can easily escape for a few hours.

Christopher possesses a combination of the Rainman's gifted mind and the simple nature of Forest Gump.Christopher is not stupid, he has worked out all the prime numbers to far greater degree than most people care about, yet he has difficulty determining if a question is serious or rhethorical.The book begins as Christopher comes upon a neighbor's murdered dog one evening, and the adventure takes off from there.

I have read and listened to it using both mediums and have gained information and appreciation of this condition. The audio version is specially well done. Such readings add a dimension that brings the characters and situations even closer than does the reading but the reader requires very special skills, which this audio version offers.I found the audio version through Amazon which connected me to the individual that was selling the product as used. The entire transaction went well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"great book. i really loved how Haddon made this book from Christopher's point of view. This book had made me look at children with \\"Special Needs\\" a lot differently"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully done","review":"Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is an amazing book. The diary quality of writing was refreshing and easy to read, but definitely not poorly written.I was able to relate to Christopher as my brother has a mild case of autism, and reading through a different thought pattern was very interesting. Haddon pulled off the boy very well. Christopher did not seem fake or contrived in any way. Haddon created a very real and thoughtful character that everyone can relate to.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone. Seeing the world through the eyes of someone different is something that everyone should try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful AP Read","review":"Writing from the point of view of an autistic 15-year-old named Christopher, Mark Haddon introduces the read to the chaotic world of autism. In the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, we see what it is like to live a life with no filters to eliminate or order the millions of pieces of information that come to us everyday. As the reader, you will experience Christopher's ups and downs and his trials and successes. This book broadens the readers perspective while allowing them to gain knowledge.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something different. It is very humorous yet somewhat heartbreaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky Book Leaves Plot Wanting","review":"Dont get me wrong, i liked the book. I mean i didnt looove it, but it was weird enough to hold my attention for the duration. I liked the tiny diagrams and pictures aiding in obscure descriptions. I liked the off beat characters. And I especially liked, maybe loved (but dont push it), the first fifty pages. Nevertheless, I HATED THE ENDING. A book should end with some finality. Nothing less than genocide, nuclear winter or buddha like enlightenment. Perhaps the dog really died of boredom?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better on my iPod","review":"This is an extraordinary book, and I believe that listening to it was even better than reading it. The \\"voice\\" of Christopher Boone provided nuance and clarity better than the written word could have done. His efforts to deal with a world he didn't understand were creative and even brilliant.It wouldn't matter to me if Christopher's behavior were \\"authentically\\" autistic or not. This is fiction. And it is credible, stimulating and well done. I hope to hear more about Christopher in a future book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Reality","review":"You'll either love it and can't put it down, or hate it and attribute it to poor authorship, as reflected by the other ratings and reviews. I'm in the former camp. It is understandable that some won't like it because the book doesn't follow it's own plot. The harshest critics of this book are people who are biased by a lack of knowledge about autism. For example, people who point out that the main character has inconsistent emotions don't understand that autistic peoples' emotions can fluxuate according to varying blood chemistry. Since 85% of all autistics are under the age of 18, people need to begin to take out the time to understand autism better, and this is an easy way to start. (I have one boy with full-blown autism and one boy with asperger's so it was forced rudely upon me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fasinating perspective","review":"I read this book for a course in special education. I sat down one Saturday to get started on it, and before I knew it I had read the whole thing! The story is in the first person as told by a young autistic boy. It's a fascinating (and from what I understand, authentic) view of the world from an autistic child's perspective providing vast insights to how these children process information and interact with their world. An absolute must-read for special education majors and family members of autistic children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I was browing the bookshelves, killing time before I had to be to class, when I came across this book. I read the first three chapters before I saw that I had to head out, but I wanted to keep going, so I bought it.The book starts out very well, but the end isn't as good at the beginning. It's still a good ending, but it just kind of drags a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific debut!","review":"\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time,\\" is a terrific debut novel! I was impressed at how well this new writer did with this unusual story. I was hooked from the beginning and the plot held my attention throughout! Very entertaining and well-worth the read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well executed, unsettling and often unpleasant","review":"Mark Haddon has been justly praised from the hilltops for his evocation of an autistic savant's world, and his writing and plotting are expert. He also does an excellent job in getting the reader to empathize with a fundamentally unsympathetic character--even though I found myself often frustrated and annoyed with Chris in tandem with his fictional caregivers. Not recommended for anyone unsure about having kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different perspective","review":"Book written from the perspective of an autistic teenager. I gave it to my niece who is studying to be a special ed teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice--bad book","review":"I'm still scratching my head over this one. The writing is lovely, and the autistic narrator's voice is fresh, believable, engaging. So why squander such a fully realized voice in a tired minimal plot populated by poorly drawn characters? The father, for instance, is key here, but all the author can think of for him to say is variations on, \\"Oh, [fill in expletive], Christopher.\\" The mother and neighbors are also ciphers....and don't tell me this is because of the narrator's unreliable perceptions. Banal dialogue is banal dialogue whether or not it's being rendered by an unreliable narrator. Basically, this novel is a case of an author putting a huge amount of work into creating one fine character and his unique voice, and then deciding he didn't need to do any work on other parts of the book. And the voice is done so well, it's almost worth reading. Almost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic ending","review":"Maybe because I'm Asperger's I don't see why everyone thinks it was so clever to write this from the persepective of an autistic boy. Duh. Has this seriously never been done before? Additionally, after putting so much effort into the rest of the book, I couldn't believe the tacked-on, contrived ending. It seemed like he got three-quarters of the way through and then got stuck and just wanted to finish it up any way he could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really curious about why everyone else loved it....","review":"This book was highly recommended but I truly don't understand why. At best it's a quirky read, at worst it's tedious and predictable. Sorry but I just really found it to be a waste of time...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic story with humor and suspense, from the point of view of an autistic child","review":"You have to wonder how the author of this book is not autistic himself. I guess he has had enough experience around autistic children to understand well what's in their heads. As a mom of an autistc toddler it was a great insight of how they break things down in this world and I think it will help me help her. As a plain reader, this was just a great story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second reading brings new pleasures","review":"On my second reading of this book I enjoyed Christopher's journey in a different way. I guess knowing the mystery (or mysteries) surrounding the 'curious incident' allowed me to experience a bit more of a bittersweet reading of the story.I also think I've matured a bit as a reader in the five years or so since I read this last time, so I enjoyed the way Haddon uses Christopher to position the reader too - he reveals much more than is immediately realised, and even though Christopher cannot really understand other people, we, as the reader, can.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fictional, but good study of what autism looks like.","review":"The title is odd and gives no indication of the book's content. The book was recommended to me and I was pleasantly surprised. It is told from the viewpoint of a child with autism, with him discussing various things that happen in his life. The book offers excellent insight into how an autistic child may think. There is tremendous variety in how children on the autism spectrum present, but the book is an accurate reflection of some things that may be expected from children with this diagnosis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Family Audiobook","review":"We took this book in audio format on a summer vacation road trip. Not only did it keep mom the driver awake, but the preteen/teenage kids and dad also loved the story. We still make reference to some of the lines from the book a month afterwards. Definitely a great book, and one that is appropriate for mixed ages (due to censorship/parental tyranny we had to can our other audiobook, Dress Your Family in Denim and Corduroy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great fiction!","review":"Need some insight on the autistic mind but want to read fiction vs. medical/psychological text? This is for you. It is a wonderful read with a great insiders view of an autistic boy grappling with some tough issues. Special thanks to Mark Haddon for writing this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Original Voice","review":"Like many other readers, I thought the genius and originality of this book was in the narrator's voice. Christopher is an autistic, mathmatical genius who one day discovers his neighbors dog killed.His search to discover who the killer is leads him to some unexpected discoveries about his Mother's death years before.Told in almost a stream of consciousness devoid of emotion and feeling the book still manages to be both very funny and moving at the same time. Christopher's detached observations really convey what it must be like to have a constant swarm of thoughts and ideas bouncing through your head.It's a literary device that makes for a distinct and memorable character, and book."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome read","review":"i had to read this book for school. At first i didn't know what to think of it but, i started to get into it and couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't like it","review":"I finally decided to purchase this book after all the great reviews i read. Sadly, I was left disappointed after reading the final page. This was not a great book, at best it was an interesting story with a few gems of knowledge. Overall, I give this book 2 Amazon Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Okay, am I the only person who disliked this book? Yes, I understand the \\"perspective\\" but I found it boring and tedious as heck. Quite frankly, I didn't want nor need to know how Christopher solved all the Maths. It was a major disappointment - thank heaven, it was short!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting way to write a book","review":"The book is written from the eyes of an autistic child. I find it an innovative point of view, but it gets old quickly since he blabbers on about insignificant details. I understand this is probably how a real autistic person thinks, but maybe he could have skipped a lot of the rambling details and gave it mre of a story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant!","review":"Wow, Wow, Wow is all I can say about this book. I decided to read it when I saw it was popular on amazon; and this book should be popular, it is amazing! I was taken into Christopher's life as if I was actually living it along with him! It was brilliant writing and was very accurate. Each step I took with Christopher was one that made me think and analyze the way life is. It was a book that I have been talking highly of to everyone I know. It is an amazing read and one that I feel everyone should attempt because I know once you get into the first few pages you will be hooked and won't be able to put the book down until you are done! If you like books that are well written and have a plot and story this book is for you it has the whole package one would want in a book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly different","review":"I enjoyed this book throughly and managed to read this in one day. It is a refreshing look at autism through the mind of someone who is autistic. Each chapter is numbered by prime numbers (because the boy is fascinated with these numbers) and many of the pages contain pictures that describe word problems or they contain mathmatical problems that he explains the answers to. The language is very simple and although the language and dialogue are simple it still manages to have a few twists that you weren't expecting. I would highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT'S THE POINT?","review":"SLIGHTLY INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE FROM A YOUNG BOY'S VIEW, BUT AT THE END I WAS LEFT FEELING THAT I'D WASTED 2 DAYS OF FREE-TIME & AM STILL WONDERING WHY THIS WAS GIVING SUCH HIGH REVIEWS..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the Hype","review":"This book STUNK. I will have to admit, that the writer did an amazing job depicting life from the point of view of an autistic child. that is the only reason that I kept reading after the first 3 pages. It was sadly predictable from the opening lines, where you could guess everything that was going to happen. Essentially, don't waste your time unless you are interested in living with autism. Wait a minute, strike that. Go read Faulker."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's politically correct to like this book","review":"I read about a novel a week, so I of course read this book. I did not see what all the excitement was about. It is one of those books we are supposed to like because it is about an autistic person, or writen by an African-American, or about homosexuals. There are many good books in these genres, but this I feel is not one of them. But we are supposed to like it because it is about an autistic person and if we didn't like it we would then be looked upon as being narrow-minded and small. A spade is a spade in my book regardless of what it is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time","review":"I couldn't get into this book at all and stopped reading after the first chapter. A friend, who shares similar interests in reading as me, loved it. Go figure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for Adults not for Children or Autistic Children","review":"I did not like this book due to its' content and plot.This book is not appropriate reading for grade school children, or to Autistic children by their teacher. Inappropriate language used.Unfortunatly an Autistic child cannot always seperate the real life situation from a fictional story situation presented in this book.This book can make it worse for a family dealing with their Autistic child. This book is Adult reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy for children","review":"It was a good book about how smart someone with autism could be.I however think it wasn't good to be called a Childrens book. The f-word was used again and again. There were blashphemys and graphic depictions of being in the bathroom.I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore others..","review":"This book was horrible, unless you enjoy reading something which sounds like an eight year-old wrote it. The story is flat, and seems to go nowhere. The worst was the vocabulary [or lack thereof], which, although appropriate to the narrator's mindset, is almost painful to sit through. I persisted only because I had some bleak hope that the ending might be what everyone loved about the book, but I was disappointed in that as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was OK","review":"I found this book to be odd and not very interesting. It is written in the first person as a 15 year old boy with autism. This was believeable. As a person with very little time to read, I would not have choosen this book (it was chosen as the first book for a new book club). It was a fairly quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"undoubtedly the worst book i've read in years","review":"Not only was this book written in such a way as to make you want to slit your wrists with boredom, but even the storyline was ridiculous and tedious. If I hadn't read this book in my Kindle, I would have thrown it across the room. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"years on I still cringe when I see this cover","review":"Don't read this if you have an autistic child. Amazon, stop \\"recommending\\" it to me, for the love of Pete."},{"rating":"1","title":"speed read","review":"I can only say thank you to the author for encouraging me to learn on my own how to speed read my way through this. Having paid money for this, I didn't want to just throw it away, but wanted to somehow get through it.Poorly done. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artistic? More like Autistic...","review":"While in college, I also worked with children with Autistism. This review is by no means intended to offend the Autistic community. I understand what the author is trying to accomplish with this book (to obviously be unique in a competative world of thousands of writers), but this is not what I define art and literature to be. The story on its own could definitely be beautiful, but why fill it with rubbish (i.e., pages and pages of drawings, maps, math equations, etc.) to try to be different? In my opinion, it's easier to write like Haddon does- it's more difficult to write with a subtle beauty. Most importantly, great art can withstand time. Do you honestly think this pop-novel will be read a hundred years from now?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting topic, but not the most satisfying read","review":"It seems like a novel that's popular because of its strange narrative style and its large number of random facts. Although its interesting to see the potential perspective of an autistic child, it's painful to see how much discomfort he causes to his parents, and from his point of view he isn't seeing their discomfort and trying to amend the situation. It's very difficult to enjoy a novel that's narrated through the eyes of child who is, though understandably so, a selfish person. The author seeks to lower this discomfort by riddling it with so many random facts and pictures, things that serve to make the narrator more amiable. The author tries to make a small adventure look paramount, and it doesn't convince me. A cute book, but not that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn, and Double Yawn","review":"What a lot of hype for a dreadfully boring book. I have never skipped over so much of a novel in an attempt to get to the \\"good part.\\" The illustrated maps and maths were tedious and the endless, prattling off-plot narration drove me nearly to distraction. If you are lured by the gushing, good reviews of this book, do yourself a favor and check it out from your library before cracking open your wallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different, but painful to read","review":"I have to admit that the book is very different. The funny illustrations throughout the book, and the story being told by an autistic boy. I was intrigued as to who killed the dog, but the answer was given away so quickly in the book. After a few chapters, I find the endless mathematical problems, and the run-on sentences irritating. I find myself skipping paragraphs just to get to the interesting part. I understand that what Christopher did is triamphant to autistic patients everywhere, but I really could care less. Some intersting storylines, but oversall there's really nothing to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it!!!!!","review":"I honestly don't get what all the hoopla is about this book. I read the entire book because I kept thinking it would get better; it didn't. The book wasn't that boring, it was okay. But I kept asking myself over and over \\"Who cares?\\" I just don't understand how the book got to be a \\"national best seller.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a miss","review":"I love when there is much buzz about a book and people say they love it. That is how I stumbled upon such treasures as \\"She's Come Undone\\", \\"In Her Shoes\\", \\"Running with Scissors\\" and \\"I Know This Much is true\\". So I have got to say I am really dissapointed about this book. I bought it this morning as a companion for a hot lazy day at the pool. I am about 100 pages in and there is no point, no story - I do not even feel for the character. All is all a big snooze fest. Give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pointless Read","review":"I thought the angle the author took (writing from the point of view of a young autistic child) was about the only interesting thing I can say for the book. It was very slow and the author threw in so many haphazard facts that were both confusing and somewhat pointless, that by the time I finished the book, I wondered what was the point? I don't know, I expected it to be much better and it was just okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written","review":"Original, entertaining and well worth reading. Haddon captures the pathos of 'Flowers for Algernon', but with more humor and warmth. The book is accessible and funny without losing sensitivity or entertainment value. To maintain the proper tone throughout the length of the book without sacrificing readability or plot is a feat. The book is insightful without being pedantic. While the premise may seem like a writing workshop exercise this story really works and, above all, it is immensely readable. The ending, which some may quibble with, is realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"This book reads like it came from the mind of an recovered Autistic person. Those of us who live with an Autistic or Ausbergers person can indentify with this story and hope that our Autistic was as high functioning as the hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"Mark Haddon is skilled at narrating from the point of view of Christopher, an autistic boy. The story of Christopher's investigation weaves in math and numbers. Personally, I love math, and I finished this book in 2 days during a busy weekend! This book is great for all readers: light and amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rain Man meets Columbo!","review":"A unique and interesting idea for a book - solving the \\"murder\\" of a neighborhood dog from the perspective of a 15-year-old autistic kid. And what an amazing kid he is!! You know kids like this are out there, calculating numbers with such speed and accuracy it's like they have computer in their heads. But now I feel like I got to be inside his head and feel his fears and his child-like expectations of others. In this day of parents pushing kids to the breaking point, it was a good reminder that we should be thankful to have \\"average\\" kids who can play with friends and can give and accept a hug from mom and dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read.","review":"The book is written in a semi-diarist style. The supposed author of the book is a very high-functioning 15 year-old autistic child. We follow him as he tries to find out who killed the neighbours dog. Our hero has an incredible memory for detail, but is unable to empathize or step back from these details and thus handicaps him in daily living. There were some minor inconsistencies in style to enable the story move forward a bit quicker and I thought that the author wrote himself into a corner (to create some suspense) at one point that he did not get out of too convincingly.If you liked this story I would suggest reading Flowers for Algernon."},{"rating":"2","title":"good fun","review":"This was a quick, fun read and an interesting story told by an autistic narrator. I'm a big fan of the TV sitcom The Big Bang Theory and the main character here reminded me a lot of my favorite character Sheldon from the TV show. I also enjoy math and liked when Christopher talked about his math problems. I haven't interacted with autistic people as an adult and it was interesting to see the inner workings of this one example of an autistic mind. I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curious Dog","review":"The book I received was in good shape. It came in a timely manner.

It was okay, but I wouldn't pass it on to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Special trip into the special life of a young boy","review":"\\"The curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\" is on the one hand a funny book by reading the thoughts of the 15 year-old boy Christopher from which point of view the book is written. But on the other hand it is also a book that touches your soul deep inside if you warm up with the main character and read about his problems as an autistic in a world full of social communication.I really enjoyed reading the book from the beginning up to the end.Very good work, Mark Haddon!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Started strong, died quickly","review":"A lot of the reviews here seem to confuse the ability to portray the life of an autistic with the ability to write a compelling novel. I appreciate the skill it took to do the former, but the _story_ itself is weak. Without giving too much away, your average reader should figure the plot out pretty quickly, and the novel becomes a drag soon afterword."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is Great!!!","review":"I just read the first paragraph and I can't stop reading all of it.

Written from the point of view of a teenager, the narrative provides wonderful insight into the cognitive processes of a person with this type of disability. As well as being a compelling detective story, Incident brings home the idea that there are different versions of reality, depending upon who's doing the experiencing. It beautifully illustrated the mutual misunderstanding and frustration that occur whenever \\"ordinary\\" people and \\"special\\" people interact. Curious Incident is both entertaining and eye-opening, characterisics that aren't often encountered within a single novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing Another Perspective","review":"Mark Haddon presents a completely different perspective of the world through Christopher Boone, a brilliant child coping with an undefined learning disability or mental condition. Despite that, Christopher sees and appreciate life's details that we take for granted. Haddon communicates to his reader through Christopher in subtle ways and causes the reader to reflect on life and relationships. A fascinating and easy read that impacts the reader in ways never imagined.

Autism has often been portrayed as a somewhat stange and mysterious condition e.g. Rainman, but this work takes a very down-to-earth yet entertaining approach. By taking the perspective of the autistic cild in the first person it delivers incredible insight into how such people may in fact view the world.

It's for everyday's life of PostgreSQL users, and especially me that's just started to work on this DB. It covers almost everything about this exceptional open-source database. You'll never need another book. However, one thing I think I need more from it is \\"database performance tuning\\" issue. It touches on some of that stuff, but in the real world, if you're running a more or less stressful db, then this issue is critical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacked research","review":"Flipping through the book in a shop, rather than buying and reading it cover to cover, revealing some woeful inadequecies.Most significantly, the section on PL/perl is laughable. The sheer number of mistakes in that part are enough to warrant removal of that bit, and replacing with a new part rather than just fixing the errors.On the basis of that spot analysis, I cannot recommend the book since if they didn't even check that such a simple thing was correct, then how could the rest of the book have fared?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sum profreading mite be a good idea...","review":"As an experienced programmer learning postgresQL, I have not been at all impressed by the number of typos in this book, averaging at least one on each of the pages I have looked at in detail (at least the ones that are not just a virtual cut-and-paste of the online documentation), e.g:eg. pg 245 - should be two single quote characters with raise notice, not one double quotepg 246 - should be returns not returnpg 247 - need an extra end if with the else if, or to use elsif... etc.All seemingly trivial, but could waste lots of time for a novice programmer without ready access to the online documentation. The online documentation at postgresql.com is free and to me seems clear and largely free of typos. It seems to be a book one pays for needs to improve on this to be worth the money, whereas the mistakes in this book make it actually worse.

Edwin Hoyt was simply out of his depth, riddling the text with numerous errors such as \\"50 millimeter machine guns.\\" Lacking knowledgable editing, the book went to press without a firm basis in its core subject: naval aviation.Fortunately, many of the CVE-73/VC-10 team related their personal stories to the author, who recorded sagas that otherwise might have been lost. But for a far, far better treatment of Gambier Bay and the Battle Off Samar, look no farther than James Hornfischer's superb \\"Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"easy, yet thorough read of account of USS Gambier Bay","review":"I just read a copy of this book with a handwritten forward by a naval officer who served on sister-ship USS Nassau. The account of the Gambier Bay is a magnificent account of the construction, training and fighting exploits of the smaller escort-class carriers in the war in the Pacific. Particularly remarkable is the account of the sinking of the Gambier Bay (the only carrier sunk by naval gunfire) and the heroic actions of the crew until being rescued at sea days later.

I found it very effective and well thought out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and extremely practical, engaging written","review":"For years I've been convinced that writing could not be taught, that I would need to simply struggle, incrementally improving my writing. Still, having enjoyed novel after novel of Card's, I bought this book, and had dim hopes of slight improvement. Yet I found myself devouring the piece, realizing exactly where the greatest flaws in my own writing have been and better yet exactly how to fix them. I'm sure I have a long way to go as a writer, but who knew that there was a high speed rail line over such a long stretch of that road? Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much on POV","review":"The book was average. I actually wanted something on POV but Card, although I understand he's a good sci-fi writer, barely touches upon the profound nature of POV which (from a literary POV) can be tricky. The Characters section (most of the book) went over all the obvious stuff. Again, there was no in-depth examination of fictional characters, and nothing above and beyond the rudimentary steps and formula to creating a character. Then again, after reading several other how-to write books, maybe I was expecting too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Resource Material","review":"Anything like this is good for the writer, or potential author. I appreciated the helps offered, and find that I refer to the book often."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Writing Exercises","review":"There aren't any writing exercises in this book. As a beginning writer, I need all the help I can get. The high ratings this book has received helped me decide to buy it. This book sounded like it would help me understand how to create characters, but with no exercises, it is of little use to me at this time. Perhaps it would be useful to a more experienced writer than I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Wisdom than One Man Can Glean","review":"I can hardly believe all of this wisdom came from one man. It would take me a hundred years to learn all that is contained in this book from any other source.

I'm sure to refer to this book over and over, it is a must have for any writer's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This is the second book I have read in the series and I was very impressed with it. I'm working my way through the series writing reviews of each. The thing I liked best about this book is that Card does not talk down to you. He is informative without being insulting. The book was also filled with allot of great info and direction, especially the section on viewpoint. He explains the common problems with first person writing and how its much harder than is generally thought. This was a big help for me and made me realize why I have been having so much trouble with first person views.The majority of the book is on characters of course and there is no shortage of solid advice here either. He gives you a very simple and direct group of subjects that you can address to help make you're characters more life-like. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to any beginning writer.

Not only do I enjoy the novels themselves, but I aleays read the forwards, afterwards, and any addition writing included in the books. I find his style and voice quite compelling.When I learned he had written a book on how to write characters it seemed only natural to me to read it. I have no interest in writing myself. But after reading this very clear and informative methodology, I can better appreciate characters that I encounter, not only in his work but in all my reading selections.The only warning I will give is that he refers to books, movies, and TV programs thar are a little outdated. It was written in the late 80s.

Since delta no longer makes the 40-601, I opted for the 40-680.The first thing I noticed was the reduction in the quality level of the stand. Second, the scroll saw required the operator to physically push the blade in order to get it started.I finally had the opportunity to need the saw to run for a couple of hours today with the following results. The lower blade holder is out of alignment and will not hold a blade. It kept breaking blades and would not hold the blade resulting in about 20 broken blades in an hour.

The Nintendo version is the one to get! You would think that the developers/programmers would have at least used some of Sega's 16-Bit power to made the game better in at least one aspect??? Making the graphics bigger is not that important. The controls are very sluggish and the difficulty is steap making for a frustrating combo. The pros of the game are few and far between.

No more trips for me to 4 different stores in search of the right bag, and not to mention the filters are all washable. It is very powerful, pulling out dirt I didn't even know I had. Some other features I like are the height adjustment so I can vacuum my carpets as well as my tile and hardwood surfaces, and the bright headlight that directs me to all the dog hair hidden in corners. Not that it matters, but the color is really cool too (the pictures don't really do it justice, as it has an almost metallic fleck finish.) If you compare this vacuum to others in the same price range, I think you'll see that the Cleanview offers more features for less money, and I'm here to tell you it does an outstanding job. Bissell definitely has a winner here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"we have been looking in local stores for a good, well made vacuum that didn't break the bank to purchase.

The \\"on-off\\" switch is cheap and lacks a solid feel. The beam is too broad and if there is furniture in the room, the unit is likely to mistake the furniture for your intended target. The laser beam is only minimally helpful because the measurement occurs as soon as you press the \\"go\\" button (by the time you point the laser at exactly what you wish to measure, the measurement has already occurred). There should be a one second delay.

I think Siket Disc is one of their most cohesive pieces, and it breaks all of the boundaries set by the conventional studio album. It is also worth noting the introduction of Page's synthesizer. It adds more to the album than it would seem, and in my opinion, makes the album much better; it gives the album a spacy, relaxed mood, unlike the generally up-tempo feeling and pace that is present in their other albums. The only other album that comes close to this space-like mood is Story of the Ghost, not surprisingly recorded in around the same time. Phish extend their jams much to much further and better ground. On this album, I think they got closer to the musical style and feel of Pink Floyd than they did at any other point.

It's not that i dont like it because it's improvisational, i dont like it because it's (.....) Phish can write a good song when they want to, but there is not a single track with lyrics. It kind of reminded me of live techno music, in that it's the music doesnt change all that quickly, and it's difficult, nay imposible to distinguish one song from another. Don't get me wrong, it's not horrible music, but it's not what phish is good at and it's not al that good. If you like slow, jazzy instumental music, try martin medeski & wood.

I am a fan of the band, as a matter of fact I'd probably say they are my favorite band, but this album was not the phish i have grown to love. Some say it is Phish in their element, jamming. However, these tracks do not fit the description of jams or grooves, but flow more along the lines of an alien trying to play a nose flute through a Mcdondald's drive through reciever. Another thing is the shortness of the tracks. The one or two songs that really start to jam end up being no mroe than 6 or 7 minutes.

Writers of Rough Guides used to be opinionated, almost passionate about their place of choice, and that voice is missing in Rough Guide Seattle. Bland reviews, no high or low marks (surely, not everything in King Co. is perfect?)and a decided bias against \\"left leaning\\" (duh, it's the Pacific Northwest, dude) stores, music, what have you, left me wanting more.

Unfortunately, when you start to play this game, you'll see why licensed products were so agonizingly bad in this time period. The gameplay is far too simplistic, the gameplay feels broken at times along with the platforming, it is way too cutesy, the levels are very boring and uninspired, the controls don't seem to function properly at times during platforming sequences, the camera is bad at times, and the enemies are flatout stupid. The plot is only something that pisses me off as well. If you want a good licensed Disney game from this time, go buy the far better Aladdin.

It is interesting, but it's missing something. It's worthy of respect, but not of love.While #1 through #5 were all exceptional, #6 is a journeyman(woman) effort. It doesn't elevate my mood. It doesn't make me yearn for more.Rowling is not completely up to the task of injecting realism in a manner appropriate for this series. There is not adequate compensation for the downers.It may be that Rowling's motives are something other than entertaining the same audience that purchased the first 5 books. Possibly she is looking for approval from the community of critics and peers who hold their own technical standards higher than the enjoyment of millions of readers.It may be a three star book, but... I give it ONE STAR, because the book is forced into a series where it doesn't belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and boring","review":"This book does not have any of the magic of the previous books.

Now that it finnaly came, i find that staying up all those nights on the computer just trying to find info on HBP was a waste of energy. I should've known that it was going to be very disappointing.

The 3rd and 4th books being my favorite. The 5th being too long and and a little too 'conspiracy theory' for my taste but still full of action. The 6th is completely unneccessary. It's like an entire book of 'filler'. If you compact the parts of the book that are really important to the story they'd probably only take up about 3 chapters... Out of 30! The rest of the book is way too slow. Just Harry following around Malfoy going on about his potions book and pining over Ginny. It just seems like the author didn't have enough good story line for 7 books so she just cranked out a long account of Harry's 6th year at Hogwarts... And then something important happens at the end. I guess it needs to be read in order to finish the series, but I really hope book 7 has way more action and isn't too long like book 5. Get the the action and get to the point. A simple idea that J. K. Rowling doesn't seem to grasp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Departs from what made the other books so great","review":"I love the Harry Potter series, but I was very disappointed in this book. The first 500 pages drag on, the whole time you are waiting for something big to happen, and it does. But, the wait is too long and the climax you waited for isn't what you wanted. Afterwards, you have a sour taste in your mouth and become frustrated at the direction Rowling has taken with the characters you care so much about.I will now relate some of the major plot holes I had with the book. Perhaps some of them will be explained in Book 7, but that's not good enough. In the best book series, the individual books are able to stand on their own, independent of the others, but seamlessly interwoven. Thus, the plot holes that end this book are inexusable.The book is interesting, and at its best moments you won't be able to put it down, but it's not as fun as they other books, and that's what really matters in the end.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy writing","review":"Any expectations I had of Rowling were fully let down by this sixth installment. Maybe she was trying a new writing style, or maybe she was preoccupied, but this book is a disappointment to me.. and I'm normally a HUGE fan. Harry seems even more isolated from everyone. All the characters seem to be lacking all their usual traits that we've grown to love. And you'd think that after losing Sirius, Harry would feel angrier, or at least turn to Lupin, being his father's last surviving friend. Readers are still left with unanswered questions about the Evans, the Potters, and about Neville. We want to know how Voldemort was thrice defied by Alice and Frank, and by Lily and James. We want to know about the OotP has been up to, now that they're not guarding the Prophecy. We want to know more of Dumbledore's background. The book leaves readers wondering if Rowling accidentally Apparated and left her imagination and writing skills behind.

Rowling always pays close attention to detail, and challenges the reader to recall intricate pieces from the previous books.I enjoyed this book much more than its predecessor, as Harry's temperment seems to have evened out considerably. He does not come across as sullen and depressed in this book, but does maintain his determination."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice come back","review":"I didn't think \\"Phoenix\\" was up to snuff (too-whiney Harry, for one), so this was a very pleasant return. Still a dark story line, but I like Harry again and things were more emotionally satisfying.

The book was predictable, wordy and full of nothing but character assassignation. I got the feeling the maturity levels of the characters regressed, much more shallow and in books 4 & 5. Truly a sad day in HP world, a true disappointment. Don't waste your wonderful reading time on a book that feels like another author has written it or maybe Rowling just forgot she wrote 5 other books as this one has no true connection to the beautiful characters she created in books 1-5. So, so sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the fifth","review":"Though an avid HP fan, I had been somewhat disappointed by the ineffective editing and meandering plot of the fifth book. Luckily, Rowling redeems herself with a far more engaging sixth book. The editing has certainly improved, with the characters having more depth and more realistic. Harry's mood settling down is also a welcome change.In terms of the plot however, I believe the sixth book does not achieve the same edge-of-the-seat excitement as the first four. There didnt seem to be any specific \\"large\\" events, with the main purpose of the book to set the scene for the final confrontation. Neverless, Rowlings style is enchanting and highly absorbing. The world of Hogwarts is exceptionally real in my imagination.I was also a little disappointed by the tenuousness of some the \\"theories\\" or explainations of events in this sixth book - particularly involving Dumbledore and Snapes actions, though Malfoys behaviour is well justified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book, bad ending","review":"I have read every \\"Harry Potter\\" book in the series, and they continue to get better, and better! The first few chapters of this book were very tedious, I thought, until Harry finally retuned to Hogwarts. Once I plowed my way through the boring beginning of the book, and got into the main plots, I found it one of the most addicting books I have ever read! As Dumbledore informs Harry of Voldemort's secret to near immortal life, Harry also tries to find out and stop what Malfoy is secretly up to in the room of requirements. However, the end is very tragic, as one of the main and most beloved characters is killed by a very surprising death-eater. Overall, this was probably the best book I ever read, and I could hardly put it down! I strongly encourage anyone who is a fan of the \\"Harry Potter\\" series, or enjoys reading fantasy or action/adventure books to read \\"Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course it wonderful","review":"Yes...Yes...Yes!! The HBP is fantastic. If you have read the earlier books, you probably have already read this one.

There are only two things I feel the need to express.1. There weren't as many light hearted moments of Harry, Ron, and Hermione just hanging out. (I really enjoyed in book five the scene where Ron and Harry are making up dreams for divination.)2. Whenever Harry wasn't with Dumbledore the only thing other characters seemed interested in was hooking up and who was with who. Yes I must admit I'm a big supporter of Hermione and Ron, but I think Rowling talked a little to much about who liked who and so forth. At one point I thought this was like a soap opera, there was so much drama. I did like the idea of relationships but I thought she spent too much time with them.Over all I really did like this book because all the good things in this book way out the bad. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.Waiting for the next book......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowling's depth hits again","review":"J.K. Rowing is such a detailed writer, with twists and turns all around. I believe completely that things aren't as they seem. Appearances can be changed and senses tricked in these books. That is what is really fun about these books. Things are so complex, that there is no way anyone can be sure how things will turn out in the end. J.K.

My only problem was with the ending. Yes, I am sad about the major death, but that is not my issue with it. i was upset that it ended so abruptly after the death. At the end of most of the books, everything gets explained and you are left with a feeling that most things will go back to normal for him.

I highly recommend both the book and audio version to Harry Potter fans everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY long read.","review":"The ending is the only reason this book gets 5 stars.

It does not come even close to the quality level of JK's writing in the 4th and 5th books. There is no depth to the story line and many of the existing lines from prior books were sadly left unanswered. This book is a pale ghost to her exceptional style and character/plot development previously demonstrated. It appears fame and enjoyment of her fortune may be more important to JK these days, rather than striving to complete the Harry Potter series at the quality level it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"School Project","review":"Harry Potter and the Half Blooded Prince, was a dramatic, sort of on the edge of your seat with some of the chapters of the book, with some romance in the air.The book begins with the typically beginning with him at his aunt and uncles house. He then goes to the Weasley's house for most of the summer. Harry is very on the edge of his seat in this book he is always thinking that malfoy is always up to something so he goes crazy with following him around.

It's hilariously funny in many instances, Rowling's humor is fairly dry, typically English, but I found myself laughing out loud quite often. I especially loved Dumbledore's comments and Luna Lovegood's opinion of the Aurors!There is plenty of plotting, suspicion, spying and investigation. Many questions are answered, but many crop up, especially as regards a certain Hogwart's professor and a certain student.There is also a lot of teenage romantic intrigue, which is thoroughly delightful.

Yet for sixth year students at Hogwarts, life goes on, full of difficult NEWT-level classes, Quidditch games, and lots of snogging. For Harry, normal life also includes trying to keep the peace between Ron and Hermione, the gut-wrenching pangs of first love, and a little potions help from a new friend.But even Hogwarts isn't immune from Voldemort's influence, which rears its ugly head outside the enchanted walls and, Harry suspects, even within.

It's just that the story does not move along with the same energy as most of the earlier novels. The characters are still well developed and the history that we are presented with in this volume is very interesting as well. I just feel that I could have done with a lot less snogging and lot more actual events.I'm not going to ruin any of the twists in this book by going into too much detail, but suffice it to say that I did feel that this was a decent book, it just left me feeling a bit cheated and wanting for a bit more out of it.Oh well, not everything can be a home-run!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Danni's Review","review":"J.

Let's hope number 7 is better.","review":"Up to this point I have inmensely enjoyed all previous episodes of Harry Potter. I am very disappointed by this one, though. It is rather dull and unimaginative, MUCH too long. By too long I mean that in fact, almost nothing happens in the whole book until the very end. The rest is just the usual Harry-thinks-Snape-is-evil-and-Dumbledore-benevolently-says-he-trusts-Snape. Add to that a truckload of teenagers' agonizing about who to date and how, and you end up with this 600-page monster. The interesting information is contained in under 30 pages. At the end of the book, we're almost at the same spot we were at the end of the \\"Order of the Phoenix\\". Let's hope Book 7 is better.

Book 6 was her best work, and really turned the story of Harry Potter around."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't match up","review":"Compared to the other HP books, this one doesn't match up. It's too long and nothing interesting really happens. Rowling makes it a page turner by having the reader expect something interesting to happen, but nothing does. There is no central story line as in the previous books. It all just flows with suspense that isn't satisfying at the end. The important information that we are given could easily be summarized in the final book, and then end the whole series... enough with dragging out the same storyline and get rin of Voldemort already!Don't waste your money. Borrow it from the library if you really must read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the mark","review":"What a dissapointment! Half Blood Prince did not really get rolling until half the book. It seems that J.K. Rowling was spending too much time giving us background on charaters that really, were pointless. As to the loss of key characters....Looks like #7 will fill in the blanks. Overall, I feel that the book was rather mosh-posh with no real unity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Book","review":"I think this would be my second favourite after the Priznor of Azkaban, It was refreshingly easy to follow especially since her last boojk was full of new charcaters and too many twists and turns. A great book and an unbelievable end. which has me wanting for more for the last one cause i think that would be onw of the most eagerly awaited books of all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Intrigues","review":"I fell in love with Harry when the first book came out. I have been a heavy reader all my life, but even at that I was surprised how quickly I fell... and with a 'children's book' as well!Just when you think you might have it all figured out, Ms Rowling introduces another twist to the engrossing plot. It is so rare that a book series can hold this amount of attention for so many volumes.... so many pages and we are all still debating where it will end (and dreading that) and whether Dumbledore .. or whether Snape.. Or who? There is no doubt in my mind that this series will be forever a classic.Our whole family reads the series from me (Gramma) to the Grandkids being read to by their Moms. Aunts, Uncles, The appeal and charm of the books is relentless: each more engrossing than the last. We are currently rereading the entire set, in preparation for the arrival of book 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not the best in the series","review":"While I liked the book, I was disappointed given the caliber of the earlier novels. Unlike Goblet of Fire, there isn't the constant worry of how Harry will get through the many challenges he faces. There isn't the dark tone of Order of the Phoenix, either. Instead, the book is mostly subdued and, until the ending, rather lacking for action or anything spectacular. The book does offer more background details about the series plot and seems to focus more on setting the stage for the seventh book. While I would still recommend this book, I must admit I am disappointed given the high-caliber writing and constant intrigue present in the prior books that just wasn't there to the same extent in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to par","review":"The other books up to this one were good. Half-Blood Prince was...not so much. J.K.'s writing style was not as good; the plot was not as developed; overall, this book does not demonstrate the skill that showed in the other books.Unfortunately, you have to read it. The next book promises to be good, and it won't make any sense unless you read this one. Of course, I would have thought from Order of the Pheonix that Half-Blood Prince was going to be good, too, so who can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"The landscape is totally different but the magic is as intense","review":"As a soon-to-be 60 boomer I offer our counterpart to Harry Potter, Oz and all its fifteen books of living in that magical land apart. The landscape of Oz seems sparse and more far-flung than Harry's world. It is a black and white and stickman world in many ways but real in its power and freedom. The greatest of the works of fantasy speak to us \\" This is the door by which you may pass, enter and welcome \\""},{"rating":"1","title":"a letdown","review":"Virtually plotless through and through. Book 6 and 7 should have been released at the same time to avoid dissappointment. All of the previous books built the main plot, but also had their own, where as 6's climax was rather anti-climatic, and its purpose was just one big 600 page buildup to #7. Not as big a downer as #5, it was by no means an upper. #7 is gonna have to be spectacular to make up for this, but I still have faith in Rowling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I have read Harry Potter for half my life (I am 14).

I am a very huge Harry Potter fan and so me and four of my best friends went to the bookshop July 16 in order to buy it. I love the way J.K. Rowling creates her plots, the way magic just seems like everyday life but so much more... and I KNEW that Harry and Ginny were going to end up together someday. Awesome book! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"JKR's Best work yet!!!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book over all the previous. Like many, I had this preordered a good 8 months before it came out, and was waiting on pins and needles. I ready about 200 pages on Sunday, and finished the rest of it all on Monday.I won't get into spoilers for any who actually haven't read this yet, but I particularly enjoyed Dumbledore's history lessons with Harry about Voldemort's past. Another enjoyable addition in this book is all the romance going on. It adds plenty of spice to the series, and leaves the reader very curious. I can't wait until book 7! I'm sure all ready all 6 books straight through a few more times before Book 7's release."},{"rating":"2","title":"billions and billions of stars","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. Laugh out loud funny and strong emotional content with a universal theme. A masterpiece.One of the things I most respect about her is that she could just \\"phone it in.\\" She could write a light-weight book that would still sell 10 million copies in the first week. Instead she produces this.The ending promises a book that will be even more intense. I can't wait.It's really hard right now to think of these as children's books. I going to have to find some kids to talk to about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh...not so much","review":"I don't want to write a review that takes 15 minutes to load, but I have to say that I was highly disappointed with this book. While it has more of the feeling of books 1-4 (since book 5 is a lot more angry and emotional than the others), it breaks pattern in a not-so-good way. I don't want to spoil anything, but the fact that the only true encounters with Voldemort are in the memories of others really screws stuff up. So, while there are some interesting hook-ups and break-ups, and a death that could have been heartwrenching (I cried about the death in book 5, not this one), overall this book is pretty much...bleh."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Harry Potter series","review":"I really liked the Harry Potter series until I read the fifth book which devastated my interest. But i did read the sixth book for the sake of it and really enjoyed it. I couldnt stop reading it till the end came. It was better than the rest Harry Potter series and i think J.K. Rowling did the best job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter (6)","review":"Being a big fan of books depicting magic since childhood, I have been very impressed with the whole series of Harry Potter books and movies. I would recommend them to anyone who is a fan of magic. I look forward to future stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, very disappointing","review":"This book seems to have been written to get it out of the way. Here, the author goes on and on with a grocery list of \\"explanations\\" - Once (well, several times) more into the Pensieve, dear friends! - the book seems to exist only as a set-up for the final one.Many of the characters who were introduced earlier in the series, sparkling and full of life, villain or hero, are given short notice here. And those that do make an appearance in this book, even the main characters, are lifeless cut-outs, background for the \\"back story\\".One of my favorite characters, the brash, funny Tonks, is here portrayed as suffering some horrible shock, is no longer herself, and makes only an infrequent and nondescript appearance. The reason for her behavior (revealed at the end) shows the build-up to be so out of proportion that it makes no sense except to fool the reader into thinking something BIG was going on. Cheap magic - unworthy of Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coolest Book Ever","review":"The Harry Potter series are truly amazing books. J.K. Rowling is an outstanding author. Today I want to discuss Harry Potter and the Half Blooded Prince. In the book, Harry, Hermione and Ron go to another year of Hogwarts, where Hermione, Ron and Malfoy become prefects and Harry does not. It's definitely going to be their hardest year and maybe their last.If you're for action and adventure, this book is for you.[..]"},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous book, horribly sad ending!!!!","review":"i thought the book was tremendous and really solved all my questions except the usual, so how does it end???? but of course we all know that we can find out until july!!!! This book was almost disappointing to me, because you get all excited that harry has a plan and that it actually works, and then something terrible happens...iwont say what!! but i definatly cried and you will too. it is definatly worth it though. so read it!!! it is a fantastic read and you will not be able to wait for the Deathly Hollows to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6)","review":"This was a fast moving book with lots of character development and twists in it. While we enjoyed it, we were also saddened by the ending. We are eager to get to book seven in the hopes that J. K. Rowling will keep the faith with the reader and twist the plot into one that will make us want to continue reading the books over and over again. Because we have enjoyed these books so much we have them on CD and tape so we can listen to them while we are taking trips in the car. Seattle to Kansas City and back again with Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it permanent?","review":"I bought the british hardcover with the black dust jacket - just to be different - but the story filled my greedy need for this tale to go on to a such a point that now my greed cannot be quenched!If it was action packed, it was - but Rowling stays true to the baseline, and that's what keeps a thirty-something hooked. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT! But really not the BEST...","review":"Half-blood prince seems to be a book I have been expecting for a long time. It doesn't really break much new ground and follows the same introduction. J.K. seems to be trying to explain so much through talking and talking, which makes it really boring sometimes. There's not much of a surprise for the bad guys and actually no surprise at all. I could say I would find my 7 hours of this book not attractive at ALL if there had not been the ending. It really had an emotional impact, yet NO big surprises. NOT as perfect as the Prizoner of Azkaban or The Order of the Phoenix, but still a great experience for Harry Potter fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful way to spend a Saturday","review":"I picked it up on Saturday morning and started reading as soon as I got home at 4p.m. Couldn't put it down so I finished around 12 a.m. Absolutely wonderful, all questions were answered and as with the previous 5 many surprises were found within its pages. J.K. Rowling has a way of opening peoples imaginations and bringing fantasy to life. Its wonderful to be able to be an adult and know through reading that the imagination doesn't get weaker with age. I await book seven with a mixture of joy and sadness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unputdownable","review":"I have read and reread the Harry Potter books, perhaps spending too much time looking for hints to how Rowling would develop the series, but I never guessed she would take the plot in this direction. Once again, she has astounded and amazed me with the depth and seriousness of the story.Until this afternoon, when I finished reading Half-Blood Prince, I was of the opinion that Year 3, The Prisoner of Azkaban, was the best book in the series. Certainly, this book has taken its place. It has everything: romance, teen angst, pertinent backstory, fascinating spells, and (of course) much forshadowing. Rowling uses Half-Blood Prince to set up the final confrontaton between her protagonist, Harry, and the ultimate antagonist, Voldemort.I highly suggest that you don't read every review on this page! Some people are not so kind as to keep the spoilers secret; reading the wrong review could ruin the book for you.Take it from this humble reviewer: Half-Blood Prince is worth it. Read it and weep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half Blood Prince Book Review","review":"The sixth book in the Harry Potter series was great! I thoroughly enjoyed the cliffhanging suspense that JK Rowling incorporated in this second to last book. The detailed plot, the killer suspense, and the great ending all tie together to make this one of the best Harry Potter books that I read. The public and media made this series very famous, and that's the main reason why I wanted to buy it, because if the public likes it, I would like it. On the contrary, there were certain things that I did not like about this book. Certain chapters seemed monotonous and boring. I just wish that Rowling brought a little bit more liveliness into some of the book's chapters. Well thats all! I hope you guys like the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter the Great","review":"Not only was this book suspensful, but it was also engaging in every manner. I have only started reading these books this summer. I have never been interested in reading the Harry Potter books because of the size of the books. But since i read these books in three days, i figured reading these books where no problem. I am looking forward to the last book of Harry Pooter immensely, and it is very unfortunate that it will be the last of Harry Potter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to JK Rowling's standard","review":"This book was, sadly, quite disappointing. Order of the Phoenix left me with high hopes after having such a spectacular finale. But the mysteries of the Department of Mysteries, the mirror, and other good aspects one would expect to pop up did not. Instead the book was heavily dominated by characters pairing up together as their hormones apparently became more important than the war itself. A lot of the relationships felt cliche and unbelievable... just thrown together. There was good characterization of some characters like Snape, and the final battle was quite intense, but I was sadly let down by this book after seeing how outstandingly wonderful (and far more memorable) books 3-5 had been. It felt like J.K. Rowling handed off the writing in HBP to someone completely different at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Rowling's best yet!","review":"I must say that I am surprised by all the negative reviews this book has been getting. I think it comes down to the fact that everyone has such high expectations for Ms. Rowling that if they are disappointed in any way it makes the book terrible. Even if one doesn't think that this was the best in the series (I liked # 4 the best), one must admit that this book rates at minimum 4 stars in comparison to almost any other work of fiction.That being said, I still think that this is one of the best books in the series yet. There is a wonderful dark tone throughout and the plot thickens as the book progresses. The individual who dies should not come as much of a surprise but the manner in which it happens will leave your mouth hanging open. Many of the hidden aspects of the series are revealed and we are given a powerful setup for the next book. If you haven't read any Harry Potter books, start now and you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best HP Book Yet!!!","review":"JK Rowling has done it again. This HBP Book 6 is the best of the series, with further character development, new twists and more puzzles to solve. Like most HP fans, after I read this book, I immediately read the newly released ULTIMATE UNOFFICIAL HALF-BLOOD PRINCE BOOK 6 TRIVIA BOOK by author Daniel Lawrence to gain even more INSIGHTS and CLUES into Book 6 and JKR. After reading the above, I cannot wait for Book 7 to be written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter 6 is shocker","review":"For the post part I liked this book. The book contains humorous elements especially the first chapter and romantic elements as the characters are well into their teens and starting to date more. It sounded just like what I went through in HS with petty jealousies. The ending is sad as someone close to Harry is killed in the war and someone I hoped was a good person turned out to be a bad person. Hopefully Book 7 will come out next year and reveal the final events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as wonderful as the book!!!","review":"Jim Dale has out done himself yet again. With each Harry Potter book he narrates, he just gets better and better. J.K.Rowling is a joy to read as well. I can't wait to read the last installment in this series. And, Gasp!!!! Maybe she will start writing an entirely new series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not the best!","review":"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was very good but it wasn't the best by J.K. Rowling. It's purpose really i think is to let you know how voldermort came to be and how he survived so that when the final book comes out you understand what is going on. for most of the book Harry takes private lessons with Dumbledore in which he learns more aboutTom Riddle who, as you are aware, becomes Voldemort. It does however have a great ending where all the action happens. The ending is kind of sad though because one of the most beloved characters dies. All in all you have to read this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"It came special edition, and in mint condition with it's original packaged arrived 2 days later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calling all Harry Potter fans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I loved it! One of Rowling's best works yet! She continues the wonderful story of Harry Potter in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Harry Potter is back, but since when does Hogwarts not have a job for Harry. The war against Lord Voldemort continues,and it's not going very well. Yet, Harry still has a lot on his mind. Sixth-yearers learn to apparate, and might lose a leg or two in the process. Harry goes from F to A++++ in potions with the help of the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.I absolutely loved this book and I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor and a love for Harry Potter. I also recommend this book to 5th grade and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"I enjoyed Half-Blood Prince. I think that Ms Rowling does a goodjob at showing Harry & the students at Hogwarts growing up.The plot had many twists & turns.I liked the Pencive (sorry, don't remember how it's spelled). It's the bowl that shows memories. I was disappointed in one area. I wanted there to be a big face to face show down between Harry, Snape, & Draco. Or at least between Harry & Draco. Up in the tower at Hogwarts when Harry & Dumbledor arrive, they see the Dark Mark in the sky. Dumbledor puts the freezing spell on Harry so that he can't do anything to stop Draco or Snape.It seemed like the plot line between Harry & Draco stalled.It started out so exciting when Draco discovered Harry on the train & beat him up.It's these plot points that makes my review a 4 instead of a 5.My most favorite HP so far is \\"Goblet of Fire\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I could not put this book down.

The only thing about it i didnt like was that there was no feasts or normal school activities. Thats ok though the rest of the book more than made up for it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice recovering","review":"After reading the Orden of the Phoenix I was very sad... I thought: well, it was impossible She could write 7 great books, the magic is over.But the half blood prince is a wonderful recovering... the magic is live again in this book... it is charming... only one or two chapters a little down of quality, but almost you could say they are needed and maybe there is no other way to tell that part of the tale.In general... this is a very good book... a lot better than the chamber of secrets in my opinion, though its not as wonderful as prisoner or goblet (still the best for me). But to be honest, its very close to those books.From this book Im going always to remember the After Burial chapter... what a charming chapter... five hundred points for JKR!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GO0D BO0K ... iTS WORTH iT","review":"i AM A BiG HARRY POTTER FAN. i L0VE ALL THE BO0KS...

Yet as i continued to read i was sucked in by her wonderful inventions and ideas. However her imaginative side could not overshadow the horrible writing. Using the same work over and over again in a paragraph (power)...its just too much. Also, i found it odd that she chose a ring as the object that voldemort must need, why a ring? Consider this, in Lord of the Rings, it is based upon such an object. THis story was almost a direct copy of LOTR, with the basis being the ring and its power to control people, even Harry himself. He admits the ring calls for him, which rings true in the LOTR series.

Ron and Hermione could have been at another school, for all the interest they contributed to the book. The last hundred pages picked things up a bit, but the whole thing is such an obvious setup for the last book.

I finished the book in bed late at night, clapped it shut, said \\"What a load of absolute Rubbish.\\", tossed it across the room onto the floor, and rolled over and went to sleep.In TV series parlance, Harry has finally \\"Jumped the Shark\\", ie. damaged its core essence so badly that no amount of re-writing later on, short of 'it was all a dream', will allow it to recover.In my opinion Ms. Rowling's only previous lemon was Chamber Of Secrets, and even it had its gripping and worthwhile components.Half-Blood Prince is simply dreadful, I'm sorry but its bad art.I would rather have waited another year while JKR re-wrote it than read this pile of pointless gibberings.

The fact that you don't know what could possibly happen next helps the book be even more exciting! I remember when reading this book, I could barely put it down due to all of the action and excitement!

Harry and friends grow up a little and take on some new responsibilities.However, it appears the characters in the story were just victims of the story - with no sentient, compellingly spontaneous qualities of their own - this is most sadenningly true of Harry. Harry is brilliant when the plot needs him to be and amazingly ignorant and suprisingly immature emotionally when everything we have been led up to believe would suggest he should act differently in certain situations.Perhaps here the pen controls the writer, more than just deliberate milking purely for commercial purposes. I would like to think the former.No new flights of fantasy and magic. No new characters/creatures. No climatic epiphanies. No gestalt.Just more of the same story grinding slowly to an inevitable conclusion..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the half blood Prince","review":"This is not the best of J.K Rowling's (the best being Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban) but it is a close second. Instead of with the other books how there always seems to be a mystery brewing with Voldemort and how Harry will have to face him this one doesn't have that to which I am greatfull. In the book Harry and Ron find love with some unexpected people but they don't last (to my knowledge). This book is more foucsed on Harry and him becoming a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"love that harry potter","review":"you stated that this book is for 9-12 year olds. wait a minute. i'm 61 and look at the rating i gave it.loved finding out alot of the history behind books 1-5. happy that harry has successfully gotten out of his moody, \\"woe is me\\", stage. cannot wait for book 7 when i'm sure he will defeat valdemort. but i will be sad because it all will end. the \\"sorcerors stone\\" was my favorite because i found out how harry began. \\"the half-blood prince\\" is second."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest HP book so far.","review":"Although I like the previous HP books (no. 5 being my favorite), 'Half Blood Prince' fails to deliver a long awaited sequel. I read it less than a day, not because the story is so engaging that I couldn't focus to anything else, but because some parts are so dragging that I skim thru them. I don't like how the storyline is told from Snape's and Dumbledore's perspectives. Merely telling the plot twists is not the same as actually writing the sequence. It seems to me that the author scrambles to find ways to cover the plot holes that she makes the characters 'tell' the story as opposed to the other way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the Good Stuff","review":"This book is a return to what i enjoyed about Harry Potter. Not since book 3 has one read better. This book will have you on edge till the last page, the only thing that sucks is that you now have to wait another 2 1/2 years to finish it......which is why i only give it a 4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I liked this book. First yes I am an adult, over 30.... I love the HP series. I can't believe the uproar over the death in this book and the impact it might have on kids. Are you kidding me? when I was in elementary school we either read or had read to us, Where the Red Fern Grows, Comanche, Charlotte's Web, Old Yeller, just to name a few. ALL of these books have a painful death in them. I don't have kids but I can only wonder are these books no longer read in schools? Are people shielding kids that much from life and death?? I also grew up in a rural environment so death was something I learned about very young.Anyways on to the book... Yes it is for the most part a prologue to the final book, it sets up quite a few things and leaves lots of questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad","review":"Is the 7th book here yet? Talk about lack of creative storytelling. There is no plot to this book other than about twenty pages towards the end. Harry thinks Malfoy and Snape are death eaters...nobody believes him...blah,blah,blah for 600 pages. Hasn't this \\"nobody believes Harry so there will be consequences\\" concept already been used? Oh, to make it more interesting and fill some pages, let's delve into Voldemort's past, and wow, you guessed it, he's evil!! Now that's a surprise. Then just to make sure everybody goes out and buys the seventh book, let's throw in a spark of a story that should be explained in this book but somehow can't fit into 683 pages. I thought each book was supposed to stand on its own as a story but this is just a $17 prologue to the end of the series. J.K.'s got it figured out, slap Harry Potter & (insert interesting title that has little to do with the actual story here) and make yourself a billionaire. Kudos to her for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","review":"The book I am reviewing is Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince by J.K. Rowling. Harry Potter is one of the most well known books and movies. The Harry Potter books are now up to 6 and still as popular as ever. I think this book is terrific and very exciting so I gave it five stars.This book is about a wizard named Harry who finds a mysterious potions book that belongs to the half blood prince. In this book Harry and Dumbledore (the schools head master) look for horcruxes that belonged to the evil wizard Lord Voldemort. Harry faces small problems such as his friends fighting and much bigger problems like getting the horcruxes. If you want to know any more about this book, you will have to read it. I would recommend this book to anyone because it is so great. Other books written by J.K. Rowling are the The Sorcerer's Stone, The Chamber of Secrets and The Prisoner of Azkaban."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to the Potter series","review":"I was very upset by this book. I am a huge Potter fan; I really loved books 2 and 5. I was hoping this book would be as good as 5, but it was not. 5 was packed with emotion, this one has hardly any emotions. Harry is dull, he is completely emotionless. Ron and Hermionie are useless and annoying characters in this book. The character development is terrible; all of the characters act like completely different characters. This \\"book\\" seems more like a screenplay than an actual book. It seems like it was writen by someone who knew nothing about Harry Potter. I only hope the 7th book will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"waiting again and again","review":"The series is slowly becoming into the Sopranos but even less; what I mean is that someone has to get \\"whacked\\" in the end. And considering how RK sets it up, you can guess by page 100 who it's going to be. The book contains very little substance and most of it the same stuff repeated over and over again, quidditch, dursleys, sorting hat, etc. It would be much more interesting to dwell on things we don't know about, like for a few pages what we found about Voldemort. But no, most of it is dedicated to rehashing old stuff. It's pretty disappointing considering the wait of 2yrs between each book. Another 2 years to wait..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best effort","review":"Ms. Rowling appears to grow weary of her franchise. There's some interesting new background info (padding, perhaps?), but the ending is a total cop out and the writing is inspired only occasionally. As a die hard Potter fan, I was necessary I read it, but I should have saved my money and waited for the libaray to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best edition.. again!","review":"Although this is not my favorite instalment in the series (mine being the Azkaban book), this US hardcover edition is once again is the best of all. Mary GrandPré's illustrations are so sweet. Cover and inside design are \\"magical\\"! I had to order this edition via AMAZON.COM because they only sell UK editions -which are dull, sorry- here over in Turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another great book from J.K. Rowling","review":"I simply couldn't put this book down! It has everything I've come to expect from Harry Potter book's, not to mention surprises and twists I never expected. It was well worth the trip to the store at midnight! I laughed, I cried...a whole lot, its a great read. But it asap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"This book was O.K. but it could have been way better. It left so many loose ends to by tied up that it was getting really annoying when something was mentoned and never mentioned ever again.

READ ALL OF THE OTHER ONES, NOT THIS ONE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way, Way better than the Order of the Phoenix","review":"I bought the Half Blood Prince with apprehension because the Order of the Phoenix had not been a great experience (sheer ghostwriting, in my opinion), but the Half Blood Prince is GREAT. JKR is BACK to her own unique, outstanding writing and every page is a pleasure to read.I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This book was a huge dissapointment. I love the Harry Potter books and always have picked them up immediately. However, book six, the \\"Half Blood Prince\\" didn't come close to the standard I have come to expect. This book was disjointed, the caracters weren't fully expanded and if was missing the flowing narrative that painted the story in the past.The last chapter of the book, was better than the rest and managed to pull it together, but what this book did was really set the stage for the next book, that we're gong to need to wait a year or two to read.This book was defenetely not worth the hype that led up to it's release, and I'm dissapointed JK Rowling chose to rely on her fanfair, not her talent. If the first few books were like this one, she wouldn't be so famous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"A real disappointment! 80% of the book was filler - only 20% was information needed to line up the final book. Considering what fabulous books J.K. Rowling has put out thus far in the series, the Half-Blood Prince was a huge letdown. Let's hope she gets back to her \\"roots\\" for the final book. Also, this is the first book in the series that I have no desire to see the movie or even wonder, \\"Wow, how are they going to do that in the movie?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Slump in the Potter series","review":"Frankly, after reading some of the other reviews, i.e. all the \\"best book ever\\" reviews, I had trouble believing that I had read the same book as the other folks had.This is not up to the same standard as Book 5; character development is minimal, and the feel of the story is that it was rushed with the goal of getting Book 6 out of the way so that we could progress to the important Book 7--the Grand Finale.And frankly, I have to wonder if Rowling is playing mind games with her mostly loyal readers. The eventual identity of the Half Blood Prince was so contrived, it had the feel of second-rate fancfiction rather than first-rate professional fiction.I also have to point out that the plot device of \\"Harry notices really important stuff and the adults all ignore him and he has to place himself in danger and do it all himself\\" it getting very old--I hope that Book 7 will not only show a mature Harry, but will also show adult characters that have a bit more wit to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince","review":"Truly amazing! If I could give this book ten stars, it would definitely be deserving. Full of danger, evil, friendship, alliances, enemies, humour, love, and betrayal, this is one of the best books I have ever read. If \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" deterred you from reading this series, I would reccomend taking this book for a spin. It is, in my opinion second only to \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" in the series, which has long had the reputation of being a reader favorite. All in all, it is more than well worth the time it takes to get through a book with more than six hundred pages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: spectacular!","review":"TREMENDOUS FUN!! I just love EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SERIES: Harry, Hermione, the owls, the newts, voldemort of course ... so creative, so clever!Yes, this one's darker, but deservedly so! Rowling ups the ante then keeps upping it! She's such a creative writer, with a seeming endless reservoir of exciting plot twists and turns; yet she never loses the sense of her CHARACTERS and their reactions always seem realistic and spot on! My kids - and their mother too!- will be very sad when this magnificent series comes to an end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet in the series!! Not just for teens!","review":"I'm a married 45 year old mother of a daughter and want to tell those who think these books are for tweens and teens only, are wrong! I recommend the Baby Boomer generation read these with books with your kids. It's been a bonding experience for my daughter, husband and myself!I really don't want to reveal too much so I won't give any details except to say many things will become more clear and some will shock you. For me, this was the most emotional book J.K. has written and I had tears rolling down my cheeks! J.K Rowling's imagination and ability to make the reader feel for her characters boggles my mind! When the series ends, I will truly be sad.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not convinced","review":"I'm not convinced that anyone actually died in this book. The death of a certain characters is to say the least \\"suspicious\\". Don't beleive me? Reread the book and watch for hints that Rowling drops that this is all a set-up. Mark my words, this character will return and how Harry will act towards said character for deceiving him will be most ineresting. Then again Rowling is a begrudingly good author and could be teasing readers like me. However, I don't believe that Rowling could kill off one of her favorite and best characters in such an unbecoming manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible","review":"I wish I wouldn't have read this.

Without giving anything away, the book, as others in the series did, answers some of the questions readers developed following the very first Harry Potter book. A beloved character dies, although it's certain that this character's spirit will continue to drive and guide Harry and his friends. A story of good vs evil, where good will win in the end. A darker book than her others.

Doesn't everyone enjoy a story about good vs. evil?"},{"rating":"1","title":"May turn me off Harry Potter for good (or at least JK Rowling)","review":"After reading this book I felt very let down by the author. Maybe it should have only been a four year school, as the books have gone downhill since then. The characters are boring and rude, especially Harry. There really is no plot, and nothing fresh to learn about the school or magic. You know it's building up to the big fight, but then Harry really plays no part in the ending. Judging by the ending, the books could easily end with this one. I will say that I was glued to the book, but only because I was waiting for it to get good. It only got worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five star ratings are jokes, 2 is flattering for this book","review":"I completely agree with Danyy Langford when he says Dumbledore was killed off unimaginativly, and cannot believe that the potter fans are in denial to the dullness of this book so severly as to give his statement such bad reviews. Open your eyes people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfoy's Rowling's last hope.","review":"Now that she drove Snape to hell, Malfoy is her, or the series' last hope. The final rating for this book should wait 'till his fate is revealed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Living up to the Promise","review":"As Ms Rowling promised, her series has indeed become darker and more complex in concept. However, it is the execution of that concept that fails to deliver. As was hinted in the earlier books, adults are not to be trusted. She relies on predictable tactics, such as verifying that all of Harry's suspicions about Snape and Malfoy are 100% correct and by revealing extreme gullibility and false judgements attributed to Dumbledore, Harry's mentor -- even to the final pensieve (very nicely done except for the unsatisfactory results) and ultimate sacrifice at the end of this book. Is it necessary for all good wizards (children) to find out how to think for themselves by losing respect for the wisdom and support of elders? This may set things up nicely for a spectacular 7th finale in which realities may undo some of the damage, but... for the time being, it teaches that even if you are a \\"Chosen\\" 16 year old wizard, don't trust anyone's wisdom... especially anyone older than 16."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat Different","review":"Possible SpoilersThis was a good book, no doubt, but not to be rude or anything, but it was written like one of those fanfiction stories you'd find on the internet. Maybe it wouldn't have if there wasn't so much LOVE! I mean Rowling could have taken it a bit slower instead of having characters snogging each other and then when mischief happens, sometimes you think they're up to something dirty (like Draco, for instance) and then they used the word SLUT. Isn't that kinda bad? I mean, would parents really want their kids to be saying slut because they read it in that \\"Innocent Harry Potter Book\\"? Just saying, and I'm not one of those people who think Harry Potter is a work of the Devil. One of the better things in the story was all the death!!

Another ultimately disappointing try by an author who lacks any depth or meaning in her work. She reminds me of an elephant that zoo keepers gave a brush and a canvass, that scribbles meaningless garbage with on it with paint and then they are able to sell it. The world may have been better off by hiring a chimpanzee to slam his hands repeatedly on a keyboard because at least that way it would have been more coherent and organized. Thanks J.K. Rowling for another book that can take up space on the shelves at the local library instead of the classics that should be there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter 6","review":"This book was literary crap. I think that JK Rowling has become a -bit- cocky when it comes to writing novels. Her head has swollen over the success of the books and the films. The stories were not well written.

And then, of course, came this Half Blood Prince thing and I rushed yesterday to Borders here in Singapore. I need not go past ten pages to realize nothing much has changed in Rowling's writing.In short, I will never understand the big fuss people are heaping on this gigantic heap of trash. Flat, wooden characters, predictable scenes, unabashed copying of Tolkien. People, grow up! Why make do with leftover gruel when there is a perfectly digestible amount of cereals other than this?Sorry to shout about the Empress' new clothes.

Harry in love with Ginny ? Ron and Hermonie? yeesh. Also Rowling downsized the Dursleys, i loved the interaction between the Dursleys and Harry.

I waited a really long time for it to come out. I think that even though this book was more in depth than the rest, it was probably one of the easier books to read from the series. All the experiences that Harry went through seemed real, like I was actually there experiencing it with him. Ron and Hermione make a very cute couple, as do Harry and Ginny.

This book is as good as the others, but there is quite a lot of teenage behavior, such as flirting and kissing, so I wouldn't recommend reading it to your five year olds. This book is funny in some parts, but it is darker than the other books - you learn a lot more about \\"You-Know-Who.\\" Some parts of the book may even make you cry.
