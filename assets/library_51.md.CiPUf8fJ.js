Overall, the game lasts 40 hours from start to finish. Just wait until you find out that Shiek is actually Zelda herself and you fight Gannondorf 3 times!

If you have an N64 and do not have this game, then you have serious issues. If you have an N64 and are refusing to get this game, then you also have serious issues. And if you perfer Final Fantasy VII over this, then you are simply hopeless. This game has it all. Great music, scary enemies, challenging puzzles, and a huge world to explore can all be found in this game. So, GET THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!However, I'd like to give a warning: the ESRB rating for this game is totally inaccurate. This game did not deserve any of its E rating.

The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time is great. It's perfect. It's the best videogame ever created.From the subtle, weathered beginning to the pinnacle of the adventure, I was in sheer awe of the magnitude of the game. The instantly playable 3D environment made for great gameplay: it was like playing Zelda III (an oldie but goodie) in lifelike 3D. I'd never felt so immersed in a game as I did in Zelda 64.If anything, Zelda 64 is a mite depressing, at least for me: it's a constant reminder of greatness that most probably can't be achieved in my life time.

I have played harder games. But anyway, this game is a MUST BUY. If you don't have it, make this your next game in your collection. It got a 10 out of 10 by MANY magazines. What does that tell you?

This game lets you be the Hero of Time, the only one worthy to pull the Master Sword from the stone in the Temple of Time, or, that's what the game says. You can be an adult or a ten-year-old.

Unfortunately, it didn't. I was disappointed with the lack of quality games. I was thinking, \\"What happened, Nintendo?\\" The following Christmas 'Zelda: The Ocarina of Time' was released with much hype. I bought it, and was hoping from the bottom of my heart that it lived up to its Zelda name, and after playing for 15 minutes I dicovered that it was more than worthy. It had silky graphics, a great storyline, and that little special Miyamoto touch. This is one of the best RPGs that I have ever played. If you don't own an N64, its worth it to buy one just for this game. And if you have an N64 already and don't have this, you have mental problems, or have an intense hatred for RPGs.

The plot and storyline are superb (there are some cheesy moments, but not many). The graphics must be seen to be believed and the best I have ever seen on the Nintendo 64. The music is great for a video game. There are enormous bosses at the end of massive dungeons. The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time has great replay value; I have beaten it at leatst 20 times and it has not gotten old. If you are going to purchase this game, however, I strongly recommend purchasing a guide booke. A guide book is almost essential if you want to get all the extras this game has to offer, like the horse, all the heart pieces, gold skulltulas, biggoron sword, etc. A guide book is also very helpful because a few dungeons (namely the water temple) are a little frustruating if you do not know what you are doing.

Most people will tell you to play this game without a stradegy guide, but I'm telling you the opposite right now. I used the Versus Books guide, and I had LOTS of fun playing the game, it enabled you to relax and follow the plot line.

Everyone knows when they come to our house for a get together that sooner or later...usually sooner...I'm going to bring out Pit. For some reason this game makes me really loud and obnoxious...after playing a few rounds my voice gets hoarse from yelling. One of the best features of Pit is that there is no waiting around for your turn and I seem to take more turns than most players!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Party Game!","review":"This must be the best party game ever! I am a high-schooler, age 17, and I play Pit with my friends whenever there is a party at my house. I have played sometimes at school in the morning (which is loud, and attracts attention), and on Forensics Tournaments (which makes other schools angry sometimes, though we have brought a few in on our games). The game is hilarious and fun, and brings people together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rip-roaring fun for all ages","review":"We played Pit at every family holiday or get together at my sister-in-laws house for the last 25 years. It was a tradition. I looked everywhere for one for myself & gifts, but never could find it until just recently. I gave one to my nephew for Christmas & the entire family got involved. My sister was already planning on playing it at some of their own parties. It's easy for all ages & once you played, your hooked for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best games ever!","review":"I listened to my parents playing this game and am so happy to be able to play it as an adult myself! I know that my kids will love it too. It is a great way to release some energy and laugh a lot. We played this the other night with my brother and his family and the only thing that we found to critisize is that the cards are really hard to shuffle and deal. We added baby powder with cornstarch, which helped a bit, but really only made the cards smell better :-) Buy this game, no matter what!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"This is the most fun game.

The rules are simple, yet engaging. Adults and kids alike play on pretty equal ground. Kids like the high-energy pace, and adults are amused by the idea of \\"cornering the market.\\" Maybe I say that because my father is a stock broker so it is great hearing his over the top analysis after each game. I can't really think of anything negative to say, except maybe that your children might grow up, like me, with an inflated sense of the value of wheat (the most valuable commodity in the game)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I started playing in fifth grade...","review":"This is a game of rise and fast action. My fifth grade teacher had about five sets of the pit game. We would get into groups and play against the whole class. I would like to recomened this game because it develops critical thinking and stelth. You can look at other peoples cards but it's not likly that they will let you. It's a great game for any card shark and especially good for partys. Adults shouldn't shun this game because children play it but try their hands at a round. I do believe that they will be hooked. A word to the wise, if you hold cards so that others can't win you will lose."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Game For All Time","review":"We were introduced to this game - big orange box, cards, and bell - when I was a kid. I hadn't seen it for years and then I found it at a drugstore. I heard my family talking about it, gave the pack of cards I bought to my mom, and since then it's a huge hit during the holidays and when the family gets together. I was just home for Christmas and we had loads of fun. It can get really noisey. I always recommend the version with the bell because otherwise it's not as clear cut a start and finish, although you can decide an opening and closing anouncement. Very easy to play and introduce others to, and I didn't even realize until recently that it was meant to teach kids about the stock market. Fascinating! If you love to play games, this is a must have for your game cupboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Pits","review":"Pit has been around since the 1940s because it is a hit with people of all ages.My seven year old enjoyed it as much aswe did.

You can play a silent version, but I can't imagine it being as fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but fun for everyone!","review":"We were skeptical and then regretful for not playing this sooner!

Some of the pages were printed too large around the corners, and were then just folded into the book before they wrapped it up. A few of the pages were even torn, which detracts from the book. Of course for a book of this price, I expected a much more professional printing and packaging.

Excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please beware","review":"This book is a reproduction of the original but the size of the page has been scaled down from that of the original by almost a factor of 2. This makes the book almost unreadable as the font is too small (must be 6 pt or less in LaTeX language, definitely smaller than than the font used for footnotes in 10 pt LaTeX documents). This makes it too tiresome for the eyes. That's a real pity as it makes the book unusable (at least to me).The book is so nicely produced, with nice paper and a nice paperback cover, and sold at a very low price. The publisher could have kept the font at its original size, trimmed down the margins (quite wide here) and sold it more expensively. We would have had a very useful book at a not-too-bad price. The way things are now, the book is very expensive, as I have paid money for something that I cannot use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Game.

Even after the first 3 or 4 games of a young child, Parcheesi becomes repetitious, and no more fun. The entire game consists of basically all luck, with a very little bit of strategy mixed in. If your idea of fun is deciding whether to move piece A forward 4 spaces or piece B forward 4 spaces, Parcheesi is certainly for you. If not, I would strongly recommend not buying this game from a store, but instead getting it for a quarter at a garage sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was worth my time","review":"I thought that this book was informative and well written. A good book to have in any Religious Study Library. I certainly have this in my Library, and don't mind recommending it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very helpful book to understand the ritual abuse panic","review":"An excellent book if you are interested in learning about the Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) moral panic that started in 1980 with the arrival of the novel (presented as a documentary) called \\"Michelle Remembers.\\" By the mid 1990s, the steam had started to run out of the panic when a decade and a half of dedicated searches by police officers had turned up no evidence of SRA.When recovered memory therapy -- the basis of essentially all of the SRA memories -- was shown to be totally unreliable, the moral panic collapsed.But if you are interested in the reality of child abuse, this book is devoid of useful material; it is just a distraction from the abuse that really exists. I have rated it with one star on this basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous unproven hype","review":"This book is the worse kind of journalism. It does not offer one solid piece of evidence for any of its conclusions. The FBI spent years studying the so called \\"satanic crime\\" phenomena and determined that it was nothing more than urban myth. Linda Blood does not offer a single iota of provable evidence for any of her postulates. This is the worse type of book, one that places gossip and innuendo as fact. where's the proof? It doesn't exist. A terrible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good overview over contemporary satanism","review":"Although satanism is a contemporary problem, there are not many good books about the subject. This is certainly one of the best. The author is neither a paranoid fundamentalist nor an armchair sceptic but presents a balanced view on the subject. It is well researched and well written. But it is unfortunate that the book totally lack references, which make it difficult to use it in academic research. Those who want to look for references must check other books, like Carl Raschkes Painted Black. The book has an excellent coverage of the ritual abuse discussion, of the Presidio affair and of youth satanism. It can highly be recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks The Inspiration Of Her First Book","review":"This book is written entirely without the unique style and inflection that I cherished in her first book. It's almost as if her editor commanded her to write another book, and therefore the story and approach feel uninspired.I find her word choices slightly lazy, and even repetitive, and her metaphors, in my opinion, feel forced. She constantly compares things to natural images of the coastal South: beach, shore and marsh motifs, but it's done almost slavishly, and this gets tiresome after awhile. (Not exactly \\"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek\\".)Since I'm a writer myself, I may be a little more picky than other readers. Yes, I demand a lot from the books I read. And I don't think this one lives up to the reviews. Still, the story line itself is just juicy enough and down-to-earth to keep your interest. And Patti: sorry to be so harsh. I still admire your honesty and creativity as a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful lyrical tale","review":"I'm so happy to find another author that writes like good wine flows. Loved Maeve!

It writes of the forgotten centuries , those between the time the Jews had a second Temple and a thriving community in the land of Israel and the time of large- scale Jewish return from the Diaspora i.e. the twentienth century. It gives a century by century account of the history and for each chapter there are accompanying photos and illustrations. For instance for the eighth century there is picture of an inscription found on the mosaic floor of a synagogue in Sussiya in the north of the country. From the third century there is a picture of vines, menorah from the lintel of a house in the village of Naveh in the Golan Heights. The photos and illustrative material is beautifully presented. The textual material is written in a clear fact- rich and solid way.A highly recommended brief guide to the century by century Jewish life in the Land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute best book to start with","review":"I have read many good and helpful books but this is the only one which gives an effective strategy on where to start. With a demanding and misbehaving child,a parent can be easilly overwhelmed when they try to change unwanted behaviors or wear themselves out tackling the symptoms of the problem. This book focuses on the way children talk and relate during discipline which is easily overlooked when trying to correct a misbehavior. It also lists the many parenting styles that do not work and why. I have recomended this book to several friends who have found it very readable with very easy to work with. We used this book in conjunction with \\"The manipulative child\\" and our child is now happy, confident and fun to be around. People are constantly remarking on the positive changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A great, comprehensive book on Fraud!\\"","review":"As a Federal Investigator, I have certainly read my fair share of Criminal Justice books, however, this book is different, unique, and down right better. It is a must read for anyone working in or wanting to become familiar with aspects of Fraud. This is one of the best practical books I have read on Criminal Justice and Fraud. As one can imagine, with a Degree in Criminal Justice I have read too many books on the subject, yet this book is definitely more practical and has a wider scope of use than most books in the Criminal Justice/Fraud realm. This book is not just for the Criminal Justice professional, but rather anyone who would like to protect themselves from being a victim of fraud."},{"rating":"2","title":"very informative","review":"I am a investigator for the U.S. gov't. This book is very informative. The book I believe, is not meant to be read cover to cover. Instead it is more like a ref. guide to all types of fraud. Very good book. I'm glad I have this in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avoid victimization by fraud, consult this book","review":"I hear or read about fraud everyday--it?s scary. Not wanting to become a victim, I got The Fraud Identification Handbook, one of the most reasonably priced books on fraud available. Every type of fraud--that I can think of--is covered.Before I bought a house, I read the Read Estate Fraud section, which prompted me to check a broker?s license history. Following the Handbook?s recommendation, I avoided dealing with someone who had a history of complaints.I am considering having work done on my home, and I am so glad I consulted the section on Home Repair Fraud first. I will not do business with a contractor who demands some up-front payment.Clearly well researched, all of the supporting examples of fraud are referenced. Tips on prevention follow each section, lending credence to the author?s expertise on the subject. I can recommend this book to others who want to be aware of and avoid fraud."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a 5-Star Book!","review":"I don't understand how the other reviewers could give this book 5 stars!The book IS definitely comprehensive.It is poorly edited.

Strictly mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about Ben's parents","review":"Ok, I'll admit it. I bought the book with the hope of getting a glimpse into the childhood and family life of Ben Stiller. I didn't find out much about him, but I did learn a lot about his parents. I first saw Jerry Stiller in Seinfeld, I had no idea what a long resume he had prior to that. I enjoyed every page of his book and didn't want it to end. He certainly has worked hard for all his fame and I appreciate that he shared so many stories with his honest feelings. Jerry and his wife are both extremely talented and versatile performers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun story about his life....","review":"Great story about the life of Jerry Stiller and his experiences in life and show business.

Cheaper than HP or any retail store, and it lasted as long as the original HP product.The nature of the current malfunction could probably be fixed by soldering - basically, one of the two metal connectors within the adaptor on the AC end burned a hole through the solder-looking material on top of the circuitboard, and so the connector wiggles around - when the connector does not quite touch the metal, it sparks in attempt to make the connection, so I had to rig it about a week ago to make it work.My only beef is that the casing is very weak and had to be electrical taped together after a short time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for one week ....","review":"The HP ac charger worked well for one week and now it only works 50% of the time.

I figured I would give the book a shot anyway, thinkin I could just transpose it or use a capo. No. I've had to pick out the correct chords and just write them in. I guess it is good ear training, but it is not why I bought the damn book. As was said before, you buy it for convenience. If you want lyrics and rhythm go ahead and buy this book, if you want to be able to play the songs approximately, but in the wrong key, buy this book. However, if you want the songs as ol' Bobby wrote 'em, this is not what you are looking for. Nor is Bob Dylan Anthology for that matter, also by Amsco. Dylan needs to cancel Amsco's rights and let Hal Leonard put out a songbook for him like they did for the Beatles. Alfred would be even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a failure","review":"When I buy a songbook, it's because I want the convenience of having music and lyrics before me that I can simply read, instead of figuring tunes out by ear. THIS BOOK IS FULL OF WRONG CHORDS, LYRICS, AND KEYS! It therefore defeats the entire purpose. Amsco Publications: Please go into a different business, you failed at this one. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"These chords are not blowin' in the wind","review":"The review by Kyle is right on. Based on trying out \\"Blowin' In the Wind,\\" the chords are just wrong. And its not a matter of transposing the chords (or of a missing transition chord) -- the chords are incorrect in whatever key you play it. The whole point of buying a guitar songbook is to be able to read and play; but I had to pick up the right chords from listening to the song, with a little help from an internet search!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intervals right but that ain't 'zactly how Bob plays it...","review":"This is a big book, and on the surface a good value -- although there are some very critical omissions IMHO.But the biggest problem I have with this book is that it's not \\"as played\\" accurate -- and therefore not \\"definitive\\". Yes, you can whip this book out and start playing and singing Dylan songs for your friends and 98% of them won't know the difference. But if you want to play them right -- the way Bob plays them -- you will have to use your ears.This is a common problem with chord/tablature books, and is not limited to this one... but what the publishers of this type of books should know is this:Anyone who is interested enough in Dylan to buy a book like this will also probably invest in a capo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGRACEFUL","review":"I read the customer comments and thought they may be exagerating, so I bought the book because I'm a long time fan and have enjoyed playing and singing Dylan songs. This book is a disgrace to his music. Whoever is responsible for the random placement of all the wrong, rediculus chords should be tarred and feathered and dragged through the streets of Desolation Row. No person that plays guitar uses the chords that are thrown helter skelter throughout the songs. Unless you already know these 300+ songs by heart, this book is totally useless. To see His masterpieces destroyed makes me sick. I will never purchase any product again from this publisher or anyone involved with this disaster. My real feelings about this are much stronger but I restrained myself. DO NOT BUY THIS SONGBOOK. IT IS A RIPOFF. Bob bless you.

Off the top of my head an example would be blowin' in the wind.. In the book it starts with an Eb then so on, when in blowin in the wind the only chords played are C, F, G.... or G, C, D.. aside from rare versions.. the only reason why I gave it two stars was because it has all the lyrics lined up and if you get the right chords its still useful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"My son has recently become a Dylan fan and I bought him this book so that he can learn some of his favourite songs (guitar and lyrics). Not bad for a plain Jane book that contains tons of songs. He thinks in a few of the songs, some of the chord progressions are not right, but I think it may just be a Bob Dylan thing.

It is the second performance of the work, conducted by Anton Webern on May 1, 1936, less than 6 months after Berg's untimely death.The performance is excellent. There could be no better interpretation of the concerto. The recording (a live performance) is quite good by the standards of the day and the transfer is superb. Louis Krasner, for whom the concerto was written, plays wonderfully. At the conclusion, the orchestra overwhelms his notes, but this is a small matter compared to his performance. There is some coughing at the start of the concerto but the audience becomes caught up in the music, so new to their ears.We have the chance to go back in time to when the Berg concerto was barely known, and as an historical document of the event it is priceless. You will not be sorry if you buy this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog Leash","review":"A real dog walker would not like this leash. It does not have a temporary brake on it, strickly on or off.

Has brought back great memories.Game has a bit of strategy, a bit of math, a bit of alliance building, and a bit of revenge built into it. I'd recommend it to all.As other's have noted, they have changed the look of the cards, and I wish they hadn't ... but so be it. Still fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"Fantastic game, mixing strategy with luck in a way that keeps you wanting to play more. My only beef with the game is that it is utterly impossible to play with all the lights out. Other than that, great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The work of a true and free artist","review":"This CD is amazing. Annie tried something a little bit different, for the better! She always was a free artist, and I think she reaches her artistical zenith here. A natural evolution. The sound of this CD is excellent, it has an experimental edge that reminds of John Cale, Lou Reed and the adventurous side of Joni Mitchell. Anyway, she's a real author and anyone interested in art and poetry should buy all of her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compliment to DSM","review":"Finding the book to be very useful as I prepare for my LCSW vignette exams. 4 stars / Thumbs up!

Brunvand is the legend specialist and his research is excellent as he relates the legends and then reveals their origins. It is amazing to read his books and realize how many people actually swear these stories are completely true zand happened to a friend of a friend's hairdresser. This outing revisits some old favorites and also brings to light a few new ones. It is a fitting addition to the Brunvand collection (which are some of the best gift books to give and receive)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cult Book","review":"Brunvand has made himself a cult figure with his attacks on urban legends. Unfortunately, he has spawned a cult of know-it-alls who see the debunking of urban legends as the only end of folklore studies. Brunvand misses the point: people often do not believe urban legends anyways, but enjoy the clever twists of fiction. Debunking is not enough to appreciate the tales he relates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant jamming, though a nice looking toy","review":"This is a very good-looking gumball machine, with a nice glass globe and metal parts. I paid the higher price for this unit because I thought it would look good, work well, and last a long time. My 5-year-old was delighted when she opened the box. The gumballs were easy to put in. My daughter used pennies to get her gumballs. After the 5th penny, the unit jammed and I had to take it apart, pry out the money, remove the gum, and finally shake it in various directions to get it unstuck. After putting the whole thing back together, it jammed after 3 more pennies. I am very frustrated that I paid so much for a toy that so quickly jams. It's ridiculous and I wish I had not spent so much money for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice...","review":"Yes, I purchased this gumball machine a while ago, but not really until now have I started using it. It is very nice compared to the one's you see for sell at the stores. Most of the one's i've seen have a metal OUTSIDE to make it look 'well made' when the inside in just all plasticy. now this one is going to last you awhile. there's just one little problem -- it says \\"it takes all coins\\" well, let me tell you, it gets quite jammed when you try putting a dime in there. other than that, I'd say it's pretty nice.. it seems to have it's own stand, but even still, they say you can purchase a bigger one to make it taller.. but I think it'll look strange...

This is a great book! and it's not being published...! :("},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for any Beatle Fan","review":"By far, the most complete and technically articulate of any of the Beatle's books in print. Lewisohn crafts a marvelously detailed chronological sequence of all of the Beatles' sessions from their debut meeting with George Martin to the last days of \\"Let It Be\\". The result is a perfect blend of both the artistic and often overlooked technical genius of both the Beatles and the various studio engineers that made it all happen.If (like me) you have ever wondered why \\"Rain\\" sounds raised an octave, just how Mr. Martin managed to meld two different songs in \\"Strawberry Fields\\", or what the heck instrument they used for the its intro, you will not be dissappointed in this reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta have it! No question about it.","review":"I have a dog-eared, torn apart copy of this paperback, and I would love nothing better than to buy five more copies.

I have seen no other Beatle book as good as this one, EVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got to Get You Back Into Print","review":"I read this book many years ago, in hardcover. I came here to recommend it to others, and was shocked to find it's out of print. It's probably the biggest Beatle-related crime not performed by Mark David Chapman. Bad taste aside, this book is absolutely indispensible to Beatle fans, both for the insight into their studio magic and the equally revalatory photos. Their songs and albums are so ingrained in the public consciousness that it's easy to forget that these records were crafted by four \\"twentysomethings\\" and an ex-comedy record producer, and could have turned out much much differently if not for their collective creative brilliance. If you see this book anywhere, pick it up. It's fab, gear and wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughy researched and detailed","review":"Mark Lewisohn gets it right - a hefty oversize book, this is one Beatles book that stands out from the crowd. You'll quickly see that ML has done his homework, not from the view of a giddy fan, but of a journalist looking to gather, verify, and report the facts, dates, and where possible, photos of the Beatle recording sessions. This book is the one to settle bets or arguments with friends. For the serious collector of Beatle facts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stick to plastic","review":"These struck me as old stock.

By the end of the book, I had listened to a symphony of sour notes. The author just came across as crabby about others and completely clueless about his own inadequacies and sour personality. Have to wonder why the guy even attempted to hike the AT...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooorrrrriiiinnnnggggq","review":"I tried, but this is the most boring, slowest book on CD!

This is one of the most versatile books I've ever read. At times it reads like all of the following:- A comedy- Trail guide- A novel- A memoir- History book- Travel book- Buddy \\"film\\"- A lamentIt seamlessly transitions between each of these genres, hilarious the whole way. I'm a big casual hiker and this book sums up very well what life is like out there on the trail. At times you may think the characters in A Walk in the Woods are far fetched and out there, but believe me I've run into crazier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Negativity Reigns!","review":"Bill Bryson hates everything; the South, Southerners, other hikers, the Park Service, the rain.......you get the drift. Yes, he's a very expressive writer but why he chose to write about an experience which he found so overwhelmingly negative is beyond me. There are funny parts, but DON'T read this if you're a hiker with a love of the wilderness looking to read about a similar person's experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for hikers","review":"I felt obligated to write a negative review when I saw that this book still has a four star average. While entertaining enough to finish, it was disapointing. If you have ever read an issue of Outside or Backpacker magazine, let alone Edward Abbey, you will probably be offended by many aspects of this book. I would recommend reading all the other reviews sorted from lowest rating first before paying money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Huge dissapointment being the first book I read from the acclaimed Bryson... Too long for what it tells, should have been an article or a short story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed so hard, I cried","review":"As an avid reader of anything Bill Bryson deems fit to put on paper, I must say this is one of his finer volumes. I used to read it when I came home from working late and would routinely have to bury my face in my pillow to keep my laughter from waking my roommate. As with all of Bryson's work, you learn so much about the places he wanders through. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever gone camping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining walk with Bryson","review":"Readers seem to be rating this book higher as it ages. Informative and humorous, it keeps your attention every minute. Some of the commentary on forest conservation, etc. is discouraging....Let's hope that situation has improved since the book was written, but that's doubtful, given the environmental record of the Bush administration.Some photos would be a big plus. Viewing one of the great videos about the trail before reading is recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hiker from Hell","review":"Bill Bryson comes across as the original Hiker from Hell. This book is a con; the man only did a tiny fragment of the trail and dresses it up as 'rediscovering America'!! He runs down other people who were clearly better hikers than himself; and in the middle of the night he THROWS A STICK AT A LARGE ANIMAL WHOSE EYES HE CAN SEE IN HIS FLASHLIGHT BEAM AT THE PERIPHERY OF THEIR SITE, AND WHICH HE THINKS IS A BEAR!The man is a liability; he's lucky he didn't get his face torn off. He has the gall to gas on about the environment and the National Park Service when he's chucking sticks at bears and leaving a trail of garbage. If I did all the things (including cracked the 'jokes') he did on the trail I'd be ashamed to write about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A walk in boredom","review":"This book would have been one star, which for me means I abandoned it, except that it's my book club choice so I am dutifully reading it. There is a bright spot here and there - mostly due to interactions with others - but, unless you love reading about the history of the AT, you may be as bored as I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous and educational","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Bryson is funny and the story of the Appalachian Trail was educational for me. I have shared the book with others who also loved it. Now we all want to hike the trail (at least little parts of it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"There is never a dull moment. The author mixed imformation with humor which makes the book a breeze to read. Highly recommended fro people who are thinking of hiking the Appalachian Trail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous and interesting","review":"Well, parts of this book were laugh out loud funny. My sister liked the book and talked about it so I decided to try it too. It made me really think about living the way these two guys did in the woods, and if I could do it or not. I decide not, that doesn't mean I wouldn't try, I just don't think I could survive the journey very well. There were lots of thoughts to pounder about walking the trail. Over all I liked the book. Parts of it did get a little slow at times but overall it was very informative and I enjoyed the images that were conjured up in my mind about these two and the scenery along the trail. The book was a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk in the Woods","review":"Love the book. I hiked a bit of the AT in Pennsylvania this year. Wish I would have read the book before the hike. Very interesting. Bryson includes lots of local history and land management information. Great human aspect to include his partner Katz. Would recommend to anyone who has ever taken a walk in the woods."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk in the Woods","review":"The first chapter made me think twice about doing all of this hike. At age 65 and a small female, I think I'll do small sections. Reality check! I loved the book. The humor was just right, and it encouraged me to read more books about the trail."},{"rating":"2","title":"walk in the woods","review":"This book was recommended to me by friends and I found it very entertaining and enlightening. Since I am older myself it was inspiring that a couple of mid forty year olds, who were not in top physical condition, would attempt hiking the Appalachian Trail. Since I have always loved camping and have hiked other places before, I have plans to hike the Pacific Crest Trail since I live in California."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misery Is Great Company","review":"Bill Bryson's wit is reminiscent of J.D. Salinger's, and that's not bad company. The book almost always kept me in stitches, laughing out loud. I found his tellings of some of the tragedies of the AT a bit disturbing, especially because they were sandwiched between humorous anecdotes. On the whole, though, this is a magnum opus for all to read. It was like hiking with Holden Caulfield. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great narrative for long drives","review":"While driving in the Kenai, especially going through Turnagain Pass, there is a great big gap between radio stations -- (and most of the way those are available they are not much fun to listen to anyway) -- so we always bring something interesting to listen to for our trips. This story was just perfect in length -- we finished it there and back again. It was also cute considering we were in the woods! I have to admit I would be horrified if anyone started flinging things into the woods. Interesting idea to use a newspaper bag for a back pack -- NOT! Very amusing. Some very good laughs, just keep your mind on the road!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Appalachian trail here I come","review":"Bill Bryson might be able to make Paris Hilton feel comfortable in the wilderness. He has such a knack for poking fun at himself while conveying surprisingly useful information (at least for the novice) about super hikes. His story telling is genius and the pace is quick making this a weekend read if you have the time. This book made me want to go attempt to walk the Appalachian trail with Bill......and fail miserably, laughing the whole way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are my hiking boots?","review":"Bryson is good fun. I had never thought about hiking the trail, but after reading this... I'm happy to appreciate the adventure through Bryson's eyes. While the adventure is daunting, Bysron makes it seem certainly possible for anyone to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill and Ted .... without the excellent adventure!","review":"I liked the Historical side of it . Not very motivational . Felt like fiction at times. I've payed less for better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like a documentary","review":"I really applaud the author form his clever writing, but this book is just not what i wanted. If you are expecting a story about hiking the AT then its not that, you will have to skip to the story parts like i did. If you want a well written history about the AT and a description of the types of plants, trees and animals then that is what you have got! I prefer the juicy details about survival in these lone areas, otherwise i would just buy a geography book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bryson is disappointing this time.","review":"I have read several of Bryson's books and have enjoyed them all, except this one. If i wanted to know how messed up the government is, there are plenty of other books that will tell me. I wanted this book to be about a novice's adventure on the Appalachian trail, but half of it wondered off into places I didnt want to go - at least in this book. Sorry Bryson, but you've done much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Committed to what?","review":"About halfway though the book, after a month-long break, Bryson unexpectedly decides to drive to different points on the trail and to do a series of small hikes. This decision underscores the author's lack of sincerity and lack of commitment to the entire venture. He justifies this change of plans by noting that \\"it is almost impossible to .... get on and off the trail without assistance.\\" Yet, at various points in the trip, he and Katz take taxis all over creation. The AT crosses roads at many places along its route. Couldn't Bryson have taken a taxi to a drop off-point, if he was really intent on resuming the hike?These day-hikes provide a lot of material for the last half of the book. Bryson was very strongly committed to something, although it was not to hiking the AT. How about to publishing another book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Terrible. The synopsis leads you to believe that this man hiked the entire AT and he didn't even complete 1/3 of it. He constantly makes offensive comments about people he meets while hiking (particularly anyone from the South) and goes out of his way to make devisive political statements again and again. I will say that he has a good sense of humor in some parts, but that didn't make up for the offensive parts. Very disappointing, I regret buying this book and will not be reading any of Bryson's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda mean..","review":"I have to admit, some parts of this book made me giggle - Bryson's dry humor can be very funny when he isn't turning it against almost everyone he meets along the way.Maybe I'm biased (he skipped most of my home state because he just 'didn't want to be so far south' for any longer), but he spends way too much time making fun of southerners, including a complete plot outline of \\"Deliverence,\\" which he delivers with assurances that it could well be accurate. Geez, would you treat the natives this way if you were in a foreign country?Get this one at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about the AT from someone who didn't really hike it?","review":"I picked this book up based on library review site as a \\"Librarian Recommended\\" and boy, what a disappointment. I have read several other accounts of AT hikes and this one was the worst. If Bryson had anything positive to say it was lost between the complaining about everyone he met along the way, the \\"politics\\" of the agencies/people involved with the trail, and/or scaring the pants off of people who have never hiked the trail with bear maulings/massacres by people/lightening strikes. And, given the fact that the author barely hiked any of the trail to begin with was never mentioned on the front/inside cover. He skipped beginning parts of the trail because he had nothing but derogatory things to say about anyone from the south and was disappointed in the price of a cheeseburger. There are plenty of other wonderful accounts of the AT - skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious.","review":"I could not put down this vastly entertaining and informative book about the adventures and ruminations of a chubby, out-of-shape, thoughtful, and somewhat prissy bookworm who sets forth with his sarcastic, even more out-of-shape buddy on a long backpacking trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed out loud and thought a lot","review":"I could recommend this book to anyeone. I am not an \\"outdoorsman\\". I am not a history fan. I am not interested in how many types of salamanders can be found between Maine and Mauna Loa. But DAMN I love this book!! It is funny, thought-provoking, compelling, and over much too soon. I've ordered two more of Bryson's books based on the strength of this book alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"He didn't walk the whole trail!","review":"This is not a GUY book; worse, it is a real let-down. Bryson does give a good story of the places he does reach and I couldn't help laughing at the antics of Bryson and his buddy, Katz. But he gives up on the trail too early and he even gave up on the last 100 mile stretch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic and highly entertaining commentary!","review":"This book is hilarious and educational at the same time. Bryson is very adept at weaving a truely heartfelt tale of his days on the trail while also taking time to educate readers on the history of this country and its natural resources. It is evident that Bryson feels very strongly about some of the pressures facing the natural resources of this country, but he does not preach. The intuitive and descriptive prose used to illustrate the various characters he meets during his travels is wonderful.This book makes you want to quit your job, grab a pack, and hit the trail. My copy will be dog-eared and battered. The most satisfying read I've had in weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Ride\\" in the Woods","review":"If you like \\"hiking\\" stories with a lot of car renting, hitchhiking and cab riding, this one is for you. This guy is supposed to be hiking, but for some reason, he just can't stay out of automobiles. I would have enjoyed an audio book about serious hiking, or a self-effacing book about humorous hiking misadventures, but this guy actually considers himself an accomplished hiker, even after quitting the trail. And it's all delivered in a condescending tone toward Southerners, the poor, The Forest Service, the Park Service the Boy Scouts and anyone else he doesn't care for. This book is supposed to be funny, and it is. Sadly, I was laughing AT the author, not with him. I can just picture this LL Bean wearing latte sipper and his fat buddy, stumbling through the woods with little notebooks, making enough noise to wake the dead, all the while keeping a keen eye out for a Holiday Inn Express. I highly recommend skipping this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This is a very disappointing book I couldn't even finish it. I was hoping it might be an iformative book for someone thinking about thru hiking the AT but instead its about an out of shape fat ass who gives up at the very beginning and knows a lot about the history of the AT. Please don't buy this book. Bryson needs to quit his job as an author and think about maybe flipping burgers I think it would be a better suited job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly disappointing","review":"Arrogant, overweight, middle-aged guy attempts hike of Appalachian Trail, quits after only a few days, then spends 200 pages making up for his short-comings in a story that goes absolutely nowhere. My first Bryson book I ever read, and certainly my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love the Trail skip this book...","review":"Back packers are an interesting lot. Through hikers on the AT come from diverse backgrounds and range from college students to retired postal workers to returning vets. They are, however, connected by a common bond: a love of hiking and the hope of self-discovery. Bryson undertook his hike with the stated purpose of writing this book. He chose an over weight, out of shape, obnoxious ex-college chum as his trail mate. His purpose was not to discover the trail or himself or the simple joy of wilderness but simply to write a book. His book may well be a financial success but his vision of the trail is one the reader might expect from a commodities broker and not one who hikes because of some higher purpose. There are easier ways to gather material and better books on the trail than this. The real surprise is that the AT Conference puts this book in their catalogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK I EVER READ","review":"I have always hated reading, but when I picked this book up I could not put it down it is the best book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"If you are looking to be inspired by someone who thru hiked the Appalachian trail then dont read this book. If you want inspiration by someone who actually accomplished something amazing then read something by Dean Karnazes or by someone who actually thru hiked it. Bryson quit a fraction a the way through. Then hiked bits and pieces of it with his car and lunches packed by his wife the day before.Plus he criticizes nearly every other hiker on the trail including his out of shape, poorly chosen hiking partner. He also criticizes nearly every organization on the way from the Forest Service to the Army Corp of Engineers.Bits and pieces of the book were funny. I actually like Bryson's works but this book was a huge let down.So if you want to know what its like to thru hike the AT then this is NOT the book to read.Disappointing"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very funny, adventurous, and entertaining book!","review":"I found this to be a fantastic book to read! The author was able to tell his story in a way that was funny and entertaining. A Walk in the Woods also gave the wanna-be AT hiker a realistic experience of the hardships, money, time, and planning that is involved in undertaking such a zealous dream. I also enjoyed the discussions Bill Bryson gave about the people he encountered, as well as some of the side adventures he was involved in besides the actual hike itself. This story also gives a realistic idea of what it is like to undertake such a trip not only physcally, but emotionally. I enjoyed his perspectives, and he made the reader laugh until your stomach hurts!! I would highly recommend this book for anyone who needs a good laugh, as well as anyone thinking about wanting to hike the AT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great characters outstripped by all-consuming griping","review":"Once again Bill Bryson has taken his acid wit on the road. Thank goodness he has matured since writing Neither Here Nor There and has developed the ability to appreciate locales other than England. If only he could have given us more of his and Katz's interaction and less of the diatribe on the National Parks Service, this book would have been a better one. While some statistics on endangered trees and animals would have been enlightening, the inclusion of so many was filler not substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad, bad read","review":"I picked up this book at the library because I heard it was good. I did finish the whole book but do not understand why anyone would want to waste their time and money reading about a quitter. It must have been nice to hike the AT, quit, and still make a ton of money. The book is only mildly funny and if you want to read a book about a real pilgrimage about finding ones self you should read WALKING HOME by KELLY WINTERS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humour on the expense of almost everyone","review":"With great expectation I purchased this book hoping, naively, that it would be a hommage to the AT. It begins with a very good sense of humour, which, unfortunately, turns annoying after about the first half of the book, when the reader gets rather tired of all the negative descriptions of what the author encounters on his way along the AT. Very disappointing is that despite great announcements at the beginning of the book, Bryson actually never really hikes the whole trail, and apart from a small episode where, due to his own mispreparation, he gets a little cold a the top of one mountain in New Hampshire, nothing, absolutely nothing exciting happens. And as to his appreciation of nature, Bryson truely fails to convince the reader of his ability to give a balanced picture. In the end, the book makes fun of almost everything and everyone. If he is so appalled by the AT conference, what about some constructive criticism? The book is not worth the while!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat Man Goes on a Walk..","review":"That should be the title of this crybaby's anthem to walking the AT. Most hikers there love every second of it. Not Bryson. He wants to be a funny guy and talk about his escapades burying his corny stools and getting lost on the trail. This book sucks! This guy is a whining bozo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super read for anyone who wants to hike those miles","review":"A excellent read for any person just might have the thought buried deep in the back of their mind..walking that long long trail..bring tissue and laugh until you cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun read","review":"This book book taught me a lot about friendship, American history, and most of all \\"rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail\\" I learned about the Appalachian Trail--which I really didn't know about at all. I know I will explore the AT more in the near future. I will tell my son about this book and highly suggest to him that he read it. I will also read more by the author Bill Bryson--I enjoyed his sense of humor. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wondrous journey...","review":"A wondrous journey, filled with side splitting humor and a love for the outdoors. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever dreamed of walking the Appalachian Trail. Who better to be your hiking partner and guide than a commedian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, entertaining and educational","review":"Bryson finds humor in unexpected places and catches the reader unawares. This adds to the enjoyment. He also has important things to say about our environment and how we humans have not been kind to it in many ways.After reading the book I wouldn't want to set out for a long hike on the trail unless I were ready for some pretty strenuous and uncomfortable times. Nevertheless his adventures and his anecdotes about his companion and others he meets on the trail make great reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"hiking can be fun","review":"All Bryson fans should read this book. The narrative is extremely lucid and you get the feeling that you are actually walking in the woods with him.Bryson,as expected,slams the authorities at every possible opportunity. And why not.He also does not suffer fools lightly. It must be fun and frustration to hike with somebody like Stephen Katz.I cannot wait for the next book by this author.His sense of humor is highly developed although perhaps not to the liking of everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing and informative -- a really fun book to read.","review":"I've backpacked about 200 miles in the past two years, including parts of the Appalachian Trail in Virginia. I identified readily with the range of emotions and observations the author so perceptively describes in this book -- the exhiliration and the dread, the truly comical as well as the weird. I recognized it all.I had read an excerpt of one of the funnier passages of this book and expected it to be all and consistently the same. I was pleasantly delighted to read the relatively more sober and informative sections as well. The bibliography he thoughtfully produces at the end offers the promise of many more evenings of informative reading.After completing his book I am left with a quandary -- which is more compelling the hilarity and serenity he describes or the arduousness and perils of the trail. I've actually considered hiking the Trail in the next couple of years, but now I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Odd Couple Takes on the Appalachian Trail!!","review":"I loved this book! Bryson takes you along with him and his hysterically funny pal, Katz, as they challenge the Appalachian Trail. I understand his calling to throw a sandwich together, put on a day pack and set off on adventure. Bryson meets his challenge with a sense of humor and serves to educate the reader in the process. In between all the good-natured (pun intended) laughs was some meaningful pearls of ecological importance that everyone should pay attention to.Don't pass up this chance to meet some great people. I only hope Bryson keeps on hiking with Katz because they are a classic pair that rings of an original rustic Odd Couple!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neither a serious hike nor a serious book","review":"So Mr. Bryson is not a serious hiker, but I thought the hiking he did was worth the effort. So Mr. Bryson is not a biologist, but reading the middle portion of the book dealing with his understanding of the biology of the Appalachian Trail motivated me to pull out some of my college biology texts.The only thing at which Mr. Bryson is an expert is writing, and this book is a very funny, easy read. The message for me in this book is that if you aren't able to walk the entire trail, you might find that what you are able to accomplish contains its own rewards.Many pages of this book are so funny you will laugh out loud. I recommend this book to anyone who may be thinking about hiking the AT."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Political Correctness\\" Detracts from Author's Hiking Humor","review":"Bill Bryson is a funny guy, and his Appalachian Trail experience -- from his pre-trip hysteria about bears, to his rather lame rationale for hiking only part of it -- makes for enjoyable reading. But his relentless ranting on \\"politically correct\\" themes detracts from his vivid descriptions. I want to know what hiking the AT is like -- not endure endless cliches about global warming, acid rain, evolution, and how idiotic Southerners are. He's lucky enough to get paid for having adventures. Why ruin it with political rants?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had to get this book for a class. It was highly recomended by everyone that I talked to that had read it, including my teacher, so I was exided to read it. Now that i have completed the book i only have one thing to say, Over rated. The beginning was enjoyable, but after that... Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish reading it..","review":"This book started out really well, very funny and you settle in for an exciting adventure... THEN, the adventure ends halfway through the book and it becomes a text book teaching you about salamanders, many species of plants, song birds, warblers, and never ending history of....\\"stuff\\".. Not to mention they give up and the author decides to drive the rest of the trail, not even making it to Katahdin..How can you live in New Hampshire and not even make a DAY TRIP to Katahdin?? Really?What a let down..I advise, if you have to buy this book, do it on Amazon for 7 bucks and don't make the mistake of paying $15.99 at Barnes and Noble like I did.. What a waste.. Never finished the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A snobbish look at America","review":"I am a huge fan of Appalachian Trail narratives, tough I really found this one petty and snobbish. It basically thumbed its nose at America, while complaining about the hike the entire time. A very uninspiring ending just tops the cherry on an overrated work."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Trail Tales","review":"As a backpacker with several thousand miles under my own belt, I was thrilled to read a trail tale not filled with braggadocio but real humility, fun, and fact. This is a great book for anyone who has hiked or is thinking about hiking. Bryson's use of honest humor made me laugh and even when I was not laughing, I was smiling, or getting angry. Yes, it has great satire, irony and foolishness, mixed in with some strong opinion. The story of Bryson and a friend hiking a good part of the Appalachian Trail is sobering yet inspiring. While he is not claiming to be a true nature lover, he shows respect often, and yet creates a read well-suited for those who simply want a good laugh, and not be inundated with environmental issues or perspective. It is educational, thoughtful and fun.Patrick Michael MurphyACROSS THE DESPERATE MILES"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learned while being entertained","review":"Great storytelling! I didn't realize I knew so little about hiking the Appalachian Trail! The author begins with sharing his preparation and research on hiking the trail, including a fun trip to an outdoor goods store, and the hiking partner he takes with him offers additional entertainment. As the story of his adventure unfolds, Bryson adds interesting facts about the trail, wildlife, and crazy hiking stories. A quick read, well worth the time. I'm not a hiker or even particularly \\"outdoorsy\\" but this book inspired me to do a little more research on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katz is King","review":"Mr. Bryson, is Steven Katz a real person? If not, you have created the perfect foil. But Katz, if you are real, forget building houses in Des Moines, WRITE SOMETHING! Or do comedy. I have NEVER laughed so hard at a book! At one point my husband thought I was choking, I was laughing so hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny , entertaining adventure story","review":"A Walk in the Woods was very funny and entertaining. It was also very human. I found the scientific parts educational and not at all boring. Inspiring; at least he got out there and tried something! I was laughing out loud throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"People either love Bill Bryson or they hate him. Seems to me, after reading this slew of reviews, that if you take yourself (or your pursuits, like hiking) too seriously, you're not going to appreciate Bryson. Although it suffers a bit in the middle, when, after having given up on thru-hiking, Bryson attempts a series of uninspired and uninspiring day hikes, the bulk of this book is solidly funny as it makes some serious points. As to complaints that readers were somehow misled into thinking he hiked the whole thing--where on Earth did you get that idea? Nowhere on the cover copy (or in any review I've read) does such a claim appear. At any rate, I heartily recommend Bryson's work, and you can take that from a gal that grew up in Waynesboro, VA--the town with no sidewalks. As a matter of fact, Waynesboro DOES have sidewalks, plenty of them. They just don't lead out of town to the K-mart. I love Bill, anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Couch Potato Writes","review":"OK, so he's a bit calculating. OK, so you can imagine him in his study rewriting certain sentences to pack in JUST the right amount of irony, but let's face it - Bryson is hugely talented, and this book is hugely funny. I wonder at people who sniff and say \\"Well, he didn't actually FINISH the AT, you know.\\" Thats's not the point. The AT isn't the product. The product is Bryson. This guy would be entertaining if he wrote about warts."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't meet any bears!!","review":"Ok, maybe I gave it away a little with the title of my review. It's true they don't meet any bears except for a rather ambiguous 'what might that shuffling, scraping noise in the dark be' moment. But don't let that discourage you. Bryson takes you on a rollicking trip down 2500 miles of trail. He mixes wit and humor, the history of the trail, and some poignant observations on people, society and nation into a wonderful mixture.Although some of the dialogue seems a bit on the foul side - rather unnecessarily, I might add - it doesn't do the book much harm.You would think a book about walking 2500 miles of trail, step by boring, repetitive step would be a snooze but Bryson pulls it off beautifully!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogance shines","review":"Ok the first part is funny. But my god he is forever putting down other hikers and the locales. Then once he leaves the trail he becomes insufferable. Some parts of the trail aren't really worthwhile (my god why bother with Pennsylvania ). And then for some reason his day hikes become some real adventure.His putting down of other hikers is ridiculous and the put down of technology is laughable.I truly think th author did something which was admirable ( hiking 10%) of the trail and then got a very overblown sense of his achievement.Btw- before you attack me as a wannabe I did hike thebPacific Crest Trail in 98-99."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another mid-life crisis book","review":"I have hiked part of the trail and dream of doing the entire route. This is one of several AT hiking books I purchased because the title suggests it covered the trail. Bryson's book is entertaining, loaded with laughs and speckled with bits of trail pearls, but boils down to a story of two overweight smokers with midlife crises who try trail hiking. This is akin to two college dropouts writing about getting a graduate degree. You will learn little regarding backpacks, shoes, tents, sleeping bags or other equipment. You learn even less about how to condition yourself for distance hiking. This book was a let down for me because I expected something else. Reading about two big boys' ice cream cravings and littering the trail during a partial hike left me nonplussed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allmost fooled me","review":"This is a very entertaining and fun to read story until the half way point. If you want to read a book about hiking the appalachian trail, find one written by someone who didn't quit halfway through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it.","review":"This is one of those books that is written for a European audience, with all the currently trendy, shallow prejudices that are currently marketed by their mass media. It has very little to do with the Appalacian Trail, which he abandons halfway through the book after traversing a small fraction of its length. The author can't even tell the difference between the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management. But hey, at least it has wit. Half of it, anyway. The time I spent reading it was utterly wasted, but Europeans ought to enjoy it. For Americans, find something else to read, like Twain's \\"Innocents Abroad\\", for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"Beware, any readers who take offense at foul language and talk of bestiality surfacing in the guise of a travelogue! And excuse me, but the use of the Name of Jesus Christ as an exlamation or a curse word does offend me. These are things I just never expected from a book like this. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised given the day we are living in and the lewdness of society at large.It is a shame as the author can be quite humorous at times and the topic is an interesting one. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but when I pick up a book I like to be transported and uplifted from the mundane. On the contrary, this book dragged me into an irreverent world of bad language and filthy talk where it just wasn't called for.Never again will I be tempted to purchase another book by this author. I'm sorry I purchased this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book to buy! Waste of money!","review":"I ordered this book in anticipation of reading valuable insights of someone who enjoyed the AT. I've done quite a bit of hiking all over the country and was thinking of trekking the AT since I'm now retired and able to have the time. But this little piece seemed to be written by someone who continually dribbles on with anything on his mind and only occasionally mentioned something regarding adventure on the famed footpath.He starts off with a theme on the dangers of being attacked by wildlife ad nauseum. Then starts into vulgarity at being scared $hitless and continues in this vein that makes me want to cringe with embarrassment for actually reading it.I like to read a lot and I've read plenty of mostly good and sometimes bad books. But this was the first time I felt the strong urge to write a review to possibly prevent another reader from making the same mistake I did in buying this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read and a good laugh!","review":"I nearly laughed my sides off at Bryson's rich descriptions of life on the AT. I would have given it a five if I weren't so disappointed that he and Katz left the trail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had high expectations about this book. My friend said he was laughing out loud all through the book. I never had that experience. I found the first half to be entertaining. Just as I was tiring of the story halfway through, (almost dreading reading it as they were of their hike)Bill and his friend decide to quick the AT. What a disappointment! Instead of reading the rest, I skipped to end, but by that time, I had lost all interest in the story. I, too, was waiting for a great bear story, but it never materialized. I agree with several reviewers that Bill is quite full of himself, but what I found odd from this man who enjoyed the outdoors, and was saddened by the environmental damage being done to our forests, is that he and his friend smoked while on the trail. I decided, right there, this man is full of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a book for REAL backpackers","review":"This is absolutely the most ignorant book I have ever read. Not only does this fellow have no idea what he is doing on the trail but he has no apparent respect for it either. Anyone who is interested in the AT or backpacking in general should Stay Away as this book gives the reader NO concept of the true experience of backpacking. I am almost embarassed to admit I read this book. Above all else, I was crushed by the disappointing ending to the book and his travels. My advice? Don't waste your time if your are genuinely interested in wilderness or travel writing. Try some Abbey."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"After 10 years' active duty in the Army, including a year in Vietnam, I've heard all the four-letter words I need for the rest of my life. I certainly didn't expect to find them all through a book on the Appalachian Trail. When I walk in the woods, I look for peace and beauty; I don't want to have to keep my eyes on the ground the whole time to avoid stepping in something that stinks.

BUT, the middle section was a bit 'slow' (to say the least). In my opinion, too much history, not enough hiking. But WELL worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was told to buy this book and it was a must read for a serious hiker like I am. What a big disappointment. I hate reading hiking reports where they start off, and keep, whinning and complaining about everything. I also expected that he was actually going to walk the whole thing and straight through (he was writing a book about this experience!). Instead these two out of shape slobes walk and complain from one shelter to the next and couldn't wait for the next hotel/restaurant. Then they poop out after just a small portion. He then took a break and came back later closer to home, skipping a big portion. For filler for the book, since he didn't have much \\"good\\" hiking to talk about, he fills it with miscellaneous tid bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"contrived journey, mean-spirited reportage.","review":"As an AT thru-hiker, I have about a thousand problems with this book -- the least of which is that Bryson didn't hike the trail. (He hiked the first 300 or so miles, decided it was too tough, and then drove around the rest, occasionally getting back on to do bits and pieces here and there.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Begins humourously; quickly becomes boring, opinionated and ugly.","review":"If you want to read about the natural world then read Muir, Leopold, Thoreau, et al but don't waste your time with this. However, if you want to read about why there are empty cream soda cans on the AT, or that it's OK to steal another hiker's bootlaces, or why the AT should have less wilderness and more cheeseburgers then this book is for you.If you want to read about 2 overweight ill-prepared hikers, one of whom is afraid of the woods and remains so, then this will thrill you.

The fact that I have lived close to the Appalachian Trail only made it better. I have to say I liked Notes From a Small Island better but this one is pretty good. He does get alittle preachy on environmental topics but the laughs make that worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"It isn't what I expected.\\"","review":"Bill Bryson has a comedic gift and adds just the right amount of embellishment to make the story fun and compelling, in the beginning. But, when he gave up on hiking the trail, the tone changed in the book, and I gave up on wanting to read it. It could have been so much more, but the fact is, it isn't. Left me sorely disappointed and the ironic part is \\"It isn't what I expected.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a technical, how to style book.","review":"Bryson has captured the \\"spirit\\" of the journey rather than spill forth tons of technical expertise. This should be required reading for all that contemplate the trail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I laughed out load more times than I can count. I even laughed uncontrollably until I cried at one point in the book. I could picture all the people and places as easily as if I were there with him. This is a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly perfect read","review":"Bryson's book (the first I've read) offers humor, history, biology, geology--all in a very captivating format. I highly recommend this book. It isn't just for the outdoors person, anyone who enjoys well written non-fiction would find this hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A whiner's guide to the Appalachian Trail!","review":"Like a hiker on the trail itself, the author starts out energetically, but about 100 pages into the book, he begins to tire and gets cranky. The longer the book goes on, the crankier and more arrogant he becomes. Everybody else is stupid, except him. His constant denigration of his hiking partner leads me to the conclusion that I'd rather hike with the partner, than with the author. And he parrots all the politically correct notions of the eco-elitists. All that said,however, the book DOES give some good practical insight about hiking on the trail, if you're planning such a hike. But otherwise, this snob's graceless bitching and sniffing made my head ache. The AT deserves a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good half book","review":"I can deal with the fact that Bryson did not walk the entire Trail. This does not mean it should be a bad book. In fact, the most humerous parts of the book are those with his friend, Stephen Katz. However, half way into the book, the narrative turns into a grandstand for Bryson to unload all his problems with Americans and the Environment. When this happens, just turn the pages to where he picks up the Trail with Katz. Another unappealing aspect: Bryson has a very \\"The National Park Service is Stupid\\" stance, which is unfair and rather boorish. Leave the Park Service alone; they have a very large, important job to do with very little bugetary support. Where was the editor when these diatributes against the Park Service (which run for pages) were printed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"He didn't hike the AT!!!","review":"The first half of the book was very good. Even a little witty. However, he quit hiking! You don't write about hiking the AT when you haven't done it. I haven't done it either but, I'm not writing a book about it. There are many other good books about the AT,, take a PASS on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject but irritatingly smug and sarcastic","review":"The subject is interesting, the descriptions are evocative and many of the observations are apt. I happen to share a lot of his views on the shortcomings of the Forest Service and the Park Service. But I quickly tired of the curmudgeonly, petulant, sarcastic tone and the impression Bryson gives of himself as the only intelligent and sane person surrounded by a sea of inanity and incompetence. The few pleasant, friendly people he meets are dismissed with a few words, while the majority with which he finds fault are heaped with scorn at length. It was made even worse by the fact that I chose the \\"Talking Book\\" version, which is read by Bryson himself. He is clearly enamored of his own wit, laying the sarcasm on thick in his delivery just in case the dull reader might miss it otherwise. I finally got sick of it and didn't finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Disappointing!","review":"I wanted to really like this book, but I was just offended. Apparently the only reason the author had to hike the A.T. was to gather material for the book. Everytime Bill or his companion were frustrated by the rigors of the trail, it seemed that they \\"got even\\" by throwing excess weight into the woods. Har Har!The author spends a lot of time talking about how scary bears are, and how everything is going to hell in a handbasket, but most of the AT he day hikes using his car. I just don't think he got it.Although the personal anecdotes are entertaining, I just can't get the bad taste the whining (and other very visible shortcomings) left in my mouth.-A PATC memberP.S., any guesses as to his trail name? My thought is that he didn't spend enough time on the A.T. to have one...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"Bryson's stories of his trip up the Appalachian trail were amusing and brought a smile to my face as I read. His story made me want to grab a backpack and head out for a day-hike. I also found the background information on the history of the trail very interesting. This is a must-read for anyone interested in taking on the trail."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a Much Better Book Available People","review":"This book was written by an author who wanted to sell books. Dennis Blanchard's \\"Three Hundred Zeroes\\" is about five times better and is an honest, amusing account of the Appalachian Trail. Plus, it's a whole book, not a short read with Bryson's long teaser about his next work at the 75% point. Arrgh. Skip this and buy the Blanchard book. It's full of usable info from an older guy who actually hiked the whole trail, didn't skip in and out, and faced some serious challenges along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"As most have mentioned this book was kind of a let down for me. My reading experience of this book is comparable to Bryson's A.T. hiking experience. I skimmed through the really boring parts.I bought this book hoping that it would be an account of his day to day experiences on the trail, but found myself reading historical information about the trail. I truly enjoyed reading the first quarter of the book, but it seemed that half way through the book Bryson attempted to fill the pages of this book with statistical info where there should have been personal experiences.Just bought AWOL on the AT... hope it will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail","review":"My husband loved this book.

The cover hints at the contents: ain't nature lovely? But that ole bear may gobble you up if you're not careful. Yeah, Billy Boy spills some prejudices against the Southern thang but his viewpoint was as funny to me (a Southerner) as the rest of the book. I didn't put this book down until I'd read the whole thing. Then I picked it up and read it again. And then I went to Georgia and hiked that section of the Appalachian Trail -- inspired by Billy Boy Bryson and \\"A Walk in the Woods.\\" (Bill, Wes Wisson sends his regards.)Thanks for the excellent book, Mr. Bryson! I want to go with you wherever you travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would have been better as a short story","review":"I am very happy that I checked this book out from the library instead of buying it because it is really only half a book.The book starts out well, but it takes a bad turn when they quit hiking the trail. The book should have ended there, but instead drags on and on. I stopped reading when Bill begins to drive back to the trail for day hikes, so if the book gets better after that, I will never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!!","review":"Loved the book.

I only walked about 1 mile of the trail(he would call me a reebok hiker). What I saw was lovely, and was the reason I bought to book, for more information on the trail. What I read was great. Though it is true he didn't hike the whole thing, he did hike more than 99% of the population of this country will every hike on any trail in their entire lives. This book was funny, and the way he told the story was so superb, I could almost imagine everything going on.

It was nice in that it took it lightly and can make anyone believe they can hike. HOWEVER - after having read through it - I was annoyed to find that these 2 didn't even complete the trail. I have done sections and my biggest triumph was getting to the top of Katahdin. They did not. I was waiting to hear how they did it and what they thought of it.

Besides not being able to fulfill his promise to himself, except for losing weight (which in his other books, I guess, is a very important thing to him - even to the point of judging other people) the author has done a minimal amount of research. History, geology, and life-sciences are alluded to in an abridged way in little lumps easily digested by slightly-better-educated people.Emerson he is not. The only character worth anything is Katz, a part-way companion. One gets the feeling that, by inserting 'Ecologically correct' paragraphs, he knows his nearly blank experiences (minus Katz) will sell the book by themselves.Hopefuly the author isn't just another \\"Tell them what they want to hear\\" hypocrite who knows how to sell books...anecdotes with 'changed names', as written, seem contrived on occasion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone needs to go and pick up Katz's trash!","review":"Many of you have covered the necessary points in reviewing this book. I however wanted to make loud and clear that the author and his buddy Katz have an evidently blatant disregard for nature and the environment. The book was funny in places BUT I cannot seem to wash my mouth of the foul taste left by the fact that these two guys walked around littering the forest. And then to market it under the pretense that it is somekind of environmental or nature-loving novel? Boo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, very funny SO WHAT IF HE DIDN'T FINISH THE TRAIL?","review":"This is a very funny book about 2 forty-something out of shape men who set out on the Appalachian trail. Bryson's hiking buddy Katz and the characters they meet on the trail are hilarious. Just because they didn't hike the whole trial, doesn't mean he can't write a good book. READ IT, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant read","review":"I was given this book as a Christmas present and read it right away. Not enough detail for hikers researching the AT, but very enjoyable all the same. If you are interested in some AT history and getting a general idea about hiking the AT, you'll get it here. Complete with comic insights and insults. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Benchley on the Appalachian Trail","review":"This is the first book of Bryson's I've read, and I'm looking forward to reading them all! Bill Bryson reminds me very much of Robert Benchley, although it's difficult to imagine Benchley on the trail with a big pack. My very favorite parts of the book were when Katz and Bryson were hiking together; I missed Katz when he dropped out for a while to work in Des Moines. While missing Katz, though, I enjoyed Bryson's pull-no-punches discussion of the fate of the AT, and the ham-handed role the national park service has played in its existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LAUGHED OUT LOUD!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Although the title is somewhat misleading (Bryson didn't hike the entire AT...) Bryson's writing is incredibly entretaining. People were looking at me funny when I LAUGHED OUT LOUD while reading in the metro.The book is a little loose 3/4 of the way to the end when Bill is \\"hiking\\" the trail by car but Bryson's impressions on the environment and very interesting facts about the regions he visits keep you going until the final hike alongside his friend Katz which is unbelievably funny making the wait worthwhile (kind of like some sections in the AT I figure...). Being an outdoor enthusiast myself I certainly can indetify with Bryson's mixed feelings towards the wilderness. You can bearly stand the discomfort but its perfection keeps pulling you back again and again.Thank you Bill B. I can't wait to get back in the woods!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bear hug for Bill Bryson","review":"This book is an instant classic. For those of us who consider \\"roughing it\\" not having room service, Bryson and his hilarious pal Katz have balls, my friends. And they have blisters. And bears. And bravery. Bryson hikes like a trooper, writes like an angel, and can be so funny so suddenly that you find it hard to breathe you're laughing so hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armchair traveling at its best.","review":"I found A Walk in The Woods entertaining and that is the point of travelogues. I read it during a 2 day snowstorm and it took me away when I was ready to go nuts. Bill Bryson shares his experiences of his decidedly wild hair-ish type expedition to go on a hike of a lifetime. Only trouble was he hadn't hiked like that before and didn't have anyone to go with him at first. That doesn't stop his determination and the result is hardwork for him, and enjoyment for us who would never experience such a thing otherwise.What it isn't: it's not a guide book for the Appalachian Trail. It's not a how-to-book for hikers; it doesn't have any maps or trails. It's a travel memoir, nothing more. If you are looking to do a little traveling in mind only, then it will be enjoyable. If you're wanting more hard fact information and details on the trail itself, then this isn't what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets me ready for spring!","review":"Bill Bryson, accompanied by his crazy friend Stephen Katz, has decided on a whim to hike the Appalachian Trail. A whim! Not the best approach to an incredibly difficult 2000+ mile hike. The two of them are completely out of shape and definitely unprepared for what they have signed on for.As the book progresses, Bryson shares not only how they came to terms with the fact that perhaps they had taken on a bit more than they should have, but some truly great information about life on the trail. There is a history of the AT, ecological information, and even a smattering of backwoods tips (mostly centering on Bryson's fear of bear attacks).Overall, A Walk in the Woods is a very humorous book--full of laughs primarily at the author's expense. At the same time, the true beauty of nature juxtaposed with the disaster of modern day America stands out in sharp relief. This is one of the few books I would say warranted its time on the bestseller list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trail mix gone soggy","review":"This book had two personalities. The first was the laugh-out-loud, somewhat inspirational first half when the author and Katz were stumbling along the trail. At that point I was pondering who would play Katz in the movie and declaring to myself that if they could do it, I could do it. Then they left the trail. The second half was forced, with the author dropping in at points along the trail, giving up altogether just short of the trail's end, and distracting me with lightweight political speeches and screwy Civil War history. Somewhere along the trail, Bryson went lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely NOT one of his best","review":"A Walk in the Woods is by far Bryson's weakest book. While enjoyable and well researched it lacks the incisive wit and keen eye of \\"Notes from a Small Island\\", \\"Neither Here Nor There\\", or \\"Mother Tongue\\". Best borrowed from the library or bought in a money saving paperback edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill and Katz excellent adventure!","review":"A real fun read. Bryson is funny,determined and hopeless all at the same time.His hiking partner Katz is a combination of every hiker I've brought along my travels from boy scouts to high mountain treks. I don't know how many times I laughed out loud while reading Bryson's account of his friend on the trail. On the serious side the book is an excellent story of the bonding that occurs when people enter the woods on a hike together.You can know someone for years, but go on a extended hike with them and you'll come away with a new feeling about them. Bryson does a nice job telling about the trail, it's history, beauty & vulnerability. A must read for outdoor enthusiats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not About Thru-Hiking","review":"**********SPOILER********If you're like me and you hope to someday hike the AT then you were probably hoping for a story about what it was really like. THis was not it.**He rambles on ALOT about history and facts about the trail or the area.**At the end he totals up his miles and it comes to around 800 (the AT is more than 2150)**He leaves after a few weeks and does a bunch of day hikes. Skipping parts he doesn't like**He gives up on the 100 mile wilderness after a few daysI read Becoming Odessa first. She does a little slackpacking and leaves the trail a few times but makes it the whole way. From blisters to the first poo in the woods. I was hoping this book would be more than that. I was hoping to hear another perspective on what goes on. What you have to overcome. I want to know what it was like actually thru-hiking the entire AT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean-spirited, fictionalized and not funny","review":"I was hoping for a funny, honest look at the Appalachian trail, but this book is neither. I was very disappointed and offended by the hateful stereotypes. The author comes across as a smug, mean-spirited, and deeply misanthropic person and his accounts are obviously highly fictionalized. How anyone could be fooled into thinking that this book is a true account is beyond me. The only thing that comes across as honest is the author's prejudiced attitude toward fellow humans. I actually threw this book in the recycle bin rather than give it away and inflict it on anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egads, what a bore","review":"Nope, I didn't get it. This book is the poster child for the \\"books by people with too much time on their hands\\" category. Bryson sells himself as an acute observer of the everyday -- the problem is, the everyday isn't always that interesting, and even when it is he doesn't do it justice. The first few pages were mildly interesting but the rest of the book went downhill from there. He might have done better had he actually walked the whole trail. The fact that he walked parts of it and spent a lot of time on breaks eating junk food pretty much sums up the quality of his writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"2/5th of this book was very good.","review":"For most non-hiking, city folk I am sure this book was a hoot. For the first 1/2, there were quite a few moments of levity - although some of the jokes seemed imagined. The last 1/2 was tedious. If this wasn't fiction, then Bryson never seemed to 'get' hiking. He didn't like to be alone, he didn't like people, he was afraid of everything, etc.My favorite part was when he berates Katz for going back on the bottle and then sits down for his umpteenth smoke of the hike.I would have much preferred to read Bryson for 1/2 book and then Katz for the other 1/2 (if he exists). I would bet that Katz has a different tale to tell.My rating is 2/5th because that is the distance that Bryson says he hiked. I think the book should have cost 2/5th - just to be fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Egotistical & Uninspired Walk in the Wilds of Appalachia...","review":"I had heard mixed reviews of this book so I thought I'd take a look for myself. I read and was gravely disappointed! If you are going to write about the Appalachian Trail and the culture around it, first start with an attitude of humility and respect, even if you don't understand or like the people you meet. Bryson does nothing of the kind. Instead he portrays Southerners as foolish imbeciles who don't care about their ecological surroundings. Say what!? I just returned from the Appalachian Trail and I can tell you that his book is extremely inaccurate on many points, but mostly on its descriptions of the Appalachian 'natives'. They are some of the kindest, hardest working, and loving people I have ever met in my life! Bloody decent folk is what they are, and Bryson is as thoughtless and insolent as a writer could possibly be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elitist and Arrogant: :Part 2","review":"R. Stockwell was right on in his review. Bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book, constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself. His favorite targets are Southern whites. A typical description is \\" ...loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex.\\" !!! How would a reviewer (of the NYT, for example) respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes inner-city youths as \\"... crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman.\\" --- Neither of these passages are acceptable but Bryson belongs to that ilk who's motto is: \\"Bigotry for me but not for thee.\\" BYTW, his earlier book, \\"Lost Continent\\" is even more egregious with his kind of self-righteousness. It's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Bryson...Bloody Arrogant","review":"It is quite obvious while reading \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" that Bill Bryson thinks quite a lot of himself and very little of anyone else he comes into contact with. Unfortunatly for him, the most pathetic charachter in the novel is himself. He is a laughably poor hiker, he spends most of his time driving around hiking small sections of the trail before moving on. Most of the humor in the book is unintentional as Bryson vainly attempts to defend his multiple blunders and his miserably inadequate attempt at a long distance hike."},{"rating":"1","title":"A trifle amusing perhaps, but take it with a grain of salt..","review":"I couldn't finish this book.As an avid backpacker (with a somewhere over a thousand miles under my belt by now...) I was looking forward to reading a humourous account of an AT thru-hike. But after the second chapter, when Bryson's dsicussion of black bear behavior was just flat *wrong*, I couldn't read anymore.Sorry folks, there's such a thing as creative liscense, but Bryson stretched the truth a bit too thin in order to make his jokes for me. If you enjoy his work, and don't enjoy the outdoors, perhaps you'll enjoy his book. If you do enjoy the outdoors, I'd recommend skipping it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you backpack, don't read this book","review":"The most interesting parts about this book are the little tangents the author goes into (the American Chestnut, the history of PA mining, mountain lions, and deaths on the AT). The thing is, you can learn all about those things in more depth in better books. This book? This isn't the spirit of thru-hiking in the least. If you like thru-hiking, internet blogs are one of the best sources of personal experiences from people who have a positive view of nature and appreciate the athleticism of hiking. If you want a better book about someone who is less into the challenge of hiking, Cheryl Strayed's \\"Wild\\" is a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very depressing book","review":"This book was billed as being funny. Unless you find acid rain, aniliation of trees and polution problems funny, it's not a funny book. It's more of a diatribe of how humans have destroyed (intentionally or inadvertantly) the land we live on. It's not like I don't know that we've destoyed timberlands, but I don't need to read about it - especially for a \\"funny\\" book. The best part of this book was the ending - because I was finished reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, Wondering What I Missed","review":"A Walk in the Woods relays the story of Bill Bryson's escapades along the Appalachian trail with his old friend Cat Stephens. Bryson has an unusual wit and ability to mix beautiful prose about the landscape with laugh out loud funny anecdotes about life along the trail. Laced throughout the story of the trail itself are diatribes about the forest service, the destruction of portions of our native flora and fauna, and the direction we have taken as a society.I listened to the \\"Abridged\\" version of the book. Normally I steer clear of anything marked abridged, and I really wish that I had noticed that it was abridged before I started listening. In this case, Bill Bryson was the narrator, and he did a REALLY good job of it. It was a good book, but I wonder what I missed :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Bryson's sarcasm and ability to laugh not only at his peers but himself is a refreshing way to share what could be an overwhelmingly informative and weighty story. I could really relate to Bryson and his companion, Katz. I found myself laughing out loud repeatedly. The way history and issues are woven in to one man's journey is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and enlightening","review":"Bryson's writing is clear, direct, and often uproariously funny. Into his narrative of his adventures on the Appalachian Trail, he intersperses mini-lectures on such topics as forest managment and underground coal fires. Many of his trail adventures--heck, even the planning and preparations--are humorous and slightly surreal.If you enjoyed Jon Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air\\" but would like something a bit less depressing, this might be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny stuff","review":"I just can't get enough of Bryson's style. I don't think it's mean. I think it's genuine. The way that he chronicles his friendships, addresses his fears and learns about himself seems to get better with each book. Keep it up, Bill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book could have been titled, \\"Complaining About the AT.\\" Bryson puts down the towns near the AT. He gripes about the shelters and the trail conditions. Everyone he met on the trail was either crazy, rude or stupid. He second guesses decisions made by the Forest Service decades ago. It is a good thing he hiked only a third of the trail. That fact probably saved his readers triple the grumbling. This book seriously tested my resolve to ALWAYS complete every book which I start reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Super Read! This book is good fun.","review":"I loved reading \\"A Walk in the Woods.\\" It is laugh out loud funny--and it holds up when you read excerpts to the person sitting next to you when you cracked up. Now I want to get out and walk the Appalachian Trail...but not all at once!Many folks have taken the time to write a careful synopsis of this book, so you really don't need me to write another one. Bryson successfully blends narrative and fact into a truly entertaining book. Unfortunately, a recent trip to one of the areas described in the book has revealed that at least one of his facts is already out of date: more than 95% of the Frasier firs in Smokey Mountains National Park have succumbed now to disease. It makes me wonder how the underground fire in Pennsylvania has progressed.But up to the minute accuracy isn't truly important for this book--just read it and enjoy the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A walk very much enjoyed...","review":"This was my first venture at a book by Bill Bryson. Suffice to say, it won't be my last. I find his writing clear, clever and constantly entertaining. Though I did find a bit slow point about 3/4 of the way through, it did serve a purpose as I needed a break from laughing. I hope you enjoy as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rip-roaring fun until the hike stalls...","review":"I would concur with a lot of readers in saying that what starts out as a gut-busting book starts to fade in the end. Once hiking partner Katz leaves the story, it dulls to common prose. I read the last part of the book anticipating Katz' return, and leafed through to see if his name pops up again, but Katz has hung up the boots for good. I did finish the book but don't be afraid to stop once Katz leaves the trail. You won't be missing much. Nevertheless the first half is highly HIGHLY recommended. That first half earns 5 stars, 2 for the bum ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"How not to discover the Appalachian Trail","review":"This book has obviously appealed to many readers. Some seem to be attracted by the humour, others by the subject matter and many by the writing skills of the author himself. There are some interesting factoids buried in this book, and some descriptive passages were terrific.This is the first of Mr Bryson's books that I have not enjoyed. The antics of Messrs Bryson and Katz, two middle-aged, ego-centric and totally underprepared hikers, irritated me enormously.I am glad that this is not the first of Mr Bryson's books I have read. If it was, it would almost certainly be the last.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Diluted Entertainment","review":"As an avid hiker with a good sense of humor, I expected this book to be right up my alley. But, halfway through the book, I found each page to become heavier than the last until I had to set the book down for fear of slipping a disk.To sum it up, the anecdotes were lame, the description of his experience was lackluster, and I felt more pity for the writer than a sense of comaraderie.I believe I would rather have enjoyed an AT book written by someone who had hiked the trail for the experience, instead of the book publishing potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book It starts very strong finishes very weak","review":"This book is quite amusing until Bryson betrays his readers by getting off the trail. I thought I was going to read the reflections of a thru hiker and I felt misled not only by the book but also by the pre-publication promotion of the book which led you to believe he did. It reads like Bryson actually runs out of things to say once he has quit hiking but still has 100 pages to fill as part of his contract with his publisher. I would not have bought the book if I knew so much of it was him DRIVING????? to various parts of the trail and remarking on what was there. Hell , I can do that myself. The first 100 pages are laugh out loud hoot but most of the rest is disposable filler material. Don't buy this book, borrow it and send its author and the publisher a message about putting out half finished writing and misleading the public. I wonder what the author has to say about how his readership has been misled?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk in the Woods is amusing,meaty and refreshing.B","review":"Bryson is a writer who entices you on, with a variety of eenjoyable means- you can't help sympathizing with his grandiose scheme to hike the entire Appalachion Trail with his inept companion,who has no notion of the demands of the project. They may have found the whole impossible to achieve but how you envy them the part they did, and their splendid appreciation of the wilderness in the process.It would be a lot harder for me to walk the entire length of the Appalachion Trail than for these two characters, but it was a hoot to be along for the try. Some of the humor is at the edge of despair. At least the two charactors are human and what grand insights are part of the try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those who have experienced the AT.","review":"Some 22 years ago, as a recent high school graduate, I and a few of my classmates hiked a portion of the Appalachian Trail for the first time. It was one of the best experiences of my life and Bill Bryson has allowed me to relive my youth. I am at that tenuous age (do the math) looking for that \\"City Slicker\\" adventure and just might consider embarking once again on the AT.Before I do though, I am going to stock-up on other Bill Bryson titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly what is \\"wrong\\" with our concepts of nature.","review":"Bryson attempts to be funny, but this book is more pathetic than humorous. As a long-distance hiker myself (did the entire AT several years ago), I found it sad that his ill-conceived attempt at hiking the whole trail (he does not nearly finish) is strewn with stories of trash he left trailside or in camp, and exactly what not to do in preparing for or conducting oneself on such an \\"adventure\\". There are much more high-quality books on the topic, such as Shaffer's \\"Walking with Spring\\", Deed's \\"There are Mountains to Climb\\", and others. Also, if you are looking for stupidity or humor in the backwoods, you can certainly find better, 'though this does fit the catagory."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO goes backpacking without a pocket knife?","review":"Bryson does not know about nature, nor does he like it. Why he attempted to hike the trail is a mystery. Maybe he didn't. He writes more about the towns along the way than the trail itself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful tale","review":"I was excited when I saw a book about the AT. A few funny incidents, unfortuately the rest of the book whines and Bryson contradicts himself usually in the next chapter. If readers want to know about the AT, many great books out there, unfortuately this isn't one of them!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start, but fizzled out","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend and fellow nature enthusiast. He was part of the way through the book when he told me how much he enjoyed it. A few weeks later I decided to buy the book for myself. I reported back to him my purchase, but it was too late. I was adamant about reading the book but did not want any details from him as to the nature of it. The first third of the book was an interesting story of the authors' experiences, but shortly after that, the book took a turn towards a more historical view of the trail. To be brief, if I wanted to learn about the history of the trail, I would have bought a history book. I gave the book the extra star because I did enjoy hearing about his journey, but at the end I was left feeling unfulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Brysoning\\"","review":"Amongst this year's thruhikers, when one messes up or does something un-clever on the trail, they are said to \\"Bryson\\".

I was extremely disappointed when he gave up hiking after all the bitching and moaning, and still had the gall to keep writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame","review":"I needed to write a review because this book disappointed in so many ways. Instead of reiterating all those very good negative reviews, (i had more laughs reading all the 3 star and under reviews here than reading this book) I'll just say, i would really enjoy hearing from the the people who encountered Bryson and Katz on (and off) the AT I'm sure that would be far more interesting and funny than this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Bother Reading This Book","review":"I was very disappointed at this wimp's view of the AT. I can not believe that he had the audacity to write the book under the pretense of walking the whole thing and he did not even walk one third of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"There are some good points that Bryson makes about ecology, communities, government agencies and the other aspects of the AT, but overall I think the book is overrated. I didn't get a lot out of the book and was actually left disappointed upon completing it. If I learned one thing from reading the book is that you can't always believe the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing","review":"This was an entertaining book, Bill has a way with words and is a good humorist. As far as him claiming he hiked the trail, that certainly isn't true. He takes a month break, drives through hundreds of miles of it and cannot even complete the last 100 miles in Maine without backing out.Other then that, there is a great deal of information and insight on the Appalachian Trail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"I am personally familiar with the Appalachian Trail and disappointed that an out-of shape middle aged man would even attempt such a hike and then dump on its difficulty. Exactly what did he expect? He drove from Knoxville to Roanoke, missing my area entirely . . . missing the mighty Roan Mountain and its Rhododendrun Gardens and wild strawberry patches. The end to end walkers are rarely heard about today. Either it is not done or it is no big deal for those who do it. The last I remember was an 18 year old who set a record of 2 months +/-.His style is overall negative toward the AT but I doubt few people and none I have ever known, had the objective of end to end. As an instructional book it works as in \\"Don't try it\\". Otherwise the tale is one of pain and no discernible pleasure. After a Chapter or two the story gets monotonous"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore, man","review":"My question is-- if he couldn't walk the entire trail, why did he write a book about it? I was disappointed that they gave up. I would have rather read an inspirational tale about how 2 out of shape guys pushed themselves to walk the AT from end to end. Who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to throw this book across the room.","review":"If you are a Christian person and love the great wilderness that God has given us you will dispise this book, although I do have to admit I was taken in with it for the first seven chapters. In the eight chapter I lost all respect for this man. Mr Bryson bashes the great state of Tennessee for trying to pass a law to prevent the teaching in their schools of EVOLUTION. At the same time he decides to rent a car and skip the trail from Gatlinburg, TN to Virginia. In my opinion, which I rarley ever give, I would have kept my personal opinions about religion vs evolution to myself. He also belittles every single person that is mentioned in this book with small exception of the lady at the AT Conference office/store in Harpers Ferry, WV. This is the first book I've read by Mr. Bryson and it will be my last. I'm just sorry that I spent 25.00 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated self congratulatory trek","review":"Bill Bryson was ill prepared for a hike of 2000 miles heading north on the Appalachian Trail. His old high school buddy was even less equipped. I found the book boring and not at all funny. Bryson's writing style evidences an attitude of contempt toward fellow hikers and a complete disrespect for the rigors of the Trail It is no surprise that neither man was able to complete the trek. It is only fortunate that no one was seriously injured, the physically out of shape writer and pal or other hikers. I still wonder why Bryson wrote this book. Tim of Glen Alan, Virginia has expressed many of my reactions to \\"A Walk in the Woods.\\" If you want to learn about America, read Charles Kurault. If you want humor, read Roy Blount, Jr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real hikers, stay away from this book!","review":"If you're a real hiker and/or you are at all sensitive to nature and the wilderness, stay away from this book. Bryson is a skilful writer, but what a waste this book is! His descriptions of nature are either flat or negative; he complains so much that sometimes it seems the main reason for the hike is to get to the next hotel; and yes, like some other reviewers have said, he comes across as mean-spirited towards others. His humour is too often the kind you get towards 2 in the morning at a drunken party : crass and unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a hiker, the author Cheated","review":"Hello. I was enjoying the book until about 1/2 way through, when the author and his companion decide to rent a car and drive from Knoxville to Roanoke. That's a distance of 259 McNally altas miles, but who knows how many Blue Ridge Mountain AT miles. This (driving instead of hiking) is like a football player selling a book about his experiences in the Super Bowl, but by the way he decided to sit out the second quarter because he was tired.So, you may read this book for just the fun of it, but don't expect to learn about hiking. To be accurate, the title should be \\"A Walk and a Drive and a Walk\\", but then who would buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, with a lot of humor!","review":"This is a book that should be required reading for anyone that wants to hike the AT. He makes you feel like you're going along with him and experiencing everything he does. Most of all, I really liked the humorous tales mixed with a lot of AT facts (and general nature notes) that I never knew and found to be very interesting. This is a really enjoyable book, even if you only want to hike from your reading chair. I liked it enough, that I have put his other books on my \\"want list\\". Hey Bill - let's have more adventures of your travels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The quintessential travelogue","review":"Bryson's book is what all travelogues ought to be. Part informative, part adventure, part humorous, and part introspective. He doesn't get too bogged down in any one of these, but provides enough to make this a well-rounded look at this unique piece of America. His travelling companion, Katz, is one of the most entertaining characters in this or any other book in this genre. I hope he travels with him more often in future sojourns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review the reviewers","review":"After reading this book from cover to cover one can certainly question the quality of reviews for this title. In fact, I would go so far as to challenge those who reviewed this book to determine if in fact they ever read the whole book. In my opinion, most never read beyond the third chapter. Had they, it would have been nearly impossible to give this book more than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troubling: Where Is Leave No Trace","review":"As someone who has done a lot of backpacking, I found this book troubling. While it gets at the absurdity of the technical aspects of long distance hiking in a humorous way, it demonstrates an utter lack of respect for the environment of the trail. Years of effort of attempting to have hikers pack out what they pack in is destroyed by this book. Tossing cans of Spam and soda cans along the trail is not the sort of back-country literature we need. Funny or not more care should be taken by a writer with Bryson's credentials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hiking??","review":"Having only recently finished this book, the antagonism it bought me is still fresh in my mind. A hiker myself, I was a little surprised at the whole 'eating in restaurants and sleeping hotels' thing...its one thing to go hiking, its another to stop in for a bit of 3 star luxury every week or so. And he calls himself a hiker.The incessant paragraphs/half chapters about the ins and outs of the trail's history, nature and scientific breakdown drove me up the wall. If I wanted to know about the flora and fauna of the Appalachian Trail and the greater part of North America I would have purchased a book on the subject. I found myself thinking that if the actual trail-log parts were the only parts to be published (and I must say they WERE well written and DID bring a laugh), it would amount to about 50 pages and could have been read in a few hours rather than days.All in all, the sarcasm and humour were well written, but it was a somewhat frustrating piece of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elitist and arrogant","review":"I have made it to page 84 and I don't think I can read any further. At this point in the book Bryson is in Franklin, NC. \\"Late on the third afternoon I stood in a Burger King and studied, with absorbtion, the photographs of the manager and his exectutive crew (reflecting on the curious fact that people who go into hamburger management always look as if their mother slept with Goofy), then slid one pace to the right to examine the Employee of the Month awards. It was then that I realized I had to get out of Franklin.\\" If you find this sort of elitist humor funny, then this book is for you. Also this book reads like fiction. Too much of it is not believable and appears to me to be written to make the story more interesting and therefore more publishable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like hiking the trail... tedious","review":"I'm giving this book 2 stars because that's pretty close to the amount of the trail he actually hiked (and hated, if I remember correctly, because he only liked Virginia and the bulk of what he hiked was the southern part of the trail). And if the book isn't about hiking (and smoking and littering along a wilderness trail), but about rediscovering America, then he gets two stars as well. After reading this book, I would believe that Americans (especially those living in the South), are inbred, stupid and have incredibly ugly towns. He is at once arrogant and narrow-minded, somehow believing that he is the only intelligent being on the planet.I liked the first half and even laughed out loud, but it became increasingly tedious (much like hiking the trail according to him- I would have liked to drop out of his narrative like he dropped off the trail)... and it's not about hiking the AT, nor is it a fair representation of America."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple, entertaining read.","review":"As a former backpacker, I read this book not as a tutorial, or as a grand statement of purpose and dedication, but to be entertained for a few minutes every day. That is exactly what I got. An enjoyable read without any pretense or attempts at grand statements. I sent it to my brother and he enjoyed it as much as I did.I came to AMAZON to look for other Bryson titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable, but I understand some of the low ratings","review":"I have been considering a thru-hike of the AT or Pacific Crest Trail and found this book to more helpful than the numerous other guide-type books I have read. Bryson's sensibilities, observations, and humor have helped me examine the realities and rationale for such an undertaking. His book has certainly not been inspirational, but it is funny and entertaining. Plus, the physical and emotional aspects of the hike really came alive for me. I can understand some of the criticisms I've read in other reviews. It probably helps if you share the author's environmental and political views (which I thought were balanced), sense of humor, and age bracket. This book earned its 5-star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and Witty Adventure","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the outdoors or in vicariously taking a little adventure.I live within a three hour drive of the AT and have only been to Mt Washington. Perhaps, unknowingly, a few other segments in New Hampshire. This book has made me a lot more curious about the AT though. More than that, it has made me want to set foot on it. Even if its just for a day hike.Bill Bryson is a great story teller and a lucid writer. After the first page it feels like the book is being read to you. My thanks to Bill Bryson for putting his journey to print."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed out loud","review":"I laughed out loud at times, so some of the humor is that good. Bryson is at his most interesting when he describes things that bore him. His descriptions of dull dismal towns held me more than the descriptions of beautiful trees and mountains. Reading the employee of the month plaque at a Burger King was one of the best moments. He makes his greatest characters out of the most ordinary people. Some of the geology and geography and history was quite good but not great. McPhee does that stuff better. I preferred his account of his walk around Britain in a way, although it's not as funny. In that he does not digress but continuously narrates the journey. I don't suppose you could do that with the Appalachian Trail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk In the Woods","review":"This is an EXCELLENT book for the hiker or vicarios hiker-- I am both, and thoroughly enjoyed Bryson's accountting of his hike up the Appalachian Trail with his former college buddy Stephen Katz. The trek was undertaken as Bryson neared his 50th birthday, and is a crash course on anything and everything that can go right and wrong on a hike. I couldn't put the book down once i started reading it, and have bought and given away several subsequent copies to frinds of like interests. \\"A Walk in the Woods encompasses the love of being out in Nature, the finite details of selecting proper hiking and camping equipment, various foibles and spats between fellow hikers, weather predicaments, environmental soapbox speeches, history, geography, and LOTS of funny scenaria!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny","review":"This is a wonderful book - filled with humor and history. I loved it. I read it during my lunch breaks at the office and I would be laughing out loud, which would encourage people to talk about the book -- some of whom have read it, others plan to after my daily reviews. I highly recommend it. I was rooting for Katz and Bryson to finish the trail, but they did not. However, they had an amazing experience with the hiking (870 miles of the AT) they did and met some colorful characters along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I am a 60 year old woman who has been reading books since the age of 8, and this is one of my all time favorites. I had never read anything by this author before picking up this book several years ago. I bought it because of the bear on the front - I love bears - and I just loved it. I passed it onto my son who is an even more addicted reader than I am and he read this book so many times the pages fell out of it. I have given this book to friends who loved it. It surprises me that anyone would rate this book in a negative way. I did not feel that the humor was at anybody's expense. I remember a couple of years after reading this book I happened to be in the Blue Ridge mountains. I had stopped at a ranger station to pick up some maps and information. I started talking to one of the rangers there and I mentioned this book. As soon as I said it he started laughing and so did I. It's a fun book and I would recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS NOT A TRAIL GUIDE!","review":"All these angry reviewers blather on about the lack of real trail advice in the book, the naivet�� of the author, the fact that they didn't finish the trail. Well, get this - BACKPACKING IS HARD! I *am* an experienced hiker, and it's NOT EASY to hike that far, and certainly not in the shape these guys were in. Bryson's attempt at hiking the entire trail was a noble one, and if people would just read the book and stop whining that he skipped some parts of the trail or kept trying to find a place with a good burger, they might come away with an idea of what Bryson *did* accomplish. Here's the deal - everyone's a newbie once. If you're in such great shape that you can just pick up and through-hike the AT your first time with no problems, good for you - go buy some maps instead and get cracking. The rest of us might find something to take away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can't Get Enough of Bryson","review":"It didn't surprise me at all how much I enjoyed this book about Bill Bryson's adventures on the Appalachian Trail. If you are already a fan of his, you too will thoroughly enjoy this book. For me the one reason why I didn't give it as much praise as his other books, is simply that I am not a hiker and would never in a million years undertake such a trip. I loved his book on Australia because I am Australian, his books on small-town America because I have lived in small-town America, and his books on England and Europe because I have travelled extensively throughout both. But hiking and camping? - not going to happen except from my armchair - my idea of roughing it is to stay at a Days Inn instead of a Marriott!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest books I have read","review":"Bill Bryson is a great storyteller who will leave the story to briefly and hysterically rant about life and the nature of people. This book is laugh out loud funny. He is a successor to Mark Twain. If you like this book read \\"Roughing it\\" by Twain - the dna is the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful mix of storytelling and information","review":"Bill Bryson is a wonderful writer. He tells great stories. Seamlessly mixing important facts into his journey. I feel like Bryson not only transports me to these places, but then commences a history lesson or teaches me something about biology. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"And he keeps calling other people stupid??!!!","review":"I couldn't believe how frequently he referred to the lack of intelligence displayed by others when the biggest moron on the trail was probably him. This is what happens when reagonite-style yuppies \\"get back to nature.\\" I knew more about backpacking and wilderness appreciation when I was 7 years old. Save your money. Read about John Muir instead. You'll be less likely to end up rooting for the bears..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book reads like the author was assigned by his boss to write about the trail. The unoriginal ... jokes about his chubby friend and carrying everything but the kitchen sink in his backpack are mildly humorous at first, then just get tedious after repeating them ad nauseum. To complete his 'assignment' he adds in filler in the form of factual/historical dialog that reads as if it were taken straight from park brochures.I was really disappointed in this book, considering the acclaim it has received."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read! A book you hate to finish it is so good.","review":"I have this book and it is so enjoyable. All of Bill Bryson's books are a joy to read. Warning...do not read this while others are around you like on a beach or cruise ship because you will burst out in uncontrollable laughter and you'll get very strange looks from people around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative and humorous","review":"Depending on which of Bryson's works I am reading, I am alternately delighted/entertained or sickened/annoyed. I have realized in the course of reading his catalog of books that he seems more in his element with some subject matter than others. Because I so despised his European tour book, I expected to hate this book, too, but I read it anyway, perhaps just to fuel my desire for complaining. Bryson's style here is informative and obviously well-researched, informed heartily with his own anecdotes of trail life, arduous, rewarding and sometimes humorous."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Feel like You're Walking The Trail Yourself","review":"Bill Bryson's account of his Appalacian Trail adventure was simply one of the most delightful books I've ever read. It was informative, humorous, and well-written. Mr. Bryson's ability to balance fact, personal insight, and wit make this book well worth reading.Pick it up for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save a tree","review":"The work is just disappointing as a whole. Bryson quits the AT just south of the Smokies and from that point through the remainder of the book, his failure is reflected in his writing. He proceeds to criticize the park service, forest service, and various subsets of our (american) culture. He has the brass to end the book by stating that he did indeed complete the AT. I recommend seeing the AT for yourself rather than through Bryson's ill-tempered rants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endlessly annoying and false","review":"This book is whiny and irritating. While some writers can capture their own failure in a way that is funny, this book is merely tedious and uninspiring. Usually those writers who can entertain in this scenario have humility and an ability to skewer themselves. Bryson has contempt for nature, the trail, and everyone he encounters, and a million excuses for his own horrible attitude, all of which made me want to push him off a cliff into a den of black bears."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk In The Woods","review":"A wonderful, humerous, enlightening read, even if you are not interested in the Appalachan Trail. Bill Bryson is a very talented writer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Going, but a Light Read","review":"The book begins on a strong, humorous note but simmers down after a few chapters. I found Bill's chatty style to be tiresome about a third of the way through, however A Walk in the Woods does give the lonely Appalachian Trail a real personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to scratch with his previous masterpieces","review":"Great, except for one complaint - too much history. All he seems to have done is hiked a bit of the way with a really fat, lazy person and had such a horrible time that he decided that he had better fill in all the boring details with historical facts. For a good historical book by Bryson, read Made in AMerica.One thing is true of all of Brysons books, you can pick any page and immediately be envelopeed in the story -t is captivating and humourous writing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Pompous, Elitsit, Intellectual","review":"After listening to ten minutes of the audio version of the book, I was bored to tears. I don't desire to read books that are so incredibly wordy from an author that feels the need to use big words. Then going into a list of diseases that would frighten even the most hearty woodsman out of the woods. If you think it can't get any better you have to love the line that leads you to believe that everyone is killing everyone out there in the good ole' USA. This dude really needs to go back to England since he seems so much in love with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny - just negative","review":"I have trudged through about 170 pages of this book, on the recommendation of my wife, who enjoyed it. I certainly hope I never have to share a trail shelter with someone this negative. Everyone is stupid, from Stonewall Jackson to the people he meets in his travels. Everything is worse than it was a year, a decade or a millenium ago. He talks environmentalism, yet shows no concern when he or his partner leave trash along the trail.I understand that some of this is meant to be satire, but I have found something funny perhaps three times. Yes, I laughed out loud once, but mostly I was annoyed.I certainly bear Bryson no grudge for not doing all of the trail. I hope he doesn't mind that I won't finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Writer but.....","review":"This is my first Bill Bryson book. I will say he does tell a good story about his travels but....the reviews as well as the book gave the impression he would tell his story throughout the Appalachian Trial. I don't mind reading about abandoned coal mines etc. but then I would buy a book on THAT subject. This book should be called \\"A WALK IN THE WOODS THEN A LOT OF DRIVING THEN SOME MORE WALKS, DRIVNG, WALKING, DRIVING, QUITING.\\" Get this one from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Discovery Along the AT","review":"The Appalachian Trail has a mystique...a soul journey on an American wilderness trail. Mr. Bryson's \\"walk\\" on small pieces of the trail misleads the reader. His sarcasm and criticism of the AT's purpose leads the reader to believe that the experience just is not worth it. From joke filled fears of bear encounters and murder in the dark shadows of the southern portion of the trail to biting accounts of his side trips through rural and poor towns near its path, Byron creates his own trail mythology. And, his message is, don't walk it. If scarcasm and ripping apart the essence of the wilderness hike is your thing, read it. If reflection on the beauty and personal journey on a preserved piece of American wilderness is, don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"way over rated, should be about 2 stars","review":"this book is way over rated, the hiking was nice, but we really didnt need to know so much history, that we really didnt care about, sorry but i cannot recommend thie one"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful tale of adventure","review":"I read this in excerpt form in OUTSIDE magazine and was hooked. This takes the humor and charm even further. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real teaser that only partially delivers","review":"Bill Bryson's \\"A Walk in the Woods,\\" has an excellent premise -- it looks to be a descriptive and subjective report on the Herculean adventure of walking the Appalachian Trail. When it does that, the book is enthralling. The problem is Bryson \\"fills\\" his book with too much narcissistic reportage about what he did when he was NOT walking the Trail -- mundane stuff like examining tourist traps and sophomoric humor about his travelling companion's quest for female companionship on their trail stops.Essentially, when Bryson writes from the woods -- the journey is fascinating and enlightening -- but as soon as he hits the pavement the level of interest plummets.Bryson wants to be Dave Barry when he makes a better (although more down-to-earth) John McPhee."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"While there were some interesting and humorous stories in this book, overall it is a bad joke! Bryson basically had a book contract to write about his journey on the trail. He realized he had bitten off much more than he could chew, so he spent most of the book rationalizing how, via day hikes, he really, well sort of, well maybe, hiked the trail. His attitude towards and description of other hikers and local folk was also incredibly ethnocentric! He came across as a New England Yankee snob.He did not even come close! Sorry, but his publisher should have told him, \\"hike the trail or no book.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: Katz","review":"I love Bryson, as well as nearly everything he writes. But his erstwhile hiking companion, klutzy, overweight, out-of-shape, pragmatic Katz steals the show in this book about a couple of neophytes attempting to hike the spectacular and challenging Appalachian Trail. You'll never look at Little Debbie's treats again without thinking of Bryson, but most of all of Katz.Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars: the last 75 pages could have been scratched. Once the non-dynamic duo left the Trail, I lost interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Until my final year of college I have read a total of 4 novels in my life. Then I ended up reading 14 in one semester. So I decided to read something for fun, and that is what this book is. This book is perfect for people who love to hike, camp or live a simple life, but it is even better for people who don't normally like to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, hangs a bit just before the end","review":"I love Bill Bryson's writing. I'm about 90% of the way thorugh this book of his about walking the appalacian trail. When I was in Australia I read his book abotu Australia, In A Sunburned Country and loved it. It's been a long time since I've laughed outloud as many times reading a book as I did sunburned country. I liked it so much I immediately bought several of his other books and read them. A walk in the woods is second in my opinion behind sunburned country. Most of it is very funny and informative especially when he's hiking with his long lost buddy, it does slowdown a bit just before the end. He leaves the trail and breaks the whole flow of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for naturalists and humorists alike!","review":"A Walk in the Woods is one of the best books I have ever read. The story line (two men walking the Appalachian Trail, as well as the history and fragility of the Trail) could make this book droll and boring, but Bryson keeps the story upbeat and laugh-out-loud hilarious. This book has a perfect combination of story and fact, and every page I learned something new. This book is an excellent choice for anyone aged 13 and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I read this book to my family while on a road trip. We all loved it. The first half is very entertaining with comical passages about the author's apprehension about bears and people he might meet on the trail. The description of Gatlinberg made me laugh till I cried. Unfortunately, the author put all his creativity in the first half of the book so the last chapters were boring. Still a good read. sp"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Read","review":"Bryson's story of hiking the AT is filled with humor, friendship and \\"Cliff Clavin\\" facts & figures about the history of people, places & things that he comes across. I really enjoyed reading this book.I read some negative reviews and think those are just ingnorant of the fact that it's a story, not a guidebook.If you like light-hearted adventure books, this one's a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"Haven't finished the book yet, but I've bitten through a great chunk. It's absolutely hilarious and has got me flippin' pages like a madwoman. This book was recommended to me from a woman at the gym (ironic?) and I didn't think it would be as funny as she had told me it was. Bryson has an amazing sense of humor, and knows a lot about what he's writing about. On a side note, the bear looks all cute and cuddly before you begin reading, but after you read about the bear accounts, you'll be wanting to hide from it... much like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun, funny, easy read","review":"really enjoyed reading this book as my son was hiking the AT. I was able to relate to the terrain and what he was experiencing when he would call me for his next shipments of food. Very entertaining and funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hiker must read!","review":"I am in the midst of planning my 2002 Thru-Hike of the Appalachian Trail, and I read this book over my Christmas vacation. It was simply delightful. Bryson and his friend Stephen Katz stumble through several interesting senarios and people as they make their transition to \\"mountain-men\\". If you like hiking stories you'll love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definetely worth reading...","review":"I just finished this, and having read a number of Bill Bryson's other works, I'd rate this on the high end, because in addition to a fabulous recollection of his hiking, he includes additional research on the history of the Appalacian Trail and other noteworthy places. The only criticism I have is that at certain sections, it does become a trifle boring when he really gets into a detailed analysis on the exact percentage of forest land in certain states, for instance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryson tackles his biggest hike","review":"This is a funny, informative and even poignant book. I think In a Sunburned Country is funnier, because he doesn't spare the hilarious excess in describing Australia and its inhabitants; he treats his fellow countrymen far more gently. His hiker friend Katz is just plain wonderful, a cream-soda-loving everyman facing the American wilderness. Really delightful.As usual, Bryson's book has a bibliography -- he's been reading up on the AT -- and you will learn lots about the AT and its flora and fauna, and even political history.I'm sad now that I finished the book. I'm looking forward to my next Bryson work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for A Walk in the Woods","review":"Our teacher reads this to us whenever she can, although we are 13-14 years old. It is funny and the author is clear in expressing what he feels on the trail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed out loud while driving...","review":"I bought this book on tape because I had a car trip I needed to take. Despite driving early in the morning, I found this to be a very funny story. Despite sitting in rush hour traffic, I found myself laughing out load -- really laughing out loud and crying. Haven't done that while driving ever before. My neighbors on the highway must have thought I was a bit weird, but the story made my trip go quickly.Sometimes I found the \\"history\\" bits often slow to develop. I prefer to hear about Bryson and his friends (Katz, Mary Ellen, etc.). However, it was still worthwhile. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Take a Hike!!","review":"Many authors can put a smile on your face as you read. Bill Bryson does more than that. He makes the reader laugh out loud as you read. You may try and prepare to prevent yourself from laughing out loud, so as not to disturb others in the room, but your attempts will be futile! Just like in his book \\"The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid\\", it is an enjoyable read.And, in this particular book, you not only laugh, you learn a lot of geography, history, etc.Even 16 years after its initial publishing, I recommend this book.Dr. Stanley E.

I can cross the Appalachian Trail off my bucket list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing is an understatement","review":"For the last several years I have been section hiking 100 miles or more of the AT. In all of the hiking forums I am a member of this book is always mentioned as the best one written about through hiking. Imagine my disappointment when I found that at most 30% of the book actually has anything to do with hiking. More than half of the book is a rant on how the federal government is destroying the national parks specifically and the environment in general. Perhaps Bill Bryson is Micheal Moore's pen name.If you are interested in learning what it is like to hike the AT search for hiker forums on the internet and read the trail journals of actual thru hikers.Read this book if you are out of shape or are a poor planner because thru hiking the AT is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but misguided","review":"Parts of the book were very funny, but there were many more parts of this book that I struggled with.1. He spoke of the majesty and beauty of Mother Nature as though this were all an accident and never once gave any credit to God the Creator.2. HE NEVER FINISHED THE TRAIL. HE SKIPPED MAJOR PORTIONS OF THE TRAIL.2a. He met up with a Christian couple who gave credit to God for the strength to COMPLETE THE ENTIRE TRAIL and proceeded to mock them. Really? How about you do half of what they did and then mock please?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment","review":"As one who lived at the base of the Appalachian Trail in Pennsylvania, I was delighted to receive this book as a gift for Christmas. And then when I read that Bryson \\"comes off as equal parts Garrison Keillor, ...and Dave Barry,\\" I was even more anxious to read the book. But what a disappointment. I laughed aloud maybe half a dozen times throughout the whole book, and found myself down-right bored for much of it. I was appalled that Bryson undertook to write a book about walking the Trail when he accomplished less than 40%."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lovely book- but he spoilt it by being petty and intolerant","review":"At first a wonderful read, until page 250. The author is conversing with a christian couple. He asks them if theu have ever thought of quitting (the hike). Their response: \\"we had a couple of low moments in the early phases but we put our faith in the lord and His will prevailed\\" The wife adds \\"Praise Jesus\\"Then the author writes:\\"I made a mental note to lock the door when I went to bed\\"Now what posessed him to make such needlessly unpleasant remark IN PRINT about a decent couple he met briefly.

The book was hilarious at times, granted, but the author doesn't come anywhere close to completing the trail, which is what it's supposed to be about, right? How can you rediscover America on the Appalachian Trail if you don't hike the Appalachian Trail to begin with? What idiocy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad 1 star is the lowest rating...","review":"As a Life Member of the ATC and a back backer who finds himself on the trail several times a year, I usually read everything I find about the trail. This book is insulting to anyone who loves hiking and an affront to southerners. In over 30 years of back packing and hiking, I have never met anyone quite as obnoxious as Mr. Bryson and his condescending hiking mate. Mr. Bryson wasted his time hiking the trail as he doesn't quite understand it's nature or purpose. I suggest you not waste your time reading his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"One reviewer above summarized this book perfectly: Bryson was much more committed to fulfilling a book deal than actually experiencing the wilderness. Generic, white-boy humor has its place, sure, but there are a million other books more worthy of your time! Try Ed Abbey, Tim Cahill, Bill McKibben...anything but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"walk in he woods, skim through the book","review":"I started out really enjoying this book, the first half is pretty funny. The second part, not so much. Bryson contradicts his words with his actions. He berates the forestry dept.(often with good reason) but writes about his friend Katz leaving a trail of trash as they walk the trail. The part where he gives up and drives a portion is boring and negative. The second and last parts seem to be filler, making a longish short story in a book. The author didn't seem interested in finishing the book and frankly neither was I. Borrow it from the library and skim the last part."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is wrong with america is people like byrson","review":"I enjoyed the book until about page 50 when he decided to abandon his quest of thru hiking and take the lazy 'city slicker' attitude of driving to spots and day hiking and trying to convince himself that he was fulfilling his goal. He cheated himself and he cheated his book by not truly hiking the trail.What is even more maddening is the fact that he has the audacity to make fun of people or point out their flaws of the hikers that start out to thru hike, but turn around after a few days or weeks. Bryson, here is a news flash...you are one of those people.Also, i really hope that bryson shared a portion of his profits with 'katz', because without his anecdotes the book would be absolutely miserable. when you decided to portion hike the trail it persuaded me to portion read your lousy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Unabridged and Bryson isnt Reading It","review":"Other reviews deal with the subject of this book at length, and I vaguely recall reviewing the book version myself years ago, so this is by way of a brief update. My husband and I checked this out of our library for a recent car trip. We have both read the book, and we both noticed things missing from this \\"unabridged\\" edition, despite its many cds. I'd like to know why it's billed as unabridged when it is definitely not. I'd also like to add that I wasn't crazy about the reader, but the reader isn't Bill Bryson, as so many other reviews seem to assume. Even with these flaws, the story is still a great one, although it definitely appeals more to those who aren't hard core hikers. Those of use who would never use \\"unreasonable\\" to describe a fear of bears or put \\"only\\" in front of a ten mile hike will enjoy this story of two men, no longer young, who dare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idealistic start with an abandoned goal - a metaphor for the unsuccessful hiker","review":"Read chapter one and was thoroughly engaged. I set out on the journey to read this book like an idealistic hiker approaching the AT. Found myself laughing out loud at Bryson's interaction with characters along the trail before reaching the Smokies and \\"going off trail.\\". After that I feel as though the whole book lost it's purpose. Instead of intriguing interactions on the trail I got pop shot critiques of towns along the way. I get the feeling that Bryson only returned to the trail out of contractual obligation as his writing went from wanderlust to drudgery. The whole book is a metaphor for all those who start well and lose sight of their destination early on. I read the whole book. Didn't skip sections because they were less than expected. And like Bryson, when I reached the end of the journey I was relieved to get off the trail that he constructed. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about hiking the Appalachian Trail","review":"This book is not about hiking the Appalachian Trail. It is about Bill's failure to hike the trail. The book does show us about sections of the trail (aka areas of our country) but he unfairly portrays some of the areas and the people. In fact, he makes fun of them. The saddest part is that Bill did not truly experience/hike the trail and too many people think this book is a good example of AT hiking. How wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author celebrates his own stupidity.","review":"If you set out, intentionally unprepared, to a place that you know is unpleasant or dangerous, and have a miserable time when you get there, then you are not entitled to whine about it!This book consists of snobbish, patronizing whining. \\"Look at the funny natives\\" interspersed with \\"Gosh, this is hard. Guess I'll quit for a while and stay in a comfortable motel.\\"Bryson is on trademark form: self-indulgent and offensive. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does that work?","review":"As an outdoors person I kept waiting for the triumph, the agony and the glory. Well it wasn't there. I am disappointed by a book about hiking the AT by someone who never hiked the AT. There was some nice background but that all came from research done in the library on on the net. After spending my life in the outdoors I have encountered plenty of humor but very little on this trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"TWO FAT FAKE HIKERS","review":"I read this book as part of a Book Club - the selection was not made by me. I went in not knowing anything of this writer Bryson nor of the AT. I came out thinking what an incompetent writer and that the AT is probably a lot better than this whinger suggests.As for laughing out loud, I wonder at WHAT? Who would do this??? One reviewer answered this perfectly for me: Bryson is from Comedy Kindergarten.Give this book a PASS. Don't even bother to borrow it from your library. I'm sorry I wasted good Australian $$$ on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks !","review":"Yes I have read the book and I don't think it was well written.

Wonderfully educational and insightful. However, there should be a warning label, \\"do not read in public\\". This book is laugh-out-loud funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Entertaining","review":"This is a great getaway book that gives a fun, fast paced, and humorous account of hiking with a little knowledge sprinkled in. A nice escape from my everyday life at home in the 'burbs and at the office."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting and entertaining adventure!","review":"New outdoor-enthusiast friends recommended this Bill Bryson audio book to us for our drives to the Oregon Coast. Being a native Pennsylvanian, I thought it good to know more about the eastern US. The author's writing style is friendly and I was blown away by his lack of planning for a trip of this magnitude on the Appalachian Trail. I fouind his personal insights/opinions about the National Park system as well as history of native song bird and tree species literally vanishing extremely interesting. We had occassion to both laugh and feel deep dismay at some of the treatment of the land and people along this trek."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent and entertaining book on the AT.","review":"I was amazed to see that one reader complained here that the book was \\"curmudgeonly, sarcastic, and petulant.\\" Isn't that why it's fun? Instead of the typical writer-as-heroic-figure style of outdoor writing (see Jon Krakauer's Thin Air), Bryson makes fun of himself, his companion Katz, and lots of folks along the trail.The fact that he does not hike the entire trail helps to humanize the book. The story of Katz is worth following to the end, as well. The day-tripping in the middle is not as engrossing as the through-hiking, but that's how his trip went. If you want epic, try Jack London.Bryson's books on travel in England are also enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Informative","review":"A Walk in the Woods is marvellously entertaining. Like many of Bryson's other books, this one is filled with information - some fundamental, some trivial.Many parts are truly laugh out loud funny. As Bill's hiking partner, Katz provides a wonderful foil for Bryson.By the end of the book, I had developed a profound respect for both the Appalachian Trail as well as its hikers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop a beer and sit by the TV, Bill!","review":"At first I wasn't going to read this book. I'm an avid hiker--having hiked the AT across New England--and it didn't seem like a hiker's book. But after many recommendations, I read it anyway and discovered my gut feeling was right: this is not a hiker's book. It's a couch potato's book. Sure, it's amusing in places and I enjoyed those sections; in other parts the guy is obviously having a miserable time...and so did I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and entertaining","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book - far more than I thought I would. Bill Bryson has a conversational style of writing and you feel he is talking just to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep on writing, Bill","review":"Bryson continues to amaze, following his \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" smash with this work, which actually seems to explain why Terry Sanford may have lied about his South American sweetie (frankly, the Appalachian Trail sounds like it is more fun). The language is handled with great skill, and one can hardly see the tongue the author apparently has permanently but firmly planted in his cheek. This is one of the rare books I refuse to give up for the friends of the library fund-raiser."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"A humorous look at a failed Appalachian Trail thru-hike. Want to know what happens when you jump into a six month odyssey out of shape and unprepared? \\"a Walk in the Woods\\" happens. It's a good primer for what not to do, for anyone considering taking up hiking. Reads fast and includes a lot of history. There is probably more history than personal account, otherwise this book would be about forty pages, but if have any interest in the AT or forestry, it is still interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun filled great read for wilderness lovers","review":"Alot of fun to read. Typical of most of us who set out to do so many things, and they never quite end up the way we expect them too. I'm not a great reader, and I flew through this book due to Mr. Bryson's great writing style and humor.. from planning the trip in EMS, and being scared about bears, this book is true to form."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilarious narrative of two less-than-average-Joe-hikers","review":"True through-hikers will undoubtedly hate this book. But if you, like me, fall somewhere between a couch potato and a trail god, you will love this narrative of two guys who fall for the allure of the trail, to be quickly smacked in the butt by the difficult reality of survival in the woods. Bryson has managed to laugh at himself, and make me laugh with him, as he recounts the Quixotic attempts of himself and his \\"Pancho\\", Katz, as they tilt at the Appalachian Trail with little preparation. I don't know if Katz is real or fictional, but I laughed out loud at his grumbling dedication. Excellent writing, with tidbits of the biology, geology, and Americana along the AT make this a roundly entertaining book. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book!","review":"I've come to the conclusion after reading all these reviews that it's a good thing books aren't written by committees. Buy this book. Read this book. Give it to a friend. If you want to read a book about specific techniques of hiking the AT, get a pamphlet from REI. This is a story about two guys who try to hike the AT. That's it. Simple. And terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Driving Along the Trail Doesn't Make You a Hiker","review":"I read this a decade ago, and thought it fun. On re-reading I've come away with a different conclusion: Bryson's book is more about senseless complaining and girlish terror than a representation of the love of hiking. His constant fear of bear, wolverine, mountain lion, little-debbie cakes, blackfly, drowning, starving, repetitive complaints about murder and crime, exotic viruses and PTSD as a result of hiking overemphasizes a mere micro-fragment of the whole story. His treatment is biased to an impossible degree and under-inspiring. If he had to write about Disney World, his treatise likely would expound upon the tediousness of waiting in line, the vastness of the boredom and the quantification of the aggregate hours waited and its unnproductiveness (perhaps the impact of queuing on national economies). What Bryson demonstrates is that in-spite of the opportunity (that many cubical-jockeys would clamor for), he has learned nothing. I'm appalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorous yet offending","review":"I was really starting to enjoy this book until he came into the Smoky Mountain part of the trail. He described Gatlinburg Tennessee in a hillbilly manner. As everyone knows,because The Great Smoky Mountain National Park is the most visited place in America,this is not the case.He speaks of Eastern Tennessee as if he hiked the trail in the 1800's. It's funny how he found no problem insulting these people but did not like being questioned about the reasons he hiked the trail although he was a fat out of shape cry baby. (Sleeping in hotel rooms and eating at restaraunts) Well, I've given my 2 cents worth and can see that in this forum he has friends that rate the bad reviews as unhelpful. I see no reason that this will not change. Just remember Mr. Bryson, our \\"smarts\\" here in Eastern Tennessee may not be up to your standards but we never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I'm not going to write a lengthy review summarizing the book, but just wanted to add my 2 cents-so to speak. This is the first book I have read by the author and I truly enjoyed every word. I was drawn to the book because a co-worker of mine had a daughter that hiked the trail one summer. I couldn't even imagine what her experience had been like and this book gave me some understanding of the experience. Do I think the AT hikers are crazy? Absolutely! Am I a little envious of their experiences? A resounding Yes! Conflicting emotions about the whole thing? Totally!Thank you to the author, for letting me live vicariously through his experience, if only for a brief period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"This is quite possibly the funniest book I have ever read. Bryson's opening chapters covering his fear of bears had me laughing so hard, that I actually cried. A must read for not just a great laugh, but an imapssioned exploration of our country's natural wonder. When I read it, I often find myself moved to hit the local trails for my own walks in the woods."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk In The Woods - Re-visited","review":"While this is DEFINITELY NOT a how-to book, much can be learned from this outrageously funny book of trail tales, mostly about what happens when disaster meets determination along the Appalachian trail.When this came out, I bought it to pass the time on a plane trip from Portland, Oregon to Orlando with my manager who NEVER laughs. I gave it to him instead, and he laughed all the way to Florida!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game to take to college!","review":"No matter how many college parties I've been to, the ones that played twister were the best!

Great candidate but the last guy was an ardent, principled fan also and look what happened to him. The owners took over the commissioner's office and the game with it as well. They should read this book. As should the players and Don Fehr. All parties are greedy and shortsighted.A thought provoking read for any fan. Costas, as he states early on, is no starry-eyed-baseball is poetry Field of Dreams guy, just a fan who loves the game. Costas makes great arguments for revenue-sharing (this resistant fan was won over), the elimination of the wildcard (even if he beats it to death, it does cheapen the regular season), eliminating the DH (almost convinced me), and a good one for salary caps (how do you handle guys locked into $11 milllion plus salaries if $10's your cap?)A lot of great ideas. Let's hope someone in a position of power and influence picks up on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Costas hits the marks on Baseball's problems","review":"When I first saw this book I thought it was going to be another \\"Baseball should never change book.\\" The usual dump the DH, turf, wild card games etc. Once I started reading it I soon realized it was much more. Baseball has serious problems that are keeping it from being a completive league. Costas describes clearly how the income differences between teams is hurting the game. Both the owners and the players are at fault. Each side is portrayed as caring mainly about their own interests vice the overall health of the game. Even though this book is 2-3 years old, baseball has not addressed any of the major issues in the book, so it is still current. If you want an educated debate on baseball beyond the 30 second ESPN analysis, check out this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair Minded...","review":"This is the book that no true student of the great game should be without. Costas goes in depth, detailing the miriad of problems baseball is facing. But, unlike most commentators, Costas offers rational, realistic solutions to the problems he presents. While not taking sides with either the owners or the Players Association, Costas offers good advice for both. Clearly, all parties involved should read this book and seriously consider his suggestions before Baseball Armegeddon occurs. One caveat though, if you don't come into this book with a fundamental understanding of baseball economics and the history behind the dispute between the players and owners, don't bother reading it. Try picking up \\"Lords of the Realm\\" first (its long but worth it), then pick up this great and fair minded book."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOME RUN","review":"This book was well written and very well thought through.

Costas illustrates when and how baseball went downhill, and describes a comprehensive plan to make things right again.Now if only we could get the owners and players union to agree..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Fair Ball\\" Is a Hit with This Fan","review":"Bob Costas has always been my favorite baseball broadcaster -- he's articulate, knowledgeable in the game's rules, personalities and idiosyncracies, and passionate in his love of the sport. Most importantly, he manages to share all of that with the viewer or listener. \\"Fair Ball\\" offers a similar experience. Costas eruditely breaks down the problems with today's game, e.g. the competitive imbalance in large vs. small markets, and offers solid solutions. For those who've read Whitey Herzog's \\"You're Missin' a Great Game,\\" this book picks up on many of the same topics, but presents them from a less biased perspective. Diehard baseball fans will find much of interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful look by a devoted fan","review":"Kostas critiques baseball and proposes several common-sense changes. He attacks extended playoffs, and shows how the current revenue disparities make it difficult for many small-market teams to compete effectively. Kostas also calls for a combined salary cap and salary floor. Actually, a decent salary floor makes lots of sense, and probably should be applied to the minor leagues, where (unbeknownst to many) lots of players and umpires barely make enough to live on. But I was surprised by the author's call for taking the players down a notch, and the last couple years have seen some teams with modest payrolls (Minnesota, Houston, White Sox) attain success.This is a concise and readable book, a bit dated, but clearly an intelligent look by one of baseball's most thoughtful fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read the reviews and had high expectations. I like Costas on TV, and had been led to expect a meaningfully insightful discussion. The book disappoints. The book revolves around only a handful of observations and a handful of remedial suggestions that even a modest baseball fan (like me) will find fairly obvious.Here's the book: Big market teams have a lot more money, so they have bigger payrolls, thus better players, so they tend to win all the time. This isn't good for the game, since poor teams will not survive and there'll be no one left for the rich teams to play. Some sort of revenue-sharing would even things out somewhat and, in the end, help everyone.Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball Like It Oughta Be","review":"Author Bob Costas weaves simplified arguments FOR the game of baseball that makes too much sense! Reading the book, I found myself nodding my head in agreement. Will baseball listen to his suggestions? Never! And it's too bad, because Costas makes some valid points on what is wrong with the game these days and how to amend it. Highly recommended for baseball fans everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and Self Important","review":"I received this book as a gift, the author is a silly and pretentious clown, an intellectual lightweight who can neither write nor think. I remember seeing him hugging Mickey Mantle's coffin to try to get himself some kind of credibility in the game. He is worse than George Will. If you want writers who know about baseball and can write, try Bill James, Peter Gammons and Roger Kahn. This book and man are monuments to our semi-literate and shallow times."},{"rating":"2","title":"some good ideas about fixing a great game","review":"Bob Costas brings up so interesting facts about how to save baseball it can also be stated as a case to save all profesional sports like the NHL so this is a good book for even non baseball fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"Costas makes an admirable debut","review":"Costas brings to light several issues with Major League Baseball that have been inherent through the 90's. Everyone knows that small market teams simply cannot compete with the big market clubs with their cable revenues and such. Costas, however, brings in the emotional side of this issue. Is it really fair to the fans and how will this effect baseball in the future? Costas has always been a proponent of bringing to light controversial issues in sports. With this book, he makes it clear that there are problems with America's past time and because it is Costas, people will listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Obvious","review":"In less than 200 pages (with very large margins) Costas says practically nothing. Salary cap, revenue sharing, yada, yada. At the end of the day we all know what SHOULD happen, but how can we MAKE it happen? If Bob takes up the mantle as baseball's next commisioner, I fully support it. But for now his book is a waste of paper. And please don't tell me how Pete Rose belongs in the Hall of Fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Costas Hook Slides Into the Bargin Bin","review":"That such a slim (and I mean that in both the physical and intellectual sense) volume could boast a retail price of $21 seems as implausible as the fact that Brady Anderson once hit 50 home in a season.Both feats are freakishly true.The book is essentially a collage of old ideas for improving the Grand Old Game largely by tinkering with its economics -- salary caps, revenue sharing and a smattering of other financial fixes. None of the ideas he forwards are bad. Nor are any of them uniquely his. If you are a baseball fan (and you'd have to be to even consider purchasing the book) there's probably very little here that you haven't heard elsewhere.If you are one of the legion of Costas fans and are determined to buy this book, follow the advice heard by forlorn Brooklyn Dodgers fans of the 1950s : Wait 'Til Next Year when it's reduced to bargin bin pricing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Costas Should Stick to Broadcasting","review":"Although he makes many good points, a majority of the book is spent listening to Bob Costas whine about all the things wrong with baseball.

A quick, interesting read if you can get through the whining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commendable","review":"So long as you're not expecting a full on Hollywood production, and are actually interested in the history, this set does the job.

Nigel grows to have a fascination with food and cooking, and when his mother dies from asthma and his father soon after starts dating the cleaning lady (Bonham Carter) - who can cook like a professional chef - Nigel takes up the gauntlet to out-do her.

You'll laugh so hard as you play. It might be a little frustrating but it's still fun to play. You'll have to use your head to describe the word to your partner without using the words listed.

The music itself is warmer, as immediately evidenced by the plaintative piano chords on \\"Head Over Heels.\\" \\"White Out\\" introduces some well-received rhythmic variations on dub. Even the more reggae-oriented pieces like \\"Steady as a Rock\\" or \\"Joyful Noise (Pt. 1)\\" seem more filled out and less generic. \\"Fixed Elections\\" rings with old-skool IDM melodies and rhythms, while \\"Portable Memory (The Final Cut)\\" drifts away on echoing static and tones that open up possibilities beyond what is heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vertical Run","review":"A hard book to put down.

One of the best thrillers in years.","review":"I thought everything about the book was a 10. The story line,thecharacters, and the style of writing. I normally spend a few days reading a book, but I couldn't put it down. The only trouble I had with the book is that it had to end. I wish it had been 3000 pages long. Usually endings are not as good as the rest of the book, but this one was terrific, and very clever, partiularly the memo at the end. I almost passed over it without reading it. I hope there are more of these to come from Mr. Garber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, bad follow-through, horrible ending.","review":"This book starts out with a bang as the hero's boss strolls into his office and tries to kill him for no reason. However, the plot quickly goes downhill through a series of ridiculous action sequences, lame dialogue, boring office descriptions, and lousy Vietnam flashbacks. This book is told in the third-person, yet it never leaves the main character, eliminating any opportunity for character development besides his. The pointless office descriptions are a lame excuse by the author to brag of how much he knows about corporate America. The main villan was a wuss and the other uninteresting characters sucked. The ending was very anticlimactic and several plot threads were left dangling. I normally like books with a lot of action but this one reeked! I burned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh, what's so great about this book??","review":"I was surprised at the number of good reviews that this book had. I found it to be silly for a number of reasons. The whole plot itself, for instance. The silly dialoge, and silly characters are another problem. And what's with these stupid Vietnam flashbacks? This story couldn't beat Die Hard if tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've heard/read in a long time!","review":"I just got finished listening to the audiobook version of this book. 8 tapes of almost non-stop action and psychological warfare. I listened to this book because one of the book groups where I work is reading it. A fellow librarian said she had read it, and had LOVED it, so I picked it up from another library, and got totally immersed in it. I felt for David Elliott, who didn't have a clue as to why everyone would try to kill him. He was amazing, in all his combat mode, and Guardian Angel's mutterings. I can't believe he outwitted everybody! I want to see the movie, and think there should be a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time best.

It's silly and not the least exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring paranoid fantasy","review":"Joseph Garber's \\"Vertical Run\\" was a mindless supposed action thriller that fortunately was a very easy read. The plot was a pale and predictable rehash of more polished examples of this genre.47 year old Dave Elliot is a high ranking executive of the Senterex corporation, a successful conglomerate, with offices on the 45th floor of a New York skyscraper. Elliot, a former Green Beret that served in Vietnam, while at work, without warning inexplicably becomes the target of all those he comes in contact with. This bewildering cat and mouse game commences when his boss, owner of Senterex, the pudgy Bernie Levy pulls a loaded gun on Elliot. In short order Elliot discovers that a large mercenary team has been dispatched to find and execute him. Elliot, as expected, uses all his military guile and cunning to evade his pursuers and determine why he has been targeted.Garber certainly did not come close to enticing me to pick up any of his other work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skilled, suspenseful writing makes this book a quick read","review":"When a friend of mine loaned me his copy of this book, I admit, I had my doubts. After reading such adventure novels as Clive Cussler's insipid Dirk Pitt series, I couldn't see what made my friend rave so much about the book. I tossed the book aside for weeks and only read it to kill time while I waited for spagetti to boil one night for dinner. The only reading break I took for the next three hours was to turn of the stove when the pot boiled over!While there is relatively little room for creativity in this genre, the author's fast-paced, seemless prose easily compensates for this intrinsic flaw. He uses suspense to enhance his story line far better than any of his contemporaries, and possibly even better than masters like Poe. While, this book screams to be made into a blockbuster movie, I can only hope that the movie stays close to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, fantastic book","review":"Excellent book, I enjoyed every minute of it.

The \\"green beret, badest of the bad\\" now top corporate executive and favored by all comes head to head against his ex-Nam compatriots, now set on killing him. They convince his boss to try first. Mid 60's, fat and emotional ... who is this succesfull corporate take-over guy? Who then, in a burst of self pity committs suicide.

Just plain awful.","review":"Ok... for all potential readers of this book, allow me to offer you a scene directly from the text (in my own words of course). Our hero has managed to get his hands on one of his enemies' two way radios. When the enemy realizes that our hero has been listening, he offers our hero a chance to speak his mind. Our hero takes this opportunity to address his foe, and do you know what our author has the hero say to the man who is trying to kill him? \\"Up your poop with an ice cream scoop.\\" That, my friends, is what you can expect from this piece of crap. Ignore the five star ratings. This book sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"fast-paced thriller lacking substance","review":"A quick read if you don't mind a lack of characterization and richness in plot. I had this around a 3.5 star rating halfway through the book...however, it never did turn the corner and take it to the level I thought it could've reached. I may be considered picky, but I like good character development and a plot with good context and I found this novel lacking in both. However, I did read just about the entire book so it did enough for me to get through it for the most part. I lost interest in the character and plot 3 quarters of the way through, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Die Hard revisited?!?!?!","review":"When a high profile movie such as Die Hard comes out, about terrorist taking over a skyscraper, and the author; Joseph Garber comes up with story about a man trapped in a building with terrorists types what's the big deal? That's not original. Anyone can take a movie change it a little and take credit as original. Give me a break, write about something original and stay away from high profile movies.

Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre writing","review":"I'm a huge fan of Stephen Hunter and James Garber was recommended to me as an author who is a close second to Mr. Hunter--WRONG. This book has an extremely linear plot, ridiculously one-dimensional characters, and absurd stilted dialog. I couldn't believe how silly some of the characters sounded. Scott Thatcher talks like a cartoon character. David's wife is a horror that makes you wonder what he was thinking to hook up with her in the first place. Ransome is supposed to be an intimidating villain but is just predictable and boring. There are no surprises in the plot.

They've updated the Extreme III series with a new \\"2008\\" spec model. Yeah, so what... Well, the 2008 spec Extreme III 16GB CF card is almost twice as fast as the original \\"20x\\" Extreme III 16GB CF card in my Nikon D3. In fact, the 2008 16GB model is just marginally slower than my Extreme IV 8GB card in my D3. This speed increase makes a big difference for me when shooting motorsports in RAW mode and hyperactive children. Even crazier still, as of this review, Amazon is selling the 2008 spec Extreme III 16GB card for ~$15 less than this much slower model.Do yourself a favor before buying one of these cards and see how it will perform in your camera first... google for \\"Rob Galbraith CF performance database\\" and look up your camera.

Card works fine, but I get the impression that it is actually slower, substantially so, than the Ultra II card I replaced. There is a noticeable pause while the camera writes the image to the card. The Ultra II card had a slight delay as well, but nothing long as this one. Of course, I am using an older camera which was not designed to use a high capacity card like this, but I can't believe the delay is because of that. My impressions are based on a week-long session with the card and over 500 snaps. I would seriously consider using a camera that uses an SD card instead, seeing as to how the other camera we use does not have a noticeable delay using the SD Ultra II card by Sandisk."},{"rating":"1","title":"compatability a major problem","review":"I called Sandisk before I bought this card and after 20 or 30 minutes of them \\"researching\\" they assured me that any \\"type II\\" card reader can read the card.After, shopping among many reader versions.

When it would not read the extremeIII 16gb card, I called Sandisk back and they then let me talk to someone who actually knew what he was talking about. He said sorry we gave you misinformation, but there is nothing we can do about it. Except, SELL me one of their card readers of which there is only ONE usb version that will read this card, and not cheap. I mistakenly went on Sandisks reputation, which is apparently evolving. I recommend to buy several smaller more compatable cards. I currently have no way to access any of my raw images on this card, as the software will only download the jpgs from the camera.

The chapters on bats, rodents and whales summarize the state of the art knowledge of scientifical research in mammalogy dealing with these critical issues. Perhaps, it would have been very interesting the addition of Meridiungulata, the main South American taxon, which is not mentioned in tthis revision.

Besides lacking any of the wit of Schine's earlier books, the plodding narrative reads more like an essay with occasional illustrations than a novel. Jane (far and away the story's least interesting character) revels in a narcissism so unbearable that Schine's superficial asides on Darwin are easier to swallow than Jane's agonizing over lost friendship. And the heroine's \\"evolution\\" doesn't begin until a page or two before the end, making for a quite unbelievable revolution.

Unlike Schine's previous works, I found this one to be mostly a chore, although there were moments of great humor. Jane is one of the most self-absorbed and self-deluded characters I've encountered lately. Maybe this was the point, I don't know, but if so, it was not funny or instructive in the least. Martha and the other characters were also uninteresting -- there was not a single likable character in the entire book. There was too much information about the Galapagos Islands, too.

I thought the characters uninteresting and boring (glad I wasn't on that trip,) and the stuff on Darwin didactic and boring.If I wanted to know about evolution I'd go to Darwin direct andIf I wanted to know about lost friendship I think I'd search the Internet.

However, the characters are so shallow and so unlikeable I could only finish it in hopes that something awful would happen to them, especially Jane. I was drawn to this book having both lost a childhood best friend to unknown circumstances and being a student of evolutionary science,so it seemed to be a perfect fit. Unfortunately, it was not. But perhaps it is just a testament to the talent of the author that she was able to make such a strong characterization of Jane as to repel me. I just wish there had been more of a meaning to the story and to Jane's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, disappointing and unlikeable","review":"My entire book club was disappointed in the book.

I found much of the story improbable but I was still fascinated with the evolution of Jane which was her realization that Martha had not seen events in their early life in the same way.

I found it to be a welcomed break-away from a conventional novel. The balance of Non-fiction/fiction was superbly crafted. Ms Shine's wit and wisdom is both provocative and entertaining. Don't we all know a Jane somewhere? Or perhaps have a little of Jane's quirky narcisism lurking in ourselves that we cringe to acknowledge? I would venture that it's this dark truth, along with the risk-taking departure from conventional format, that readers find disturbing. But if you shake off preconception, it's a terrific read.

Also matches nicely with the white Bose speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not Work for me","review":"I bought this Adapter to connect my Accoustimass speakers in the pre-wired room and only one Channel (Left) worked, remaining did not work at all. I know the wires are all working as I can hear sound when I insert the wires into the left channel (the only channel that works)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree with Michigan Reader","review":"The dialogue at times was trying. It was really hard trying to figure out what was being said when Tanisha started speaking slang. She would have been just as good an ingenue coming from a middle class background as being a \\"soul\\" sister. But, the story was good and I really enjoyed reading the book and the relationship between Tanisha and Wheeler was developed nicely. Despite the gruesome detail of the tortures and the slang language, Riding the Snake is a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs technical guidance","review":"This is a fairly well-written and somewhat interesting novel, but it suffers greatly on the technical side. The author should consult someone with firearms expertise before publishing his next novel. It's hard to maintain an interest in a book when details don't ring true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some improvement","review":"There is a real novelty in this book: for the first time ever in Cannel's cosmology, a Latino character (Ram��n) is not directly associated with crime, dirt and grease altogether. Well ... he is an illegal immigrant, but hey!, you can't have it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trials and Tribulations","review":"What a good story. This is the first novel of his I have read. I will read more. I found the information on China and their triads, gangsters, and tongs to be very informative. The book was well researched. All in all a great fiction story with a non fiction base. We can beleive today the real enemy will be China in the future. I hope not for many years.Best of all it shows how our country is not protecting us by allowing all the illegal immigrants and now talking of their rights. Fiction is a close brother of non fiction, actually Siamese twins. Read it and weep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannell just gets better and better......","review":"Do not let the fact that Mr.Cannell is involved with television/Hollywood.... fool you regarding his ability to paint descriptive characters/places and plots with his words....if by chance you are like me and delight in finding an author that can actually make you look forward to picking up the book you are presently reading....and if you tend to read everything the author has written...then order 'Riding the Snake' with confidence and each of Cannell's previous works....'Riding the Snake' was entertaining as well as culturally illuminating...Cannell is one of those rare authors that allow us to relish where he has taken us...and to wait in anticipation of his next work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting!","review":"Mr. Cannell's descriptions of Hong Kong and South Central LA were so vivid it wouldn't be hard to imagine that he has spent extensive time in both places. One reviewer said that the relationship between Wheeler and Tanisha seemed rushed and unrealistic. In my opinion, he did an excellent job of flushing out their feelings and fears while making the decision to become lovers. Having been in the same type of relationship, under similar circumstances, it was as if Stephen Cannell had either read my diary or been part of my life during that part of my life. I would love to see this as a movie - it has all of the elements to make a really good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well crafted thriller written with great passion.","review":"Mr. Cannell writes with great passion, and that distinguishes him from most of the other thriller writers around. This book also shows that he has thoroughly researched its subject: Asian gangs and their roots in Hong Kong. He also takes chances that most other thriller writers wouldn't take, such as making one of his main characters an African American female. Somehow, he is able to get inside characters who are completely different in background from himself, and make them believable. The action scenes in this book are riveting and violent without being gratuitous. The overall premise is timely and genuinely scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed","review":"This is an excellent book to read if you want to be kept on the edge of your seat. I enjoyed reading about places in China that I have never heard of. The relationship between the two main characters could have been developed more but for me all the action made up for it. The characters are a BW and WM that fall for each other but there wasn't much romance because of everything else that was going on around them....it was still an awesome read and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"20 Tine Manure Fork","review":"Couldn't find this in any store.

While Evans makes a lot of jokes about squirreling cash away in the sock drawer, what her book is really about is evening out the financial balance in a marriage. Her message is that even in good marriages, women need to retain the independence that comes from earning, managing and/or saving their own money. After I read this book I didn't start \\"hiding\\" money, but I DID re-think a lot of my financial habits and assumptions - much to the benefit of my entire family. Evans' book is easy to read, very funny, and a perfectly serious commentary on how money affects the balance of power between women and men. So don't sweat the title - read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful!","review":"I think this book was superb. I don't see it as a way to undermine a relationship. INstead i see it as a way for women to remain financially independent during marriage. As everyone knows these days, marriage is not always a sure thing. Having a nest egg of her own will allow any woman who finds herself in the throes of divorce to prevent herself from becoming destitute. The book was funny yet highly informative and I know that I will most certainly put the information in it to good use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very misguided book","review":"A better topic for a book would be how to build a financial future together as a couple. Instead we have been given a book on how to undermine a relationship. The book has the general undertone that men are stupid and anything a women does for herself is, therefore, alright. Would the authors also propose that men also hide money from their wives? Would the authors argue that there are other areas in a relationship where one spouse should lie to the other? Relationships can be hard enough to build without an instruction book on how to take them apart. The authors should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"SICK..","review":"I haven't fully read the book but the first few chapters made me throw up out of disgust!In the same line with the other reviews/comments about this book, I find this work not only immature in approach but also teaches wives how to 'cheat' on their husbands; generalizing that all husbands/men deserve such treatment.The fact that Joan Rivers was quoted in the book cover tells you how LOW the author would go to promote this book.HALF-A-STAR is my rating on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess OJ read \\"How to murder your wife\\"????","review":"Nothing much I can say other than what a sick subject.

I started listening to merengue tipico about year ago and I really like the energy that's produced by the principal instrument, the accordion. If this genre of music is new to you I could assure that Agapito Pascual is one of the best in the business. I became interested in his music thanks to the Aqui esta la bachata compilation series that have some merengue tracks by the artist on various volumes. In a nutshell, this album is superb. Put on your dancing shoes because this merengue will just move you in all directions. All of the songs are great and the rhythms are very upbeat. I extremely enjoy track #4- Me esta enganando and # 6 Por ser egoista. His style is one of kind.

I spent three days tracking down a vendor who had apparently charged me $490 over the course of a month only to discover that the transactions were normal ATM withdrawals that Money had just decided to import from the online bank as being from that particular vendor.

I have had corruptions in which I had to export all transactions from all accounts, create a new file, then re-import. Just lately though, Money keeps dropping transactions or adding its own. The result is that what Money says I have is completely different to what my online bank statement says I have. This happens even after I have reconciled against my latest statement.

The expert user wants a few choices - MONEY gives you everything. Yes, you can customize it but when you first start out (and all you really want to do is pay your bills on line), it is a bit overwhelming to see so many things on one opening screen. Also, the voice introduction is a bit unnerving but that can be turned off quickly.This is an improvement over previous versions as you can save your payments as drafts and then submit the drafts all at one time for payment.But there still is quite a bit of repetition that should either be eliminated or give the user a choice.My advise would be: Clear out the clutter but keep the quick and effortless way and this would be a first class program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - MS Money 2003 Expires after one year!","review":"Please read the EULA (end user license agreement).

The exact opposite was the case for Second Glance as I found myself struggling to continue after reading a mere 35 pages. All of the elements for a fantastic read are present as is Picoult's spot on writing technique, but the mark was missed by a mile. Another reviewer said that she kept waiting for something to happen and I couldn't agree more. Page after page I was waiting for that \\"it\\" moment which brought it all together but that moment just wasn't there. This novel just did not make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My All Time FAVORITE Books!","review":"Impossible to tear yourself away from this book!

I really wish Ms. Picoult would write more books like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well crafted, but contrived.","review":"Jodi's books have good plots, a twist, a nice legal battle and enough emotion thrown in to make for a great beach read. It aint literature, however, nor will it change your life. Second Glance was just that--good, but not great, it didn't flow that well (I could pinpoint structure and plot changes and character set-ups, sometimes it was like reading an example from an eleventh grade writing class) and the predictable love story was unbelievable and boring and just 'ugh' inducing. (Like most of her novels, including her latest 'my sister's keeper)I recommend it for a beach read, and to rent out of the library, but don't spend good money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this one","review":"Not only was it a great chance to escape from reality for a while it also kept touching on and teaching about a little known (well, at least I didn't know about it) piece of our history. I had never even heard of an eugenics project until I read this but it has me searching for more information. The story itself was fascinating. At first, each character seemed so disconnected from the other that I couldn't even imagine where we were being taken. By the end of the book their lives are so intertwined...amazing. What a wonderful way to tell a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Jodi Picoult's research into the history of the eugenics movement in the United States made for very interesting reading.

Like several reviewers I have been struggling through this one. It bounces between present day, back 70 years, then back to present day. The detail about the characters, etc in the present day is just too much, simply uninteresting, perhaps irrelevant. I am still reading and waiting to see, hoping for a satisfying ending, but wanted to read other opinions to be sure I wasn't alone, because this is so frustrating! Actually, I very much enjoyed the foray into 1930's eugenics, and this section had stayed with one character so I found myself riveted to this part. Now back into the present day, I am again, though much more interested and vested in the outcome, just so frustrated by the painstaking detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Enough Hours in the Day","review":"I truly enjoy Jodi Picoult novels but this IS the best.

I saw this book on sale in the clearance section of my local grocery store and needed a book to read so I gave it a chance. I'm so glad I did!First off, I love a good ghost story and this novel definitely has that. The only negative to this book is that it's one of those that starts off with so many different characters and their own stories that it's hard to keep them all straight. The author acknowledged this as a risky move in the Q&A; section at the end, but it worked out and came together nicely.The characters are a little over-the-top in that they each have extreme personalities. One's totally suicidal; one's totally into vocabulary words; one's totally a non-believing scientist. There's no average character who doesn't just possess a few quirks which I feel would have made the story more plausible.I do recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Glance Disappointment","review":"I have throroughly enjoyed every Jodi Picoult novel, and eagerly await each new release. Unfortunately, I am so extremely disappointed in the latest, Second Glance. There was something so definitely missing - I perservered to the end, thinking that surely something that had been missing throughout would occur to make it all tie in together, but it just didn't happen. I have been interested to read other excellent reviews of this book, but I am slightly relieved to find my friends who also have Ms Picoult as one of their favorite authors, are also very disappointed. The wonderful writing style is strangely still there, but the story line just couldn't hold me - as I mentioned earlier, I spent most of the book waiting for something to happen. An extremely far fetched story that is possibly best left to authors you would normally expect to write a 'far fetched' story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried so hard...","review":"I feel like a failure. I tried sooooo hard to get into this book, but it was the literary equivalent of pulling teeth. Tonight was it... I finally gave up. It was the first Jodi Picoult book I picked up and it will probably be my last. I've had this book for over a month and every time I try to pick it up I start nodding off with in an hour of reading it. I can't seem to get in to. I feel awful because everyone keeps saying what a great read this is; I wish I had the same experience. She seems like an awesome writer, but the pace at which the plot/ characters is unveiled (coupled with the storytelling style) makes this just too difficult to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I liked this book, because of the writing style and how every character fits together.

And is it supposed to mean that only females are interested in stories about human relationships? Aren't relationships the center of every life? Pretty much, unless you're an independently wealthy single orphan hermit (even those are probably all at least online these days).Well I wouldn't call this maudlin, absurdly improbable, sophomoric effluvium literature (lines like \\"letting the smoke curl down his throat like a question mark\\" sells millions?), and I don't believe that any self-respecting, intelligent female would call herself a chick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"For some reason, Jodi Picoult's books sound alot better when I read about them instead of actually reading them.

Good reading for the insomniac."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need a lot of patience to get through this!","review":"I don't.

Bad idea. First, The Sixth Sense has been done! Enough of the kids seeing dead people already! It's really getting tiresome. Second, two of the characters were called by three different names, which was confusing. Cecelia was also Cissy and Lia. Grey Wolf was also Az and John.

I did feel that the book could have been condensed a little, especially since I had pretty much figured out the outcome of the book several pages from the end. True to form, there were some twists and surprises, but all in all I liked the story and appreciated the extensive research on the subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of my favorites..","review":"I have likes many of Jodi Picoult books but this is my least favorite that I have read to date. I listen to many audio books on my drive and I'm usually looking forward to getting in the car to here the next \\"chapter\\". This one didn't grab my attention. I had to force myself to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Glance","review":"I am a fan of Jodi Picoult books so when I started reading this I justexpected it would be so good, it's true she maintains her high qualityof writing but the theme of this story, plus the amount ofcharacters she introduces in a short period of time, madefor uncomfortable reading. Three times I tried to read ituntil I finally put it down as not my kind of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Fan","review":"I have been a big fan of Jodi Picoult since reading THE PACT. In her books the characters are so rich and well developed and she writes so well about such touchy subjects and the complexity of human relationships that you can't put her books down and are left wanting more.For me this book was not a \\"spell-binding suspense novel\\" as touted on the cover, rather a story of family and relationships and inner deamons. I love the fact that Jodi's characters are so multi-faceted and so real that you actually care what happens to them long after you finish the book.If you are just discovering Ms. Picoult, I envy you, if you've been a fan and have read several of her books, you know that every time you crack the cover on a new one, you can count on a satisfying, substantive read."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be able to put this book down!!","review":"This was an amazing book. The twists and turns that Jodi takes you through in this book both suprise and amaze. There was no figuring out the ending of this book long before getting to it and there was a new suprise on every page. My advice, don't pick up this book unless you have time to read it because you truly will not be able to put it down until you've read the last word. It is one of those books that makes you wish it would never end and when it does it leaves you wanting more!! Bravo to Jodi Picoult she is an amazing writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the sticky beginning","review":"After getting past a few chapters of confusing dialogue, too many characters and intense language, Second Glances comes together to be an inteteresting and informative story of history, love and relationships. Set in picturesque Vermont, a tumultuous Ross Wakeman is looking for paranormal disturbances on what is said to be an Indian burial ground. In his search, he happens upon Lia - a long-deceased woman who comes to him in a loving manner. Unable to forgive himself for the death of his girlfriend, Ross sets out to find out why Lia's spirit features prominently on this land. In doing so, he meets many people and learns interesting news about the small town as well as about himself. A wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Second glance by Jodi Picoult","review":"Received this book in good time, good condition. the author fully involves the reader, and always surprises in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"look away","review":"Maybe if I had read this book of hers first I would have a better opinion of it. But I thought it droned on and on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I believe.","review":"I always enjoy how Jodi Picoult writes about such controversial issues. It really gives each of us a chance to seee both sides of an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Glance","review":"For some reason, I did not connect with this novel. Not the Authors fault, butmine. Will try another time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another page-turner from Picoult!","review":"I could NOT put this book down! I enjoy how Picoult can weave in history into a story. I also loved how the book moved from character to character until you could connect all the dots together. I was surprised a few times by the turn of events, and I was surprised also at the ending.If you like mystery, fantasy, romance, and history, then this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First time Jodi reader...loved it!","review":"This is a great book! Whether you're a fan of the paranormal, mysteries, historical fiction, or romance, you'll love it! I look forward to reading more of Jodi's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I am an avid Jodi Picoult reader. This is the first of her's that did not have me staying up late to read more. In fact, this is the first of her's that took me more than a few days to read. Perhaps I would have enjoyed this book if I wasn't anticipating the fierce enjoyment I receive from every other Jodi Picoult novel. Basically I am just disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you guessing","review":"Another great Jodi Picoult book. Great ghost story. Keeps you guessing and keeps you turning the pages wanting to want more. One of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"ghosts, love and mystery","review":"At first I was a little skeptical of this book, but then after I got past the first couple chapters and was able to keep everyone straight, I could not put it down! I was eagerly awaiting for Ross to meet Lia again and again! I love how everything came together in the end. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and thought-provoking as usual for Jodi Picoult","review":"Jodi Picoult is an excellent researcher and always presents a balanced point of view. Although there are many characters in this book, each is deep and multi-faceted. As everything unfolds, some of the connections seem a little improbable, but in Jodi Picoult style, everything meshes together well. I am a big J.P. fan, and this book didn't disappoint me...it was another one that I just couldn't put down. When you finish, it stays with you, causing you to consider things you hadn't really thought about before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Glance","review":"Comtosook, Vermont is a sleepy little town that has suddenly been thrown into turmoil over a development battle on what the Abenaki Indians believe is a sacred burial ground.Ross Wakefield is investigating the ghosts that the Abenaki feel have been disturbed by the construction. In doing so, he will stir up many secrets within the community and Vermont's history of eugenics as well as some unexplainable phenonmenon.As usual, Jodi Picoult tells a captivating story that has the readers questioning what they believe. There were a few loose ends in this one as the cast of characters is large, but a great read on interesting subjects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I am a huge, huge Picoult fan. I think her writing is fabulous, and her plots are usually riveting.However, I found this book so cliched, I could barely believe that it was written by the same author I've loved for years. It was juvenile and predictable, even though she tried to add plot twists. The metaphors and similies were overused. I almost didn't finish it, but decided to give it a chance. Sadly, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"rls releif","review":"Sedorum did help my rls to a good extent. I now have several days and nights a week when I don't have rls. When I do have it, the length of the spasms are reduced to about 1/2 hour instead of 4 to5 hours and the severity is reduced at night so I can sometimes even sleep through it. I have to say that it has helped, and I have only been taking it about 2 weeks. Possibly it will reduce the symptoms more when I am using it longer. Either way, I definitely plan to keep using Sedorum for my rls. Thank you for this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Enrichment Tool for Couples!","review":"This book appears to be written for couples that still have young children at home. Therefore most of the \\"suggested dates\\" are directed towards that age group.

It is a valuable tool and I'm glad we have this resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it is finished - no target audience here either","review":"There is nothing ground breaking or even new in this book.

It is an okay book but one I wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"40 Unforgettable Dates with Your Mate","review":"20 Unforgettable Dates with Your Mate was forgettable.

I was expecting a straightforward list of 40 date ideas, not a sermon. Religion aside, I was bored before I got that far.If you are Christian with plenty of time, this may be for you.If your time is valuable and/or your not Christian, a quick search on google will turn up better ideas for dates that most people can relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"No god stuff for me thanks.","review":"I appreciate my fellow seculars giving me the heads up about all the christianess of it.

With a title like \\"40 Unforgettable Dates with Your Mate\\" one might assume (as I did) that there would be a list of these 40 dates. I started reading the book and couldn't even finish it. Just wasn't what I expected and I did not care for the story book style. I'm glad this was a free book on Amazon and I didn't waste my money on it.

One of my signature dishes is now the Hobakchon - fried zucchini. It came out quite tasty. Next I'll try the cold seeweed and cucumber soup. What I like best about the book is the many color pictures.

I was surprised to find, however, that the grammatical instruction is presented more in the workbook than in the textbook, which is the opposite of programs I've used before. Usually the lessons are presented in the text book and the workbook is for practice exercises. Despite that little quirk, I definitely recommend the Destinos series for anyone who wants to learn Spanish."},{"rating":"2","title":"So simple to understand","review":"I purchased Destinos Student Edition for my spanish class I was taking online.

Most important to me...all the blocks with the pic of an elephant are misspelled and read \\"elerhant\\". The pictures over all are not great. The grapes look like cherries...have you ever seen candy apple red grapes? The apples look like red pumpkins. Some of the blocks have pictures but the corresponding letter has been replaced by a symbol and other letters...confusing to a child trying to learn. Additionally, the quality of these blocks is not great as the paint was already scratched off on a few when they arrived and the wood is frayed on some. They have a strong odor (kind of like clay). Lastly, they are quite small as others warned although the size is clearly written in the description. I expect to see a set like this at a dollar store and would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning before letting our baby touch them.","review":"We are returning these blocks without letting our baby use them.

Eight months later, I brought them out and he enjoyed playing with them. I was happy until I looked at the blocks more carefully. Each block has a picture with the name of the object below. Unfortunately, all the words under the elephant picture say ELERHANT. Do not buy these blocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secrets of Belltown","review":"I think it is a great book.

After 3 months, they seem as good as if not better than the OEM batteries. The originals were only good for 6-8 hours out of the charger, and would not hold any charge after 9 months. At 3 months these are still better than the originals ever were - the phones can be left off the charger over night and will stiull work though at least the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage In, Garbage Out","review":"This book speculates far more than good authors should do, especially dealing in the mind-boggling world of the serial killer. They are horribly wrong about the extent of Henry Lee Lucas' crimes (the numbers) and seem to know little about Ted Bundy that doesn't come from either Bob Keppel, Hugh Aynesworth or Stephen Michaud. Would love to see some original research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, feel great....not well made, customer service stinks","review":"This watch looks great and feels great. I receive compliments on it all the time. It's fairly well made, but it has started to fall apart after about 3 years of use. The pins have both been replaced several times. The watch clasp has been repaired. One of the minute marks on the face of the watch came off, which got the watch jammed and now the hour and minute hands are off. I have tried to call customer service multiple times. Sometimes I get through, sometimes I don't. When I finally did get through one and requested a replace band part (it broke, too), they sent me the wrong part. I called again.

But unfortunately this CD did absolutely nothing for me. I can't stand the Big Tymers. They are definately the weak link in Cash Money and shouldn't be on anyone elses tracks let alone have their own CD.

I've seen the concert while channel surfing and found myself totally mesmerized by the Big Tymers music. I sat frozen at my seat watching asthey performed their lofty masterpieces. And when the concert finished, I was at the verge of tears as I saw the love they has been hailed with and how people seemed to embrace them tenderly in their eyes. Sometime after that I rushed to buy this CD. Only to discover how limitless is the magic of music and how musicians can be true magicians. The incredible thing about Big tymers music is its immense variety. How it can echo our sadness, our delight, our rapture, our passions and even our fears. Sometimes you can almost trace a whole story between the folds of this music. You will surely find yourself captured between soft whispers and high-pitched notes. And between this and that, you will have no choice but to take your hat off for these wonderful artists and love them for the music they give."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Example of Mainstream Junk","review":"I don't mean to be spoiler to anyone who has this CD but this CD is just mainstream hype. To put it bluntly, it's trash. The beats are pretty phat, but the lyrics are simple, unimaginative, repetetive and definitely one of the worst I ever heard. Turk is the only rapper that deserves some credit for his flowy lyrics. The rhyme schemes are ridiculously simple, like rhyming \\"do\\" and \\"too\\".

And with the Hot Boys, Paparue, LAC, Baby, and Unplugged in his corner, I can't blame him. This is probably one of the best CD's I've heard in a while, and I don't know why everyone wants to hate on it.If you're not a Cash Money fan in the first place, you have no right to judge this CD.

The seller, will not issue a return label and if you have received \\"free shipping\\" through Amazon, this seller will deduct that cost from your refund, and also charge a 15% restocking fee.

The belt is an OK lifting belt, but be careful of the size."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great belt","review":"I use this belt for bodybuilding; specifically for squats and dead lifts. I purchased this belt originally because it had some padding on the inside and helped fill the small sway in the middle of my back. When cinched tightly this belt actually helps keep my spine in alignment and has drastically reduced the amount of pressure my lower back was enduring with other types of belts. My suggestion would be to loosen this belt when not lifting as it not made to be worn constantly.I have used the velcro type of belts as well as the regular leather belts and neither of them offered the same type of protection I feel I receive from this one. I would highly recommend this belt for anyone doing serious lifting and has any sort of dip in their lower back.I noticed that one of the reviews commented that the belt was made from plastic. This is not true, the belt is made of a very stiff leather and as it used will begin to fit to your particular shape..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a proper weight belt","review":"Basically the problem is this, if you don't know. The function of a weight belt is to give your abdominal muscles something to push against. The belt is tight and offers resistance so that the abs can push harder and therefore brace the torso/spine more effectively. That's what a belt is supposed to do.Now, it makes no sense to have the belt be six inches tall in the back and 2 inches in the front. This is just poor design. A proper belt should be 4 inches the entire way around. Look into Inzer Belts, they are quality. Yes, you're going to pay more for a quality belt but any belt that is bigger in the back and small in the front is just improper design and won't function as well as one that is designed properly.Save your money and put it towards a belt that is designed by people who actually understand the function of a belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Bad!

I think if I didn't see that chart, I'd have gotten one that was too big. That's why I took off a star cause something that works so well should have a chart. That one reviewer saved me a lot of time.The belt is made of leather. Not sure what kind but it's very sturdy and pliable. I expected some issues since the front is smaller than the back side but when I used it, my abs were definitely snug and I can feel my back supported. Great belt."},{"rating":"2","title":"great belt!","review":"Great belt! the belt is stiff and has a bit of padding. I used this belt atleast 2-3days a week when I'm working out on my lower back. wearing this helped me equally distribute my lower back muscles. When I'm wearing this and performing deadlifts, I feel the burn on both sides of my lower back instead of one dominate side. For those who are 5ft'6in and weighing at 125lbs(all muscle w/ low % body fat) I recommend the size small. For those who are planning to bulk up you might want to consider bumping up the size in the future, I know I will.

It resembles cardboard more than leather. The belt guides are so thin you can stretch them with your fingers (not 1/4\\" thick as shown in the photo of the tan belt). The front of the belt is supposed to be wide enough to give support for your abdominal muscles to push against, but is so small from top to bottom that you might as well wear a jeans belt. I ordered the Large length for my \\"newly expanded\\" 36\\" waist but it's too long to even latch in the first set of holes. I bought the black version. Maybe the tan one is better quality. There is just no way anyone would give the belt I have 5 stars. To be fair; the buckle seems sturdy and the liner and padding look substantial. I'm not angry, just feeling duped. Again, if it's too good to be true...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good first belt","review":"I've just started getting into weight training, and wanted to see the effects of a belt before splurging on a nice one.This is a decent belt which has served me well so far, but I'm a little concerned about its durability. The belt buckle worries me, as both the buckle and the 2 pins that go into the belt holes seem very flimsy. I'm squatting around 170lbs, and so I haven't seen this perform under high pressure, but I think it will be ok.Also, I've realized that I'm not a fan of belts with holes and pins, in contrast to belts you simply tighten. If your waist is in between hole sizes, well tough luck.

I purchased this belt for my training partner whose waist size was quite a bit larger than mine (a size 36 compared to my 30). The training belt that I used is a leather belt I purchased over a decade ago and has held up to 5 plates for deadlifts without a hitch.This belt by valeo however gave out while doing a TWO PLATE deadlift!!! Unbelievable. The notch which broke wasn't even the ones which he was using but the holes closest to the middle of the belt (the smallest size holes).

I felt as if the belt was not tight to my back giving me the support i needed, even when i had the belt on as tight as it could go. The material is a cheap thin quality. After using it for one work out, dead lifts and bend over rows, the leather began to tear and rip. I would not suggest this belt. It offers very poor back support, especially in heavy power movement such as squats and dead lifts, and is very cheap quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weightlifting belt","review":"Made out of plastic. Get what you pay for. Spend the extra money and get the leather. If you're a novice, it would be a good starter belt, just in case you don't stick with the sport.

Garbage","review":"I only used it twice, weightlifting in the gym and if I could post a photo of it I would (can't seem to find out how to do it, sorry).

Again, only used twice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strong and durable","review":"Purchased this product in the event I was going to be heavy lifting.

I can still use it barely but it will rip all the way soon and it will be useless. Look to Inzer for a quality belt. Buying this is like buying anything cheap.

Unfortunately, very little of that quality appears in this collection of twenty-seven very short stories, all set in a bar on the edge of a Siberian spaceport that hosts a wide array of alien visitors. These aren't shaggy dog stories, though, or whimsical character portraits. In fact, it's hard to tell just what they're supposed to be. Each story introduces one or more aliens in conversation with (usually) the bartender/owner, Rick Schumann. So they schmooze, and the alien tells a story, and that's it. I kept wondering whether the end of each story had been omitted, and that was why they were all so short.

I think it is too big and awkward for a 2-3 month old to hold on to, and it is still to big for him to chew on at 4 1/2 months.

This toy has slept in bed with our little one for almost a year. He is quiet in bed, but livens up when you crinkle, squeak, or rattle his colorful segments. We didn't find all of his hidden qualities initially, and we have been surprised by all of his tricks. There is one quality, though, that has been priceless. He makes a wonderful positioning pillow. He isn't cushy, heavy, or in any way a suffocation danger as some pillows are. He is slender and soft and fits neatly (much like a body pillow) down the full length of our child. She sleeps quietly with him tucked in place -- big enough to keep her from rolling over, soft enough to be comfortable, loveable enough to help her sleep. \\"Wormy\\" has become mother's helper and baby's friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but...","review":"My son loves this toy.

Unfortunatly, Hallucinating isn't all that great. On the plus side, it is a moderately experimental blending of metal and electronic music. However, there are few songs that are really worth listening to. They all just kind of run together into a relatively bland mess of distorted guitar and computer bleeps. The only song that really stands out is the hidden instrumental track at the end of the CD. It seems to be the only actual realization of the unique creativity hiding just below of the surface.While Hallucinating is a somewhat weak effort, I still believe it to establish Apartment 26 as a band to watch for in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"the newest techno metal band!!!","review":"This cd rocks!!the sound is intense and they vocals are amazing.Apartment 26 can't hardly be placed in a specific genre,but either nu metal or techno fans should like it!It has been a while that i ever heard any extremely heavy metal band tht succesfully mixes it with techno.Especially 'the fear','hallucinating' and 'anymore' are way too good for words, but i just picked out my fav's,others will like others songs,maybe...but anyway the cd is extremely good for a debut and certainly from a group who was claimed to be too young to play!(great work !!!piece of art!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I was surprised when I bought this CD.

If you want to know whether this saw is a good choice for the cramped space, first saw buyer I can say decisively that it is because that is the situation I am in and I actually own the saw. Buy it.

The built-in hand holds make moving to the job site a breeze. Especially handy is the built-in dust collection port that attaches to a standard wet/dry vac.The single best feature would be the fence. It rides parrallel to the blade, operates very smoothly, extends over 24\\", has a very nice reading scale, and lifts off easily for miter work.I am a cabinetmaker and installation contractor and this is my job site saw. If you are a hobbyist with lots of room in your shop buy a big saw.

In the week since I bought the saw I've used it every day and absolutely love it.The fence adjustment is fantastic. Why aren't more manufacturers doing rack and pinion systems?The miter gauge has worked fine for me so far.The blade is, well...It works.

However despite the directions, which include turning this saw upside down and adjusting the rack and pinion adjustment, this table saw just does not measure up. The gears on the rack and pinion fence adjustment continually skip especially as the fence extends out to the its maximum rip length of 24 inches. The mechanics of this feature were just plain shoddy. DeWalt Customer support was equally unimpressive. Like the title says, I recommend running in the other direction on this one.

The fence is amazing...always parallel and totally accurate. I also like the portable stand which makes it easy to carry around and takes less space when storing.My only negative is the splitter/blade guard is a knuckle-buster to install and, if you're not careful, can slide down to hit the blade.

So far I haven't had any trouble with it. I cut oak, walnut, etc. without any problems. This isn't a cabinet saw, so don't expect it to cut through thick materials all day. It works fine for about anything else. The miter that came with the saw is pretty cheap, I replaced it with a better one. My only complaint with the saw is that the blade is so close to the front edge that it makes cross-cuts on anything wider than 4 or 5 inches a hassle. It does have the best fence adjustment system that I have ever used. After you have used the Dewalt rack&pinion fence system you won't want to use anything else. My advice...if this is your only saw save your money and buy a bigger more powerful one like the Delta Platinum.

The edge design allows birds of different sizes to easily get to the water level.However, there is one major problem: the connection between the leaf dish and the stake is not good. It rusted and broke after just 3 months of gentle use! I am still using the dish - I just put it on the ground between bushes. But now it mostly serves squirrels and opossums...There is another problem, this time with the design. To keep birds healthy, the dish needs to be washed every time prior to refilling it with water. The easiest way to do it would be to remove the dish. To accomplish it with this bath, one needs to unscrew the dish or the remove the whole thing from the ground. Both are quite cumbersome for a daily procedure. My advice is to buy the bath that has a dish which can be lifted from the base."},{"rating":"2","title":"The librarian","review":"These short story books are always a good read.

The problem is that this toy doesn't really do anything. I know it's intended for newborns -- who don't do much of anything themselves -- but the star basically hangs there. The squeaker is too difficult for an infant to activate, and the toy's mirror is really tiny. If your infant needs something bright to capture his attention, I would suggestperhaps buying the wrist rattles and hanging those from his carseat, etc. Later on, those wrist rattles can be used for actual play as well. Skip this toy in favor of other Lamaze successes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In the toy box","review":"I must agree with your other customer when she said this toy was a total dud. Like her I have bought toys from Lamaze and have found them to be most stimulating and fun for my little boy.

I bought the toy to hang on his stroller but it looks like I'll have to buy a more stimulating one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My baby didn't like it","review":"I have heard that Lamaze toys are excellent for babies but I felt this one was a waste of money. I think the star is quite heavy for a baby to play with and my daughter always picked up something that was lighter and easier to hold than this star.

It shows you how to make a Wolfenstein 3d type graphics engine, which was fine at the time the book was written, yet dosn't cut it anymore.

If it were a drip or a slight trickle, I'd be ok with it, but it's a pretty good stream and doesn't fall straight down. The leak shoots out at an angle between the filter output and the shower head input. We tried to hook it up with a handheld shower head by putting it between the wall and the shower head: leaks. Then we tried to hook it up between the shower head attachment and the tube that leads to the handheld part: leaks. We have a fiberglass shower/tub unit and it is not tiled above the shower head.

Clandestine meetings, miniature spy cameras, smuggled documents, dead drops, midnight escapes, everything short of murder - though legions of Hollywood agents are no doubt stabbing each other in the back to get the movie rights. Weiser provides a remarkable look behind two curtains: both the iron one that shielded cold-war Poland and the veil of secrecy that normally cloaks the CIA. The author's unprecedented access to the actual messages that passed between spy and handler allows him to bring two fascinating personalities - and the intimate friendship they developed - to life. If you like history, buy it. If you like biography, buy it. If you're a military buff, buy it. And if you like spy novels, buy two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patriot or Traitor","review":"A Secret Life will attract numerous audiences but holds special appeal for those who enjoy the mental challenge of wrestling with questions of moral dilemma. Colonel Kuklinski, the subject of the book, lived as a citizen of a country, Poland, during a time when Poland's national interests were subjugated to the interests of another nation. In sharing military intelligence with the American authorities, did Kuklinski act as a patriot whose mission was to protect Poland's freedom or as a traitor to its national security? The author's conclusions are clear from the phrase in the subtitle \\"the Price He Paid to Save His Country,\\" but his meticulous research allows the reader to appraise the narrative at every step of Kuklinski's journey and to draw one's own conclusion. An absorbing tale that one constantly has to remind oneself is not fiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RIVETING !!!!","review":"What a fascinating story....I couldn't put the book down !!!Ryszard Kuklinski is a real hero. What this man has done in helping to end the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Blocis simply unbelievable. What a man of courage !!!I highly recommend this book.

Lech Walesa was against colonel Kuklinski's rehabilitation, the former president considered him a \\"bad example\\" for the army. Ex-communists Miller and Kwasniewski when they won the election soon afterwards decided to rehabilitate the colonel, which Walesa called \\"a political trick\\".

It is not about dating beautiful women in scenic countryside (James Bond) but about photograghing thousands of pages of documents and then throwing them in a passing car.

Thompson heaps his usual amount of scorn on the deserving pols of the '92 campaign, but he doesn't give us the real feel of what was out there. This is probably because most of the book seems to center on faxes he received and finding a way to use the word \\"bubba\\" on every page. Thompson used to put substance behind his politician roasts. Now he just roasts.Pete Townsend used to lose chunks of flesh off his fingers as he played guitar. He is too old for that type of thing now and the Who aren't as good because of it.In much the same way, Hunter S. Thompson has opted to stay at home next to his fax machine instead of putting his teeth to the asphalt and giving us the wonderful literary journalism he may or may not be capable of putting out anymore"},{"rating":"1","title":"A failed attempt to rekindle the spark of \\"...Campaign '72\\"","review":"Normally, a new release from the Good Doctor is cause for intense celebration; indeed, that was the mindset I had when I first read this work. Sadly, the party turned into a wake about one third of the way through.It is a limp look at the Presidential campaign for 1992; mainly reproductions of faxes, a lot of inside jokes and just the lightest smattering of the Famous Thompson wit. The saving grace is the Tribute to Richard M. Nixon...I'm not sure if that's worth the price of admission, though.Certainly for dedicated Thompson fanatics. Others would do well to checkout the classic \\"Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas\\", \\"Songs of the Doomed\\" or \\"Hell's Angels\\".Don't worry, though, doc...I'm still counting on you to come through with 1997's opus.

Even he panned all but the last chapter where Nixon's death (\\"who never let ME down\\") brought out some of The Dr's best 'medi- cine'.

One hopes."},{"rating":"2","title":"You got to love Sex","review":"Best said in the opening page, \\"when the going gets weird, the weird turn pro,\\" in Better than Sex: Confessions of a Political Junkie by Hunter S. Thompson delves into the most perverse scene of all politics.The book is like a collection of random thoughts, journals, and scrap book materials. The subject revolves around politics but in Gonzo journalism style Hunter does not limit his continuous stream of consciousness.Thompson shares his unsavory view of the comeback kid, Bill Clinton but does include correspondence from the Prez. He developed some interesting relationships including George Stephanopoulos and the raging cajun' James Carville.He ends in chapter 666, an appropriate tribute to his muse and nemesis Richard Nixon.Better than Sex: Confessions of a Political Junkie by Hunter S. Thompson is another stab of understanding politics through Dr.Gonzo himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A warmer, fuzzier HST for the '90s","review":"I think some of the other readers have been a little unkind to poor old Hunter. So he's lost some of the venom he was famous for, but he still writes a compelling tale about a subject I normally find exceptionally dry - American politics. This book is worth reading for the eulogy to Richard Nixon alone.Hunter's teeth may not be as threatening as they were in '72, but I still think you NEED to read this book. Hunter is, after all, a professional - and someone's gotta pay for his drug habit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thompson gives it to you straight --","review":"One of the best factors of the book is the first-hand knowledge of politics and the way Thompson \\"tells you how it is, Bubba.\\" Witty and articulate, this is truly a no-holds-barred book about life on, around and within the campaign trail of '92. One of Thompson's best books, second only to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Gonzo After All These Years...","review":"Let me start by saying that if you have never read anything by Dr. Thompson before, do not start with this book. Rather, start with some of his earlier material (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or one of his many articles for Rolling Stone).I don't recommend this book to first-time Thompson readers because it is so disjointed that the reader, without knowing Thompson's style, may give up on Thompson before discovering his other great writings.This is not one of Doc's greatest books, but its entertaining, none the less. Its almost worth it just for the funny pictures/faxes and the vicious jabs thrown at all of the canidates.I rated this book with four stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I enjoyed it so much because I am a Thompson fan and eat up almost everything he writes.

It's very easy to use and holds the bikes steady."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite right","review":"Had this rack for 5 years and just sold it at a garage sale for 50$. Well built and sturdy, but way too heavy and awkward. Even though made for 4 bikes, 2 mountain bikes nearly filled it. Mountain bikes frames, especially those with full suspension do not fit well at all. Three bikes was a chore to cram on with pedals and handle bars interfering with each other. Requires bungees to secure the bikes from swinging and handle bars from turning and banging into each other. The rubber supports for the bikes were difficult to fit the tight frame of suspension over. Many comments about the hitch bolt. The reason there is a bolt on the hitch and not a pin is to tighten the rack so it doesn't wiggle around in the receiver. I had the Thule lock on the hitch bolt which worked well although it is hard to get to in the tight spaces between the bumper and the receiver. Storage of the rack when not on the car is also awkward as it is very heavy and ungainly to hang or set against a wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps bike safe on AND off the car","review":"I used to use the old strap car rack, but as the kids got bigger I needed something more sturdy. Especially when I got the wall mount (Jamas). That has been the real treasure of this rack. Once the bikes are locked in, you can forget your driving with them--and when you take it off the car, you can attach it to the Jamas and keep the bikes out of the way ( by the way I think the promo code for the jamas wall mount is RD2011 ). If there was one problem with this thing it's getting the bikes balanced together, but that is part of the snug design that keeps them close to the car on the road and close to the wall on the rack. I don't think much can be done about that.And the rack is light enough that the kids can move it from the car to the wall and back without my help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not totally happy","review":"I was excited when i opened the box and installed it, was not happy to see that the arms that holds the bike can't be lowered down, you have to remove the bolt before you can do it, some models is just press and two arms goes down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thule Bike Rack 956","review":"Bike rack was delivered quickly.

Definitely buy something like: www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054ZQL36/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00 to make this easily convertible into a fold down unit. Super simple.2. I don't have a ton of experience w/ bike racks and not much to compare but it is not easy to get kids bikes onto these racks. My bike (35+ yr old male) fits perfectly but my son's 20\\" and my daughters toddler bike w/ training wheels make it a bit more complex.NOTE: Got the 4 bike and 2\\" hitch but ultimately roughly total of $200 for a 4 bike hitch carrier that folds down and locks isn't so bad.Just feel like Thule can offer a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"I bought this item couple of months ago.

Assembly was a breeze and installing it on the hitch receiver is simple. The bolt for attaching to the receiver keeps the rack snug with no wobble. If you want to lock the rack to your vehicle you will need to purchase Thule's optional lock (pricy at $50) or come up with something on your own.

Camille loves Vincent's paintings, yet the villagers look upon Vincent with derision and suspicion.

And the best part of the game is that you can combine animal DNA and make some mutant animals. And the number of the unit is limited by player's creativity. And what I like about this game is that it's not some boring old RTS. usually in RTS the things you do is build strutures, mine resources, build units and other stuff, and to win you just need to use your hands faster and build lots of units and destroy other peoples bases. Well this game does not work that way, the units have relations like rock,scissors,papers so one unit can easily konck some units but can be knocked out easily by other units. So you need to be stragical and place and build units carefully, so you get to use your brains more than your hands.Oh, and this game has some Homeworld's blood in it so if you played homeworld you might find it simliar.

Alarming yet very much enriching. \\"And This Too Shall Pass\\" is a very impressive and insightful work that challenges the harsh reality, which has been brewing around us, by testing our morality.A book that shall sit for a time on my nightstand."},{"rating":"2","title":"And This to Shall Pass","review":"This was the first book I read by Harris, I could not stop reading the book, it had a believable story line and all the characters were well devolped. The book had a few good suprises , one being Zurich twin Zach. When I finished reading this I had to go out and by Harris first and second novels. And This To Shall Pass is a excellent read and will have you wondering if you have male friends, past lovers, family that were gay. I will be recommending it to my book club, The Circle of Sisters"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"This book was not at all what I expected. Even though the bases of the book was not about the football player being acused of a crime he didn't commit, it was very interesting.

I understand that the theory part creates the base analysis, but I have to say that the reader will understand the models without reading section 1. Not so profoundly, but good enough to grab the idea of this book. If you are in a hurry, skip section 1.All in all, this book is an excellent book for those who want to understand the structure of mobile industry and the way it is evolving. Mr. Vesa has done good work in capturing the characters of a dynamic and constantly evolving industry. Though, this book is published in this year, some of the information of this book is already outdated; this tells much about the dynamic nature of mobile industry.Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not original CD","review":"There are three extra songs.

I was thrilled to have stumbled upon them. Since then, I have shared their enchantment with a few friends who also agree they are fantastic.HOWEVER, with utmost respect to the group, this is not one of their best albums. I find myself only listening to two songs on here: Samhain and Belladonna. Many of the songs sound similar to one another, without their usual unique ring to them. I STRONGLY encourage you to check out a different album of theirs. Personally, I enjoy \\"Wild\\" - it is much more true to how good they really are. If you have never heard Inkubus Sukkubus before, check out the \\"Wytches & Vampyres: The Best of Inkubus Sukkubus\\" album - you'd be getting the Belladonna & Aconite song on there, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TSR meets Kenzer Co.","review":"Miss the old days of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons.

Tonight, my husband was attempting to snap the pieces together, and it sliced his thumb, and sliced another finger bad enough that he was bleeding pretty heavily. The connectors & pillars are also REALLY difficult to use. You have to push them really hard to get them on & then when you try to remove them, it's very difficult.

Only 3 or 4 of the 11 chapters are directly related to clusters and distributed computing networks. The majority of the book covers system administration tasks that are relevant in any setting. The clustering chapters do not provide adequate detail to evaluate the options available.As an introduction to system administration the book is acceptable, but the overview of clustering is too cursory to justify the title. The book is also poorly copy-edited, with some of the acronymns expanded (sometimes amusingly) incorrectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted effort","review":"Having waited for ages for this book to be published I was mightily disappointed when it eventually arrived. I would accept that this subject is a huge area but this book doesn't even scratch the surface. Lets take for example the French infantry uniforms of the period - generally blue and given that the French are the main focus of the Napoleonic wars you might expect to see some pictures of infantry in Blue - not in this book.This could have been the one stop shop for uniform info, sadly there are better sources elsewhere just not inside one cover yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too obscure","review":"I bought this book with high hopes, then returned it the day after I received it. The pictures are gorgeous, but just how many obscure uniforms do I really need to see? I expected to see the basic line and light infantry uniforms as well as various cavalry uniforms. Officers and musicians. Go from there. Instead I get sappers and drum majors and gendarmes and everything BUT what I really need. So no help at all. Maybe Smith felt the basic stuff is covered elsewhere by many other authors, so he should extend the range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exaggerated claims as information source","review":"The title of this book and the description of it use adjectives such as \\"unrivaled\\" and \\"unprecedented\\" and \\"illustrated\\". I found all of this to be simply hyperbole; a gross overstatement of the value of this tome. There is nothing new in it and there are pity few pictures of uniforms; virtually all of the illustrations look to me to be reprints of those found in various Osprey books. It's fine as a primer, but not as a painting guide for hobbyists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview of the Napoleonic Wars and War of 1812","review":"This is a good overview of the era 19th century. It covers the Napoleonic Wars and War of 1812. So it does have a worldwide view of the conflicts of the 19th century. I still waiting for the Encyclopedia of uniforms of the 19th century to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The female Bond","review":"Janice Weber is one of the most inventive writers out there, and her books are astounding for their originality and their strong female voices.\\"Frost the Fiddler\\" is one of her best; Weber manages to combine Bond-esque espionage with the world of classic music. (For those that don't know, Weber is also a world-renowned pianist.)The book does become a bit complicated and perhaps convoluted at the end; Weber novels rarely have happy endings. It may also seem a bit dated at this juncture (most of the spyspeak is now everyday lingo, unfortunately, with our changing post-9/11 world) but it's well worth the read, and readers won't soon forget characters like Leslie Frost, or Maxine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like James Bond, but better","review":"I loved Ian Flemming's James Bond novels and am always looking for books in the playful, yet serious, yet ridiculous spy genre. Frost the Fiddler fits the bill perfectly. It's fun and light, but very well-written. No space is spared for extraneous detail (aside from classical music stuff). The plot is well-paced and the characters are interesting and a delight to keep up with.I'd highly recommend this book if you are fan of the Bond novels or just tired of the bland political machinations which seem to fill page after page of so many spy novels these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer who said the ending made no sense. I'm not going to put a spoiler in here, but will note that it appears Ms. Weber draws upon her own relationship history to create some dramatic and titillating scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides a lot, but does not go far enough","review":"Although the idea of providing resources is a good one, many of them are out of date (addresses and contact information,etc.)I have used Project before and I am working on a fast track project and trying to learn the new features at the same time. Some of the explanations do not go far enough, but if you are new to MS Project, this is a good beginning.Some of Microsoft's definitions of project management terms are misleading and in some cases, wrong. The publications on project management that are listed are more correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is fine, CD is a pain","review":"I found the text worthwhile, but the CD that comes with the book was missing an installation file, which forced me to have to install all of the programs manually. When I called IDG technical support, they said that the only fix was to go ahead and install everything manually, and there was no way to get the additional required file. I would have found it easier to put up with this nonsense if the price of the book weren't so high."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the way to a cup of coffee in Baja","review":"I was on my way for an early cup of coffee at Rancho Leonero Resort on the East Cape of Baja, Christmas Day. . . greeted my favorite bartender Jorge, \\"Feliz Navidad\\", and heard this music on the bar CD . . . I listened for about 15 seconds and knew Elefante was my new World Music group favorite. If you like Mana, Knofpler-like guitar, listen to this CD. This music is also a way of improving your Spanish! We loved it in the car for over 1000 miles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard for a leg rest","review":"The wedge is too hard and too sharp when used to elevate the legs to relieve back pain...that would be square side to body rather than the wedge side. I'm sure the wedge works great for raising the head though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product","review":"First, it stinks like sewer as it comes out of the bag. It took a few weeks to lose it's offensive smell, which of course with your face right above it is quite strong. Second these wedges almost always have cotton blend covers which give you some grip so you don't just slide off the wedge. This has a pure synthetic cover, NOT COTTON/POLY LIKE THE DESCRIPTION STATES. This cover is slippery like nylon material. You cannot lay on it without your upper body sliding down against your lower body compressing you into a fetal position. Very uncomfortable.If you are going to sleep with your upper body on this, don't buy it. Find one with a cotton cover and that doesn't smell like a septic tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't happen with product and company wouldn't return","review":"As soon as I opened the box i realized this wasn't what i wanted. A few days later in wrote the company to do a return and was told I couldn't because it was not hygienic. I never used the pillow. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible smell","review":"The bed wedge had a terrible chemical smell to it.

Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mom said it was too hard","review":"Got it for my mom to help with acid reflux at night. She couldn't sleep on it; said it was too hard.

Upon inspecting it i found it to be in perfect working order and looked forward to getting a full nights sleep using it. Believe me when I tell you, this wedge does what it is supposed to do. It is firm enough to hold even a large person and I should know I weigh in at over 400 lbs. It does not even begin to squash. It is very firm yet still very pliable to the touch. It is a quality product that I would highly recommend to everyone thinking of getting one to help rest or prop up body parts. The price is differently right also. You would be very lucky to buy a foam piece this size for the price of this wedge, cover and already shaped properly. I am enjoying my hrs of sleep I now receive due to this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far so Good!","review":"I ordered this product for my husband's post-septoplasty recovery positioning and sleeping. It is very comfortable when pillows are placed on top of it. My husband is very happy with it so far and I think it is great for the price (about 30$).

It was very well packaged. It is working well so far, about two weeks now. It came with a light blue thin cotton cover, not as pictured.

It is larger than what I had in mind and there seems to be a problem sliding down during the night and causing a stiff neck by morning. Would consider buying a 7 or 8 inch version of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful","review":"This wedge pillow has been very useful after my esophogus surgery. Although not extremely comfortable, it did the trick. Would not recommend for every day use but has good angle for upright sleeping.It didn't have an aweful smell like some reviews have said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short. I'm 5'9","review":"Looking at the pic I thought this item would be perfect for me. After sleeping with it it's just too small. If I position it where it should be my head hangs over the edge. I just wish it was made longer. I am average height, which is why I thought I would not have an issue with this product. I guess if you are 4' this is the product for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works fine under the mattress, but a little hard on top","review":"I first used one of these on top of my mattress, and I agree with other reviewers that it is very firm. I have a firm mattress, but the wedge was too hard for even me. So I bought a second one and put them between my mattress and box spring at the head of the bed, laying side-by-side so they span the width of the bed. This arrangement works much better since I am now cushioned by my own mattress and I can no longer roll off the single wedge. The cover on the wedge seems well made, but that doesn't really matter when it's under the mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"This 10\\" wedge perfectly mimics the hospital bed angle my mom used for several weeks. It was an inexpensive solution for the problem of keeping her at a comfortable angle while she sleeps. Would highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Item reviewed for practical use","review":"The shape of the item is fine; but it is too hard and after using it for a few weeks it still won't accommodate the shape of the head. I will keep on using it, but I wish it was softer on the head."},{"rating":"1","title":"not ergonomic","review":"I bought this after using the 12-inch wedge, which is uncomfortable to sleep on. Both the 7-inch and 12-inch do work for acid reflux, though the 7-inch doesn't work as well because you will tend to slide, making the elevation insuffient. In addition, they are not ergonomically designed. The main problem is the lack of lumbar support. The human spine is not perfectly straight. You need to put a rolled towel under your lower back to feel comfortable, otherwise you'll find yourself sliding down toward the bottom of the wedge in the morning. Prepare to get lower backaches. Also, this is not designed for side sleepers. I'm going to try stacking something under the head of the bed instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO cheap - find something a little nicer!","review":"This cable was so cheap I ended up throwing it away. One of the s-video pins were bent - I was able to bend it back into place - only to plug everything in and realize there was a short in one of the RCA cables, making this only good for carrying video not audio, and I need something that can do BOTH. Don't waste your money on this - find something for a few bucks more from someone else - I wish I had done it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"adventure in reading","review":"How often does a book change your life? For me, the answer is: rarely. As a child there was The Diary of Anne Frank. As an adolescent, The Prophet. Since then I've found important books, quotable books, but few as profound, engaging, generous, and unpredictable as Kelly Winters' Walking Home.We need this book now more than ever, if only for the sheer humanity of it. While the story reads like a magnificent, heart-thumping adventure, it is startlingly candid and full of great humor (I smiled so much while reading it that my face hurt).But you need not be outdoorsy to be gripped by this book. You just need to be up for an adventure in reading and self-discovery.So how has Walking Home changed me? It has given me a compass for truth-telling. It has encouraged me to walk up rather than around the mountain. And it has made me marvel at the simple things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilgrimage Story Only","review":"If you want to inspire you in your thoughts about hiking the Appalachian Trail, this is not the book for you. Kelly Winters whines about rain and pain on the trail and that is about all. It is a pilgrimage story, so if that is what you are looking for, you might enjoy it. But if you want a story about the trail try reading \\"A Walk for Sunshine\\" by Jeff Alt for a fun and inspiring tale of life on the trail."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Bummer","review":"Hiking the AT is long, arduous, and trying experience, and so is reading this book. I make it a point to finish every book I start, but the first 26 pages of detailed, creepy episodes with one of her ex-boyfriends almost stopped me there. Then when she gets to the trail, it is continuous complaining. Everyone on the trail complains--its only natural--but Ms. Winters makes a point of doing it. There are few people in the book with whom she doesn't have a problem. Like Bill Bryson, she doesn't finish the trail either, but at least Bryson was entertaining, even when he complained.The only bright spot I found in this book was Winters' knowledge of plants. She seems to have a great appreciation for the outdoors, but that gets pushed aside for her copious physical and mental agonies. If you are a woman seeking another's account of the trail, try Adrienne Hall, Jean Deeds, or somebody else. Even better, try Earl Shaffer's Walking With Spring, the best account of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self indulgent and mean","review":"Stories of personal journeys can be inspiring for their narration of the world or for the insights of self-discovery. The mean spirited judgements (and ugly details) Winters indulges in toward her ex and even towards people she meets along the way show she is in no way interested in learning about herself or growing. There are moments of good nature observation, but a lack of personal maturity makes the book a poor read."},{"rating":"1","title":"More lesbianism than trail","review":"I read 35 pages and was totally turned off by the author's graphic descriptions of her boyfriend's sexual perversions. I knew right from the start she was trying to justify being a lesbian and her issues with sexual orientation. Even the first nite on the trail she talks about someone offering her condoms and saying she wouldn't ever need those. I skipped to the last few pages and sure enough, she ends up with a woman. Since I was too disgusted at the beginning to even read thru it, I felt like the author was just setting the reader up for her personal quest into homosexuality, not really about the trail itself. I had no interest to find out. I have read some other good books on the trail and wasn't about to waste my time on her journey of sexual exploration. I didn't need to read further to know this wasn't a book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachel has an allergic reaction to the crocidle morph.","review":"This book was about how Rachel got an allergic reaction to the crocidile morph and she couldn't control her morphing.She and Cassie got to go to this talk show because a Controller was gonna be there and talk about the benifits of the Sharing which is really a group formed by the Yeerks to get more human Controllers.So she and the other Animorphs go but because of her allergy to the crocidile morph and her un-comtrolled morphing, a disater happens!

She gets into some pretty awkward places in this book, and has some trouble with her croc(NOT GATOR!!!)morph. I really enjoyed the humor in this book. KA Applegate is a wonderful author. If you enjoyed the other books in this series, you should love this one!P.S. does anybody else think that the cover illustrations are a little wrong? Don't they have to wear skin-tight clothes to morph?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really big downfall for the animorphs","review":"In this book there was no action in it at all. It was more a romance than a sci-fi. You mean it should me in the romance section not the sci-fi section. Plus she is probaly going for some ugly stupid kid anyway.

I went with these because I had an older version of this sippy cup from The First Years that also didn't require a valve. I can't stand washing those things.

After a couple months of use all 6 of the cups we own leak. My daughter is 17 months old and tends to leave her cups on their sides on the floor. I have found many a cup with a puddle under them. The problem with our cups is that the built-in valves no longer \\"close\\" or touch, so the liquid easily drips out. Though \\"dishwasher safe\\", I wonder if the dishwasher played a part in ruining the valves. I wouldn't recommend these for long-term use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give this ZERO stars!!!","review":"I bought these cups because I thought the idea of no valve was excellent....however, I quickly learned that while it may be a good idea, it was very poorly executed in these cups. I have purchased (and returned) 2 packs of 2 because all 4 leaked. I thought maybe the first set was just a fluke...Nope. These cups are NOT spill proof. They aren't even drip proof! The return air valve leaks profusely on all of the ones I tested. I do NOT recommend these to anyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"by far the best sippy cups","review":"After reading the previous review I had to comment. We have three kids and have used these cups for years (we have probable owned, and lost, over a dozen) and have never had one break or leak. The lids have valves built in, which gives the lid a smooth surface that is easy to keep clean, unlike the 4 or 5 other brands available.

They really didn't have much of an explanation. Now this set of cups is doing the same thing! Gross! I have had Playtex cups for years that never did anything like this.

We ordered these and they are horrible. They leak like crazy from the first use. plus the mouth valve is super wide so it is really big for my sons mouth.

First, if they tipped over, they leaked so badly, it was almost as though there was lid on it. He has a tendancy to drop his cup where he stands and you can tell where he's been as there's usually a puddle. Also, with in the first month, the outer plastic shell of the cup cracked. No big until it started collecting water between the two layers. Had I not thrown the one away last time I was baby-sitting, I would have returned them to get my money back for them.

I thought perhaps I put too much in so I decreased the amount and they still leaked. Forget letting them fall on their side, that's even worse. I can't tell you how many leaks we have had to soak up because of these cups. They are in the trash and I am sticking with Playtex.

It leaks from the moment I put the cover on, all over my daughter, and all over the furniture. I purchased the cups because of the Minnie Mouse design, but I will never again skimp on quality for cuteness. I am going to stick to the Playtex sippy cups which have never given me a problem.

That is the most important quailty a sippy need to have is to be leak proof ( at least for the most part) and these cups are terrible.

While I appreciate that the sippy cup doesn't spill, it is also impossible to drink from! After seeing my son get frustrated when he tried to drink, my husband and I both tried it. No matter how hard I sucked on it, i could not get out more than a dribble. The only way to get them to work was to cut a hole in it, which then made it not spill proof. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good, one bad","review":"I was a disappointed that as another reviewer had mentioned one of the cups leaked internally after one drop the first day. It's just too much of a hassle to return. The other one appears to be working so good so far. I sent my hubby out to store to buy add'l cups and he came back with the same brand - so I guess we'll try again. I also must note that they were only 7.49 at Target.

With all that said - my son really liked the cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sippy cup for the Star Wars fan!","review":"OK, I guess they are a little expensive, but I have never seen these in the stores with the Star Wars characters on them. My 3 year old LOVES them and I even think his 6 year old brother is a bit jealous. They are Star Wars fans and it is nice to have a sippy cup without what they call \\"baby stuff\\" on it.I have to say these are my favorite sippy cups. They really don't leak (don't ask me how) and the lids are just one piece so there is no place for stuff to get trapped and yucky. They are also so much easier to load and unload in the dishwasher since there aren't all of the pieces to take apart/put together like the other brands.

Saw some frustration, but we had also recently given up the bottle. My husband and I both tried these cups and got nothing out of them. We tried loosening the lids, refrigerated, unrefrigerated, milk, water. Each time it was very difficult to get a drink. I'm going back to my tried and true Playtex that we used with two older children. It was nice to see this new-to-us product and not have to mess with valves and making sure they are clean of any residue.

The holes are like a pin hole. So I took a knife to the plastic and widened their awesome patented easy-to clean built in valve so that my child could actually take a SIP from this stupid SIPPY CUP. So, may I ask... what's the point of buying a sippy cup if you can't even get a SIP out of it? So ridiculous- so now I have a sippy cup that works because I widened the holes myself...but leaks like crazy! lol! I think the playtex are the best. They are cute cups, and the idea behind it would be great- if it worked.

For the initial use, I did have to push a tooth pick through the slits on the valves. They all worked fine for a while, but have started to leak from the top vent hole (not the spout). I am soooo frustrated! I thought it was the perfect cup and never would have invested that much money in a whole set of them. I can't stand having a million different types of cups. It makes matching them up too difficult.

He sails around the horn, and experiences all the exotic ports in the days when they were still truly exotic.

Great stuff you simply will not find anywhere else.I happened to meet Jim in his store in Boise Idaho, where he was selling Japanese and other oriental collectibles. He told me that many of these stories were true... told to him by his uncle who experienced them as a young man.You should also note that the books are almost completely unedited. They are rife with misspellings, incorrect grammar, and incorrect usage.

Having seen Jay speak, I often cring when someone proclaims themselves as the \\"world's most innovative coach.\\" To me, that's just marketing husbandry. Jay obviously has taken from the inept Joe Vitale school of self-promotion: If you claim it, fools will believe it.

This elegantly designed but engrossingly readable book is witty, scholarly and insightful, but still the best reason for buying this book is that it's a grand read if if you don't care about fashion as a daily fan. Like all additions to a home library, this illuminates a world from an intelligent, learned perspective. It will become a classic collection of essays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointing","review":"Brubach does little to convince me that fashion is not, in fact, shallow and dismissable. She comes close to an epiphany of meaning in an essay about the French and the social reading of personal appearance, then loses her ground totally in an article about large size fashions, exposing her own biases without self-awareness.

Written for the general public, it provides an intimate view into the healing processes of persons treated with EMDR. Individual stories are written in narrative form, describing the experiences and symptoms of each person before, during, and after EMDR treatment. Therapy descriptions include transcripts of actual treatment sessions. Each chapter highlights recovery from a different type of disorder: combat related trauma, incest and child abuse, rape, phobias and panic attacks, sleep disorders and childhood trauma, attachment disorders, traumatic grief, addiction, and diagnosis of life-threatening illness. This book is very helpful for persons considering EMDR treatment as it explains the therapy process from the client's perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"EMDR can help free us from the BIG and \\"little\\" traumas.","review":"\\"EMDR: The Breakthrough Therapy for Overcoming Anxiety, Stress and Trauma\\" describes a method for finally releasing the demons of our past. The book points out that it isn't necessarily the magnitude of the event that is important but our response to it. Most of us are familiar with the impact of post traumatic stress on war veterans but over time we tend to discount the long term effects of losing a loved one, not holding an infant or the chronic teasing from a sibling. Francine Shapiro shows us how EMDR can help free us from the BIG traumas as well as the \\"little\\" traumas of life. Fortunately, we don't have to understand how it can change us emotionally or physically. All we have to do is try it ourselves for 3 sessions and see what happens. After reading the book I understood how anxiety, stress and trauma changes our thinking and how EMDR can transform the negative into positive for any number of situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview but perhaps a little out of date","review":"This book is good for having an overview of EMDR and its history.

I think that's the case with most people who experience this amazing therapy. There are other therapies out there that work, but nothing works as fast as EMDR.If you're looking for a captivating read on the top trauma treatment in the world, get your hands on this book.

But with EMDR, I re-experienced painful memories from many years in the past. This led to a period of sleepless nights (something that almost never happens with me) as I endured a parade of terrible flashbacks. These negative experiences did not occur just during sessions, but relentlessly throughout a number of months in which I felt I was constantly engaged in an ongoing medley of the worst moments of my life. I so much wanted to believe in EMDR, and I gave it my very best effort, but ultimately I can't begin to describe how incredibly painful the experience was for me.The worse I felt the more progress my therapist said I was making. I didn't start feeling better again 'til I said enough is enough and quit EMDR. I know some people swear by EMDR. My advice: tread VERY carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but in reality, useless","review":"Purchased this iron about 9 months ago because, like most people, I was tired of dealing with the cord. I mainly iron dress shirts, polos and khaki pants, when I don't have time to go to the cleaners. This iron is very frustrating. On full heat, it doesn't get hot enough to iron out the wrinkles and constantly needs reheating. I felt like I spent more time with the iron on the base waiting for it to heat up than I did ironing.

With part of the story told in the Star Trek TOS timeframe and then another part in Star Trek TNG, that's all we're given ... no memorable characters and almost laughably forgettable dialogue. Many scenes almost read like filler, written last minute to expand the book to a required word length.

But I pulled it out the summer before starting journalism school and laughed the whole way through. Zinsser knows exactly how writers look when they write -- he knows the glassy-eyed expression of writer's block, the sudden sensation of thirst that seems to hit every few minutes, \\"forcing\\" the writer once again away from the typewriter to the watercooler. He knows we procrastinate, because he knows we suffer. His book is like a forgiving uncle guiding us back to the keyboard and coaxing us to try again.That first worn and rough-edged copy of Zinsser's book is now on my desk at work. When I'm stuck or I've been heading to the watercooler too often, it's there.

Bugeja's book (was bad) but Zinsser is the man. He doesn't make learing hard in his book like a lot of other writers do.

He finishes the story by recognizing that there is no \\"right\\" way to write.

He writes with a tone of superiority that is sure to discourage more writers than it will inspire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about verbose","review":"I am not a fan of this book.

Much of his style is completely subjective--he doesn't explain well why he likes some phrases and dislikes others. One thing I'm sure of, no matter what I'd write, he'd hate it, including this review.

The Neoconomy is how Altman describes Bush's fiscal policy goal, a world with no taxes on saving, which could bring great prosperity, or lead to unprecedented crisis. Altman manages to convey the subtleties of cutting edge economic research and its links to the current policy debate in a crisp, engaging style. Furthermore, unlike other economic scribblers, he manages to stay balanced and non-partisan. He weighs arguments for their intellectual soundness and policies for their impact, not their rhetoric. A must read for those aspiring to be informed citizens of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"What \\"fair and balanced\\" really means","review":"This book has been described -- and is -- a thorough, tough critique of Bush administration policy. But its virtue is in the fact that there are no cackling corporate cronies lighting cigars with $100-bills while they sketch out their plan to snatch food from poor children. This book looks at the numbers, looks at the facts, and lets a fair-minded reader draw conclusions for him/herself.This is true fair and balanced journalism. Fair doesn't mean \\"having no opinion\\" or midlessly weighing two points of view equally, whether or not they are equally true. \\"Fairness\\" is a dispassionate, thoughtful look at reality. In this case, the reality is that some very intelligent economists with a real dream of making America's economy stronger have a plan. The problem is that that plan might have some dangerous intended and unintended consequences. Altman's book lets the reader decide whether the gamble is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems.","review":"It's a pulley so there is not much to say.

The most interesting characters, such as her little brother, were hardly developed. And the book was full of mistakes! If I spend that much for a book, I expect it to be proofed by a human, not just by a spell check. I got rid of the book as soon as I finished it, so I don't remember the examples specifically, but I'm pretty sure one was \\"garbage disposable\\" for \\"disposal\\" (or some other real word in place of \\"disposal.\\") And there were many other such.

By page 200 I was about to pull my hair out.Emily Briggs lives in the city and has a male for a best friend of whom she is clearly jealous. Around that time she meets Henry, a starving artist and likes him. Their whirlwind courtship is way too easy.What I didn't like was Emily's personality was so boring. The romantic subplot had no substance either and no anticipation. [...] The worst thing about the book is that there were tons of grammatical errors. [...] But it's horrible and frankly I'm disappointed enough to never purchase another Strapless book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is hilarious!!!","review":"Finally a book that made me laugh out loud!!! Emily Briggs' zany (and self-deprecating) sense of humor is truly refreshing. I haven't come across a character like hers since Carrie Bradshaw. So if you liked Candace Bushnell's novels, you'll LOVE \\"The Fabulous Emily Briggs.\\"The New York backdrop also makes for a fun and entertaining read. I was sad to finish it. Now I can't wait for the next Emily Briggs chronicle!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SEX AND THE CITY RETURNS--ONLY BETTER","review":"The Fabulous Emily Briggs could be considered a benchmark book for anyone interested in understanding what single life in the city is really like. It has style, class and the best part is that it is realistic. I don't have to wonder if I am truly the only one who does not own a pair of Manola Blahniks. The author laces the story with humor and wonderful characterization. This book presents the main character with independence, combined with a hint of insecurity. This lends itself to a particularly charming characterization. Whether you are sitting on a beach or getting thru a dreadful winter this book will pass the time in a most enjoyable way. I would also recommend it as a graduation gift, to any \\"young deb\\" who is ready to venture out into the cosmopolitan world. It will not only prepare her, but will excite her."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book with too many historical errors to be of any value.","review":"The Book is a Christian feel good book, that lacks any value as an historical reference. Many myths are retold to cast serious doubt about its veracity.There is no bibliography. The source of the stories are not given for the reader to check its accuracy. Not for the scholarly who would ask for a little more documentation.There is a lot Catholic bashing and a sense of self-righteousness from a Protestant point of view. The book contends that Catholics were not Christians and the \\"Church\\" or \\"Christianity\\" didn't begin till the Reformation.To say the least this is a myopic look at the supposed martyrs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foxe's Christian Martyrs","review":"Great book.

The plastic button breaks after a short while and leaves a hole and the light exposed. You should expect to get less than 2 years of use before it breaks. I've had two of these. I'd gladly pay 2 or 3 times more for a quality doorbell that lasts 10+ years... still looking for one but can't seem to find one (yet).So, minus 3 stars for the breaking plastic button... so 2 stars for this doorbell."},{"rating":"1","title":"A basic replacement doorbell button (that broke)","review":"This inexpensive button was almost exactly the same size as the broken 14 year-old plastic doorbell switch I needed to replace, although the screw holes did not line up exactly.It sits flush on the surface of the door frame, so no other modifications were needed. The light is bright. The metallic silver finish looks a little cheap, but better than plastic. An antiqued finish would likely match more door hardware, but it's hard to complain at this price. Recommended.UPDATE NOV 2012: Downgrading from 4*s to 2*s. The switch broke in the middle (a small hole formed in the center of the plastic button) after less than a year installed. Our doorbell gets rung infrequently (probably 2-5x a week), and that minimal level of usage should not break the switch. Other reviews report similar experiences, so the switch must just be poorly designed or made of cheap materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic button broke after 7 months.","review":"I bought this same button somewhere else.

I've had the same sense of surprise with another of the V.I. Warshawsky novels -- after 30 or 40 pages to be only that far into it. The behaviour of many if not most of the men in this book is implausibly stupid, serving perhaps as an inexcusable excuse to examine abuse and inhumanity between and among the sexes. V.I.'s tendency to argue unproductively with most of the other characters in the novel is annoying at times, too, but there's always a lot going on, continuous plot motion, and plenty to think about. And it's nice to have a PI who doesn't pull out a gun and threaten to blow the bad guy's head off if he doesn't come across with the information. This is a slow read and a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hard to Believe","review":"I've read every Paretsky / Warshawski book but the last (as we speak), but I'm disappointed at the pretty unbelievable action in this one. I often feel like our author and our leading lady have the same problem as Robin Cook sometimes -- when the characters start moving around and breaking into places and being mugged, being tailed, etc. etc., it just gets a little tough to believe. I believe if V.I. stayed put a little more and did a little more cerebral work and a little less hotdogging 'round Chicago, we'd both be happer.I'm still a fan, but I'd rather see fewer and more well developed characters, a somewhat less complicated yet compelling plot, and surely less social commentary. Letting some reasonable actions speak for themselves is better than rubbing our faces in it. Would like to see Paretsky stop reading Grisham and get back to her earlier self!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Author","review":"I am a fan of Sara Parestky. she writes well and her plots are complex enough to keep you enthralled and the characters have clear identities that are easy to identify with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Solution For Center Channel Small Space","review":"The Infinity gives great sound for such a small enclosure, and blends in perfectly with my den setup.

A few parts have good content and actually teach worthwhile stuff. But for the most part the chapters either (a) just echo the online documentaion, telling you that you can change the font by applying the font property [doh!], (b) attempt to explain a complex topic in a dozen paragraphs, and so you learn nothing useful, or (c) are just plain flat wrong.I don't have time to go into all the errors I found. The book is so bad that I couldn't even consider donating it to any charitable drive. It's now being used for starting fires in our fireplace. Come to think of it, that might be the best use for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does many things, badly","review":"I'm new to VB, whereas this book intends to explain VB.NET to developers who were familiar with earlier versions of VB. Even though that probably retards my learning, I'm still convinced this book fails. Imagine, nothing but brief code fragments, and no hands-on exercizes, until page 219?? Actually, there are no hands-on exercises even at that point, just source code for some apps on a small CD.Every chapter is skimpy, every chapter leaves something out. This book is too clumsy to help beginners and too incomplete to help competent developers.I learned some VB.NET, and I'm continuing to learn it, but not with this book - with the MSDN documentation on the web. That's not how it should be when you buy a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sour, and full of powder","review":"I ordered this as well as Metagenics Cal-Apatite chewable calcium (chocolate flavor), and hands down prefer the latter. This product is overly sour (and I like sour/tart tastes in general), so that as you're trying to chew it up your eyebrows raise, your face crunches up and your jaw would hurt if you were to laugh. Also (and this might partially be due to handling during shipping), these wafers are coated in an extreme amount of powder from the broken ones inside. No kidding, if you try to pour a few wafers into your hand, get the vacuum ready. And if you try to reach in with your fingers to grab your dose, your fingers and knuckles will emerge coated in powder and you'll need to wash your hands.

The movie skips and then in the next scene she's alive and running around while the two who were fighting in the previous scene are now together and fighting a different character altogether.Very disappointing.Maybe the video is the complete film, but avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of bug, unwatchable","review":"...Two problems I had with this DVD:(1) The movie kept jumping (skipping) scenes.

Personally, I've read it literally tons of times, but still can't put it down!! A must read for anyone who enjoys an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book that could of been better","review":"Peter Telep has written great Descent Novels that have thrilled me and made me actaully pick up a book. I eagerly awaited the book after playing Descent3. The book seemed great at first, but it gradually drifted away from the story in the game which I disliked immensly. Some examples were that some of the Descent2 Weapons are still in, and St. John never went to Venus to confront Dravis. This is a good book but could of been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS GREATLY OVER-RATED","review":"The book starts out good in the first half but then gets worse and worse. There is too much of constant techno-babble and dogfights that really become boring and irritating. Many things in the plot have nothing to do with the game and are there just to lenghten the story (ex: St. Johns's wife hostage situation etc). Although there is a lot of humor in the book that made me crack up, the rest made me grit my teeth as I struggled to read on. I have come to know every Descent game very well and was greatly disappointed by this book. It could have been a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned a Second Time","review":"I just sent back my 2nd watch box. The first one had a major scratch in the mid-rear lid. The 2nd one had a chip on a box corner, with a poor repair attempt--but the main problem was that the lock mechanism was not aligned; the top and base were out of alignment by about 1/4 inch--no way to engage the lock. Also the key does not seat well into the lock opening. Both boxes were clearly a 2nd time around, i.e. previous returns, as the interior wrapping was torn and the foam parts torn or missing.

I think this book certainly is insightfull in the way it describes the 'undercurrents' of the behaviour (some) girls show when they're amongst each other or how this 'thing' is always in the background waiting to attack (so to speak). And it makes clear how this - sometimes downright cruel - behaviour affects the 'odd girls out'.

However, the author focuses way too much on her research methods rather than drawing conclusions from the research. She also spends too much time giving unnecessary details of each subject's situation. Another annoying factor is that the author constantly throws in references to the movie 'Heathers', as if we all should have seen & memorized it. The only value in this book is that it will remind you that you are not alone in your past or present feelings of isolation and/or loneliness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignantly Redundant","review":"Simmons writes in a direct manner, however, I sometimes get the feeling that this straightforward style forced her to fill the pages with the same thing over and over. After a while, you just kind of get the point and every chapter seems to be only slightly variant than the last.

Simmons relies mostly on case histories but her storytelling style is weak. The reader can quickly get lost in the web of unrelated characters Simmons presents us and their dull boring lives. Worse, once we labor through these the case histories, Simmons offer little in the way on commentary or insight upon the girls' stories she has collected. It would have been better for her to offer more in the way of a thesis up front.

A well written book can be such a joy to read, but I'm sad to say that I have to force myself to read this one - like forcing myself to have a spoonful of cod liver oil 'cause it's good for me. Not only was the content editing much too sparse, there were quite a few grammatical and spelling errors as well. Tsk Tsk. That said, the subject matter is fascinating and definitely of importance.

On the other hand, I also read this other book, Queen Bees and Wannabes, which covers some similar terrain but with an emphasis on the practical, and I've already applied some of what I learned in that book to meaningful effect. I'm going to go back and reread Queen Bees and mark it up (and make my husband read it!), and expect it to be of even greater help down the road.

That should tell the reader how much we liked the series.One of the most valuable qualities that this material has is the confessional nature of Jimmy Evans. He can speak effectively to the male, and all the while, keep the females on board with his frank admiration of Karen, who has seen through him, and yet loves him still.Evans is not a 'girlie man'...he seems to be genuine, arrogant, and vain, but he knows it and points out the fallacies of the male point of view. Women can gain tremendous insight into the strong and shallow impulses of men, while men gain an idea about how to really connect with their wife...and daughter...and mother...and boss.

The musicians sing in their throats and the songs are written almost exactly like the early 80's love songs, with the same electronic feel.

Furthermore, any author who seems to have very few credentials in dog behavior (she's not a vet, a behaviorist, a trainer, or a biologist) and ostensibly calls her book the Dog Bible and actually believes that the majority of pit bull attacks were seemingly unprovoked either a) has no idea about dog behavior and knows the other factors going into any dog attacks (pit bull or not) and/or b) is foolish enough to believe the media pot stirring over these dogs is just plain stupid or maybe secretly afraid of these dogs.

Everyone was running around assuming this that and the other thing about everyone else, which is rather flimsy when holding up the novel. I'm surprised the book was as long as it was. Still, it was Mary Jo Putney's first book, and I haven't read any of her others, so maybe this was just her \\"warm up\\" to the writing industry.

This time around, I was shocked by how little I had remembered about it, so unfortunately, though this set of four short stories that interlink together was interesting, it was rather forgettable. The links between the stories provided the most fascinating aspect of this rather hard to classify book as a whole. The book was certainly well written, though, but unfortunately not very relatable.

I was very disappointed when I finally got to use it. Like others said, the cord unplugs very easily, which is a hassle. Also I was only able to pump a few ounces at a time. On the plus side, the design itself is nice, attractive and easy to use, however the results I had with it were very disappointing. I really wish I would have invested in a better, more expensive one. I am now pregnant with #2 and I am looking at other pumps, wishing I wouldn't have bought this one. I hope this helps"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like a ball and chain","review":"Whatever you do, spend the extra $100 and get a double pump. I had the pump in style with my first and only used it for a few months(but I really liked it) so I thought I would spend less on this one and just dedicate the extra time to pumping while I'm home. BIG MISTAKE!! First off it takes forever to pump, and then you still have to do the other breast. Because it's such a weak pump, I get really engorged and when I'm pumping, the milk somehow goes into the tube and makes a huge mess and I have to take it off, clean it and start all over. It's honestly like a ball and chain. I have NO time to do anything else, including enjoying my newborn child. Just a complete waste of money. I regret this buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done.","review":"That's the only pump I've ever used so I can't compare it to others, but it does get the job done. I've been using it for the last 6 weeks (since my son was born) and I've been pretty happy with it. I don't pump much, usually just one bottle a day, so I'm not sure how efficient the swing would be if I needed to pump more. It's a bit loud, but it doesn't bother me. The soft shield it came with got all stretched out within a couple weeks and lowered both the comfort and efficiency when pumping - I had to get a new, regular one piece breast shield and it works much better in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a very bad item.","review":"I just bought this product for less than 2 weeks and the Sofefit shield is already broken.Then, I have to keep spending money to order replacements over and over again.I rated this product 1 star due to low reliability, I really don't like it.Anyone who interests in this item please just save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"medela swing","review":"I bought this pump a month after my youngest was born,I was a 1st time breastfeeding momma so I was clueless about breastpumps. If I had to do it all over again I would not buy the swing again. I thought I just got a bad pump but that wasn't the case I contacted medela and they sent me a new motor however it was useless just like the first one. It doesn't suck as hard as you think a breastpump would. I can hand express more milk in less time! I thought maybe it was a low milk supply issue trust me it wasn't! I can only pump about 2 oz total and that's from both sides together. Either buy a more powerful one or save yourself the money and worry. I pump at the highest vaccume and it barly draws my nipples in and I'm using the correct size shield!

However, that being said, it has been only a few weeks and it feels like it is harder and harder to get milk out.Also, more importantly, milk consistently gets sucked up the tubing. I hold the horn/bottle upright and keep the motor/pump higher than the bottle but for whatever reason my milk refuses to go down the correct passageway to the bottle. The horn is incredibly annoying since (unlike the older version) you can't even see what the heck is in there (parts are yellow plastic). I don't know if I have a bad horn or if I'm doing something wrong (I have NEVER had this problem with my pump in style).I'm sad that I dropped about 150 on this and it isn't all that great. I wish the baby market were a bit more reasonable...."},{"rating":"1","title":"It don't mean a thing if it IS the Swing...","review":"I've been lugging around my Pump-n-Style through three babies... until it finally broke. I was turned on to the Swing 'cause it's so compact - and cute - and considering baby #3 is now 10 months old, I thought the Swing would be a wise buy, because I'm only pumping a few times a week. WRONG!!! Give me back my Pump-n-Style! The Swing takes at least 3x as long - w/ the Pump-n-Style I'm able to set up, pump both breasts and put everything back in the bag w/in 10 minutes. The Swing takes AT LEAST half an hour - not good when I only get 30 minutes for a lunch break @ work.... What's worse is I just don't get as much milk with the Swing: and my breasts are engorged again much sooner. The \\"Advanced\\" option makes absolutely no difference. I'm taking back the Swing and getting another Pump-n-Style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pump!","review":"After reading tons of reviews on breast pumps (which I really don't even have time to do), I'm so glad I decided on this pump.

I work part time and use to feed my daughter when I'm away. It works well and is compact and quiet. However, it drains batteries after only a few uses, so don't forget the AC adapter! Also, you have to hold it just right so milk doesn't go in the air tube.

As a result I can no longer give my baby bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"At first, I was really impressed with this product. I was using it multiple times a day when I got back to work. Then, inexplicably after 6 weeks, it stopped working. I bought a second one. 6 weeks after that, the pump lost suction. At $120+, I am unable to afford another. Due to the mediocre quality of this product, my milk is starting to go dry, as it will not provide adequate suction to maintain my supply. I bought this one from a friends recommendation--my own recommendation is to look elsewhere and try other products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Pump","review":"I have used the Medela single electric, the swing and the Pump in Style Advanced, and a Whittlestone Breast Expresser. The Swing is the most effective of the four for me. I get more milk using it than from any of the other three. It is painless and the quietest of them all. I highly reccomend this pump. Plus it is very portable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pump for the money","review":"I bought this pump for my wife after getting tired of paying $75 dollars a month for the hospital grade. My wife likes it, however she has to release the cup from her breast periodically because the plastic membrane where the milk releases into the bottle sometimes gets stuck due to the vacuum created by the suction forcing breast milk into the suction tube. It is also much louder then the hospital grade. I recommend it to anyone who has already established a milk supply and doesn't pump two breasts at once. (This is all info from my wife, obviously.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great value for price","review":"When I left the hospital with my newborn baby girl my milk hadn't come it yet. My baby had lost more than 10% of her weight so they were talking about keeping her there and discharging me unless I was willing to supplement with formula. I cringed at this idea because I wanted to exclusively breast feed. They set me up with a rental for the medela symphony (dual pump) for $70/mo. As soon as I saw the swing pump on amazon for this price I knew it would be a much better deal even though it's a single pump it does the exact same thing for WAY less money. Would DEFINATELY reccomend, awesome product has been a life saver when engorged.BTW, I supplemented for a day and my milk came in completely due to using this product. If you are considering purchasing it would be wise to do so in my opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for SAHM's","review":"I really thought this was a wonderful pump for stay at home mom's. I'm not sure how great it would be if you were exclusively pumping during the day while working, but for my periodic uses, I loved it. I usually used it on electric power, since I thought it ate through batteries pretty quickly, but when I did need to use it on battery power (like in the car) it worked well too. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I felt like it did not have quite as powerful of a suction on battery, but since I was usually plugged in, that wasn't an issue for me. I did use it while on vacation without my child for 5 days, pumping at least 6 times per day, including two 8 hour car trips, and it worked great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome pump if used correctly","review":"I bought this pump because I wanted to increase my milk supply and the hand pump was difficult and painful to use. This was very easy to put together and it works amazingly, as long as you clean it properly EVERY TIME and leave the pump running after you've finished for about 2-3 minutes. After about a month, I started getting condensation in the tubing every time I pumped, and then a few weeks later I started getting some milk in the tubing. After I cleaned it as the instructions say, I started leaving the pump running with only the tubing attached for a few minutes after each pumping session, and have not had any problems since. I love that it is comfortable and you can adjust the suction as well as the fact that it can be plugged in or operate on batteries. WORTH EVERY PENNY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Well, this pump must work for some people, based on the number of good reivews, but it doesn't work for me--unless I have over an hour to pump 4 oz. I don't know whether it is the suction or the speed, but it just takes forever to get not nearly enough milk! Also, this pump has turned off on me for no reason! (I work from home and don't pump often, so nothing should be worn out yet!)I really like the fact that it is a single pump, as I only pump one side at a time, but this product just isn't good enough to feed my daughter with a bottle, forget about keeping my supply up. So, I'm still on the search for a good pump. (Lansinoh is my next try, even though it's a double.)Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money - Very Dissappointing","review":"I purchased this pump a month and a half ago and it is barely working. When i first started pumping it worked really well and i would get at least 20 ounces a day. Now it takes at least two hours for 4 ounces to be pumped.I believe the problem is either with the suction (tubing to flimsy and narrow) or the small size of motor that cannot handle even average capacity of pumping. For the amount of money spent is certaintly is a dissappointment. I intended to breastfeed my baby exclusively using the pump as my backup when i return to work and now after spending all that money i also have to buy formula for my baby in these hard economic times.The manufacturers need to revisit this product or reduce the price and its false claims. This is a legitimate review. I am from Trinidad, West Indies. If you know of any other more reliable pump please contact i am desparately in need of one. Please dont make the same mistake i made.

They are sending a new motor, but I will forever expect it to stop working at any moment because of this horrible first impression.And the AC adaptor plug comes out SO easy if it's pulled on or jiggled in the slightest, like others have complained about in their reviews.To produce milk efficiently, we are supposed to be relaxed and without stress to help our body pump effectively, and this pump has already caused me nothing but annoyance and stress. I'll never recommend Medela products just for the fact that I would be embarrassed to rave about it and then the person pull theirs out of the box BROKE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak pump and gets milk in the tubing","review":"What a huge waste of money. I have a Pump in Style Advanced which I love. But I leave it at work and one day, I was staying home sick when I realized that my baby was at daycare and my pump was at work and I was in trouble. So, I went out and dropped $150 on the Medela Swing. I was pleased with my purchase since I liked my pump in style so much and I thought this would be fine for very occasional use. First of all, the swing has increadibly weak suction. It took me over 30 minutes on each side just to get my breasts down to a comfortable level, not even to empty them completely! I shudder to think what this one sick day of pumping will do to my supply for the next few days. Plus, the little white flange doesn't open and close with each pump like it's supposed to. As a result, your milk gets trapped in the little yellow flap and then flows up into the tubing! If you are buying a breast pump, please please please shell out the extra money for the Pump In Style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only pump you'll ever need!","review":"Was about to give up giving breast milk to my 1-1/2 month old baby... when i decided to purchase this pump...

The suction is less than i would have wanted and also loses strength if you use just battery power. the pumping tubes do not secure well into the pump or bottle so have a tendency to slip out - a very irritating design fault. Condensation forms in the tubes quickly and can go mouldy. It does the job but with a bit of tinkering by the medela design team, it could work even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable","review":"Pump stopped working after 2 weeks usage , simply not a durable device , the motor of the pump works but it seems something in the pump failed , the pump mechanism is sealed so its useless at the moment.I recommend going for the higuer end medela pump , i tried to save some money buying this model for my wife and ended up buying the higuer double pump model which is more durable.DONT recommend this specific model."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would buy this over and over again","review":"I have owned two other cheaper pumps before finally buying this one. I needed something small and for every once in awhile while relocating, and it has been great. I use it every single day and it doesn't let me down. I owned two other dual pumps and I thought that this being a single would bother me, but really it works better and has less parts so it is actually more convient. I have had to use this is the car a few times and I thought because it was running off batteries it wouldn't be as powerful but it worked just as well as being plugged in. I would recommend this to someone that wants something small and light weight. It is a little noisy but not so much that I wouldn't recommend it. If something happened to this one, I would turn around and buy the exact same one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reliable brand, over priced pump","review":"This is a good pump but it is pretty weak. I have a problem with my milk supply and this was not the pump to help with that problem. It is absolutely not worth paying over $100 for.

I haven't tried any other pumps, so I don't know if there is something better out there. But I find the Swing completely frustrating to use. As other reviewers have said, milk seems to go up into the tubing often. Also, sometimes it works and I get a couple of ounces but other times I get no milk at all, or just a drop or two. And this is when I KNOW there is milk in there because it's been a couple of hours since I nursed and I can feel my breasts are full. I'll spend 30 minutes pumping with nothing to show for it.

The sample questions are strikingly different than the several other review/sample test books that I have. What's really amazing is the bad answers. Some of them are so bad that I don't trust any of the answers, which means that the sample questions are worthless. Here's an example: \\"Which of the following demonstrates good body mechanics?\\" The answer listed as correct is \\"Keep the feet and knees close together and bend at the waist.\\" OMG, that's awful! All of the questions have answers A, B, C or D to choose from. But answer 87 in the key is \\"E\\". Huh?

Overall I enjoy reviewing from this guide"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I gave the lower rating because I was expecting a more thorough book to study for. I started off using this book to study for my national test and realized that I was better off reviewing my text from school. It's too general and not enough information to explain what your studying. Would work good to review things while in business. Would not recommend utilizing only this book to pass the national."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for therapeutic Massage & Bodywork Certification","review":"I thought this workbook was awesome ...

I'll still refer to my class notes, and study my textbooks, but this is a book I'll spend a lot of time with.Some of the more negative reviewer comments seem to reference the first edition of this guide, because topics mentioned as missing are included in the second edition.

When I got it, I could not believe how such a small glitch could suck all the fun out of an otherwise great game. The glitch is the frequent slow-downs and sudden speed-ups or even pauses while you are playing. I got killed a lot because the game would pause near a horde of monsters and when it un-pauses the monsters will be all over my character and he will be killed, or it would speed-up and I can't keep up with the monsters attacks. THQ advices that you should not teleport a lot in the game to avoid this problem, but why should we stop using a main feature of the game, why didn't THQ solve this problem. Furthermore, I suffer from this problem even before I teleport? And believe me it's a problem that will annoy the most loyal fans of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Titan Quest TOI","review":"Fun action ggame, more depth, more story line...a blast to play.

Her stories are so unique and her prose is so rich and beautifully articulated. It's easy to immerse yourself in her stories even if they are oddly disturbing.This is a strange tale, but very compelling. My biggest disappointment was that the book was over too quickly. I kept saying, \\"just one more chapter,\\" until it was completed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I found PRINCE OF LOST PLACES.","review":"I read this book in just over a day and loved it. Kathy Hepinstall tells a simple story about a mother who \\"steals\\" her son and goes off on an adventure to live in a cave hoping to protect him from the real world. The story and style remind me of Cormac McCarthy's Child of God and William Gay's Twilight, two other gothic novels. I have to admit I was not prepared or expecting the surprise ending, which made the book a special treat. I look forward to reading Hepinstall's other novels, THE ABSCENCE OF NECTAR and THE HOUSE OF GENTLE MEN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book--couldn't put it down!","review":"I absolutely devoured \\"prince of lost places\\" and i loved, loved, loved it. from the get-go, its characters are compelling and the story is incredibly absorbing from beginning to end.there's also a great twist that i did NOT see coming, which explains why i didn't move from my couch for the last 150 pages. great read, brilliant plot, awesome writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly written, reads fast","review":"There is no subtlety in this clearly written, fast-paced tale, which seems to lack any relationship to what is feasible even by a mentally disturbed mother. My realistic soul simply could not accept that even one in the central character's mental condition could do and effectuate what she is related to have done and accomplished. Possibly one should suspend one's view of reality when reading another's fictional creation, but I never was one much for fantasy and anyway this does not, at least overtly, purport to be fantasy. Nor could I applaud the ending. But I am not one to judge a book of this genre. I kept wondering whether this is supposed to be a Harlequin-type book (I've never read such so...), or \\"young adult\\"? But I guess it is classified as a psychological thriller, but evidence of psychological veracity if present was not noticed by me. But I am no psychologist. I felt reading this book was not a valuable use of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Spectrum of Love","review":"Kathy Hepinstall continues to introduce refreshingly new tales that are beginning to delineate a voice that is clearly unique. As in her previous two novels PRINCE OF LOST PLACES takes us on a whirlwind journey that transplants a mother and son from a fearful society to a Plato's Cave. The story is well outlined in both the editorial and reviewers' comments on this site. Suffice it to say that Hepinstall is maturing in her language, her clarity of character delineation, and in her particular gift for creating atmosphere. She is a solid writer and will hopefully have another novel on the shelves soon. Follow this writer - she is terific!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not hepinstall's best","review":"Kathy has crafted her books, but this one seems rushed. It is very short and the plot suffers from the lazy effort. The ending was not a shocker, as any alert reader would pick up on by page four. Sorry, but I did not like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mystery To Befuddle Sherlock Homes!","review":"Take a large helping of mystery, add a heap of suspense and sprinkle liberally with a charming romance, and you've got one of the best mysteries this side of Sherlock.

Tastes like its a complex home mixture of spices etc for chai tea but its all in a simple tea bag! AMAZING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what's going on?","review":"I loved the Tazo Organic Chai spiced black tea (at first). I brewed it a cup of hot water, no sweeteners. The tastes was good, it gave me a calming feeling, I felt mentally sharp, and could focus. However, the bad news is that 12 hours later, I could not sleep at night! I watched the clock tick all night long. After two days of this, I suspected the tea (as the only thing different in my routine). Since I have a personal and family history of hypertension (although under control by diet, medication, and exercise), I checked by BP that morning when I could not sleep: 148/98 and a pulse of 98! Something in that tea (I suspect) is interacting with my system. I don't ever want to go through this before., Has anyone else experienced this???"},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been good BUT","review":"the CD is typical of bad mastering. Everything is compressed and shrill sounding. Please girls take a lesson from Brian Wilson on recording quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Return of Wilson Phillips","review":"I am so glad that WP is back together. I really missed their harmonies and their great pop sound that was upbeat and fun to listen to. These covers are not obscure and they have modern arrangements. My favorite song on the cd is \\"You're No Good\\". I wish it could have been the first single off the cd because \\"Go Your Own Way\\" is about the only downtempo song on the cd. They also look fabulous! Their individual voices have become so warm and melodic. This cd will be the soundtrack to my summer and I can't wait until their cd of new material(this is fine for now)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but it feels like a ripoff","review":"I used to like this band. Good, easy-listening AOR-pop. This album isn't a huge disappointment but a bunch of cover songs after so big hiatus doesn't really convince me that this band is really back.18$ for this CD is a ripoff, it's very short. But what the heck, it has nice cover picture of the girls sitting cute and barefoot on the sofa.Save your money and buy some of their old albums instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD should be called \\"Collection of Butchered Songs\\"","review":"I was excited to find that Wilson Phillips finally had a new cd out. I figured, how could you go wrong with such a great group and so many great songs. I was even sceptical when I read the other reviews that warned people about the awful remakes on the cd. Then I had a chance to hear the cd for myself. I have never heard remakes as awful sounding as these and what's worse is they're all on one disc so the torture just goes on and on! Even though I am not as big of a fan of the original artists as I am of Wilson Phillips, I'd much rather hear the originals any day. It's weird 'cause I love those old songs and I love Wilson Phillips but put them together and it's awful! The cd makes my ears cringe! If I were to even consider buying this cd, it would only be out of complete desperation to have something new from Wilson Phillips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest comeback","review":"While it appears on the surface a cd full of remakes would be ideal as the perfect comeback, however for Wilson Phillips who only had two albums to begin with isnt such a great move. The only good songs I care for is \\"Your No Good\\" & \\"You Can Go Your Own Way\\" & Already Gone. They sound like they should be bonus cuts on a Wilson Phillips Cd with all new material. To wait so many years for them to get back together and record something only luke warm, isnt very exciting. I say pick up greatest hits and hope they come out with a album of all new material instead. Note: There is also a hidden track acoustic version of Already Gone which sounds pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, breezy, delicious","review":"Wilson Phillips is back again with \\"California,\\" an album that covers songs all about or from their native state. As on their other albums, the harmonies are crisp, clean and filled with light--no surprise, since the three have been singing together since childhood.A couple of the tracks are uninspired, but others are a lovely surprise. \\"Go Your Own Way\\" is transformed from Fleetwood Mac's propulsive \\"go to hell\\" version into something filled with melancholy, tenderness and heartache. \\"In My Room\\" sounds just as gorgeous here as it did when the Beach Boys recorded it, and in fact, Papa Brian Wilson sits in on piano and vocals.Carnie Wilson is a delight on \\"Old Man\\" and \\"Get Together\\"--the caramel richness of her voice is appropriately dark for these two songs and on the rest of the album, she anchors the soaring, more lightweight voices of her sister Wendy and of Chynna Phillips. The album is fluff--it's sweet--it's lightweight--but it's also lovely to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE LOVE Fleetwood Mac and...","review":"WP offers a great cover of \\"Go your own way.\\" Ok, so the irony of the song is lost and no jangly guitar, but what the ---,these gals, through harmony, make it a heartbreak song,and it works. Is it different -- yes. But, after repeated listenings, I find myself humming the WP version all the time.

An overproduced covers album? You've gotta be kidding me. Coming back to sing songs that you didn't even write is not exactly the best way to re-establish your musical relevance and artistic credibility. These three need to get back to the studio and actually CREATE an album, show they have something new to say, and then I'll consider it a comeback. This... this generic offering just shows that the girls can sing, which, thank you very much, I already knew. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"nothing original here&you gotta wonder why they even bother coming back on alot of levels.Musically they are just kinda there.they may do a song or two alright but on a whole they have never moved me&this Album of covers doesn't so any growth then when they had there little run in the early 90's.same ole same they just took off a Decade basically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the cover songs!!!!","review":"I can't believe they make a comeback after 12 years and we get an album full of cover songs!!!

Every time I hear this song on the radio I have to turn the volume down or turn the station! The only good thing I can say about this song is that it is thankfully sooooo unlike the original awesome F. Mac version.

They were all classic in 60' & 70' which is the golden age bright California !!!And three girls cover the song by the W.P. style.It's amazing~ With the CD ~ I can imagine the pacific ocean high way ~ and views of california on my mind.

It wasn't \\"cool\\" to like them anymore. I picked up \\"California\\" today just to see what it was like and I was blown away. They've taken the \\"Classics\\" from all over and made them their own. The harmonies are still there - just as sweet. But each is given a chance to shine on her own. I recommend this to anyone who has ever liked them. Glad to have them back and in such great form. Brava!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasure to Listen to Familiar Favorites","review":"This album is a guilty pleasure, like eating whipped cream straight from the can - light, frothy and quite enjoyable. The surprise for me was how Wendy Wilson (whom I had always regarded as the weakest singer of the three) came into her own on this album; I love her renditions of Joni Mitchell's \\"California\\" and Jackson Browne's \\"Doctor My Eyes\\". I found only one song's arrangement to be somewhat disappointing, Lindsey Buckingham's \\"Go Your Own Way\\" (I think this song needs the hard edge that Fleetwood Mac gave it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"As a fan of Wilson Phillips and these great old songs, I was so excited to get this CD. I was so dissappointed. I thought the arrangments were horrid and the singing left a lot to be desired.

Their version of \\"Go Your Own Way\\" is a hideous puke-inducing abomination. It is the worst cover version of any song I've ever heard in 40 years. If Lindsay Buckingham allowed this, he must have been truly coked out at the time. I shall not try to find out, because if he did I would lose almost all respect for him. The rest of the covers on this disc are merely bad to mediocre. \\"Go your own way\\" is vile and loathsome. I will have to listen to Fleetwood Mac's version at least a hundred times to begin to wipe the revolting memories from my violated mind. Gotta run and hurl and retch now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"WP came out in 1990 and not the 1980's as other reviewers have listed.

What a shame......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on You Wilson Phillips!","review":"I'm astounded by how truly bad this album is, and how amazon reviewers can actually give it 5 stars. Are we listening to the same record, folks? To me this album is just pointless, an expedient concept record designed to test the waters to see if the girls still have commercial viability. I guess if this album sells a few copies, the girls will have the incentive to actually go into the studio and write and record their own music. That's what artists do, isn't it? But you would think the girls could have mustered the strength and set aside some time in their schedules to write at least one song, especially since its been so long since we have had anything new from them. What a shame, and shame on you Wilson Phillips. Pure laziness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again!","review":"Always a dis-pleasure to know that the daughters of 2nd rate, over the hill pop wash-outs are at it again. Michelle Phillips' claim to fame is she was lucky enough to have slept with the guy who actually wrote the songs that made her famous, and the alure of the Beach Boys went out when people who surfed their lives away in the 60's actually found something to do with their lives. And now her daughter wants to carry that tradition on. God rest the soul of John Phillips.Flying high on only their family names, this trio of wanna-be's have proven with their latest effort, that they can only record covers of previously successful material rather than try something original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tunes for a hot summer night","review":"Although the majority of the songs on this CD have already been released on other albums, they come together well for a theme-based disc that'll get your blood flowing for a summer party. The styles range from vocals with a lively chorus, to the biting brass and lush strings James Last is known for. Interestingly, the different styles work together well.

The good news is that HP service was excellent, they picked up the machine in one day, turned it around in one day, and I got it back the following day. The bad news is that the second keyboard, while much better is still not acceptable. The further bad news was that I had to reinstall windows before they would replace the keyboard, to make sure it wasn't a driver issue...although this made sense to me at the time, I now realize they should have had this issue in their database, and should not have put me thru that exercise...on the other hand my wife also has a dv8000 series machine and that keyboard is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad keyboard and lousy support at HP","review":"I got a laptop and my L key wasn't working all the time and the shift key would get stuck and after over a year they still do.

Having only recently visited NYC for the first time, I was looking for a book that captured the feeling the city gave me, the sense of connectedness just being on the street provided. This book does that, highlighting the little things that make the city wonderful. It reminds me of the wonder of NYC more than any photograph I took (and I'm a photographer!). Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for any movielover","review":"Being a huge fan of \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000,\\" I was quite interested in this book-length discussion of movies by Kevin Murphy. I was surprised to find that the book is actually several different books in one. The basic concept is that Murphy spent an entire year going to the movies every single day. The book that resulted from this experiment was sometimes a movie review (such as where he called \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" an \\"infected lump of pig offal\\"), sometimes a travelogue (such as the chapter where he visits the smallest movie theater in the world) and sometimes just a love letter to the art of film. For all the years Murphy has spent tearing apart terrible movies, he is clearly someone who loves movies, who wants to see them elevated to their highest form. This book is funny, entertaining and thought-provoking... well worth it for any movielover."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAYBE two-and-a-half stars, tops","review":".Pretty disappointing, IMO.I read this on a couple of back-to-back plane-flights, and... it just really LACKED something.One thing the potential buyer should know before buying is that this book, while all about the theatrical EXPERIENCE, doesn't actually talk about the viewed films much at all. Oh, there is the occasional complaint about 'modern cinema', etc etc etc, but there are no real reviews of the films in the book.Which would be fine, if the book was entertaining. Sadly, it just isn't. Oh, there is the odd interesting anecdote, and a funny moment or two. But it just doesn't hold the attention from chapter to chapter. In the end, the reader feels like s/he has been nagged-at for a few hundred pages.Given Murphy's role in MST3k, I'd expected more. Too much, perhaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much repetitive complaining","review":"The fact that the author went to a movie everyday for a year is a complete gimmick to get you to buy this book which basically is 362 pages of him ranting about all the things he hates about going to the movies. Some stuff is genuinely funny but after a while you get sick of reading him complaining about these things (such as advertising) that really aren't that big of a deal. He hardly even talks about the movies themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-righteous and Indulgent","review":"Good God, is this book self-righteous. I bought it based on its compelling premise, and in return I received endless tirades on the inadequacies of movies, movie theatres, movie audiences, and every other topic that managed to crawl up Mr. Murphy's ... and opinions that Mr. Murphy has used to bore people at dinner parties for YEARS and now he's found an opportunity to share his \\"wisdom\\" and \\"perfect\\" taste to a wider audience. The one advantage we have is that we can stop reading (I did) whereas the friends and family of Mr. Murphy are still stuck listening to him complain, which is the #1 component of this book. The only thing that saves it from a one-star review is that there is some nice pro Laurel and Hardy propoganda, which means that Mr. Murphy got at least one thing right. Otherwise, it's a lot of self-satisfied griping."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I had been looking forward to this book for a long time. As a Mystery Science Theater 3000 fan, I hoped the idea of MST3K regular Kevin Murphy writing about the movie-going experience (he planned to see a movie every day) would be fun and entertaining. Murphy's book is neither.The major failure of the book is that Murphy's basic hook-- seeing a movie every day-- is unexplored. He breaks his movie going experience down week by week, starting with a list of the films he has seen duering the given week. However, he spends little time reviewing the films, instead, we get a week by week diary of how Murphy spent a (mostly)uninteresting 2001.The other problem is Murphy's tone. He comes off smug and self-satisfied, a tone that unfortunatly crept into the later years of MST3K (as well as into MST3K regular Mike Nelson's second book).A major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, annoying book.","review":"Being the film nut I am, I bought this book thinking that it looked like a really fun read. And it was: for about eighty pages. After that, I realized that I had gotten stuck in the quicksand of one man's midlife crisis. Kevin Murphy sounds more bitter than my great-aunt,and believe me, that is a hard thing to do. If you're excruciatingly bitter and don't mind 52 chapters of kvetching, go on ahead: this book may just be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"drinking the old ways","review":"For these years when most bands produce dull music, Tankard stands out with Kreator even Sodom in producing interesting and pleasing pieces of work.Guitar sounds are strong, production is excellent, and drums are classic metal. Although its not quite 'thrashy' its still a worthwhile CD if you can get it at decent price.To my opinion, Tankard is on even level with other more known metal acts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"Both \\"Badlands\\" books were a waste of time. I've just been catching up on my Star Trek reading and these were the last 2 of 7 books I had to read. It took me as longer to read them as the other 5. I can't put my finger on anything specific, it's just that they were very easy to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ripped 3","review":"I have read numerous diet and exercise books. This is one of the best. It is well thought out and thorough."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Pad is Too Small","review":"The size says \\"Adult\\", so I assumed it was one size fits all, but these pads do not fit even a small adult. My thai boxing coach is 5'7\\" weighing 135 pounds, and he was barely able to get the pads over his forearm, and the fit around his elbow was too tight and restricted blood flow. So I gave the pair to one of the kids at our dojo.The quality is irrelevant if you can't apply it; it's ridiculous how small these pads are."},{"rating":"1","title":"good and bad","review":"These things fit my 115 pound wife fine. I'm a 240 pound man and had to cut holes in the elastic to make them semi-comfortable. I use them for computer elbow and the pad part is nice but it would be better if they had size options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Founding Fish","review":"Excellent book by McPhee. A lot about fish and so much more. Good as an adjunct to a study of the Delaware River and Colonial times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Remarkable Shad","review":"John McPhee has the ability - which I prize as a reader - to write engagingly about any subject, and Founding Fish is no exception. In this case, the subject is the American Shad. The fish is prized by anglers and gourmands and pops in and out of American history. But this is not \\"the cultural history of American Shad\\" (are we tired of these \\"cultural history of...\\" books yet?\\" Instead he weaves history with science as well as plenty of personal observation. The myriad digressions are like seams of precious metal. McPhee's world is populated with fascinating characters - ichthyologists, shad dart makers, and a seine fisherman from the Bay of Fundy. If you have a taste for non-fiction and would like a book that is diverting and pleasurable (rather than \\"hard-hitting\\" and topical) try reading John McPhee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much detail, too little McPhee","review":"I was really excited to sit down with this, but I came away pretty unimpressed. This doesn't really match up to other classic McPhee writings. It's too focused on cataloging every mention of shad in American history, to the point of boredom. There are a few nice vignettes of shad fishermen and fish scientists, but they are brief, and they don't make up the narrative arc of the story as so many other McPhee writings do.If you're really into fish, you're going to like this. But unlike other McPhee books, it didn't draw me in when I wasn't interested in the subject. It's good writing, just not presented in an interesting way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful for history and fish lovers","review":"enjoyed this book even thought I am not an angler. Lots of American history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling, poorly written, dull and didactic","review":"What a disappointment! What a mess. A few interesting tidbits here and there but mostly just poorly worded ramblings. I could do without the animal rights lecture also; it was fraught with the baseless anthropomorphisms so commonly tossed into the ring by those too lazy to actually do any research of their own. Furthermore, anyone who takes hours to land a 5 lb. fish has no right to claim any high ground on animal rights. Look in the mirror Mr. McPhee and you'll see someone who \\"plays\\" with his food!But really, it's the writing, or lack thereof, in this book that makes it one of the worst I have read in the past 20 years.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring....","review":"I listened to the audio cd version of this book - read by the author no less. And that's actually part of what made it so boring. He was so monotonous. I also thought that it read like a personal diary as oposed to an organized book. There didn't seem to be a structure to this book. There wasn't a story thread or thesis. Instead it all seemed like an aside or random thoughts about Shad fish thrown together. I\\"d just read the \\"Cod\\" book by Kurlansky - which was fabulous. So I guess I was expecting something of that caliber. One good thing was his description of the joy of fishing. I have to say that before I read this, I didn't understand why people would want to spend their time fishing. Now I at least I've gained an insight as to what makes fishermen tick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"I very much enjoyed Coming into the Country (though it rambles in places), so I looked forward to listening to The Founding Fish on morning walks. What a disappointment. The audio version is read by McPhee, who unfortunately does not have a pleasant voice. The book tells one heroic fishing story after another--only I just don't get what's heroic about killing fish. I've got to stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Delaware May Flow Nicely - This Book Doesn't","review":"I have read several of McPhee's books and loved them. This one with the accounts of how fish were transplanted and buying shad darts seemed to be a Mulligan's stew of anecdotes about shad - I found myself wondering what the point was.The story of fighting the 4 pound shad for two hours and thinking it was a sturgeon or a muskellunge was laughable. A soft-mouthed shad on for two hours stripping the gears on his reel huh? This wins the most ridiculous fish story of the year. Did he run into bigfoot riding on Nessie that day, as well?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe McPhee is not so good a writer?","review":"Well, I hate to burst your bubble, because I like McPhee, but his latest effort seems to be trying to hit the sweet spot in the American public by using a sixth grade vocabulary. Also, the English language seems to be becoming more and more passive tense oriented and nounish in sentence structure (not unlike this sentence has become). Where is the active voice? That's why I like foreign languages better. You can write a sentence in Latin like: delendam esse Carthaginem (simple and direct).Anyhoo, like people who think high culture is going to Las Vegas, I doubt anybody agrees with what I have to say (there's that passive voice again)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fish Story","review":"I have never fished, never even wetted a hook, but I just finished an entire book about shad fishing! Only John McPhee, finally hitting his stride again after two rather disappointing outings could do it.His secret is telling a story through people, in this case through icthyologists, commercial shad fishermen, shad dart mavens, historians, and his own personal experience.I particularly liked his interlude with the Bay of Fundy brush weir fisherman. As with many McPhee expositions, I felt that by the time I was done reading his chapter, I could have gone to the Bay of Fundy and built a brush weir myself.And I can only hope that someday I will be able to write such direct yet luminous prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated","review":"Found a couple really cute patterns here, but when I tried to make one of them I was totally frustrated. The pattern says to \\"continue in pattern\\" without allowing for any decreases. After 3 days of test swatches, I determined it is nearly impossible to knit the pattern as written in the size I wanted. I ended up substituting a different stitch pattern in order to make it work. Not how a good pattern book should be written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a relatively new knitter, and I bought this book because I had heard good things about this designer. I did think that several items in the book were cute, but for the most part, the designs seemed overly complicated and hard to follow. I would probably not make sweaters as complex as the ones shown for myself, let alone for a small child that would only wear a sweater a handful of times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby knits","review":"This is an early Debbie Bliss pattern book. I didn't like many of the patterns. They are too chunky for my taste. They have a \\"dated\\" look.

I used to do aerobics to it in the basement in the days way back before step was ever invented. I can't describe how this music gets my adrenaline pumping. When I discovered it here on amazon I could swear my heart rate went up. Most of the songs really rock.

Well if you would like to share my experience read this book. When I pick up a biography on Marvin Gaye it should be just that-a biography. What I got from this book was Mr. Dyson's views on the problems in Black America right now. And was there a reason the afterword was mostly about R.Kelly? I know he was supposed to be comparing the struggle of sensuality v. spirituality that both men experienced but come on. R.Kelly doesn't have an ounce of the talent Marvin Gaye had. It's a shame to even make comparisons (at least on a professional/artistic level) of these two men. The book was boring, sloppy and I came away angry. After reading it my thought was 'Mercy Mercy On Me'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than a root canal","review":"I thought the Publishers Weekly review was pretty accurate. This book read like a textbook. Maybe that is because Dyson is a college humanities professor. I could only get half way through before as Popeye said That's all I can stands, I can stands no more. Now I understand why I was able to purchase this book for 84 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"More about Dyson than Marvin","review":"Please do not waste your time on this book. It is more of an outlet for Michael Eric Dyson to express the effect of Marvin's music (as well as other artists) on Dyson. I really don't care about how a song makes Michael Eric Dyson feel. If the author could ever get past his own ego, it would be a lot more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"ffff","review":"this guy thinks he met tupac marvin and others but the guy just needs money and its sad he makes up alot of stories that even tupacs family says are not true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money; buy DIVIDED SOUL instead","review":"I say this because I read DIVIDED SOUL when it came out some 20 years ago, and it seems like Dyson has just read THAT book and has written an essay/review about it and thrown in some unsubstantiated allegations just to make the reading more \\"interesting.\\" In short, any halfway decent college student enrolled in an upper-level writing course could have written this book. Bear in mind that unlike Ritz, Dyson didn't actually KNOW Marvin Gaye. David Ritz actually knew, worked with, and lived with Marvin Gaye, and even though there are things I could nitpick about with DIVIDED SOUL, that book is a FAR SUPERIOR read. It's far more informative and far more insightful than this offering from my favorite pseudo-intellectual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"The reason I didn't care for this book may partially be my fault--I did not realize it was an essay instead of a biography. But the rest of the reason is on this author--this book was pretty much fact-based, reasons for songs were thrown out sporadically, Tammy Terrell's name was all over the place but the beatings were danced around (and one speaker even plugged her own book--why is that even in there?) and the author went on a history lesson through Motown with other artists. The organization was terrible, there was no set subject pattern, and it was a dry read. I ended up just skimming the book after page 20.And as big a fan as I am of R. Kelly, I did NOT want to read about HIM in a book with Marvin Gaye on the cover. It's like the author forgot who he was writing about through half the book; he starts talking about the Supremes, Gordy, R. Kelly, James Brown; stick to the man on the cover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have enjoyed this book more...","review":"...if it's depiction of the people in a small Montana were not all noble, wonderful people (except for the killers of course!), and it's depiction of all the environmentalists were not that they were all stupid, selfish people, who only want to save the wilderness so it would be their \\"playground!\\" The majority of cattle ranching in this country is controlled by huge mega-corporations, and they've been able to graze on Federal land where their cattle strip whole areas clean, and make it harder for the indigenous creatures to survive.

If you're a skeptic, this book will change your mind about St. John's Wort and what BRAND you buy. Covers a staggering number of therapies in great detail: some you probably know like electric shock therapy, Prozac and cognitive therapy. Other lesser known therapies include Omega-3, 5-HTP, SAM-e, and Tyrosine. The author did his homework. Citing numerous clinical trials, studies, and on-line news groups, I found this reading a bit overwhelming or too dry at times, but only because of the author's thorough investigation. All in all, it was well worth it. Makes your doctors sit up and take notes when you talk about how YOU want to treat your depression. (that alone is worth it). An excellent reference that grows with you as your treatment for depression evolves."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent collection of old and newer songs","review":"I own no other Tony Bennett recordings and have not been a big fan (although my mom is!) but I had a hunch I'd like his music.

Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An end to dating a Sociopath...","review":"This book has been essential in my desire to break out of the constant dance I found myself in with a sociopathic person. It establishes criteria for co-dependent behavior through bulleted lists and examples which thereby enable you to objectively realize situations you seem to find yourself in and often wonder why. This book not only identifies the symptoms we all seem to focus too heavily on, but also on the ever more important problem that creates the symptoms. By identifying these problems and understanding why they occur, you are better equipped to begin making substantial changes in your life. This book prevented me from falling back into the same self-defeating patterns and create a new life for myself.

However this book feels like it was written just for me. The examples and explanations of Low Self Esteeme and what it does to you, is so exact, that it makes me disappointed that I havent done something about myself earlier.Carolyns writing feels like a friend trying to help.

Also not happy to see any mention of Genetically Modified Organisms (Peanut, Cottonseed, Palm, Soy, Canola/Rapeseed and Corn oils) - this is a crucial factor in my food choices. If you are cooking with non-organic soy, corn, canola, or cottonseed oil, you are dipping into the highest genetically modified oils in the U.S. I'm trying to find data on peanuts, but again, buy Non-GMO peanuts and peanut oil to be safe.

The authors claimed that one of the reasons that American children are not as successful in school as Asian children is because they are involved in too many extracurricular activities. While I agree that extracurricular activities should not cut into study time, I believe that there should be a balance. There are many American parents who have found this balance and their children are the ones that do well in school.

Get over yourself and your fascistic insistence on perfection, even at the cost of the child turning into a depressed, utterly miserable human being who's too unhappy to form functional relationships. Oh, but yes, I forgot: at least he'll have a diploma from Yale hanging in his closet.Shame on you, people, for trying to shape your kids' lives according to your canon. Parental motivation is, of course, mandatory, but not to the point of a master-slave relationship.

On top of that the author chose to showcase several houses that are starkly contemporary and amazingly ugly in my opinion. In sum: this book has nothing much to offer the prospective home builder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belongs on a coffee table","review":"I bought this book to get insight into the Smart home concept and implementation.This book has very little of hard knowledge, as far as smart homes are concerned.

Examples illustrated in this book are not bad, either. Layouts are there, pictures are there. Descriptions are quite well-written. Still, this book is lacking of that wow factor that manages to captivate our interest, or perhaps, to keep us reading from beginning till end. Perhaps, it is the quality or the presentation of this book. It is printed in Hong Kong and compared with books done by Taschen and Phaidon, this book is definitely of a more inferior quality.

I hooked the camera up and ran it that night. Well needless to say they got me again and the camera missed the whole thing. There was so much interference you couldn't even see the picture through the lines. I called the company TWICE and got the same interference story. I even moved the receiver to several different rooms with different televisions and vcr's, changed the frequency and unplugged everything wireless in the house and still the same picture.

But even in the same room it only had a range of about 16 feet. It's a fine LOOKING system but looks mean nothing when you want security. I'm taking it back today.

First tried these cameras inside the window - daytime was fine, nighttime all you could see was glare in the window from the LEDs. Tried one outside, and it worked fine...for one night. Went to start the VCR it was hooked to the second night and there was no picture from the camera. Replaced it with the second camera, which worked for two nights, then stopped. It was October and low temp might have gotten to 45 degrees, well within the range in the specifications. I tried the receiver at about 40 feet from teh camera, picture was good, just a little interference. When receiver was closer (about 10 feet) picture very good. The other issue was it totatlly blocked my WiFi network, could not connect from my laptop. So, returned the set.Pros: good picture, when camera worksCons: outside doesn't last more than two days, totally blocks WiFi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foal Watch Camera","review":"We bought this camera not as a security feature, but as a \\"foal watch\\" camera to monitor our mares out in the barn about to foal.

Good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This product isn't good at any distance. I had it as close as 2 feet from the receiver, and it still wasn't worth it. Don't try to have it extend out any further than 10' without expecting serious degradation of quality. We got this camera with the intent of watching our 2 year old son at night. He likes to get out of bed and play with things at night, so we needed a way to observe from our room. Our bedroom is about 75' from his room. The frame rate was way too slow and the picture quality left a lot to be desired. I'm not sure of your planned use for the device, but it would be a waste for anything outside of watching a turtle crawl in the brightest room available.

Endless detailed dialog about who's commanding the mission, focus on nipples, cutesy little responses from the main computer - anything but telling a story.Worse yet, then he starts citing all these other contemporary science fiction works, INCLUDING HIS OWN! So much for any chance of immersing oneself in another world - impossible when you are being reminded that you are reading a work of fiction about other works of fiction.I loved Stranger in a Strange Land and Jobe. This one I gave to my parrot - I would not foist this on another reader. I have only done that to one other book in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heinlein's finest (believe it or not)","review":"This is a novel that should be read by those who are familiar with the genre of pulp SF.

This is a work from a man that is ready to return to the craft in full force."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Premise - Brutal Execution","review":"Very Cool Premise Brutally Executed.I'll even give the die-hard Heinleiners the fact that he wrote it as a joke and in doing so tried to see how many of his other works (and those of others) he could include.But Man!!! How much of his hyperbole and preaching can one take? Further, he jumps between fine technical detail and generality often, sometimes within the same sentence. He tries in many places to tell the story through the characters dialog which he recreates in painstaking detail and never gets the point across as a result.The book follows form with his older stuff in that he becomes an ardent free sex advocate, and kind of perverted about it too.Don't get me wrong, I love a lot of his work. But this isn't his best.....it isn't even close. A waste of several hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I'm a Heinlein fan, and this is possibly my favorite of his books, though \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" is excellent and far more recognized. \\"The Number of the Beast\\" is a charming adventure through most of the Heinlein universes. If you've read Heinlein and like him, I highly recommend this one. If you haven't read him, you may want to start with one of his earlier works (perhaps \\"The Man Who Sold the Moon\\"), but this one can stand on its own merits without having been through more of Heinlein's 'Future History.' It's a fun and intelligent read that I return to on a regular basis. Sort of like really good brownies! Warning: Heinlein was a bit of a libertarian, and thus not for all readers. But if you're open-minded, give it a read. I doubt you'll be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time takes its toll on even the greatest.","review":"I was a Heinlein fan all throughout my formative years andinto adulthood. Thought provoking books like \\"Stranger in aStrange Land\\" and rousing good yarns like \\"Glory Road\\"made growing up in the 60's bearable. With such a greattrack record, I eagerly awaited the release of \\"Number ofthe Beast\\" when it was originally published. At first, Iwas enthralled. Up to page 100 or so, the book was riveting,a real page turner reminiscent of \\"Glory Road\\".Unfortunately, the book totally changed at then. It wasalmost like another author had taken over. The book rambledfor the next 600 pages on a totally different track andnever resolved the original plot. I suspected that Heinleinwas feeling the first stages of senility. It was a realdisappointment; particularly given his former greatness.Later works (e.g., Friday) were better, but the greatness ofthe early works never returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't care if Heinlein was teaching us about writing...","review":"Heinlein was not a good prose writer nor was he a good storyteller at this stage of his life. This book is awful, the story is bad, the writing is even worse. It took me 1 read through to get that he's trying to teach the reader how to write well but if you read Heinlein's body of work, with a few notable exceptions where he does write well or tells the story well, most of his works are horrible prose and even worse in the story department. You learn from writing well by reading good prose and good writing not from reading the opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heinlein was in his dotage...","review":"The first sci-fi I ever read was Heinlein's _Have Space Suit Will Travel_, it hooked me as a Heinlein fan for life. When _Number..._ hit the shelves I was delighted--what could be better than another Heinlein? To say I was disappointed would be gross an understatement. The fine sense of alternate reality, the wit and the sarcasm of the Heinlein I loved was all missing from _Number_. What this books seems to show us is an aging writer badly stretching his credibility to write a final cumulative volume wherein all his characters in all his novels get a final chance to meet each other. Sappy, trite and not worth it. The \\"continuity editors\\" were sleeping through this one and it, sadly, must have made it into print on the author's name alone. If you love Heinlein, don't sully your memories of him by reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"love robert heinlein","review":"I enjoyed everything I've read from Robert Heinlein. This book had lots of potential and I liked the concept but hated the voice of the story. It was like he was getting lazy, sounded bombastic and I hated it. I cherish books but this one went into the nasty garbage can at work, only ever threw away one other book and it was worse but it went in the garbage for the same reason, I read for stories not to hear an author try to show off how famous or witty he can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Reader","review":"Marginally better than Friday.

Luckily, there were plenty of other distractions of various types, as if this was the only entertainment things would have been very bad indeed on that holiday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great promise, died on the vine.","review":"I was lost in this book. The characters were in and out of focus. It started out with a feeling that it would be great. But it did not work out that way. Of all of his books, this one was the most confusing in overall direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number of the Beast","review":"Having read many of the reviews of this book, I am baffled at the number of negative ones. If you don't like it, fair enough, but many seem directed at Heinlein himself or seem disappointed that the book wasn't what they had expected.It is long and rambling and there isn't a great deal in the way of plot. However, the book is driven by the charecters and the inclusion of many old favourites was mostwelcome. Having read most of the Heinlein stories referred to, the references made sense but, although I can appreciate that they may leave novice Heinlein readers wondering, so do a number of his books. The only answer is to seek the stories out.I am a great fan of Heinlein's work and I consider this to be one of the best examples of his novel-writing. It requires some patience at times but is well worth it. I only wish he had had time to give us more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I think The Number of the Beast is boring, confusing and the worst novel I have ever read from Heinlein. The characters talk, and talk, and talk, and talk ALL the time and nothing really happens. Also there are a lot of references to other novels from Heinlein so if you haven't read them before you are absolutely lost. Also there are jokes that I thought, have been very funny for Heinlein himself and his friends, but only for them. There is also some like a \\"revolutionary\\" concept of sexual liberty like in Stranger in a Strange Land, but only a shadow of that, something really absurd because it seem to be written on pourpose to be \\"revolutionary\\" and failing in the attempt. I have to make a effort to finish it, and also I got lost at the end. As a final remark also the \\"science\\" on the storty are not speculative (as its supposed to be in sci-fi) but absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened? A master falls on his face.","review":"Disclaimer: I've only been able to make it through about half of this book before giving up is disgust. Twice. It is possible that the last half is worth reading (but I wouldn't bet on it).I have read many Heinlein books and thoroughly enjoyed them all. Except this one. The dialog between the characters is the worst I have ever read in any book. The characters' actions defy belief and the first half of the book seems to ramble to nowhere. I'm not saying I could write a better story, but at least I would have had the sense to stop. I would sell my copy to Half-Price Books, but I can't in good conscience do that to another human being.Please do NOT make this the first Heinlein book you read. He is an amazing author with a great collection of stories, and it would be a shame to have this one book turn you away from his other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure drivel from cover to cover","review":"\\"Number of the Beast\\" makes me wish Amazon had a no-star rating. This book has nothing to recommed it to anyone but the most extreme Heinlein afficianado.For starters, the struggling-to-be-one-dimensional characters not only have little to no appeal, but are dull as well. And of course, all the protagonists must hold seventeen hundred doctorates as well as be in prime physical condition, not to mention that they all have the most sparkling of personalities. I thought for a while that this was a parody, which would be fine except for the fact that it's not funny.We could move onto the plot at this point, but why bother. It's the typical nonsense that Heinlein wandered into during the latter stages of his career.Heinlein can be brilliant, as in \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" but not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers\\", I was expecting to enjoy this book. However, I found it to be a tiring read, with the plot obscured by silly banter among the four main oversexed characters, who play at being heroes and heroines from old SF magazines. They wander through universes wielding sabers and calling Mars \\"Barsoom\\". In between their capers, they decide that Russians are xenophobic with Communism or without, and that a ranger who is unfriendly must be an alien. Reading this book (and being a science fiction fan, mind you), I began to understand why so many people cringe at the very name of science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal book. Don't read it.","review":"In general I'm a Heinlein fan. I had this book floating around in my attic for years. I recall reading it way back in my teenage years and liking it so I thought to give it a try again. What a pointless waste of time. It lost me about a third of the way through. I tried to stay with it for another third and then gave up.Don't read it.You won't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much like the rest of his stuff but a really fun read","review":"This books brings together many characters from many different books and allows them to interact in very interesting ways. Not the best book in the world but definitely one of my favorites, some of my favorite characters of all time reside in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worst book I ever read, Best book I ever read","review":"When I first read this book, I was in junior high. I found the plot changes confusing, the characters stupid and in general, it was boring. It was much the same way with RAH's other books which were written for adults. I put these books aside, grew up a little, experienced life a little and began reading RAH again. I found the novels that he had written for adults to be just that - for adults. They were complex, intriguing, naughty, controversial, funny and endearing. This novel and Time Enough for Love, I feel exemplifies the best adult writing that RAH wrote. To Sail Beyond the Sunset rates a very close second. He is not Shakespeare, nor does he pretend to be. But I find the plot and the down home style of storytelling to be just what I find to be great reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarro Heinlein?","review":"I have a new theory on why this book is so disappointing. What if it wasn't really written by the same R.A. Heinlein who wrote the truly impressive \\"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\\" and so many other classics? I think it was written by an imposter from another dimension.Seriously, this novel exemplifies all the weaknesses that Heinlein's detractors love to point out. Without going into the gory details, I'd just suggest that anyone working his or her way through Heinlein's books leave this one for dead last, or skip it altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from his best","review":"I first read this book when it came out in 1980 (I was a *huge* Heinlein fan at the time), and I remember being vaguely disappointed with it at the time. Now, having read it again 20 years later, I'm no more impressed with it.Part of Heinlein's charm to me has always been his ability to make his characters so likeable, regardless of where his plots took them. He's managed that early on with this book - but he soon gets bogged down with trying (and never really succeeding) to be clever. The convoluted 'storyline' soon takes over, but never goes anywhere satisfactory - or even particularly entertaining. It's just one literary reference/gag after another, none of them particularly clever or satisfying to this reader. Even the Heinlein in-jokes and references don't have the charm to pull this book out of the mire it's stuck in.Not his best, not by a mile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Best, but darn close!!!","review":"Although, not as good as, JOB; A Comedy of Justice or The Cat Who Walks Through Walls, this piece of RAH's work fits into many of the other \\"Lazarus Long\\" stories.

If I wanted to reada soft porn novel, I'd go to a book store on Times Square."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned me off to Heinlein for good","review":"This was the fourth and last Heinlein book I've read. I am now thoroughly sick of Heinlein's self-assured I'm-smarter-than-you-are characters. Having four of these characters banter back and forth about how great they are just got really tiring. The book starts off with a plot which is moderately interesting, and then completely abandons it, just so we can meet more people who Heinlein seems to think know all the answers to life. Given how smart all these good guys are, there's no worthy antagonist, no suspense, and no intrigue.This was the worst of the four Heinlein books that I've read(Job - 4stars; Stranger - 4stars; I Will Fear No Evil - 1 star),and they all suffer similar problems involving pedantic, egotistic characters and interesting stories that fall apart half way through.Thus, I will no longer bother to read Heinlein."},{"rating":"1","title":"this one killed the relationship","review":"I too read everything I could get by hienlien until I started this one. It is the only book I never finished. Hienlein was one of the true greats, but this book left such a bad taste, I'll never read his work again. It is sophmoric. If you like \\"Married With Children,\\" of Jerry Springer, you'll love this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"His Very Best!","review":"This is the book that got me hooked on RAH and is the first book of an excellent three-part series. It starts out as a good story all on it's own, gets better and better and through a very clever plot merges with another of his excellent storylines and other books of his. All my life I wished for a story like this!Number Of The BeastCat Who Walks Through WallsTo Sail Beyond The Sunset"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun peice of RAH fluff","review":"IF you only love his earlier, hardcore, sci-fi, you will , as so many others have absolutly HATE this book.But if your looking for a light, easy reading, fun book, with references to most of the greats of sci-fi and children's literature you'll enjoy this book. Have you read Asimov, Baum, Swift, Burroughs? Have you read Time Enough for Love, Moon is a Harsh Mistress, The Cat Who Wlaks through Walls? If yes, than give this book a try. If not, don't bother, you'll probably hate it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Heinlein","review":"Warning! Number of the Beast cannot be fully appreciated until one has read much of Heinlein's prior works. It takes a rare skill to bring together many previous story lines into one comprehensive finale, but Heinlein does so with style and exceptional competence. As an added bonus, he mentions people I actually know and brings the experience home in an amazing way. Although I learned a lot from Stranger in a Strange Land, Number of the Beast has become my all-time favorite Heinlein work."},{"rating":"1","title":"the first book for 2 years I really hated","review":"Usually, I try to finish a book. But this time, I could not. At the moment I wanted to kill the 4 main characters because they had been talking for approximately 6 pages, I put it away (I did not throw it away because it was from the libray). I just could not stand it anymore. As some of the reviews tell me, there seems to be story somewhere behind page 150. But I can not believe that anything interesting happens in that book. Perhaps that is not true; I will never know, because I will never even try to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start/Appalling ending","review":"This novel starts off with an exciting and thought provoking beginning, unfortunately Heinlein seems to get bored with it halfway to 2/3rds of the way through. He basically tosses off his main characters and their story and takes up with an entirely different (and far less interesting) story as a continuation of a previous series. The antagonist who provided the drive for the first half is also reduced to complete insignifigance. This sort of storytelling is not only bad, it is inexcusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Once I started reading Heinlein, I read everything I could find. Until I got to \\"Number of the Beast\\". Then I stopped, couldn't finish the book. It seems an attempt to fill pages by using familiar characters from past works, with lots of useless dialog. It started well enough but went nowhere fast. In truth I feel Heinlein's best work is found in the many short stories he wrote and are compiled in \\"The Past Through Tomorrow\\". I'll re-read those stories instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I read this book when it first came out. It is certainly the worst, by far, that Papa Heinlein ever produced. Very disappointing. Should have never made it to print. Maybe Spider could have fixed it, but he wasn't given the chance, as far as I know. I tried to return the book to the store (long before Amazon even existed) for a refund, but they wouldn't take it back. I've had an aversion to throwing away any book since I read 451F in 4th grade, but I made and exception for this one. If you like Heinlein, don't buy this book. If you don't like Heinlein, I have no advice for you whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite Heinlein","review":"I dont have anything bad to say about Heilein - out of respect.He made a living writing, I just read whatever there is by him.This just wasnt much to my liking.I have read the re-interpretations trying to say this was meant to mean certain things.I dont really buy it, so let's just say, if you aren't compelled to read EVERYTHING Heinlein, you can probly give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even the Sexy Parts Can Save This Book","review":"Plot, characterization, style, art, skill -- this book lacks it all! The characters are undifferientiated, and Heinlein's refusal to directly identify which character is speaking doesn't help. Then again, it doesn't matter, because aside from secondary sex characteristics, there is very little to distinguish them. Thank God all four characters aren't the same sex, or I would never be able to tell them apart. (Heinlein must have known this, because each chapter is named after the character who narrates it, and the chapter headings are printed at the top of every right hand page, for reference. Thanks for the hint, guy!)The pseudo-technical detail is maddening to wade through, what little plot the book has is dragged down by the constant annoying arguments and more annoying endearments the characters bandy about, and not even the sexy parts held my attention for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Heinlein book I CAN'T finish","review":"I've read everything else by RAH and enjoyed it. But this book has kept me from finishing it 3 times now. I get just over half-way through and get sick of the characters' constant bitching at eachother. I find myself becoming bitchy like them! The plot has no consistency at all, except for the same characters keep dropping in. It's like the episodes of The Pretender, where he's a different character every week. In Number, there's never any closure, at least as far as I ever made it.I didn't mind the free-love concepts (at all) or even the scientific parts, though they were a stretch. I just lost interest in what would happen next to our 4 characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"I read this for the first time about 30 years ago. At that time it was one of the most thought provoking sci-fi stories I had read. The Number of the Beast challenges a readers pre-conceptions of the world. I find it funny that \\"libertarians\\" call this novel right-wing while \\"right-wing\\" readers call it libertarian. Actually, it is solipsistic. Furthermore, a true solipsist can be liberal, conservative, or otherwise, and perhaps all three at the same time. Now, that is something to chew on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heinlein's Waterloo","review":"I've read a lot of Heinlein and have really enjoyed most of it. That said, I think this may be the worst dreck I've ever read. Several failed attempts to slog through it should have taught me a lesson but I kept thinking that it would get better toward the end. Oh how wrong I was! The last 25-35% of the book is the worst; confusing, meandering, plotless and pointless. Once I had finished I didn't even enjoy the feeling of relief and satisfaction that I usually get from finishing a particularlly challenging book. I was just angry that I had wasted the time and effort when there is so much quality reading material around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cure for insomnia - buy it and never lie awake again!!!","review":"Snore, snore, snore... infinity squared snore making. I am a Heinlein Fan, have read loads of his books and found some of them tough going but usually found nuggets of fun and enough to keep me interested in all of them. Until now.There is one good bit when someone defines Phd as 'Piled Higher and deeper' apart from that Snore.....I have got over 10 good nights sleep so far from trying to read this in bed and never managing to stay awake for more than ten pages at a time. This is the first book I have failed to finish.I will read and re-read this one - and save a fortune on sleeping tablets."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was one book I couldn't finish.","review":"I plodded through this story for 500 pages until I was finally repulsed by the constant attempts by Heinlein to push the envelope and be as outrageous as possible. What finally got me was the incest. I really enjoyed some of his earlier works like Starship Troopers and The Sixth Column, and I wanted to collect and eventually read all of his titles. This one was starting to get a little confusing for me but I put up with it until RAH started going off the deep end with the breaking of taboos. Maybe it was over my head since I'm a new reader of Sci Fi, but I just reached a point where I wasn't interested in the story anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Rules Without Exceptions","review":"If I didn't KNOW that Heinlein is a fantastic author, I would never believe it after reading Number Of The Beast. This book is exceptional - in it's boredom. After the first few pages which are at least exciting, although they don't make a whole lot of sense, the novel dissolves into pure boredom. A maddeningly slow storyline revolves mostly around the fact that people should spend their lives naked, no matter how old they are. The worst book I have read in a long, long time. If you want to read Heinlein, read some of his other (and excellent!) stuff such as Glory Road, Starship Troopers, or Stranger In A Strange Land."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read","review":"I have read and enjoyed a number of other Heinlen books. However, there was something about this book that struck me wrong. The charachters are poorly drawn; all are classic ubermensh. The plot drags on and goes nowhere. The whole story seems to revolve around the charachters value system and their constant bickering over their minute differences with one another. Much of it comes across as Heinlen preaching once again about the benefits of nudism and open relationships. If you are looking for a not too subtle conflict of the sexes veiled in flowerchild philosophy, this may be the book for you. However, if your looking for more thought provoking entertainment that actually has a plot, look elsewhere. I could barely get through this book. I was extremely disapointed with an otherwise noteworthy author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witty repartee and revolving narrators kill.","review":"Ohh man. I wasn't too hot on some other Heinlein stuff I've read (Farnham's Freehold), but that didn't make me want to get up and throw the book away. I wish I would have thrown this away.The switching back and forth of the narrating character drove me absolutly insane, it was hard to keep straight who had said something, or who was speaking at any given time. Combined with the fact that the \\"Captain\\" switched 4 times in the book, it leaves ones recollection of the story splayed out like spaghetti.I've come to expect a good bit of witty repartee in Heinleins novels, but he went waaay overboad with it this time. A person can only take so much of it. The choppiness of these (they didn't even flow well) added even more to the difficulties one has in following the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worthy of the author; a slapdash piece of junk","review":"Ow!

The Lesbian relationship between the mother J-wild, lost, beautiful - and competent Aunt V, a business woman, reveals itself to the reader as \\"the talking room\\" becomes the sounding board for endless fights, endless reconciliations. V's desperate search for the beloved J through the nights of waterfront bars is lightened by wildly comic excursions reminiscent of our great American humorists. With wit, poetic clarity and compassion, Marianne Hauser explores the paradoxes of our age - the need for love yet flight from love, search for self yet self-destruction - a dilemma shared alike by today's heterosexual and homosexual world. The author's multifaceted view defies dogma or simplification as her characters draw us into their turbulent and deeply human drama. - from book's back cover"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely terrific for kids!","review":"This inexpensive little volume is by far the best book you can give your kids to occupy their minds with while traveling, or just trying to get them to be totally preoccupied by themselves.

They will encounter images that flip-flop, topsy-turvy figures, geometrical illusions, impossible figures, and motion illusions.This is terrific value for the money. It is best for the ages of 6 to 12."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I have read the other reviews and I think you should know, even though we all in theory have the same phone, they arent.

The radio gets goods reception, although i wish i didnt have to plug in the headset to use it. The back comes off easyily (not randomly but is easy to access the battery).

The phone is small and good looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mac users","review":"This phone's bluetooth will work with Tiger's iSync 2.3 and Address Book with the addition of a \\"feisar\\" plug in via the net for about $3. The 300i is not on the compatibility list at apple dot com as of my purchase time of Dec 06. -- In general I agree with some of the other reviews: The interface is not as simple to use as Nokia's, the oddly overlapping buttons are small, the battery time is pretty good (4 x 24 hours with 2 hours of talk time and it's at 40%), it has a nice form factor, good reception, good audibility, and no major problems with Cingular calls in Philly for me.

There's actually a list of the contents on one end of the box. I also purchased a w810i, and while the phones are similar in function, it also came with a 128MB Memory Stick Duo, USB cable, and software. So the w810i turned out to be a better deal if you like the candy bar form versus the clamshell.Also, the AC adapter included is the standard model. There is another model of AC adapter that allows you to charge the phone and plug in the headphones or other accessories. Or you would have to buy the docking station or a charging station. So either you end up with a stack of connectors or a jumble of cables. The new connector seems to be a bit more robust than the previous design on my old T637, but less practical in real use.Otherwise it is a terrific little phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very robust","review":"I bought 2 of these, one for each child. within a year neither were functional one dead, one the callee can not hear the caller.

I really don't want to carry anything else with me.My brief 1.5 months of owning this phone came to an abrupt end when I accidentally went swimming with it in my pocket. I probably spent a minute or less in the water, but it killed the phone.I've had several other friends wash their phones in their pants and it seems like 50% of them survive. And you'd think this wouldn't have been as bad spending 30 minutes churning around in a washing machine. But a quick dip in a river ruined it.Sony should make a Sports version."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT HAPPY WITH AMAZON","review":"Just like another review, I to am fighting with amazon to receive the things that were supposed to be included with my phone purchase. (USB cord & memory stick) They said they are not responsible for things the manufacturer did not include and gave me a 15 dollar credit which by the way does not cover the cost of the items that need to be replaced unless you order them through amazon, which I will never do again. Quite the little racket if you ask me.

There's no shortage of Beethoven 4's that are the soul of poetry (Kempff, Arrau, Rubinstein); or that muscle up and leave you breathless by the end (Ashkenazy/Solti). This one does both. It is utterly unrushed in I, with plenty of opportunities taken to smell the roses. But the power of it all never lets up, and by the time it's over, you've been taken to a deeply spiritual, emotionally affirming place. Likewise, there are many powerful \\"Emperors\\" out there (Serkin/Bernstein; Kovacevich/Davis; Fleisher/Szell); but none as heartbreakingly lyrical in II or as imperiously powerful (at a slower, more emphatic gait than usual) in III.

I purchased it for my 6 year old so she can practice math through productive play but for what I spent ($33) I was better off purchasing her fake money from the 99cent store and a large calculator, I would've save a good amount of bucks and it wouldve been the same effect. The dollar bills and coins do not look realistic as advertised and it is not solar powered it uses a cell battery. So much for reading reviews! If it didnt cost dam near as much as I paid for it to send it back I wouldve sent it back as soon as I opened it and tried it out. It didnt captivate her amusement but for 30min. There are better options out there. DON'T BUY THIS TOY FOR MORE THAN $10 As for durability it is sturdy. The plastic is very thick."},{"rating":"2","title":"hits money learning right on the head","review":"I bought this for my daughter five years ago when she turned 4... it is still a household favorite. The design is good and it has held up well despite its being knocked around a fair amount.The display is large and easy to read. The play money, which was one of my primary concerns, is realistically sized and marked. There is plenty of it to play with and make change too. The credit card is a nice touch which slides into a slot with a beep.The sticky note space isn't as useful or cool as I thought it could have been, but I think sticky notes tend to just get ripped off of the pad and spread across the room by most children.Now that my daughter is older, she still plays with it as well as putting it to use while running her punch & shaved ice stand in the summer.

It gives a nice history of tea and discusses health benefits and what to stay away from such as decaffeinated tea because of the chemicals used.

It replaced one that broke.","review":"Given this was a $10 carafe for a $24.95 coffee maker, I was a little hesitant not to just buy a whole new coffee maker that came with a carafe. But I liked my Mr. Coffee coffee maker in its simplicity and uncomplicated design. I also hate waste, and if the coffee maker still works (how many parts can fail on a coffee maker, really?) I just waited until I got free shipping and bought this carafe.The only worry I have is that when it cools down, I hear creaking noises. The carafe that replaced this did not have that. I think it's the shrinking of the metal band around the bottom, but there's this fear the glass will just shatter in my hand one day and then scalding hot coffee everywhere. My last carafe didn't do this, someone left it in the sink, and dropped a cast iron skillet on it. That carafe lasted 5 years, though. I hope this lasts as long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drippy needs redesign","review":"I have one of the many Mr. Coffee coffee makers that use the same carafe.

It is definitely ment for those who share this point of view. Carring the same beliefs, I could totally relate and understood where she was coming from. She was able to express the feelings of doubt, interest, and desire that is felt by many maturing women, who are unsure of what choices they would like to make. I recommend this book to anyone who feels like they are out of the loop because they aren't having sex. It is okay to be a virgin and to be proud of it and Tara McCarthy makes you realize it with her blunt and outspoken look at dating in our world and not that of our parents. Being 18 and still a virgin, which believe it or not is a rarity, i fell reafirmed in my belief that sex can wait and that it is not necessary \\"to do it\\" in order to have a real relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book goes on and on","review":"Tara McCarthy's memoir was refreshing to find on the shelves and even entertaining to read...in the beginning. The first couple of chapters are interesting and somewhat funny. However, as the book continued, I quickly grew tired of hearing about exploit after exploit. If you are looking to use McCarthy as a role model for your children, I would should suggest otherwise. McCarthy has documented a fairly promiscious life, despite not actually having intercourse along the way. I think it is fantastic that she has decided to wait until she is love, but it is exhausting reading about the thirteen or so times she thought she might have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, weak development.","review":"Although I felt I had much in common with the author, I could not identify with her. This book is like a long rambling letter from someone you went to school with but didn't really care about. I think she displays great courage in bringing up the issue of virginity in our sex-saturated society. She also brings up the virgin/whore sexual dichotomy felt by many women. She just doesn't address these issues with any kind of depth. It seems that she doesn't address the relationships in her life with any kind of depth either. She's indignant at men who want to have sex with her without examining her own actions and motivations which led her to be physical with them in the first place. Overall this brings up some excellent issues and ideas that should be expored, unfortunately she addresses them in a shallow and at times immature way. Perhaps if she rewrites this book when she is older and has more perspective it will be worth reading... this book however just isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have read more profound and witty graffiti","review":"Who knew that a book on something so potentially thought-provoking, even inspiring, could be shallow?

How can a virgin have a sex life? Well, you'd be surprised at what this girl does.Basically, this book talks about dating between men and women. One aspect of dating is sex. Tara talks about how she views sex, how men hav viewed her for sex, and how she remained a virgin. This books puts the idea that virgins aren't as fun to date to rest.One moment in the book that I thought was interesting is when she gets rejected for sex when she was ready to do it. After years of holding out for the \\"perfect one\\" she is the one being shoved to the side so the other can go to sleep. Her thoughts on that situation are very interesting, but I won't give it all away here.I thought about getting this book for a friend of mine. He is 24 and still a virgin, but not by choice, as was Tara. This book is a quick read and fun.

The beginning is a bit rough, as is to be expected with a first novel, but Julie Wray Herman finds her stride well before the middle of the book. The characters are endearing.

Chomsky is really more biting at these teach ins: You almost wish all of his books had this concept.There is also his use of four letter words, which you seldom see from him. He interacts with other people, and that seems to get interesting answers that Chomsky usually keeps to himself.Need I say it: Chomsky's first, \\"entertaining\\" book.

The only way to find out will be to have them reviewed by another Landscape Architect or Engineer.The text functions well as a reference for Landscape Architects to review formulas or storm water calculation techniques but if you are trying to use it for developing skills or for exam preperation I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal instructions... 2 Stars for Nice Cover/","review":"Abysmal instructions...This book seems to assume the reader is already a trained landscape architects reviewing for the LARE exam.This textbook manages to take rather simple theories and turn them into Quantum physics by the virtue of jargon, verbose explanations, dismal graphics, - and get this: They are No answers to the exercises in this book.The authors are undoubtedly very knowledgeable regarding Site engineering, but either clueless or indifferent to techniques of effective instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre strip quality, way overpriced","review":"For the price, this stripper should work much better. It doesn't cut the braid cleanly, leaving ragged patches sticking out. Yes, I have it adjusted properly.You can't spin it with your index finger, as the instructions say, or it will wobble out of alignment. Also, it is difficult to adjust. I estimate it required about 20 test strips before it was tweaked in. Repeatability is only fair.I also use a Canare TS-31C stripper, which costs about half what this one does, and is FAR superior. In fact, the cheaper Canare strippers are so much better than this, I have to categorize this as a ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't help you repair your engine","review":"Peter Hunn really missed the mark on this book. This is not a instruction handbook. First, this book was released in 2005, but the newest engine reviewed is a 1990's lawnmower engine. It is a series of case studies of very old products. Secondly, it has only about 30 pages related to engine troubleshooting. If you want a process/methodology to repair or rebuild engines or engine parts (carburetors), look else where. Finally, Peter is certainly knowledgeable but really needs more writing help in structuring his knowledge so its' useful to the average person looking for engine repair help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Textbook.","review":"I brought this one, thinking it was the textbook without a hardcover.

The writer's explanations are not in plain english: they are short, brief, and confusing. I would definitely not recommend this book to any one who has never taken any physics courses prior to this course. I researched good college physics text books and found a very very good book from D. Giancoli - 5th ed. Great so far. He explains everything thoroughly so that the reader can understand what they are doing. The worst part is that I payed so much more for college physics wilson, buffa, and lou and the book is not worth a dime. I spent a lot less on Giancoli.

Plus it's not even worth that much money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start for studying physics","review":"For someone looking to get an overview of basic physics, this book is great. The problems in the back of each chapter start out easy then become more and more challenging. In several chapters there are photos of some physics instructors doing experiments we all want to do; one of the best is an experiment where someone is sitting in a chair holding a very large CO2 fire extinguisher and... rockets off! It does a very good job of explaining Newton's laws. (every action has an equal and opposite reaction) If you purchase this text, make sure to get the associated study guide. It not only provides a review of each chapter, it goes through step by step problem solving on slected odd numbered problems. The only caveat is that some of the wording is vague; there was an attempt to explain physics without calculus. As a result, some subjects must be taken on faith. If life sciences is your major then this text does a great job of explaining physics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Easy to Understand","review":"One of this book's authors is a professor at my university. While he himself did not teach my physics class, he definitely conveyed our school's philosophy of \\"learn by doing\\" through the use of numerous pictures, diagrams, and straightforward exercises at the end of each chapter. I thought the book explains the general ideas and concepts of physics very well, without requiring a calculus background to understand the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book at all.","review":"I'm an engineer who has taken many physics classes and taught physics once at a community college. Now one of my children is using this in school for learning AP physics B. I can honestly say if this had been my first exposure to physics, I'd be in a different profession.I find some of the choices to emphasize certain things quite strange. For example, the book spends an inordinately long time on the difference between speed and velocity and then the author uses them wrong in a problem at the end of the chapter. But then elastic collisions don't get nearly the space I'd give (or other books give) them.Also, this book's explanation of torque is one of the worst explanation of a technical concept I've ever seen. I've only read through to chapter 7 so I'm sure there is a lot more to complain about.I dug up one of my 25 year old textbooks and my daughter uses that instead to learn from and gets everything much more easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with the regular edition","review":"If you want a competitive advantage in this class, buy the ANNOTATED INSTRUCTORS EDITION.

Recommended!!!","review":"An oboist in the New York Philharmonic once addressed the austere German conductor as \\"Mistah Klemps\\", and for me, this has always stuck. Despite his formidable demeanor, Klemperer was a wit with a secret cache of good humor, which he unfolds from time to time in these outstanding readings.The Symphonies are in pure, authentic mono mid-fifties sound. The E-Flat is the gem of the disk: one of my all-time favorite interpretations, having a rigorous sense of proportion and detail, and a grandeur not often encountered. Yet there are loving touches, such as the swaggering minuet with a very relaxed, central European trio. Marvelous!The Serenata Notturno is in real stereo, a bit \\"ripe\\", dating from c. 1956: the reading is exceptionally cheerful and relaxed, much slower than the run-throughs we often get nowdays from chamber orchestras like Orpheus.Highly recommended to true Mozartians!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best on options","review":"I have been frustrated with the books I have been looking at that I have purchased on Amazon but this video and some others have shed new light on the subject and now I am making wiser trades with a higher chance of success than before watching this.

The whole class got one. I decided to get one for each of my kids since we like to hike. It wasn't as easy to use as I remember (so my elementary-school age kids had some trouble using it), but it's still pretty neat how the book will ask you a series of \\"does it look like this or like this\\" type of questions to help you narrow down to the tree you're trying to identify."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy reference","review":"This book provides good coverage of most trees of the northeast.

My 6th grade classes and high school classes were able to use it independently. Its' simple, straightforward approach is a fantastic introduction to using a key. The diagrams are a big help for the student unfamiliar with the vocabulary. The only weakness is that it doesn't cover some cultivated varieties, ie. thornless, so some coaching is necessary when using in a typical park or residential setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little book but limited","review":"As with any book set up as a botanical key, there is a limited range of trees that can be identified using this tree finder. It covers the Northeast pretty well for major forest trees. The key setup works pretty well, but sometimes the descriptions about toothing on the leaves can get a bit difficult to use.It's a great start at identification. The pictures are excellent, so you know if you are wrong or right when you get to your final determination.

The guage of the \\"brass\\" is about the same thickness as the metal on a pencil eraser (okay, maybe not that thin, but you get my point). When I attached it to my new 250 ft Gilmour 8 guage hose, water squirted everywhere. I tried to reattach it with pliers again but the water kept spurting out, but not quite as heavily. I came back an hour later only to find that the fitting completely fell off the end of the hose and my yard was saturated. I then went to Ace Hardware and got a good fitting made of a heavier guage metal that fits on the hose much more securely. It works like a charm. Avoid Gilmour hose fittings at all cost- they need to stick with water hoses rather than fittings."},{"rating":"1","title":"What sucker bait","review":"I almost ordered 20 of these hose fittings at $1.77 each, a total of $35.40 which is a very good price. Just before I hit the \\"buy it\\" button I noticed that shipping and handling was over $17. We're talking hose fittings here; little things that go on the end of garden hoses.

So if the price is too good to be true, be real careful before you actually buy it because that's where they get you.P.S. the price actually started out at $1.93 when I looked at it the first time this evening.

Secondly, the portrayal of sexual orientation. It isn't mentioned, it just is. And because it just is, everyone around the main characters also just accept that reality. That sort of mind set is something I feel should be in all walks of life. People are either gay or straight or bisexual, and that's it.

She also has the ability to touch someone and have them fall under her spell. She is a good guy though, so uses her powers for good. There is a power struggle between the good fae and the bad, so the underlying theme is good against evil. Both sides want her to choose which side she is on, which she refuses to do. Her trusty side kick is well cast and sometimes steals the show. Her on again, off again love interest is intriguing. I liked this show, although they tend to focus too much on same sex relationships and sex in general. Some nudity and bad language, plus lots of bloody scenes. So this is not recommended for children. Check it out. You may enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Girl","review":"I usually don't write reviews. That one being said, this one will be short.

It sounds easy enough when you first read it-draw a card each time you land on a picture space; if the card you draw matches or rhymes with the picture space you've landed on, you keep the card. The problem is that there is only one picture card for each picture space on the gameboard. Most of the game is spent landing on the picture space for which the picture card is at the bottom of the draw pile (since it was just drawn in the last turn).

She had no problems figuring out how to use the camera. The printer dock is fairly easy to set up and the pictures turn out as good as or better than the local one hour photo places. She has enjoyed taking photos and using the movie mode, too. Even though it's more expensive than a film camera, you save by not having to print all the bad shots. I highly recommend it. I would give 5 stars, but I haven't used the camera/printer myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I agree with Shelly. This camera takes great pictures BUT worked properly for about a month. I sent it back to kodak and they repaired some things and it's malfunctioning again! It is no longer under warranty so I might as well by a new one. It goes off and on by itself, the lens pops out, then back in, its ridiculous. They said for me to use lithium batteries, so that I did, and they do last forever it seems (much longer than rechargable) but its still acting up. I thought I would've gotten a much better camera from kodak. Going to try a different brand next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy share","review":"I am not impressed with Kodak Printer Dock.

This book is especially good at off beat conversations between the two and mis-matched meanings. All the actions taken by the two main characters deepen their impression on the reader and give a better picture of where they both come from. No matter where you are when you pick up Deathday Party, you will be transplanted to an \\"Addams Family\\" surrounding and will enjoy the sorta-spooky stuff deftly woven in with the sharper elements of the story line. While that is going on, Paula gives us just a hint of what is to become of the relationship between Jane and the Sheriff. No matter if you are waiting for a city bus, for the opera to begin, or the dentist to start your root canal, this book will lift your spirits and transport you to a Southern small town where you can be part of the action as the characters entertain you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's going on here??","review":"Haunted house. Misty cemetery. Washed out bridge. Thunder and lightning. Dumb dialogue. A cast of characters you can't keep up with. I was really disappointed with this book, which seemed like it would never end. It had a lackluster, contrived, meandering plot, with confusing portrayals of character relationships and motivation. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous","review":"I almost never write reviews, but after reading this book I had to make a comment or two. The characters are ridiculous with no explanation really for their bizarre behavior. A California woman surrounded by Southern Stereotypes. Of course her exhusband is named Jim Ed, because Southern men have two names, and of course he's married to a former Miss Alabama who's incredibly shallow. The plot is silly. The one thing I'd really like to say is that if you are going to write a book that takes place in Talladega County learn to spell it. The first time an L was left out I thought it was an editing error, by the second time I realized she apparently has no familiarity with the area at all, picked the name at random, and probably wrongly assumed that no one in the county could read and therefor wouldn't read her book and catch this mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably need to read the others first","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. It was more like a gothic than a standard mystery. I found Hillary -- who, I assume, is supposed to be a sort of send-up of Martha Stewart -- bizarre with her decorating tips at the oddest moments. She wasn't the least bit realistic. And, as a native Southerner, I was expecting more development of that angle, which didn't happen (at least, not in any good way). But I think my unhappiness may be because I missed the character development earlier in the series. I imagine I should have started with the first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally unrealistic","review":"I absolutely love time travel romance novels. But this one is beyond me. The way the people speak, especially Bella - who's from the present, is way too proper and totally unrealistic. It actually ruined the book for me. I had to force myself to continue reading, hoping that something interesting would happen, but I was sadly disappointed. I would not recommend this book to anyone, especially as an introduction to what time-travel romance novels are usually like. I am actually afraid to waste my money on anything else by Eugenia Riley. For a terrific read, I strongly recommend Lyverle Spencer (for historical romances) and Constance O'Day Flannery (for time-travel romances). Maybe I'll have better luck next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"typical, but good","review":"I read this book a few years ago when I was in college; as a voice major I may have found it more interesting than someone who is not an opera enthusiast. The story is a bit see-through and the love scenes are very typical, but it's a great story to cozy up with on a rainy day when you have nothing to do.

So, if you are into deeper thinking, this would be a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Well, I don't think I need to review the ideas of Plato. Besides, to do that would take far more space than I have, and far more time than I'm alotting to this review.Ultimately, what makes this book so good is that its a cheap yet extremely intelligent and scholarly intro to Plato. The 5 dialogues within are incredibly thought-provoking, and are an excellent demonstration of philosophical thought and logical argument. My only problem is that sometimes its hard to understand the prose, but that may be a result of translation from the Greek. I don't know, but this is a small complaint...if one sits and really gives a confusing sentence a close, close reading, one can usually figure out what's being said.5 Stars, for the philosophical ideas within, presented (mostly) in a clear way (via translation), the packaging of these 5 critical dialogues together neatly and cheaply, and a brief yet informative intro and good footnotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"we've had this game since my son was 18 months - and we're still playing with it at almost 3. it's basically a memory game, but you can play it competitively, or not, with colors, or with black and white. if you love the book, this is a nice addition. the only problem is the cards - with a toddler, it's kind of hard to keep them on the table together, much less in the right \\"spots\\". but if your kid is kind of orderly, this is a great game to play with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun for younger children","review":"My two-year old girl loves this game.

There are 1 or 2 versions that she has tried, but is not successful with yet (they are rated for 4 or 5+ yo). It is great because it grows with your child's memory development. You can progress ahead to the next level whenever your child is ready-but, the first few versions they suggest are excellent for 2 yo kids.

I liked the extraordionary language he has used and the way he makes it so very interestion for the reader. This book is like a magnet. You have to keep reading it, because every chapter is written in such a way, that it is linked to the next.The book describes a perfect plan of a murder, with suprises right till the last word. And just when you think that, that person is the murder 'BAM', this person gets killed!If i had to compare this story to any of his other books, i would say that this one does not only stand out for it's 'roller-blading kill scnene', but is also one book which you can read all over again, and not get bored!I recoment this book to all the people who love a good horror story and a sleep-less nights of thinking about this ficton-story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS IVE EVER READ OF HIM","review":"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK .FROM THE ONES THAT I HAVE READ I STILL THINK THIS IS THE BEST.

Unlike, say, PALLAS, which held my interest from beginning to end, THE MITZVAH just didn't work for me. I kept putting it down and finding it hard to get motivated to resume reading. This may be a function of the fact that the book is a collaboration, and collaborations usually don't work well. Or it may just be that this one is more overtly propagandistic than Neils's earlier novels. Whatever the reason, I can't really recommend this book to anyone. There are better books on the importance of our right to self-defense using firearms, and better novels by Neil Smith. Pass on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Message got put before the story","review":"There's nothing necessarily wrong with a novel having a message. Some of the classics (1984, Animal Farm) and most (all?) of Smith's do. But this one put the message ahead of the storyline.

And in doing so, destroyed any validity to their arguments. The chapter containing the discussion between the Chapmans was so contrived, it read more like a teacher talking to a class room of students. A real John Greenwood would not have been 'turned' so easily, he would have experienced more anguish than we were shown. In an attempt to copy the style of Robert Heinlein's juvenile novels, the authors just trashed one of the very best science-fiction writers. Zelman & Smith wrote a book on a teenager's level so their readers would understand their intend. This was the level to which they had to appeal. This was a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cliff notes for Ross' 'Unintended Consequences'","review":"I eagerly awaited the day this novel was published and it didn't disappoint. It is an intellectually fast-moving story that caused me to mentally compile a checklist of stuff of which to further read and study. One example, the mention and subsequent discussion of the novel 'Death Wish.' The story is developed fluidly and the authors intersperse juicy tidbits about little known eyebrow-raising facts. I gave it 4.5 stars out of 5 'cause it was too short! However, when you give some folks 800 to 1000 page tomes (such as John Ross' 'Unintended Consequences' or Ayn Rand's 'Atlas Shrugged') to better explain and communicate your views they sometimes let them lie around the house like Hawking's 'A Brief History of Time' without reading them. 'The Mitzvah' is an excellent primer for folks looking for a concise and stimulating story involving religion, ethics, the philosophy of self-defense and courage in the face of a seeming monolithic enemy, the state."},{"rating":"2","title":"On my \\"ten best\\" list of books.","review":"Like John Ross' Unintended Consequences, this book is a must-read for those citizens who have paid more attention to the sales catalogs and ball games than they have to political history. Failure to read, think, understand, and learn from history kills more innocent people than criminals ever could, and both these works just might open some eyes and save some lives.

I suppose it gets the job done but it always seems like the battery is about to die, even with a brand new one in it. It tends to pull hairs out somewhat too rather than just cut them like it ought to. The light is a joke, since it's aimed directly down the barrel (though to be fair, all trimmers seem to do this - don't ask me why they don't aim off to the side so you can see what you're doing while using it). Anyway something that should be a no brainer product is just poorly executed. Find better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price says it all","review":"The trimmer does not cut most hair without a significant amount of gyrations of angles for it to get the hair in the openings.

I'll stick to scissors for now until I find a trimmer that works properly.I had this product for about eight months before it died on me. When it was working it was quite painful to use, often pulling and tearing away the nose hairs. The light was absolutely pointless.

I think it would probably cost me more to mail it back to Panasonic than to go with a different maker.Not too happy with this one - I'd advise looking somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works if it works","review":"I agree that the light feature is totally useless and is probably Panasonic's method of differentiating a more expensive model. On the positive side it did a good job of nose and ear trimming. On the negative side, it stopped working after about 8 months. I owned a Panasonic previously and it too died after about a year. No more Panasonics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Trimmer","review":"After 6 months, the trimmer became dull and had a loud, grinding noise when used.I was given this trimmer as a present. The first few months, it was a great trimmer. After the first, three months, there was a high grinding noise that sounded like the blade was rubbing against the inner cap. After taking apart the inner cap, and cleaning the blade numerous times, the machine was still in the same condition. I ordered new blades and after a couple of weeks , the same noise came back.It was obvious, it was time to replace the trimmer.In addtion, I personally never use the attached light accessory, I think it's a wasted feature.In conclusion, out of my experience, I would keep away from this model and look into other trimmers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!

The Blade is What Led Me to Have to Buy Another Trimmer, Because it Became Slightly Out of Aligned with the Outside of the Trimer and Would Not Allow the Motor to Turn It.

The light was worthless, as it wasn't positioned appropriately on the trimmer to be of any use3. It didn't cut hairs all that well and often pulled hairs instead4. At times, it was hard to take off the cover/tip of the razor to clean it out or adjust the flimsy parts inside to get it to work again.5.

Just like any other shaver/trimmer, it CAN cut your skin (I've only had a small nick once, however). Also, it sometimes rips out hairs rather than cutting them, interrupting the twenty seconds of use with stings of pain now and then. Also, this can cause a pimple/whitehead/pus to emerge, although it's only occoured once to me during use. Dried nasal mucus (i.e., boogers) seem to increase with the use of this product; perhaps it's simply more noticible with shorter hairs, though.

The only downside is that I expected the trimmer to catch the hair after trimming, it may have gotten a few hairs, but upon blowing my nose I discovered a good amount of hair had been left in my nose from the trimmer, not a big deal, but this does go against Panasonics claims.

Here goes: You twist the very bottom 1/2\\" of the device and bingo it opens up to a single AA battery. The light is critical - it shows you where to cut; however, you don't use it _while_ you cut. Still, by knowing exactly where the hairs are, you target them one by one instead of reaming out your entire nose. When you drag the device, you pull hairs instead of cutting them. However, the recent price is too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic ER421 Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer","review":"I'm delighted with the Panasonic ER421.

Instead, I used to trim my nose and ear hair with a small scissors. But a small misstep left me wearing a band-aid in a somewhat embarrassing place. So I ordered this little puppy and it does a great job. I feel a little silly sticking it up in my nostrils, especially if my wife is around. She has a tendency to make fun of my technique, but she never complains about my grooming. My only reticence about the product is the power - sometimes I think if could use a little more.

I have always cleaned it meticulously after every use and even tried different kinds of lubrication and batteries but it just works very poorly. I still have it and put up with it but it's very frustrating because it ends up pulling a lot of hairs because the RPM's intermittently drop which cause the blade to yank the hair instead of cutting it.

Unfortunately, I recently grabbed it out of my closet to do some touch up and it would not turn on. No response. Totally dead. I popped open the battery cover and WHAM! I may not be trimming my nose hairs but I think I just burnt them off with that awful smell.

In fact, it leaves as much hair as I used to start with when trimming with the 411. The blade on the 421 is recessed from the tip way too far. I'm an engineer and studied the inside of the unit to make sure there wasn't a manufacturing defect, and everything looked very solid and well assembled.

I usually read and follow the reviews but this time I ignored the poor reviews because I had owned another Panasonic model Nose and ear trimmer and it worked just fine. The ER421KC is unfortunately lousy and the most absurd part is the light which does nothing. I can not believe how bad this item really is. The unit does not trim properly, operates too slow for comfort and swift trimming, does not do a good job of it and all the while, the silly dot of light reflects on your face far from the area that you are trying to trim.

Savall's vision seems even more curiously focused. For instance, not only is the use of keyboard continuo eschewed, but Savall also structures the ensemble groupings more rigidly, distinctly separating the winds and strings in non-tutti movements. This, combined with Savall's inordinately slow tempos heightens the work's sense of grandeur, making Bach's architectural elements seem more powerfully deliberate. Alessandrini takes an almost exactly opposite, though no less distinguished and worthy approach. Listening this recording in SACD format broadens the sound stage and marginally heightens the instrumental clarity. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended disc","review":"Pete Droge has finally produced a great album with \\"Skywatching\\". While I like his previous albums (though I still don't have \\"Spacey & Shakin\\"), none of them are great the whole way through. Droge seems to have learned a bit from working with Stone Gossard on \\"Bayleaf,\\" as there are definite similarities in some of the vocal lines and delivery here to Stone's solo work (\\"Hard to Tell You,\\" & \\"Bring Up the Failure\\" especially). Overall, the album still isn't a rocker like his album with the Sinners nor \\"Beautiful Girl,\\" but is a really nice, mellow disc that's not your straight-forward singer/songwriter material. By the way, \\"Small Time Blues\\" is just a tremendous song. Anyway, highly recommended to fans of his previous work, Stone Gossard's solo work, or anyone looking for a cool, mellow album.

That form has nice edges that kind of hold the gears in place as young hands move the wheels around the edge of the forms to make the fun shapes. The kit includes one pen (I remember a pen with 4 colors in the old toy and pins that stuck the paper to cardboard to hold the forms in place. This toy requires the young artist to hold the form with their hands which is a very difficult task to do.)My 6 year old could barely manage the play, and was bored very quickly.

The disposal leaked out of the bottom of the unit, same as the previous one. The seal on the inside wears out quickly. The inside was nothing but rust and corrosion.

All pipes were tight and nothing leaked continuously. Eventually figured out that when a fair amount of garbage made water to hold in the grinder chamber switching the disposal unit on caused water to leak out from the upper cone area. When used with only a small amount of garbage there were no leaks and no problems, but now the corrosion has got so severe that when the last backup occurred water sprayed like a jet across the kitchen when the cabinet door was open.

One of the best qualities is the author's ability to present the strengths of each archetype and not build a hierarchy of goddesses. This approach allows the reader to understand different women, as well as conflicting emotions within herself, and see the positive qualities.

Some people will like the additions Tazo has added to this red bush blend, but you can not taste the real rooibos flavor. This blend does not mix well with cream or milk, but it goes well with sugar. I agree with others in that you should not steep for more than 5 minutes, as it becomes too strong.If you want to try a true red bush tea, try Freshpak Rooibos Tea. It does not have the additional flavors that you see on store shelves. And it goes very well with some cream and sugar/honey.2 stars for not delivering a true red bush tea, because the additions overpower the rooibos.

Terribly written with virtually no sign of editing, it's a struggle to read and, when covering extremely technical issues, virtually incomprehensible. Worse, the content does not exactly match the on-line curriculum, meaning that Cisco on-line tests typically ask questions about topics not covered in the relevant book chapter. Even worse, the answers to the tests in the book don't match the questions being asked. Buy the Sybex CCNA book instead; although it's not written to match the on-line course, it will help clarify networking, and not leave the reader frustrated and feeling cheated.In short, this book is something of a disaster, and by no means should be used by someone who's simply looking for a textbook on computer networks. Much, much better would be \\"Computer Networking\\" by Kurose.I hate writing negative reviews, but this book certainly calls for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I am using this book in a CCNA semester 1 class. Although it is by Cisco and therefore contains the information they want you to know, it is poorly written. It is as if the original text were 3 times as long, and to shorten it, they had to take out every third sentence, because it does not flow, and concepts are often only half-explained. I am *often* reading it and think \\"What????\\" (And I'm fairly certain it's not just me - I have a B.S. and M.S in Computer Science and plenty of real-world computer experience). All in all, I have to say that this is not a high-quality book.Although it's not a substitute for the CCNA material, I really like the book called \\"Interconnections\\" by Radia Perlman."},{"rating":"1","title":"CCNA 1 and 2","review":"This book has so many errors in it.

I've gotten to the point where I leave the car adapter attachment in the center console of my car. If I am going somewhere and only want to take my point and shoot Canon, then I grab my camera and the charger. I plug it in when I get in the car and by the time I am at my destination I have charged the battery enough to usually get me through the night.I would suggest also buying a spare battery.

Yes the sound isn't good...but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is an incredible performance. Layered with subtle guitar textures to extremely violent guitar solos...I grew up on this album and lost some of my hearing on this.

I've heard this in houses, cars, and boomboxes and the sound is NOT awful. It's not the cleanest live recording I've ever heard, but nothing from that period is. Yes, the band perspective is somewhat distant and the (I think small) performance space has a certain kind of echo.But the band are quite energetic, and especially \\"King of Twilight\\" really hits a groove.The disc would be good if that were the only decent song, but the others are good as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed would be a kind statement.","review":"As an old Nektar fan from vinyl days, I searced the CD bins for Nektar for years before grabbing this release. Played it once and now it begins its half-life countdown with the other decaying objects in the garage. It is not so much the choice of songs, for these are vintage. The problem is in the recording. Sounds like the person(s) recording this live performance did not get a ticket to go inside, and simply set up his/her equipment outside the venue to catch whatever penetrated the walls. It is so condensed as to be painful. Singer's voice sounded rangeless, also. Unless you have a cheap transistor radio hooked up to your CD player and care nothing of fidelity, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good live album of a great band","review":"I'm not sure if the other reviewer and I have even heard the same album.

As a sheriff's deputy myself, I can attest to two facts: #1: As officers of the law, we primarily carry firearms to protect OURSELVES. Using our firearms to save a civilian in danger is seldom done mostly because it is rare that we see a thug brutally assaulting someone red-handed. #2: The police are not responsible to protect individuals round the clock, but rather \\"society as a whole\\". People practice fire safety and keep fire extinguishers in their homes because they know firemen are not responsible to be watching their houses round the clock, this book will also go to show why police cannot be watching their houses in the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for lawyers","review":"I thought it was a book about incidents involving 911 failures and the aftermath.

This book is not only a great tool for \\"building the career you truly desire\\" it's also a darn good entertaining read. In these volatile times, \\"Second Acts\\" is a valuable resource for anyone weathering the current economic storm, building a new career or simply recommitting to the job they currently hold.

How hard can it be if your first act was First Lady, boxing champ or Wall Street insider? These books always lose credibility when they draw upon celebrities as examples, simplistically implying that stardom is within your reach. Even using J.K.

He plays with a very distinct sound, crisp and refined, that makes his music adventurous and accesssible at the same time. With each album, you can sense his growing confidence and amazing artistry. On this album, check out the first cut, a sax solo that will blow you away. Each cut weaves it's way into the next in a seamless fashion. He has kept his band together from his last album \\"Beyond\\", and what a band it is. This album is tremendous, one that any fan of Redman or jazz in general will be able to enjoy. The musicianship, sound quality, and overall packaging is superb....get this album!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy is awesome...","review":"I still wonder where the riffs come from.

It wasn't as engaging as the first Scorpion King, but it does leave many openings for spin-offs for: the Mummy, Scorpion King, and a few others.I'm pretty sure that it is less historically accurate than the others, and the key for the Book of the Dead did not match up with the other stories in the series. The action scenes are intense and use a lot of martial arts.Overall, for an immediate DVD release, it's not half bad. However, price-wise, I think I was better off renting it, than buying the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scholarly translation from the original Arabic","review":"Noted scholar Menachem Mansoor makes an extremely valuable addition to the wealth of literature on Bachya ben Yosef ibn Pakuda's extensively-studied treatise on spirituality and ethical behavior. Whereas most extant popular translations are taken from Ibn Tibbon's definitive Hebrew translation, Mansoor works from the recovered Arabic version -- the language in which Bachya wrote. The result is a deeper and richer understanding of the subtleties of this already remarkable work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Dreams My L.A. Ex. single","review":"\\"Sweet Dreams My L.A. Ex.\\" was Rachel's first single and it went to #2 in the UK. It is a brilliant song, one of the best ever and it was written by Cathy Dennis who also wrote Britney's \\"Toxic\\" and Kylie's \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\". The single features \\"Sweet Dreams My L.A. Ex.\\" and \\"Little Secret\\". Both are included on the album Funky Dory. Also included in the remix which is fun. The video is the gem of this whole disc. It is sexy and sophisticated, don't pass it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"This is perfect for my patio.I had a tough install. I had to tunnel up under the concrete for a retrofit.This drain did a great job and was one of the easiest parts of the job.I attached the exit port of this drain to a 25' french drain pipe. So far it has taken all the water that I give it. I may go back and lengthen the drain pipe length just because I like to overdo stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch Basin Kit","review":"This item was perfect for the task at hand. The price was competitive with local stores, however, shipping made it more expensive. I had it shipped because I needed the extender for the pump to fit that I couldn't purchase locally, so I purchased them together to make sure they were compatible. Product was received on time as promised and in excellent condition. I am very satisfied with the quality and appearance of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible customer service!!","review":"I purchased this plan for a camera that I purchased from amazon and was not successful in reaching them.

I ended up asking for a refund and that took forever with several emails and phone calls!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think about your credit card protection first!","review":"Most credit cards (Amex, Visa) offer loss and damage protection, and extended warranty protection. Amex, for example, doubles the manufacturer's warranty up to and for at least 1 year.Research your credit card benefits before investing 20-25% of the product cost in extended warranty protection. I think it's worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severe Problem with Communication","review":"In error, I had two Replacement Plans for one scanner in my Cart when I checked out. I emailed the company to request it be corrected to one Plan. They emailed back that they needed more info. After I sent them more info, I never heard from them again.When I received two Plan contracts in the mail, I returned one Plan contract requesting a refund for that one Plan contract. I gave them all of my contact info.I then received an email from Amazon that both of my Plans had been canceled and refunded.Now, I have no Plans . . . don't count on this company following through with any sort of warranty or replacement! They aren't able to handle simple communications!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the terms and conditions!","review":"First, I have called them, and the person I spoke to was very friendly and personable. Which is why I'm not giving the service two stars.HOWEVER, before purchasing this, I suggest that you carefully read the terms and conditions. Very few things are covered. From what I can tell, the only thing that would be for the $150-175 range would be a glitch in the actual hardware of the item. It does NOT cover normal wear and tear, theft, or acts of God, for instance.Things are only covered after the manufacturer's warranty ends.Also, it doesn't say that the 1-year replacement plan begins after the manufacturer's warranty ends, so I would wager that it doesn't... I could be wrong, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Deal","review":"I thought that they would send a paper copy all I got was an email.

The first time we took it out we were having great fun. Then while it was flying it took a nose dive and when we retrieved it both wings had a tear in them. They should come with an extra set of wings or at least you should be able to buy extra wings as they are very delicate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure Board RPG","review":"I remember playing this board game with my father & brothers growing up. A great game in the genre of D&D. Easy to customize & has the option to make your own quests plus available expansion packs. Keep your character & develop him over multiple quests. May have to get my brothers together for some nostalgia with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Game","review":"This was by far one of my favorite games growing up, and I would love to find a new one to share with my kids when they grow up. Its for older kids, the rules are sort of complicated at first, and it takes 3 people for a good game. I was always the player who set up the board and was the 'boss' of sorts, I dont remember what the title was in the game, but the other players move around the board and you control what goes on and control the bad guys. I remember having it set up all summer and playing for hours every day trying to get through all of the quests. Its a great game, I'm not surprised its so expensive either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Basic","review":"There is not much information past name and lighting. Very very basic.

This is a Neil Gaiman book from the 90s. Azzarello certainly wasn't writing any comics in 1980. Why is there a listing for a book that doesnt exist?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really people?? I wish I could give it less than a star...","review":"*spoiler alert* (for all the haters)This book is overwrought and painful to read. The first page or so is spent just describing the horizon, really, who cares?? The plot of the story would have been somewhat interesting if it had not been written by Thomas Hardy. Like The Scarlet Letter, the story is good but the delivery of the writing is dreadful. I'm glad something BAD happens to Eustacia Vye, she's selfish and ungrateful. And people actually like this book? Whyyyyy??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Return of the native","review":"Much verbiage but that is consistent with Hardy. Its his style - very very descriptive. It's a classic. I enjoyed the story very much but was glad when I finished it.It is a novel that I should have read in high school but I didn't. Now that I have retired I had the time to spare."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning collection of photographs","review":"I remembered seeing this book reviewed in The New York Times when I needed a birthday gift for one of those hard-to-suit relatives! The photographs taken from the train are stunning. They capture the real grief felt at RFK's death and bring it home to people (like me) who were too young to take it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're from the Appalachians, this is a must hear album.","review":"To understand your Appalachian ancestors, this album is one of the most important things in years.

Got old very fast. I am a huge Jeff Foxworthy fan but this game was way to complex for a redneck like me.. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got boring fast","review":"I love Jeff Foxworthy, but unless you worship the guy, this game got boring fast. There was really no strategy to it, and many of the questions seemed like they could have multiple answers. It really is just an excuse to sit and tell Jeff Foxworthy jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturer doesn't stand behind product","review":"I bought one of these directly from mojoplay.com in late February, 2006. The unit quit working in late May, 2006. It still has audio but the video is dead. I started noticing problems about 2 weeks before it died, the picture was turning very reddish when I first turned the unit on. Then the day before it quit there was a bunch of static in the picture. I realize I may have gotten a defective monitor to start with, but since the manufacturer wouldn't honor the \\"1 year warranty\\" I will be buying another brand from now on. They will not answer their E-Mails, will not answer the phone, and they apparently have their fax machine turned off so there is no way to get in touch with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was useless...","review":"We purchased a widescreen monitor for our son, as a gift. He attached it to his PS2, and used it for approximately 4 hours, and it got very, very hot. He then turned it off, to allow it to rest & cool. Later in the day he tried to use it again, and it wouldn't work at all. We then noticed a melted spot on the back of the case!! Apparently a capacitor or something fried. As I didn't have the shipping papers, I couldn't return it... What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have fun while learning your letters","review":"Kids really enjoy playing this game. It consists of a board, a set of cards, a spinner, and player pieces. The cards are spread out on the board according to color. You spin the spinner and have to decide if you can pick up the card based on its color or if the letters on it match any of the letters on the top card in your pile. Helps kids with matching letters and colors. Best of all, the game doesn't end until the last player finishes. The winner is the one who collected the most cards. Pre-readers will have fun playing too, but need help from Mom or Dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The History like you never thought","review":"This is a really an amazing story.

Everything needed to make the chocolate is in the box. All you have to add is a spoon and a microwavable bowl. The action is quick and pretty foolproof. The only time lag comes after you've heated the chocolate and must wait for it to cool to the proper temperature before tempering. This takes about 15 minutes.You get cocoa butter, cocoa, powdered sugar, starter crystals, a thermometer that works well for this application, adequate candy holders, and an informative instruction sheet. The instructions are very clear, and the resulting chocolate is good. If I have one complaint it's that the science discussion is neither detailed nor in-depth and if that's your focus you may want to supplement the material; however, if your focus is high interest hands-on science, this kit is terrific. There are even a couple of cacao beans to examine and taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Rich Chocolate","review":"Bought this as a Christmas present for a 8yo.

Excellent introduction on beads, supplies, techniques and fringes with seven great projects from simple to intermediate. Diagrams are well executed and instructions are easy to follow making this the definitive book for the beginner. The gallery of finished bags at the end of the book, in full color, is a joy to look at and an inspiration for any beader no matter the skill level.

Really cute doll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so erotic","review":"Erotic if you like somewhat overweight girls being screwed by a post-op transgendered wearing a strap on. This is a good piece of film work and visual ideas are interesting compared to many items in this genre, but I feel it would only be shocking or new to someone who had only seen R rated films before. As usual acting skills are completely absent, but at least it is a very good quality strap-on (wonder where you could buy one like it...?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Personally didn't like this","review":"Personally didn't really like this movie. The story line is OK. I liked the idea of the story. The acting is horrible. Low budget. Basically a softcore porn with a story. A lot of the sex scenes are not very attractive, unless you like a chick that obviously used 2 be a dude raping another girl, and girls crying. All the sex scenes are lesbian. The other girls are attractive though, just the one is a transexual, and kinda works with the story cuz shes a demon."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointing !","review":"This is a tipical lesbian boring movie the kind you can rent anywhere.

What I got was a surprise home video sex tape. It is sooo bad in so many different ways I don't know where to begin. And to add insult to injury, the sex sucked. Lesbians or not if you want porn this ain't it. If you want a film, like one that you can actually watch, this ain't it.

Harris putting forth the opinion that America is at grave risk for decline, and that the key to renewal lies in using the institutions of religion, government, and commerce side by side. Warning that the process of separating religion from government entirely only serves to turn governments into power-obsessed beauracracies, Ending Entrenched Power may be a stark contradiction to the principle of separation of church and state, yet it does bring to light serious and troubling social issues with respect to the aftermath of tearing those two social institutions apart from one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"Now this is good stuff.

The book does get two points 1) for having been written and 2) for being profoundly odd. I also look forward to his next book. Not because I expect it to make a quantum leap in readability, but because the hero of Secrets is described as being lanky and handsome, with muscles he's made hard as walnuts from hours at the gym, and I have a hunch that this is what Mr. Olson looks like. No one but an egomaniac could write something like the Secrets of Mabel Eastlake and he must have a starring role in there somewhere.

It was focused on trying to prove that Islam is a valid religion and the Koran directly the work of God from him. The explanations made me more skeptical and wary of the entire Islam religion. According to the logic in this book, Nostradamous is a prophet of equal stature to Mohammed and should be revered. Nostradamous' quatraines were written in a similar style and can be interpreted to say he is predicting history and scientific principles that he could never have known in his time period. I am not against Islam, but this book really gave me a negative attitude, since it was trying to prove itself more than just expounding on what the beliefs are and what Islam is all about...."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought it for my library.","review":"Personally, I don't like it at all.

I did not find it to be any kind of reasonable guide to the Islamic religions. It explained nothing to me about a various Islamic sects such as Sunnie or Shi'ite.The first chapter purporting to provide evidence of the truths of Islam was illogical and superficial. Of course, the paragraph about the status of women in Islam is utterly ridiculous from what I have seen and read in various news media.

The author has put so much into such a small book, you come away from reading it wondering how he managed to do it. There is even a note that you may pass this book on to others, or tell them about the website where the text is available.My only comment is about the structure of the book. While I agree with the scientific statements at the beginning of the book, I felt they should have come after the main introduction - which pretty much takes up the second half of the book.That is my only criticism, and a small one at that. If you are new to the subject, you will be enthralled and amazed by the facts stated - the prophet was illiterate yet he changed the face of history.A wonderful book, and an inspiration to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey DM was it the size remark in the song that bugged ya?","review":"The music is different - her voice is different and her lyrics are fun and catchy - I highly suggest a listen - you might just like the whole album.

It's very refreshing to know that there really is an answer to the question, \\"If you're not pre-med, what are you going to do with a biology degree?\\" My only complaint is that all of the people who discuss their careers in the book already have advanced degrees (such as PhDs or MDs).

The book reeks of phoniness.","review":"While the title seems to imply that the author was such a \\"free spirit\\" that he couldn't be shackled by others' limited capacity for life, what comes through between the lines at every turn is man who in fact was quite vane and wanted others to worship him.Now, as a professional physicist myself, I am fully aware of Feynman's contribution to physics. That's where he's outstanding and deserves respect. Outside of the realm of his craft, it's quite another story. In truth, the opinions and actions depicted in the book can best be described as smart-alecky and perhaps juvenile, not anything of depth. Nonetheless, over the years an industry of Feynman groupies (many of them physicists, of course) has formed. This book will be primarily of interest to these uncritical Feynman fans. If you think for yourself, on the other hand, I believe you will find the book disingenuous."},{"rating":"1","title":"yep its ok","review":"Coming from a 16 year old girl that has to read this book for a school project...I would have to say that this book is kind of boring. If your into physics and science and all that jazz then you will most likely enjoy this book. But if you're going to read it just to read it, then I would suggest you not. I have to admit, that some of the stuff Richard Feynman says is funny but I found my self skipping pages at a time because of its boringness. Don't get me wrong, I really do admire Mr. Feynman as a man and he was a great physicist but this book was just ok. Sometimes he got into a lot of in-depth physics stuff that I just didn't care for. But sometimes i was interested in what he was saying.Have a nice day"},{"rating":"2","title":"A genius of physics, common sense, and entertainment","review":"I have read the Czech translation of Feynman's book 3 times, and the original 3 times as well. It was always a very entertaining experience, and the book was among the things that influenced me a lot.Richard Feynman has been one of the greatest and most original and unusual physicists of the 20th century. At the same moment, he was an ordinary, curious, emotional, straightforward man whose thinking was deeply rooted in common sense.However, this book is primarily a great portion of fun. Feynman's stories involving locks in Los Alamos, doctors who considered him insane, girls in the pub, paintings with naked women, physics, rabis, magicians, maps of a cat, and other things are simply irresistable.There may be other physicists whose life is (or was) equally entertaining and interesting as Feynman's life. But this book will make you sure that Feynman deserves your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Makes me wish I were more inquisitive","review":"This is a great book! The book was in great shape. Shipping was quick. The book itself is really good. I've only read one chapter so far, but it was really good. This book is great even for learning how to write scientific papers without sounding like a stiff shirt. I'm using this for a Research Methods class. Dr. Feynman is so cool in how he inquires everything and is such a rascal in carrying out his experiments and inquiries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic journey into the life of a genius","review":"This book was an absolute joy to read. I found that I could not put it down. It makes a great book for a small break in the day because each topic is only a few pages. I will warn you that reading just one topic may be difficult. If you enjoy science, physics, how things work, brilliant minds, you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I only wish","review":"I only wish that I could have taken a class from Richard Feynman. This is not a book about physics. It is a book about of the most brilliant physics minds of the last century and a good guy to boot. It is a book that I have read to my kids (the chapters are each an episode or incident in feynman's life and are hilarious, touching, and insightful). I can not recommend this book too highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is excellent, and I thouroughly reccomend it.","review":"I really enjoyed this book, though I only listened to it on tape. It was a worthwhile read/listen. The stories are fun even if you don't understand the physics. I suggest that anyone read this book, whether scientifically inclined or otherwise. I'm actually 13, and I found the book an enjoyable read. My parents and younger brother all enjoyed it equally. A great book for any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mind expander","review":"I wish someone had given me this book when I was 12-13 years old. I have always enjoyed math and science, but this book would have really made me more excited to learn as much as possible instead of \\"just enough to not look too dorky\\". Anyway at 24 years old I read the book and loved it. I have given away several copies since then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remembered for the wrong reasons?","review":"This book is entertaining, no question about that. The anecdotes are very amusing, although Feynman sometimes comes across as a bit of a [jerk]. I think if Haulden Caulfield grew up to be a genius physicist he would be Richard Feynman. I am surprised though so many people seem to put him on a pedestal. I just hope that in the long run Feynman will not be remembered mostly for his smart-alecky pranks rather than for his outstanding contributions to theoretical physics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feynman never got out of his box, because he never had one!","review":"Part physicist, part prankster, part musician, part teacher, part genius, part story teller, part little boy and all human being, this is the true story of Richard Feynman. He was a man with an insatiable curiosity, and had a zest to explore the world of physics, human nature and himself.The stories in the book are funny, entertaining and enlightening. Feynman never got out of his box, because he never had one. From the gifted young boy who fixed radios by thinking to the top notch physicist who could explain concepts to laymen like no one else, Feynman was one of a kind.Well worth the read!The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"Feynman the comedian is in this book.

From the Manhattan project to picking up the ladies in smokey bars, Dr. Feynaman and his curiosity has narrowed the gap between the superlative and the mundane. This book is not a boring account of a scientist, but an exciting book about a man who lived mostly on his terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"Fantastic book of short life stories. I am not a \\"physics\\" guy but all these tales, even the ones with hard core science, were easily accessible. The writing style is fantastic and you really get to know the author so well. He was a great writer, scientist, and human being. Some of the way he deals with his personal life are... odd -- but it only adds to his quirky scientist persona."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a compilation of funny stories","review":"A good friend loaned me this and I enjoyed it so much I bought one for my father at Christmas. He loved it as much as I did. It is more than an autobiography of a truly stunning intellect. Mr Feynman's curiosity is contagious and has caused me to open my eyes and question why things are the way they are. The stories are hilarious. I hope you enjoy it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift for High School Graduates","review":"I have given this book to several high school graduates and plan to continue that tradition this year. This is especially humorous for those in the hard sciences (physics, math, engineering). Such a brilliant guy and so funny! Some of the adventures are just a hair unusual, but that is typical of college students, so it opens the mind of high school students to future possibilities (and possibly what to avoid!). Definitely recommended and a great gift that will be devoured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all physicists are labcoat wearing nerds","review":"A lighthearted romp of entertaining stories that let you know that even brilliant scientists are human.

Very good supplemental reading for any serious student of science to remind them not to take life too seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delight and Requirement for People in the \\"Hard\\" Sciences","review":"I have only given out three books in my lifetime, and this was one of them.

I have no scientific background at all, and I agree with another reviewer who said \\"everyone should read this book.\\" I have returned to this book many times since someone gave it to me 7 years ago. In good or times or bad, this book has been an inspiration to me. How to be yourself against the flood of conformity, how to maintain standards, how to remain human. Unforgetable."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN READ","review":"Lets you know that a life of science doesn't have to be all work and no play. This is the kind of person I'd like to be.

Life would not have been dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chilling Lack of Empathy.","review":"One of our times' most well known physicists tells some supposedly amusing anecdotes from his life in 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!', but in many cases I fail to see the humor. The writing is rather pedestrian, but the author does not purport to create great literature, only to amuse. Some of these anecdotes can be described as funny, but in many of the stories Feynman shows a glaring lack of empathy with his fellow man, and seems to be completely unaware of his shortcoming in this respect. Feynman was among other things involved in the Manhattan project, and if this is what passed for humor among the people who created the bomb, their moral stance (or lack thereof) becomes more tangible. It is a very chilling realization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"This book chronicles a few incidents in the peculiar life of Noble award winning physicist Richard Feynman. Feynman was a brilliant scientist and an inspiring teacher who led an eccentric lifestyle. Although most readers have loved this book, I found it to be boring and dull. A few of Feynman's so called adventures were pretty interesting and had a sparkle to them (like how he learned to open safes), but I thought most of his stories were boring, especially his adventures with ladies in bars. I was pretty disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was passable, Feynman's a prat","review":"Are you all blind? This Feynman character is nothing more than a conceited, pretentious, stuck-up, high-and-mighty, pseudo-funny-guy. He has no respect for anyone with a single brain-cell less than him. \\"Haha the dumb waitress poured water on the floor\\" or \\"Haha the dumb Captain forgot to set his safe\\", he might have been a fantastic physicist but he obviously had the personality of a worm. Don't bother reading this book. He was one of a kind and now he's gone. Thank God."},{"rating":"1","title":"A better title \\"I am so great!\\"","review":"Clearly Mr. Feynman is brilliant, but he comes off as a self-aggrandizing jerk; always having to show that he's smarter than anyone else and playing 'jokes' on people that they probably didn't find so funny. Would I want to hang out with someone like that? Nope! Then why waste my time reading all of his clever anectodes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"bargain for your brain","review":"inspired, enlightening, powerfully disarming and highly entertaining.What a bargain - so much wisdom for that price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, great read. Feynman's life his own words.","review":"I truly felt that Dr Feynman was talking to me and introducing me to his world, and how he has experienced things through out his childhood, college and adult life.I recommend this for people with a background in Mathematics and Natural Sciences (like myself), and for those of you who have never heard of string theory or other phenomena Dr Feynman was famous for studying.For those of you who would like to learn more about Dr Feynman, this book is excellent.For those of you who want to understand more of his work and the world in which he taught (more detailed information regarding his field), this book is probably not as good as the other Feynman books out there. Amazon has all of them, so you can easily find a great book by Feynman for your needs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice walk in the past or a true scientist, driven by curiosity","review":"The book chapters are very uneven in terms of content and the writing is not that of a litterary scholar.Yeat, each chapter offers an experiement with a situatino of the lofe of Feynman and the author describes his search for new feelings and the ability to learn from them in a very eloquent manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Structured, Kind of a Jerk","review":"Not only was this book not structured in an meaningful way - it was just an extended series of anecdotes - it also portrayed a not pompous and at sometimes flat-out rude man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read","review":"This is a fantastic book! Richard Feynman is a fascinating person and an excellent writer. His view of the world is exciting and interesting and his life experiences make for enjoyable stories. One lesson that comes through in this book is 'Think', don't be afraid to stop and think about something, a problem, a point of view, etc. Through these stories and the life of Richard Feynman, we are all shown what it is to live a life well. Get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Entertaining Story Teller!","review":"\\"Surely Your Joking,Mr. Feynman,\\" is a book that you keep because you read it and reread it. I love Feynman's sense of humor and his story-telling. He certainly was a character who led a remarkable life with a wide variety of interests.I bought the book from Amazon after seeing the movie, \\"Infinity.\\" The movie describes a tragic love story but also allows the viewer an opportunity to get a glimpse of the Feynman attrobutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feynman steals the show with his witty attitude!","review":"Before readnig this book I knew very little about Physics and never even heard about Richard P. Feynman. After reading the book, I got a greater appreciation for Physicists and what they do.Feynmans witty attitude keeps the reader awake and yearning for more. He describes physics with such simplicity that a child could understand. His great attitude and vivid imagination help you conceptualize his experiments both as a child and as an adult. Great book overall!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Book by a Brilliant Man","review":"\\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\\" is simply one of the best books I've read. It's funny, witty, informative, and interesting. But most of all, it's entertaining.Despite my utter infatuation with this book, I believe a \\"Reader Beware\\" is in order: To truly enjoy this book, I would suggest that you have at least some interest in science. Feynman's antics aren't difficult to understand, but if you don't like science, you might feel a bit on the outside of some inside jokes.As for the accusations regarding Feynman's arrogance, they're not unfounded. But it boils down to this: a smart guy poking fun at some dumber guys. I found it funny. Some people don't. If you've never giggled in class when someone gave a really dumb answer to a question, you may not enjoy this book.Overall, \\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\\" is an excellent piece of literature. It's an incredibly fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa Robbins' Review","review":"The novel, \\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\\", by Richard Feynman was very interesting I must say. The numerous stories of events during his life were very comical and entertaining. Feynman's humorous tales of his ideas and experiences made it hard to put down. Although the book is written by a physicist, it is not your typical science book. It tells about the things Mr. Feynman did from his childhood all the way up to his life as an adult. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting an enjoyable biography about a wonderfully successful physicist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius in true form","review":"The book was given to me by my English major brother. He often sends books my way and they usually sit for quite a bit while I try to get through them, but for some reason I picked this one up and read it in one sitting. The last paragraph seemed like it had been written for me, \\"So I have one wish for you-the good luck to be somewhere where...you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity.\\" Feynman remained true to himself and still had time to win a noble prize. Science readers and everyone else would benefit by his unique outlook on the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"Pros: Great price. Arrived on time. Condition was perfect (it did not even look as if it had been opened... let alone read). What a great read. Written in prose - almost as if Dr. Feynman was sitting with you on a porch recollecting his life. ...And what a life it was! This guy did everything from work on the Manhattan project, to sculpturing, to safe cracking, to bongo drum playing, etc, etc. He even has some tips on how to approach women at a bar! If you like biographies about eccentric, intelligent people...you will most likely enjoy this one.Cons: shipping and handling was more than the price of the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Funny, brilliant, bawdy\\"","review":"Be prepared to meet Richard Feynman, learn about his drumming in a steel band, his cracking of safes, his portrait painting, and his very wise, and very humorous look at what goes into his life. Feynman pretty much excels at everything from radio-repair to philosophy. The book is an insight into his days as a child, at school, at MIT, at Los Alamos research center, at the nuclear research center during world war two, his non-existent social life and how he goes on to learn the tricks and become a social animal. It's really amazing how one man can play so many roles in one life. But one also admires that Feynman was absolutely committed to his subject with a no-nonsense attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's different kinds of genius","review":"This book, in its chatty style, shows us the life story of Richard Feynman as told by himself to a bongoeing friend. It shows how one man's intelligence can be totally exceptional. By standard IQ tests Feynman never got very high (see the book), because his genius works along different lines and IQ is a lousy standard to begin with. It shows how Nobel-prize winning science work can be fun, can be a discovery and can take you to Japan etc. Very entertaining, especially the part where Feynman personally hacks the safes in Los Alamos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bully","review":"Feynman was undeniably brilliant but he was also a bully and a supreme egotist. He recounts story after story of how he humiliated people, usually with cruel \\"jokes.\\" I did not find him appealing at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did'nt get it!","review":"While I have no doubt the author and his fans are enjoying themselves immensely, I simply didn't get it. No harm there. I wish them continued happiness and joy on all fronts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book","review":"This book was fun to read. Dr. Feynman surely has a lot of worthwile stories to tell. He is an interesting character and has a lot to offer to those outside of the realm of physics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glimpse into the colorful life of a brilliant man","review":"Mr. Feynman's career as a physicist was remarkable, including highlights such as the Manhattan Project and the inquiry into the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster. This collection of anecdotes gives us a look at another side of this distinguished scientist. Here we find an irreverent person, who enjoyed practical jokes and loved to explore interests beyond science. Many of these stories are extremely funny, while others are thought provoking. If there is lesson here, it is that we should live our lives like explorers, always pushing the limits of our experience and never afraid to take chances."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a lovely autobiography","review":"Feynman was a brilliant physicist, but he's also a brilliant observer of the human mind. His puzzlement over the inability of others to see the world as a scientist does helps to explain science in a way that the actual explanation of scientific results might not do. Entertaining and insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"a curious and exploring mind","review":"brings you into the mind of a genius, a man unimpressed with his given talents, but wanting to know the world around him..the art world the scientific world and the world of women and socitey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't believe I Gave Away My Hardcopy","review":"Well-crafted collection of stories by the free-thinking, free-wheeling physicist who lived them.This Kindle version will soon have as many notes as were in the margins of my physical copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobel-winning physicist talks about life, learning.","review":"One of the best books I've ever read, fiction or non-fiction. Feynman's book had me laughing out loud so many times that people around me began to wonder what was wrong with me. Through his recollections about growing up, travels around the world, working at Los Alamos on the bomb and teaching at Cal Tech, Feynman shows what it's like to really live life. To get involved with interests and hobbies you might not consider. To strike up conversations with strangers. To play the bongos.After I finished this book, my one regret was that this genius is no longer alive. I'd like to write him a letter telling him that he had changed my life in some small yet meaningful ways.

Despite a few historical errors that slipped past the reviewers (the famous naval theoretician Alfred Thayer Mahan was not at West Point as a teacher, but rather his less famous father, Dennis Hart Mahan was), that suggest this volume may have been rushed to publication, this is a fitting conclusion to a great alternative history series.

My mind wanders, and I find myself thinking about other things rather than about the music. Perhaps this is how Glass wanted it to be.

I have never before listened to an album of his that had nothing--zip, nada--on it that I came even close to liking. This is a practical joke of an album: there's that beautiful voice, singing two collections of songs without any redeeming features. There are boring melodies, dragging tempos, limp rhythms. Was Jerry in the midst of a contract dispute? You wouldn't even use these songs to pad out an LP in the old-fashioned way.

While the age level is 8+, I found that my six year old loves it. It has multiple skill levels and additional puzzle cards are avaliable, if and when you ever get bored. While it is a single player game for the most part, it is fun to time each other for competition or you can also work as a team on the harder puzzles. My only complaint is the box which serves as storage could be a little nicer or perhaps designed to make it easier to store away (all the pieces have to be aligned just right in order to get it back in the box!). It's also great on trips!

Not being able to resist the challanges of the different card categories I started off with the top-level, but soon had to give up and step level by level down. Solving the cards one by one gave a real kick to continue up-wards in the card categories. Playing the game during my in-laws Christmas dinner, I stole the show from my mother-in-law's great Christmas food. Everyone invited could hardly wait for their turn to try to get the litlle red car out of the parking lot, giving me tips and advice and completly forgetting the food! That goes also for my mother-in-law! END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"My kids got this for Christmas and absolutely love it. They are ages 4 and 6. It took a little while to understand the premise of trying to move the cars out of the way to get the red car out, but then they were hooked. THey can play it together and help each other out. It's nice to have a toy that requires them to use problem logic skills, and it can keep the parents busy too. The only negative I have to say is I wish the roads were a bit deeper as my kids have a tendency to knock the cars over accidently as they are not \\"set-in\\" to the raods very deep. But I still give it a 5 star as it's one of the games that is both kid and parent approved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great puzzle- must have for maze lovers!","review":"You set up and manipulate the mazes in your mind and with your hands.

The Hollywood Quartet and Victor Aller supply chamber music performances that are so idiomatic, elegant, sensitively played and true to the spirit of the composers intentions that the results defy any negative criticism. The pianist Victor Aller (1905-76), an unfamiliar name, is described in the notes as \\"spending most of his time teaching or acting as a contractor/fixer for the Warner Brothers Orchestra\\". His playing is superb and is easilly equal to the more illustrious names who have recorded this music over the years. It is refreshing to hear a bit of old fashioned portamento from the strings.The sonics of these performances, taped between 1952 an 1958, are very acceptable and often more realistic and better balanced than those of more recent vintage. A memorable set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finish your job faster then others","review":"The fantastic idea that's combined the caster and the gun-toy to suppport a big or small wire project.The design and body colour also make it this tool more expensive then the price we get it.Buy it now before GreenLee change the colour !

A wonderful piece for any kitchen and a historic piece to be handed down for generations. Be careful. Later reproductions have been printed without the cartoons and poems, as they were not deemed politically correct.

No extra expense for gas to get to your class, and not a minute wasted in travel.The course itself has phenomenal production values and many added features to get you playing bass! There's a real-time fretboard to follow along with the lesson, practice loops that you can use over and over again at your own pace (loops have FAST or SLOW samples), and even an on-screen band that you can practice with once you get each lesson under your belt.I'm taking this course myself - I bought mine on the Teach Me Bass Guitar website - and I couldn't be more satisfied!There's no better self-paced bass instruction series in the world!

It may seem a bit purist to exclude his other pieces, but many of them, including his marches and songs, are rather commonplace for their time period. Two unfortunate omissions are Solace, which is actually a Tango, although it is in rag format, and Chrysanthemum, which is an intermezzo, although many in rag circles think it qualifies as a Joplin rag. Aside from these, this is a good substitute for the hard to find Complete Works of Scott Joplin from the New York Public Library. Also included are the original covers and some information on Joplin and the pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Scott Joplin Book!","review":"Absolutely love the book and agree with what most others have written. My only complaint is with the BOOK itself. It's incredibly hard to keep open - the pages and cover keep closing! When you fold it to the page you want, it just won't fold smoothly. Very annoying!

It does nothing to explain the real deal with breeding like identifying strains that are compatible and in turn can breed. He puts it in a manner saying all you have to do is find a male and find a female and voila you have seeds. Any good cannabis breeder knows this is not the truth.

I wanted to savor each of the stories and not rush through through the book. As a contemporary of Atwood's, I could relate to the periods and relationships she so brilliantly describes. The final story, \\"The Boys at the Lab,\\" I was able to read on two levels--the description of the decline of the narrator's 90+ mother and recollection (only by photos in an album) of a magical period of her childhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Atwood's Best Work","review":"\\"Moral Disorder\\" was our book club selection, and I was happy to see the usually reliable Margaret Atwood as its author. As a short story fan, I was eagerly anticipating reading this book. Unfortunately, \\"Moral Disorder\\" seemed like a jumble of half-finished ideas for other books that never quite jelled. The characters are allowed to show random-seeming pieces of their lives, but little happens in terms of an actual plot to link these people into a cohesive, satisfying story. Overall, it was a disappointing read. Would strongly recommended \\"The Robber Bride\\" or \\"A Handmaid's Tale\\", which are much better examples of Atwood's abilities as a story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Margaret Atwood!","review":"Have you seriously read anything bad by this author?

Although the style, which does not introduce the main character's name into a few storeis in, can be hard to fallow, it was unique and worth working at. The first few stories were really great, I felt like I was learning alot while reading some great stories. But once it got to the parts about Tig and Nell...? ...boring. I didn't understand the character's reasoning at all-- Atwood did not give her much depth in this area. I got a taste of it, but not alto; I feel this story may have been told better if in a different format, this large networking of people's lives. However, the stories about aging are rare, true, and great gems.

Yes, I will read other Atwood books, but this one UGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dawn Rochelle Series","review":"I loved the first 4 novels by LM in the Dawn Rochelle Series. I thought that they were original and awesome! But in the 5th DR series novel, \\"To Live Again\\" I was highly dissapointed. Since the DR series was at first just 4 books, and the 5th was written years later, you find yourself thinking \\"This isn't the Dawn we know!!!\\" Dawn seems to have a different attitude, like a different person, and a less likable one at that. The different obstacles Dawn go through are boring, and rather stupid. I found the book to put a damper on the whole series. In my opinion, if you read the DR series, just stop at the 4th one, and skip the 5th."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Group","review":"While I don't actually have this CD, the group is great.

If the woman who had the abortion was so upset about having to take that decision, why did she do it, and what claim does she have on our sympathies given that she lies to her husband regularly? That bad a marriage is a problem rather than a drama, and given how awful the woman is, why doesn't her best friend run off with the husband? The idea that dividing a grammer school into competing groups as a way to improve education is laughable. These students are not interested in learning no matter how much they are begged to do so. Why bother?

I felt so much better, no gas or bloating, my stomach felt great, and I started to lose weight. Unfortunately the acid reflux was too unbearable so I had to return to Prilosec, and the symptoms came back immediately and I gained the back weight I lost plus some.My experience has been verified by many other people on Prilosec who went through the same thing.

If the frequent heartburn is not treated, this disease can progress to cancer. The good news is that a doctor known as a Gastroenterologist can perform a very simple procedure known as an Upper Endoscopy to see if any cells have changed and to treat the condition well before any danger. I'm surprised that makers of acid reflex drugs don't advertise this danger of leaving the condition untreated. Instead I always believed the worse thing was a little heartburn and a benign condition called \\"erosive esophagus\\".If you've had frequent heartburn over a long period of time, tell your doctor that you want to see a \\"Gastro\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product.","review":"I had severe Acid Reflux/Heartburn usually requiring me to take multiple antacids throughout the day.

His acid reflex has gotten worse to the point where he is afraid to go to sleep for fear he will aspirate in his sleep. He has used Prilosec OTC for the last year with great results and no problems, until he ordered from Amazon. Today he took the box to the pharmacist and was told that there is a very good possibility that these are counterfeit pills.

Galois' theory can be called the aim to learn Abstract Algebra. I cannot help confessing that to read this book is to waste time. It would confuse you rather than help.

My son wasn't as interested as I would have hoped, but I can attribute it to him being 15 months old and perhaps too young for it. However, as a video professional, I can tell you that the production level of this video is poor. There is a kid on the video that has no business narrating anything beyond a school project. The microphone used couldn't have been anything better than something found on the discount rack at Radio Shack. And the editing was similar to what you might find on your local cable public access station.

I'm looking forward to trying the biscuit on a stick and Mrs. Swan's White Cake! YUM.Fans of cookbooks and western cuisine are sure to appreciate this cookbook. The photos are huge, tasteful, and numerous, and the recipes offer a delightful mix of western and Mexican inspired food. Just reading this cookbook makes me hungry. =-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Kingsley Amis pastiche","review":"I ordered this book from the library, after it was briefly referred to as \\"hilarious\\" in a recent review of \\"Talk to the Hand: The Utter Bloody Rudeness of the World Today, or Six Good Reasons to Stay Home and Bolt the Door\\". Sadly, I found that it didn't live up to its billing.It's not a dreadful book, and certainly it is better than any first novel that I am likely to write. But neither its characters nor its storyline are very interesting, and I can certainly see why it faded into obscurity when it was originally published."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!","review":"Didn't like it and won't recommend to my friends. We all box and train and most of this book is not true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Ladder, one small problem...","review":"I have this Sturdy Step ladder, and a 6-step ladder from the same line, and I LOVE them! They are very lightweight, fold to a 4\\" width for storage, and the steps are closer together than most ladders (9\\" apart vs. the usual 12\\"), making them very easy and safe to climb. They are very sturdy, as the name implies, and are great for using around the house and yard. I have been using my ladders for over 10 yrs. and they are still in perfect shape. HOWEVER!! the photo shown on this listing is a picture of a 4-step ladder, NOT a 3-step. If you order this item here, the ladder you will get will have 1 step less than the one in the photo. Check the manufacturer's website sturdystep.com before you buy, they have all the correct photos and dimensions for a 3-step and all of the other sizes available, so you can make sure you get the ladder you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to break","review":"Do not purchase. Very fragile product. The material used is clearly cheap it's not heavy glass. I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like drinking from a Ball jar","review":"Very uncomfortable for drinking. The ridges for the screw cap are right where you put your lips. It makes it uncomfortable and sloppy as it is prone to dripping. One of the ridges even has a slight chip making it even more unpleasant. I have a similar product from Tazo and cannot find another anywhere. It has a flat surface above the screw ridges - wish I could find another like it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Comprehensive, but Older Edition a Better Value","review":"As always, an excellent collection of readings. However, not all that much is new compared to the 4th edition (ISBN: 0070523797). I suggest buying the last edition (which is selling used for only $...) and saving yourself a bundle. Use the ISBN to search, otherwise the 4th edition doesn't come up on Amazon searches."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Motorola V180","review":"I recently purchased this phone and after only three weeks the LCD screen started acting up, coming on scrambled and at times I would flip the phone open and it would display just a black screen. I figured maybe it was just a bad phone so I exchanged it for another V180. I have this new phone for about a week and a half, and I am seeing similar signs which led to the problems that I had with the first phone. This phone is aesthetically nice looking and has some nice features, but until they work out the bugs its not worth it, I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I would rate a -0 if I could. I went to charge my phone and the pin inside the port broke off. Called Cingular and was told it was physical damage and not covered on warranty. The phone is 2 months old! Service with Cingular is minus minus zero, as with all large corporations. I have a contract for 2 years of service with Cingular and will do whatever I can to get out of it without paying fees - what a rip off!! I will begin my letter writing campaign from the Attorney Generals office to the CEO of Motorola and Cingular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a way to put a MINUS-SUPER NEGATIVE star?","review":"I had the same problem other people had with LCD screen. The phone company (T-Mobile, also super negative service) wants to charge me for replacing the phone claiming abuse. I used the phone only for 3 days and it went bad.Get another phone and brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is easily the worst cell phone I have ever owned. The quality is very poor(cheap plastic...the phone actually creaks when you flip it open). The screen in too small and dark even w/the brightest setting. The menu is non-intuitive and the simple task of using the phone book is a hassle. My 3 year old Samsung was of much higher quality and better in every aspect. With all the choices on the market don't waste your money - Fred B."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it until the crystal display broke","review":"Had the phone for 3 months. Worked ok until today when I took it off my belt clip to make a call and noticed the outside display was half gone with a big blotch in its place. Did not drop/bump it, etc. There is no reason the display should have gone bad. It doesn't affect the functioning of the phone and the main display is ok. It just looks ugly as hell on the outside now. Plus I now have to open the phone to check the time and caller ID since I can't read the outside display anymore. I was going to call Cingular or Motorola but after reading other people's reviews it sounds like they will just tell me its not covered under warranty and that I must have dropped it or something.One other major complaint I have is the battery life, or lack thereof. If you buy this phone, and I don't recommend it, make sure you have the charger handy cause you'll need it every other day if you talk much.CAP"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap fragile screen in front","review":"I still do not know what happened, but one minute the screen on the outside front cover was working, the next minute it was cracked so now there are ink blots. I only had it for 3 days before this happened and I know it was not dropped. I only paid $20.00 for it but would definitely NOT pay any more for it. Otherwise, it works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked Screen","review":"I bought the phone...two days later I experienced the same cracked screen. Didn't drop the phone, smash it...nothing! Opened it up and the screen has a wierd blueness to is. Brought it back and i was told it isn't covered under warranty. Unreal! Avoid this phone...I'm out the money I paid for the phone with no help from the Cingular dealer (corporate store)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Got this phone a week ago, and the outside LCD screen has already cracked. Have no idea what happened to it, simply took it out of apocket and it was cracked (inky looking blotch on the screen). Seems to be a quality issue, no abnormal use, it seemingly spontaneously cracked, and of course this is not covered under warrenty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun little phone","review":"I just upgraded my phone to the V180 great little phone with fun features. Yes the phone's screen could be a little bit bigger. But it's really simple to use. And I found a great website for more wallpapers and ringtones! I would recommend it. I have T-mobile service now, maybe the previous ppl that have had problems with this phone should go to a new carrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"Bought two of these phones in late January and have now replaced both once and are having problems with both new ones. The displays keep having problems and the batteries either don't hold charge or shut off completely. Cingular is perfectly willing to keep replacing them but will not allow us to upgrade or change to a different phone. I have now spent hours on the phone to no avail and am considering completely switching over my service even it we have to pay the penalty. Frankly, we have found these phones to be faulty equipment and after researching them on the internet and speaking with someone at Cingular they apparently have known this for some time but have continued to sell them. In fact, we asked Cingular after the first one quit working if there was a problem with this particular phone and were told it was just a random problem and that there were no common complaints about this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP OF THE LINE PHONE - EASY - THE BEST","review":"This phone is the best phone I have found yet! There is not one thing I have to complain about with it! It is much easier then any other phone for everything - text message, phone book, calculator and everything! This is the best phone you could get! The speaker phone is an awesome addition! I love this phone and would highly recommend it to everyone I know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reception, a stir of echos","review":"I've had this phone for a year and I'm just about to get rid of it - can't wait. I don't know if it's this particular phone or the model, but reception is poor and I frequently hear my own voice echoed back at me while I'm talking. The other party doesn't hear it so it's not a complete disaster, but it's tough training yourself to ignore that. I do know one other person with the same phone who's had similar problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"underwater conversations","review":"I have this as a replacement for my Samsung e-105 which was a fantastic little phone that I never had a problem with, until my lack of care caused it to finally collapse. Phones (other than Nokia, IMO) only last about 14 months these days.I have no complaints about the design - the LCD is not NEARLY as clear as the samsung, and it is cheap plastic, but it's free - what should I expect?The problem is that every conversation - whether to a landline or another mobile - sounds like the other person is under water! They're garbled and hard to understand. I always have to ask people to repeat themselves.Second problem - the battery. After an hour, even when not in use, it needs more juice.I already called TMobile and ordered the next Samsung - their interface is considerably better.(and any problems with TMobile might just be from the particular agent - i've never had a problem, and I've been with them for 6 years - since they were Voicestream!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I am three months into my plan and this phone is horrible. For the first month this phone worked fine, I just wanted a simple phone without fancy features.But about two months after purchase I get calls dropped after 11 minutes of talking. Consistently. EVERY Single call gets dropped now after 11 minutes. 1 out of every 3 calls I have to redial to get a clear signal.I have used LG, Nokia, and Samsung and should have stuck with one of those phones. This is my last Motorola phone purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible reception","review":"Horrible phone, every few days you need to shut it off and turn back on to get decent reception, calls dropped all the time. Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't expect to learn In-Flight","review":"This CD only state the phrase once and expect you pick it up.I gave up after several hours of trying but it just did not work.I bought the car version which is better because it gradually builds on the difficulties, repeats and reviewseach lesson. The car version of multiple CDs was more helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Even though I ordered this book years ago, I remember receiving it just as expected! The delivery time was quick and the book was in perfect condition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A used book!","review":"Though the seller claimed that the book was new after receiving it, I discovered that the book was used with highlighted lines (green, pink) in several pages! I wasn't interested in a used book as it was a gift add to that that I was charged for a new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know the man","review":"I know Paul Hawker personally. He is a hypocrite, a liar and a cheat. If these are the type of qualities in a person that you are trusting to tell you how to discern Gods voice then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment --- and false advertising, too!","review":"QUESTION: WHAT'S ON THE COVER OF THIS BOOK?Answer: It's a drawing of a girl kissing another, somewhat startled girl!Now WHY would they put two girls kissing on the cover, when in actuality there are NO GIRL/GIRL SCENES WHATSOEVER IN THIS ENTIRE GRAPHIC NOVEL?!!Every chapter in this book is boy/girl (or boy/girl/girl in one instance), and that's not what I wanted. Whoever markets this book knew, however, that girl/girl drawings/episodes sells books, so that's what they put on the cover. But instead we, the unsuspecting customers, get a bunch of drawings of male genitalia. No, NOT what I wanted.Even the one female roommate in this book who openly declares herself to BE A LESBIAN in the first chapter doesn't have a SINGLE SCENE with another girl, opting instead to be with guys. That's false advertising. And the drawings and stories BOTH are below par. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TRACK LIST","review":"Track Listing1. When The Roll Is Called Up Yonder2.

I was very surprised at how effective they were in taking away cravings and relieving stress, better than nicotine patches that I have also tried. I stopped without agony for ten days. I started smoking again after returning to the real world - not committed yet. I am ready to stop again, and am ordering these patches for support. If you are quitting, you may find these patches very helpful for a relatively low cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"these suck.","review":"I feel like these are just skin colored stickers. they did absolutely nothing, even though i really wanted to stop smoking. and if it isnt bad enough that it does nothing, it leaves a sticky mess after you pull it off. dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy","review":"I've sampled several different quit smoking products all of which I've had at least some success on cutting back or stopping smoking for a period of time...until this product.

I am a lover of poetry and of all my books, this is number 1. I come back to it again and again. The beauty and depth and complexity are beyond any contemporary American poet I know of. She captures eros like no one else I know and allows me to actually experience it as i read her words--not just know it as an abstract concept. I am so grateful to Ms. Rogers for her work. I tell as many people as i can about it, and hope the word spreads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant cat-written mystery","review":"Crozet is one of my favorite small towns :)I love Harry's pets so much that I just named \\"my\\" stray cat's kittens Tucker, Murphy, and Pewter.Pawing Through the Past is another brilliantly-written mystery by Rita Mae Brown. Her characters are rich as chocolate mousse, and just about as satisfying. Brown's love of animals makes me want to read her books; her style makes me want to read them again.This mystery was not only \\"right up my alley\\" but reminiscent of personal friends. However, while I figured out Who Done It, I didn't figure out the REAL mystery until it was spelled out for me. It was clever, and I admire Brown for pulling the wool over my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel Inc. on the prowl again.","review":"As some reviewers of Rita's works have suggested before: Rita is a good read for those with nothing better to do; those wanting someting light, and perhaps amusing, to read as a change of pace; or those in transit with an excess of downtime on their hands and nothing else to do but read. The animals who are supposed to be the stars of this series are getting quite brazen in their actions. In \\"Cat on the Scent\\" Rita would have us believe these things actually drove Blair's car to Harry's place with Blair in the driver's seat and unconscious. In this book she would have us believe they went after Harry's attacker with a skateboard on one ocassion; and thoroughly clawed another attacker into submission on a second ocassion. I don't buy this and neither should anyone else.If you really must insist upon reading this sorry excuse for a serious mystery borrow it from your local library like I did with the copy I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable but unbelievable","review":"The story held my interest but the animals are a little unbelievable with what they seem to accomplish. Wish animals could reason & behave as all of these seem to do. Was cute to think that all animals \\"converse\\" in this way & work together to help the humans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad... it could have been much better","review":"Against all odds, Legally Blonde made its way to a sequel, which was good enough and didn't let us down. Now the first soundtrack was suprisingly good, I liked almost every track of it. I couldn't wait to have the second soundtrack, and ohh big disappointment. I liked 2 tracks of it. My advice, don't get it. Leann Rimes' \\"We Can\\" is a very uplifting song and Hope 7's \\"Breakthrough\\" is rellly nice too... but the soundtrack ends there. Unfortunately the whole CD is just not worth it just for those 2 songs that are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Cd wasn't as good as the movie, but good competition","review":"This cd was really good. I especially enjoyed superchik's song. If you enjoyed the movie then this cd is a good bet. P.S. Whats up with associating Howard Dean with Leann Rimes' song \\"WE Can\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT.","review":"Upbeat and happy.... same affect it had on me with the original Legally Blonde soundtrack. \\"WE CAN\\", \\"BREAKTHROUGH\\", \\"ME AGAINST THE WORLD\\", \\"MORE BOUNCE (IN CALIFORNIA)\\" is enough to make this album worth your money.It's 4 stars because I felt like the original soundtrack (5 stars) was more complete with feel-good, go-girl songs entirely throughout the album... this 2nd soundtrack is more, say, gender-balanced but still great.Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Power","review":"This soundtrack delivers upbeat tunes that are as catchy as they are inspiring. Motivating, girl-power songs fill the album graced by Leann Rimes, Superchick, and other energetic bands. With song titles such as \\"We Can\\" and lyrics like \\"I'm gonna breakthrough\\", 'Blonde Ambition' is defined through song. Bottom line - if you like the movie, you'll love the album. May induce smiles, fun, and blonde behavior: as happy as the movie, the Legally Blonde 2 soundtrack gives listeners a sugar-coated good time."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],W={key:0},O={key:1};function C(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",O,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(M,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-44db14a9"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/51.md","filePath":"library/51.md"}'),j={name:"library/51.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{R as __pageData,G as default};
