On several occasions I read the author's presentations over and over. Either he has no idea how to explain things OR I have simply lost my math ability. I hope it is the latter because I need to take two other math courses. Hopefully, they will not be courses that use books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed","review":"I cannot recommend this text for use with students who need help with calculus. Perhaps students who already know calculus might find the book interesting, but that is only a guess. I can attest to the fact that the typical student in my class found the text disjointed, frustrating, and verbose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanna learn Calculus? Stay away from Stewart!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is not the worst book on calculus, but it's one of the bad ones. If you're a professor or already learned calculus, you'll probably won't have trouble following it. However, for students like me taking calculus for the first time in my life, I find it VERY VERY hard to follow. I \\"was made\\" to purchase this book because my school uses this book. .. Wanna learn Calculus? STAY AWAY FROM Stewarts calulus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for beginners","review":"I am a reader from Czech Republic and I have to state that I have never seen a nicer book about calculus for beginners. I wish all unhappy people about this book would see books students in eastern European countrees are using. If somebody does not understand this book he should review his ability to learn mathematics.This book is written as stated above for beginners, who want quickly learn calculus without worring about proofs and theoretical background of calculus. You can find many color pictures of geometrical representation of calculus stuff, which can be sometimes quite helpful. My only complain is about exercices and review sections etc. I think it should be reduced, because some of them are really dummy. But ok, maybe it is too subjective.Please, excuse my english."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Stinks","review":"Again I will say that James Stewart should not be writing calculus textbooks. His book stinks. All it has is a bunch of theroems that are not throughly explained. He has no clear and concise examples to illustrate how the theroems apply to calculus.There are way better calculus textbooks than this one. This is one of the most poorly written calculus textbooks on the teaching market. This book should not even be considered for a learning tool for calculus.In order for this book to be as good as the other calculus textbooks, HE MUST give plenty examples in doing calculus problems on EVERY section. He must make sure that each example is concise and clear with NO mathematical steps skipped.As long as James Stewart's calculus textbook keeps taking shortcuts in illustrating the concepts and methodology of calculus, it will always be a low quality calculus textbook. That is plain and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical Approach","review":"I used this book for Multivariate Calculus only, but I found it to be clearly worded and very helpful. The exercises I found to be complete. Now, as I am tutoring Calc I and II, I find that another strength of the book is its classical approach, which I appreciate greatly. The author never once leaves a topic solely to the technology, but tells the student the theory behind the technology. That way, the student can instantly recognize whether an answer the computer gives him is correct or not.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"This is the best introductory calculus text on the market. If you are one of those who find this text to be sub par, there is not a calculus text in the known universe that will be to your liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed feelings","review":"I took two consecutive 1st year 1-semester calculus courses and I used this book for both. I have mixed feelings about it, because I have been lucky to be taught by good professors who gave good lectures, so I used my class notes. However, I inevitably missed a few lectures, and had to study from the book. A terrifying experience. Was it my fault, being not used to the author's style ? Anyway, I think that one example per case is not enough, and stuying the series chapter was difficult. The author definitely and absolutely fails to emphasise what is important, he writes just as much about some obscure application than about the main points of the principle. There are simply not enough examples for the important concepts. Also, there is some theory, confusing most students, without being enough for a mathematics major. I just started using Calculus: One and Several Variables by Salas/ Hille/ Etgen. I wish I had it in 1st year. Anyway, even 2 stars is generous for Stewart's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say No","review":"My professor made us buy this book this year. It has been a waste. I can't understand the writing and we have found lots of mistakes in the answers. If your professor asks you to buy this book, I suggest getting the class together and telling your teacher \\"No.\\" There have got to be better calculus books out there. Ask your professor to find a book that at least has correct answers in the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY DRY TEXTBOOK - AND I KNOW THE OTHERS TOO!","review":"Don't waste your time with this book folks. Not only is it the dryest textbook I've had the displeasure of using, it gives the learning student a lack of example problems that would facilitate learning. This is clearly one of the worst calculus books ever to be published. Don't waste your money on this textbook. The greatest textbook I could recommend to you, dear reader, is Howard Anton's Calculus with Analytic Geometry. It is a University textbook that is far superior to Stewart's. It is eveything that Stewart's book isn't. I have used both of these books in a University environment. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Math Book I Ever Had","review":"I can't believe that this book has any positive reviews at Amazon.com. Who wrote them? The author's mother? This author knows nothing about how students learn calculus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak In Calculus Theory","review":"I don't expect a beginning level calculus text to have all the rigor necessary to develop calculus with precision. I do expect, however, that the author of such a text be honest and tell students that the mathematical precision necessary for the course is only appropriate at higher level courses. What bothers me greatly about this text is that it purports to be rigorous, complete, and precise. I am writing this review to tell you that it is not! It has many problems in theory, especially in the third semester. Here is one example of the sloppiness in the text. The text claims that a \\"parametric curve\\" is a set of points in the coordinate plane. This is not correct. This is the definition of a \\"graph.\\" A parametric curve is supposed to be defined as a set of points in the coordinate plane TOGETHER with a set of parametric equations that generate the points."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Recommended","review":"This book is not recommended for students who need clear simple writing. I really bugs me that teachers are the ones who choose textbooks. They often seem to choose a high-toned book like this. It is clearly written for teachers, NOT for students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"I could write a book about my bad experiences with this text. Thank goodness I had a good teacher because the book did not help me at all. Also, a warning to other students.

I finally went and bought another calculus book that was easier to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome calculus book","review":"You get Calculus I, II, III all in one book. The exercises are very challenging. No wonder it is widely used in major colleges and high schools with AP Calculus AB/BC and Multivariable Calculus. As a teacher, this textbook is always my first choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Luck - wear a back brace!","review":"The information is incomplete. Stewart goes out of his way to make calculus as confusing as possible. Concepts are not fully explained. Some proofs are incomplete. I had to refer to an old textbook from the clearence rack ... written by Sokowski to learn the concepts. The author does an exceptionally poor job of explaining derivatives and integrals of exponential functions.Book weighs a ton!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Understand The Explanations","review":"I tried reading this book, but I simply cannot understand the author's explanations.

I took precalculus last semester and got a B. This semester I have the same professor and I am getting a D. The only difference in the two courses is that in precalculus I had a book that was written with clear explanations and examples. Stewart's Calculus book just doesn't help me. I just don't believe that Mr. Stewart has ever taught real students. His examples seem to be written for other professors, not for students like me. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I adopted this book for my college calculus class because it is supposed to be widely used in colleges. I am VERY disappointed in the organzation and presentation. Now, I am stuck with this book and I am not happy about it. What makes me angry is that a bad book increases my work load. I have to find additional material and exercises for my students and I have to spend so much more time explaining things. If you are considering adopting this book, I suggest you show it to your students and ask them if they find the explantions helpful. I strongly suspect that they will tell you they don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult Book","review":"I took calculus from this book. I am an engineering student. The book did not help me in my engineering classes. To get help, I had to go to the library and check out other calculus books that had more practical, engineering examples. I would not recommend this book to a student who wants to know how calculus is used in engineering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please avoid this book!!!","review":"This book tends to complicate the subjects compare to other calculus book. For Calculus I or II, it might be bearable. But the mulivariable part of this book is the WORST ever. It makes the theorem extremely difficult to understand. Frequently, the problems given are extremely hard and long (3 - 4 pages of work), such as verifying the Stokes' theorem. And it DOESN'T have the solution in the back. (odd nor even problems) If you want to challenge yourself on those problems, go on. But if you are a regular student who just need to get an A or B in the course, stay away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult if you're new to calculus","review":"I recently completed the 3 quarter freshman calc sequence at Ohio State University with this book. Having not had calculus before, I found the book quite difficult throughout. Stewart would do well to improve the introduction of fundamental concepts, like the limit, chain rule and integration by parts; the explanations are almost invariably inadequate. This book is useless for the average person, and consistently frustrating for anyone motivated enough to wade through the text. My advice for anyone without prior calculus experience who's using this book is to also get the solutions manual and study guide, they can help to explain what is left unclear by this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books","review":"Too conceptual..the book does not rely on enough examples. Problem sets not like the examples worked out at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but no calculus book is!","review":"I'll start of by saying what is bad about the book. When introducing a topic, they use a lot of numbers instead of words. Not everyone can follow numbers but graphs and examples that further illustrate the topic would be very helpful. Also, on occassion the book skips a step or two when explaining a point. However unless you have absolutely no calculus experience it shouldn't be too harmful. There are nice illustrations in this book that are helpful. Also there are many examples to help you. Another nice feature is that you can get an additional study guide and answer book to accompany this one. Another nice feature is that it doesn't introduce strange topics too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful,apocalyptic,surreal","review":"Stephen Tunney takes his surreal art and transfers it from canvas to type in FLAN. The atmosphere and dialogue is extremely abstract and full of energy. In a few words, the book is an absolute pleasure to read. One could get quite esoteric and pseudo-intelligent about what the author is \\"trying\\" to say, but simply put it is a surreal rollercoaster ride. I highly recommend this book to a certain genera of readers. FLAN is definitely not for everyone. I have given the book to a few friends who put it down after a few chapters. However, the individuals that I gave the book to that enjoyed it, fell in love with it. If you enjoy surreal,random,dark humor or drama I can promise you that you will love this novel. Bravo Stephen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exhausting, overwhelming read that is also fascinating and disturbing. But only for those with cast-iron stomachs...","review":"When the character Flan wakes up one morning to a world on fire, he grabs his burning toupee, his fish Ginger Kang Kang, and sets forth to be reunited with his girlfriend. On their Candide-like journey, they witness mutilated, burnt, pus-and-fly-egg-filled bodies, freakish anthropomorphic creatures and cannibalism. As participants, Ginger gobbles the brains of enemies, Flan cuts throats and strangles others who get in his way, while (at one point), Jesus wonders about performing miracles with dismembered limbs.An exhausting, overwhelming read, 'Flan' is also fascinating and disturbing fiction. It is as though reality had been replaced by a vision that Bosch and Dali would have been proud of. A reader's warning: I think it is fair to say this is really only for those readers with cast-iron stomachs and an inherent interest in the bizarre and freakish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking poor quality","review":"They say you can't judge a book by its cover; well that was never truer than here. The cover art looks enticing, and the actual book is full of great historical photographs--which would be wonderful if they were of even passable image quality. They're not. Each and every one looks like a low-res, amateur scan from an old newspaper--for all I know, that's what they are. Black and white, of course, not a single one is color--what a crime, documenting this most colorful of celebrations. Blurry, low-contrast, horrible resolution, and most are tiny to boot. This wouldn't even have been acceptable back in 1977, when the book was originally published. For this day and age, it's inexcusable--a waste of time and money.

The diet and exercise advice are consistent, by and large, with what all of us have heard before, with the exception of recommendations for the eating of undercooked red meat and poultry. The advice on a man retaining his fluids ruined what had been a wonderful relationship between me and my boyfriend. He belives most self-help books and bought into the fluid retention without question. The whole notion of retaining a man's fluids to enhance their health and longevity is reckless and clearly a roadmap to ruin an otherwise great relationship. The book is filled with utter nonsense and should be read by those who are able to think for themselves so that they do not ruin relationships.

Each year is given a great amount of space as well as clear black and white photos (yes, no color here) of exteriors, interiors, close-ups, etc. The level of detail the author puts into each description is incredible. This book is ideal for Cadillac aficionados who love the 1960's era. I own a '60 Coupe and a '64 convertible, so naturally I loved the focus on this particular decade and I enjoyed reading about the subtle differences between years and across models. The original shop manuals or sales brochures simply do not provide this sort of information. Most Cadillac books focus on the 40's or 50's, so this one is a real gem if you love the 60's car lines as I do.If you are only a moderate Cadillac fan, I would suggest broader topic books that cover earlier years as well. Keep the faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Caddy book...the best.","review":"This is one of the best Cadillac books I own, and I own around 15. Excellent details and pictures.

It tastes like mineral water with chocolate syrup.The pros:No saltNo caloriesThe cons:Little flavor, I mean..fudge? No. I don't even think the flavor is heavy enough for me to use it as a mixer with vodka, which is how I usually dispose of my least-loved diet sodas.No caffeine (though I could see how for some that might be a plus?)If you want chocolate, it's seriously worth it to get 70% or higher dark chocolate and quench your craving. Sometimes I eat a couple of my daughter's M&Ms; and I want to turn to the bag like some sort of crazy ravenous chocolate eating beast. But. If I go to the kitchen and eat a square of dark chocolate, all that ends. It's done, you know? It's just over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird, but tasty!","review":"I was at Central Market looking for an energy drink when I came upon several six-packs of Canfield's sodas (Chocolate Fudge, Swiss Creme, and Chocolate Cherry). Feeling adventurous, and knowing that since the sodas are calorie-free I really had nothing to lose, I bought one of each. I had heard horror stories about them mixed in with raving accounts of them, and I wanted to see for myself just how bad (or good) they were.This is the first one I tried. I just don't understand anyone calling it \\"the most terrible thing I've ever tasted;\\" the chocolate flavor is light, almost subtle. The best way to describe it is \\"carbonated Yoo-Hoo.\\" I hear it tastes especially good with a splash of milk or soymilk...I might give that a shot. Even if you can't agree that it's tasty, you at least gotta concede that it's *unique*."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like Thesis","review":"Thomas Cochrane must be a fasinating person, but you will not discover it from this book. It is deadly dry--just like a thesis. The man does not live and leap from these pages. The author gives us a recitation of his accomplishments but not any detail behind the man. He does not come across as a living, human. I have a feeling that the author did not do a very good job researching this man--surely there are diaries from his wife Kitty or Cochrane, himself, that can give us insight into how he thought. I am still looking for a good biography on this complex man."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much of some, not enough of the other","review":"This biography makes too much of the \\"enemies\\" that Cochrane made in his career, and how they brought him down. But frankly, I was left thinking that like many heroes throughout the ages, he too had feet of clay - fabulous at sea, and an idiot on land, (and undoubtably a crook too).As the title of the book is the \\"life and exploits of a fighting captain\\" I would have appreciated more of the exploits (and flavour) of his expeditions than were laid out.However, it did introduce me to someone besides Nelson (and his Captains etc) who was lionized (then forgotten at home) and who may be more famous today in Chile and Brazil than England.Worth the read, but don't expect too much depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I only paid $5 for it.....","review":"Basically a recital of accomplishments and events, with next to no detail about most of them.

Much has changed since I retired in 1986, and to see the new techniques and training aids that are out there to test the mettle of our fighting men and women, is most interesting. It is reassuring to know that we ARE the cutting edge in stealth, be it ground, sea, or air, materiel, or physical. Well documented and narrated. This training and the personnel who volunteer for this rigorous and demanding training are a tribute to the many who have given their lives to defend and support this great nation against any and all enemies, past, present,and into the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite of my son and his fellow cadets","review":"Fantasic price.

Gerald Nachman, an old college classmate of mine, is at or near that age. The result is a strong book that isn't based on others' recollections, but is based on Nachman's own experiences. Certainly he verified some facts by using normal research and reference tools, but Gerry's memories here are his own. They're vivid, they're succinct, and they're just wonderful. Raised on Radio is a gem, not because my friend wrote it, but because its title is truthful, thus the stories inside the book are truthful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Episodic and discontinuous","review":"There's disappointingly little narrative or historical continuity to tie together the anecdotes that make up \\"Raised on Radio\\". If you have a room in your house where you read for only five minutes a day, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a real history (or even a continuous memoire) of an important cultural phenomenon, look elsewhere. On a story-by-story basis, it's often a delight, but it's flawed by those errors cited by others and by an amazing editing gaff in which Adlai Stevenson is cited as a 1960 presidential candidate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pricey for what you get, poor picture quality","review":"Very disappointed in the picture quality, even after using an HDMI cable.Colors very bland and washed out, picture not very clear.

It's a superb film but the MGM disc, which came out in 1998, does not hold up on high-definition TVs. It shows up the poor resolution of the digital mastering, and it is non-anamorphic, which degrades the image further. Some scenes are terribly noisy, others simply unstable. This is a film that seriously needs a new, remastered edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Drama","review":"Excellent drama; Michael Manns dark, brooding photographyalong with an outstanding sound track pairs well with the entire cast, who are also excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thief with James Caan","review":"This is a very good movie because of James Caan's portrayal of an ex convict master thief. This is the best thingI've seen Caan do other than Godfather. Tuesday Weld is also very good as his woman. Caan comes across genuinelytough here, and perhaps that's because he is, being a martial arts black belt. It's terrific entertainment, a great crime drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Caan hauntingly portrays a one-day-at-a-time ex-con.","review":"James Caan's portrayal of the ex-con jewel thief in this movie is very powerful. Strikingly breaking life down to one home made collage carried in his wallet! Great character roles for James Belushi and Willie Nelson, combined with Tangerine Dream's powerful sound track give this movie even more depth. Michael Mann's use of reflection and off center lighting entwine with the music and actors to yield a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mann's First Feature Showed His Style","review":"The man who gave us TV's Miami Vice and the Movies' opus 'Heat' cuts his teeth in 'Thief'.The story of a master thief, who wants to make one last score and live a respectable and peaceful life with his woman and new son, but gets pulled in by the mob; where he must put everyting on the line for his own survival.In watching the movie, I felt like I was watching a prequel to the movie 'Heat', where James Caan was playing the Robert DeNiro character at an earlier age.The visual style and music add to a hypnotic ride through an obvious 'no-one's going to win' journey, but grips the viewer to ride it out.Mann has always had his own style (love it or hate it), but diffently it is his own.If you loved 'Heat'... get the 'Thief'"},{"rating":"2","title":"MANN'S FIRST AND HIS BEST","review":"For a first-time film effort, Thief is an instant classic and a benchmark work in the storied career of Michael Mann. Long before his Miami Vice fame, Mann made this compelling film noir about a thief trying to go straight and live the life of his dreams. James Caan turns in a performance that raises his level of brilliance that much further. Indeed, the entire cast is excellent. Of note, Tuesday Weld's performance as the woman Caan's character covents as part of his goal for a better life is equally compelling. Though Mann's re-explored this territory in Heat, that work never strikes the level of intimacy with the audience that Thief does. A truly great American film."},{"rating":"2","title":"You want to buy a car come see me, if not get the F*** off mine !!!!!!!!!","review":"What more can I say BUY THIS MOVIE.This is HEAT one.Like some people say the movie starts off slow.

Everytime i thought that there was going to be a little spark of warmth or humanity in the lead character, he goes back to being the one-dimensional tough guy. When towards the end, when the lead (James Caan) is sending his wife (Tuesday Welds) away with their adopted baby son that they have, he gives her $410,000 dollars to take with her. Then I started thinking, well here is his human caring side.Nope, not to be, he then goes ahead and instructs his wife, who he is kicking out, that she has to pay the guy he is sending to be her driver on this journey $20,000 on the first month, $25,000 on the second month, $30.000 on the third month, etc. How long is $410,000 going to last if she has to keep paying this guy incrementally larger amounts?That's when I said, \\"Forget this guy, he's damaged goods.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"STYLISH STOOPIDNESS","review":"James Cann is an adult, not a kid, in the 1980s, not 1930s, who thinks he can do just one job for the mafia and then quit, with no trouble from the mafia!!!!Even back in the 1930s, with LITTLE CAESER, Douglas Fairbanks Jr couldn't just quit the mob.There are some nice gore, violent, scenes, especially for the stupid and stylish climax in which James Cann practically goes out his way to screw himself over before the mafia can screw him over! That's how dumb this movie is---Cann at the climax ruins his life in order to get revenge on the mafia!

It has a great cast, so I purchased the DVD. First, it is not worth the price since the sound is NOTHING better than the less expensive VHS format; and the difference in picture quality is nothing to brag about either.It is a very slow at the beginning, and seems disjointed. We were not able to watch the movie past 30 minutes as it just is too boring during the first 30 minutes.Purchasing this DVD was a WASTE OF GOOD MONEY. I'm now into DVD rentals - if it is good,then I will purchase the DVD for the library.

The image is soft, and when something moves fast it is blurry. The end contains some sped up shots, where the sound is out of sync! Add all this to the fact that the DVD says Michael Mann supervised the transfer and you have one big \\"huh???\\" The commentary is also pretty bad. James Caan does most of the talking, and they hardly ever discuss the film specifically. It's more stories about the different thieves they had in the movie than the actual film itself, which is a shame. If you can, track down the VHS put out by MGM 10 years ago. The print is dark, grainy, and electric!

The difference was amazing! The tomato plants we grew in our Earth Box gave us great yields! As an experiment we also planted tomatoes and peppers in various containers and in our raised-bed organic garden. With the exception of our tomatillos, all the other plants did very poorly.I love its portability and the fact that it maximizes the use of a small amount of space. Sunny spots in the yard that would be too small for a raised bed are perfect for the Earth Box. I also love the fact that fertilizer, etc. is included and measured out for you. After far too many years of attempting to test and amend my soil, I'm very happy that that work has been done for me.We'll be buying at least one more Earth Box so that we can grow peppers this year too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Container Gardening","review":"Very easy to assemble. Mobility optional - wheels or no wheels. I chose the mobility with the wheels in case I needed better sun exposure or not.

The plants grew nicely and produced a goodamount of vegetables, however, toward the end of the summer the cucumbers needed to be filled with water twice a day. Even then, the plants looked poor and eventually died. I thought they had gotten some kind of disease so this spring, I decided to takeout all of the old soil and replace it with new. When I emptied the box, I could see why I had to water it so much at the end of thesummer. There were several cracks in the bottom of the box so the water was just running right out of the box but I thoughtthat it was just running out of the overfill hole. I emptied the other box and found that there were a few small crack in the plastic bottom of this box also. I am very disappointed that after just one season, these Earth Boxes are not useable.

I've bought two more Earthbox's and absolutely love them.You can plant everything from vegetables, to flowers....I think the secret is the watering system.

First of all, I've set up a handful of different tents and I found this one to be the most difficult to work with. The poles just don't want to slide through the holes and constantly were getting snagged. The poles also felt pretty cheaply made for a 30$ tent(not saying 30$ is an expensive tent but I've used cheaper tents which imo had sturdier/better made poles). Anyways, after setting up the tent in my living room(test setup), I found that there was a dime sized hole in the bottom tarp of the tent, and 2 of the seams by the holding pins already had dime sized rips. Also, fitting 3 people in this tent is laughable. I am 5'11 and can barely lay down in the tent, maybe 3 children could fit in this tent, but definitely not 3 adults.

So when I just need to read the New Testament I reach out for this Bible. I read it for spiritual growth and daily inspiration. The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because my Bible's pages are starting to become yellow, which most probably means that its paper is acidic.

Can I just enjoy the free spirit of these kids, the travel locations and the great surfing without all the Christian propaganda? I guess some church must have heavily funded the movie so they had no choice, but it leaves a bad taste in the mouth. This movie is trying to convert people to Christianity instead of just showing the joy of youth and surfing as it should.

The \\"you need the Lord\\" message is subtle for a while and the surfing footage pretty good, but as the movie progress the intended message becomes too much to tolerate.

I've used them for a year now, and they do not work, and they never have. At first I thought it was because they were not properly adjusted, but I can safely say now that it does not matter how you adjust them - they still don't work. Sometimes they'll work for a few days, but then you come into the office to find that everything plugged into the slave receptacles is being turned on and off intermittently. The only way to prevent the fault is to use only the master receptacles, but even that doesn't guarantee proper function - again, the power is often intermittent. If I had only one, I would suspect a bad unit. Since I have two and neither does what it is supposed to, I have to suppose that they are all either poorly designed and/or poorly made. I am learning to expect both when it comes to products coming from China. An utter waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart strip LCG3 Surge Protector","review":"This product is not entirely \\"user friendly\\".

I hooked one to my computer system and I can't believe how may electrical items I had hooked up until I installed this strip. Now when I power down my computer, the Smart Strip will turn off my monitor, my sub woofer/speaker system, my external heard drive, my printer and wireless print server, my shredder and electric pencil sharpener. That's 7 items that were drawing power 24/7. Now no power is being used during the overnight or periods when I am out of town. According to the manufacture and the lady on Oprah, electrical items that are plugged in will draw power even with off. This apparently blocks \\"phantom power\\" from being used. I look forward to seeing how much money I will save on my power bill each month with these two Smart Strips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well","review":"I have one for my TV and another for my computer. Easy to set up. There is a master outlet that controls a series of switched outlets. So, for example if my computer is in the master outlet and is on, the printers, scanner, extra monitors plugged into the switched outlets become live. Once I shut down my computer, all those peripherals turn off. What could be easier than that to reduce trickle energy usage? There are also 3 \\"always on\\" outlets that you can use to bypass the master outlet.

I have it tied with my entertainment center. When I turn the power off to my surround sound, this unit senses the drop in power consumption from the surround sound and kills power to my tv, vcr, dvd player, dvd recorder,playstation, and a/v diverter. When I hit the button on the remote to turn the surround sound back on, everything comes back to life!Normally when you turn the switch off on these devices (tv, dvd player etc.) they still draw \\"standby power\\".

A little disappointed about that, but I still would recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"We bought this to use with our entertainment system and were shocked when we got our electric bill a month later- it was down $15! Each month we are saving $ and within 2 months had already made the cost of the strip back. We plugged in our HDTV to the control unit outlet, the cable box & wireless router in the outlets that stay on all the time, and then we have our Wii, Xbox, blu ray player, network storage device & printer plugged into the other outlets that are controlled by the TV.

I've convinced everyone in my family to buy one- we are that impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea","review":"This does just as it says. In my case, my surround sound system stopped responding to remote controls (it's not the remote itself; I've tried several).

The first time or two they would work fine and I thought that everything was ok, but after leaving the room for a while, they would magically be back on when I returned. I have my HDTV plugged into the outlet, and the power it is using when on should dwarf the power it uses while off, so there's no reason this power strip shouldn't work. Either a lot of the adjusting screws don't work, or this is a really bad power saving strip.Can't recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adjustment hasn't worked","review":"The power strip has a screw on the side of it that is supposed to allow you to dial in the sensitivity of the 'shut everything' feature...that has never worked for our strip.

When the preamp is powered on, the tuner and power amp automatically come on. Neither unit would respond through this \\"Smart Strip.\\" Rotating the trigger level adjustment screw on the side did not make a difference. I suppose I could have experimented with different loads such as light bulbs but I didn't want to waste any more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 14 months :(","review":"It stopped working after about 14 months. The devices plugged in to the auto-switched ports begin to randomly turned off and on for no reason. It does not matter if I'm in the middle of using the computer or not. Adjusting the sensitivity makes no difference. It's possible that I am unlucky enough to receive a short-lived model, so YMMV.Anyway, these strips are wonderful at keeping the the electricity bill low, but I can accomplish the same by manually switching off the surge protector after shutdown the computer. I would not want to gamble away another $35-$40 just to have it stop working less than 2 years later, when a normal $20 surge protector can last many more years.So 2 stars for the effort and the thought behind this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not sensitive enough...","review":"I'm very unhappy with this device, it must be designed for power sucking devices because it is not sensitive enough for any of my devices to turn it on.I've adjusted the sensitivity dial to no avail.It's a real bummer, I was hoping that it would end up saving me electricity.I wish they'd specify what the turn on current/load is needed for this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use in home office","review":"Using this thing in our home office was a royal pain. More than half of the outlets automatically cut off power at intervals, which is a problem if you have a laptop with old batteries or a desktop. It's also a problem if you're using lights that are plugged in or a router. All in all, this was not a smart purchase for us for our home office. I'm all about saving energy but don't want my internet access sporadically cut off to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and Poorly Developed Product","review":"After receiving this product it failed within 3 days. This is the second one that failed. I contacted Joe Coons of their customer service and they never resolved the problem with no offer or resolution. They merely apologize and nothing further. The product clicks, buzzes and then turns off completely and doesn't resume power even with resets. Save your money and buy a proven product or UPS. This is not worth the investment or effort to try to resolve. I have filed a complaint with the BBB to let them know these jokers don;t provide support. I was unfortunate to deal with this issue and hopefully this helps others to see what a poorly designed product this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised.","review":"Perfect ! I like to watch TV while I go to bed and this smart power strip makes sure that the power is off to my DVD player, WD media player and Netgear Widi receiver. I just put my TV on sleep mode and watch without worrying about falling asleep. It is reassuring to know that the power strip will have everything powered off when I awake.Also, everything has a standby mode light which seems to be waste of electricity, why must it be on standby mode when my TV is off? doesn't make sense!Two things that need to be improved are that the LCG3 cord it a bit too short for my purpose and I wish there was a sliding cover for the unused outlets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adjustment just too touchy","review":"I bought this strip to control a fan unit placed on top of my A/V receiver. Since my Onkyo NR717 doesn't have a switched outlet, I wanted a way to turn on the cooling fans when the receiver was turned on. In my case, I could not find a sensitivity setting that would reliably sense when the receiver turned on AND would sense when it was turned off. If I set the strip to detect the turn-on current, the fanunit would come on as predicted. However, at this setting, when the receiver was turned off, the strip was unable to detect that. The controlled outlets stayed on. If I backed off the adjustment just a little, the strip wouldn't detect the power-on current. I just couldn't find a setting that would turn on and turn off the controlled outlets.I'm not doubting the strip can work as advertised. I just think my receiver doesn't have that much of a current draw between the idle and on states."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great at first","review":"At first I loved having this strip.

I have a PC with two monitors, two printers and assorted other peripherals. I have the PC plugged into the main outlet, so when I power down the PC everything else goes off. It worked great for a week. But now when I shut down the computer everything seems to shut down but, then all of the peripherals start cycling on and off, on and off. So now I shut the strip down manually using the toggle switch after the PC shuts down.Disappointing.I have an electric heater plugged into a different outlet, thought there might be some power surge issue but I have been turning off the heater prior to turning off the PC and it makes no difference.I don't think there is anything with my PC that would be causing this, so I can only conclude that the power strip isn't so smart after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but poor quality","review":"Nice idea. Overpriced for what it is. Didn't last very long. Broke after less than one year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Smart","review":"For the most part, I am very happy with this product. The testing that I have completed thus far had this power strip connected to a laptop docking station. This unit does indeed save energy, but the docking station power draw is so small that it is difficult to set the on/off adjustment so that the controlled outlets remain on when the laptop is on and off when the laptop is off. I am currently testing it on a desktop machine, and am having no such difficulties. All in all, it works as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this one","review":"Sorry to report we threw this unit out three months after installation. It was connected to our computer and worked fine until one day it would not turn on despite all efforts. We removed, reset, plugged elswhere it just died.

I primarily use them around my computer for turning off monitors, desk lamp, printer, and speakers when I shut down my computer.The biggest drawback is that IT SHOULD NOT BE USED WITH A PLAYSTATION.

I would not recommend using this for high end (sensitive) electronics."},{"rating":"1","title":"They die","review":"I have had two of these. The first died after about a month. The second died after about a year. They both died the same way. They just stop switching off the power to the controlled devices. They still work as regular power strips.

One in my office for the computer, speakers, shredder, lamps, etc. Another in the living room for the media center. At first I was enamoured by the hype of all the electricity I must be saving. Slowly but surely the sensitivity slipped more and more frequently and I found components weren't shutting down as they should. Worse yet, you'd have to unplug the component after first repeatedly turing on and off the lead. I hate climbing behind my electronics. Hate it. This is a clever idea but it's got kinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died in 3month","review":"Like other reviewers, mine die after 3 months. Now it's just 1 expensive power surge protector.

Hopefully someone will market a smart power strip that actually works, but I found this one to be completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as advertised","review":"It would have been nice if this would have worked as it's supposed to. I wanted to primarily use it so the subwoofer would turn off when the TV is turned off. I was also trying to use it on 2 powered speakers and 2 wireless game adapters.

It's going back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart Strip LCG3 10 outlet auto switch","review":"The concept is a good one and the unit is well constructed.

I had read about people plugging the tower portion of their computers into the control and then having the monitor, speakers, and other accessories in the switching plugs and then adjusting the strip to turn off the accessories when the computer went into sleep mode. I never even had to adjust mine, I just plugged them in and it works perfectly. I couldn't be more happy.So far, zero drawbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for prime time","review":"I thought the idea of saving energy with the smart strip worth investing in. After two years the strip starting generating a loud buzzing sound whenever I turned on my computer, which only increased to the point where the device was not usablethe second problem, not as critical, was that setting the strip's power level to enable auto shut off was quite tricky and required numerous adjustments over quite a period of timeif the technology and reliability improves I'm all for it, but I can't recommend it now. After two years' use I wonder if there was any overall energy saving, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another unfortunate case","review":"Add me to the list of people who now just have a regular surge protector. This product worked great while it worked. Three weeks after I purchased it (and three weeks of it working perfectly) it suddenly started messing up. At first, it would take time to shut off the switched outlets. After two days of that, it just quit shutting off the switched outlets completely.Nothing happened when adjusting the sensitivity knob. The switched outlets do reset if you turn the device off then back on, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having any always-on plugs. I just processed the return and will be sending this product back tomorrow. I cannot recommend this product at this time.

This surge protector did not function at all in any of our outlets at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless piece","review":"This strip is probably the most useless thing I have ever purchased through Amazon.The basic concept is that you have one outlet as the trigger one and it then starts up the rest. However, that's not quite how it works. I have several plugs that don't come on regardless of whether or not the activating plug is on.I found that the only reliable plugs on this strip are the hot ones.

It worked pretty good for about a month and nothing since then (its been about 6 months since purchasing). I've adjusted it about a dozen times from max to min (a little at a time like the instructions say) but in the morning the monitor, printer and speakers are still on. I do have it all plugged in correctly (trust me - I'm more than qualified when it comes to electricity).Knowing what i know now, I wouldn't get one of these kind of power strips (had an APC brand do the same thing to me about a year ago) but would have got a plug strip with remote off switch so I could positively turn the whole mess off at night.On the good side, the plug layout is well thought out and works well for those clunky transformer plugs.2 stars because while it's a nice plug strip the power sensing auto-off does not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is a replacement for one damaged by a water leak.

Normally can have both TV and DVD player on and manually change source on TV to HDMI when ready to do so.

I picked it over a lesser-priced brand because it had a heavy weight feel to it, which made me think it would be long lasting and of higher quality. I used it about 20 times. I noticed today that there is a piece of teflon that has chipped off - and so I scratched at that area with my fingernail to find that the rest is going to easily chip off now as well. The only utensil that I used on it was a teflon-safe plastic spatula, and as a cheap-skate, I take good care of my stuff- because I don't want to replace it lol. Anyway, I threw the chipped thing in the garbage and will buy a different brand. I really expected this pan to last for years like my other (unknown branded) non stick baking pans.Does really cook evenly though!

It is just straight down to business. Most books have a few adjectives or a last a basic descriptions of the characters and what they look like, this book does not.

We had to move it from a upstairs laundry room to main floor laundry room in our new house, thank god it was on the main floor! Those washers are HEAVY! If you have tight spaces where you can't get more than 2 people to help lift these are the only solution. I would highly recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoulder Dolly makes the impossible possible","review":"This product is amazing! My husband and I used the shoulder dolly to lift a 350-pound television and carry up stairs to our 2nd-floor apartment. The carrying strap is adjustable, allowing you to lift anything as long as a couch to as short as a portable a/c unit. It allows you to carry large, awkward loads easily. The only downside to this product is that the shoulder harness is not adjustable to fit your body, so it made it a little difficult to keep the harness in place while carrying smaller objects on stairs. Regardless, we were able to move all of our belongings into our upstairs apartment by ourselves and were not sore at ALL afterwards.NOTE: If you plan to use this on a regular basis, you might want to check out the Pro Lift Unit on their website: http://www.shoulderdolly.com/pro_lift.htmlIt appears to be fully adjustable and would make a big difference if you have a smaller frame."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"It really works, takes a little bit of adjusting to get the straps where you need them, but once you do it is great. My daughter was a doubter and just wanted to move the chair by carrying it, I made her put the Shoulder Dolly on and she couldn't believe how well it worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"The Shoulder Dolly is perfect for moving furniture up and down stairs. The weight of the item is carried on the shoulders and legs with your hands free to stabilize. It does take time to get the strap properly configured under whatever you are carrying. The one negative mark would be the lack of padding on the shoulder strap. I had it painfully ride up around my neck when picking up a china hutch. A hand towel worked for future lifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hazardous!","review":"This item made moving a dangerous proposition for us; setting items down was cumbersome and hurt your back, and items tended to shift on the lifting cable.

Moved heavy sofa-beds, washers, and solid wood desks, up and down stairs and all with minimal effort over the course of 2 days. All the weight gets distributed to your shoulders, while your hands basically stabilize it on the strap between the two movers. The best thing about this moving system is that you have enough ground clearance to move it up a stairs. The only issues that I have is that they could definately use a little bit of padding in the shoulder area. But for the 30 dollars i spent, that is really nitpicking.It's the best money i've spent. Saved hundreds in chiropractic visits probably!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Works","review":"Bought this based on the other reviews. Surprised to find that it actually works as advertised. Moved a 300 lb elliptical machine out of the garage, around the back of the house, down stairs, through the basement, and into the exercise room with this and 3 people. My wife was positive the machine would remain in the garage forever.Lost one star for the shortness of the main carrying strap - for my purpose at least. Wanted to carry the machine the long way, but the strap was too short. That's why we needed the additional people - to balance the machine while carrying it the short way. To be fair, we would have needed the others on the stairs anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works GREAT!!!","review":"I have a 200 gallon fish tank that is 340 pounds(7 foot x 2 foot x 2 foot) without a drop of water.

Within two weeks I had to move an old coke machine out of a warehouse to an open area where we could pick it up with a fork lift. With my wife on one side and me on the other, we moved it much easier that than rocking it back and forth for the same distance. It doesn't reduce the weight but it does allow you to use large muscle groups to move that weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"believe it or not this actually works","review":"I am not a professional product rater such as appears on Amazon so much (are they paid by companies to do this?), just a regular person. I am also getting older and find it harder to move heavier or bulkier items.

We purchased a heavy one-piece bathroom vanity with an attached granite top. The delivery men left it in our kitchen (as they do curb-side delivery but it was raining outside and were nice enough to bring it inside for me....they used forearm straps). So it was our task to somehow carry it from our kitchen to the bathroom...approximately 50' give or take. There would have been no possibility of us moving it a foot by ourselves without these straps. I'm only 100 lbs and under 5' tall, so you can only imagine the disadvantage.

Didn't work at all for these: it's simply not the appropriate tool for irregularly shaped objects. To be fair, I also tested it on a few furniture items indoors and that was better (than flagstone fiasco). But it's still not the miraculous tool it's portrayed to be. Even with furniture, you're probably better off lifting stuff conventionally (legs and arms!) or using a dolly(ies) with wheels, because it's awkward trying to use this thing. I think it could be very dangerous if used by 'non-experts' (i.e., you and me), which ironically is the target market for the shoulder dolly."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCAM!!!","review":"Who are these people leaving these 4 and 5-star reviews? This item is a joke and the biggest pain in the you-know-what ever! First of all, the shoulder straps are not adjustable, so they hang loosely on most normal-size people. Secondly, it takes a long time just to adjust everything, so by the time you're done, someone else probably could have moved the item where you needed it by the time you'd be ready. Lastly, it only really works walking straight lines because turning corners will create slack in the line. So, yeah...don't buy this!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost but not quite","review":"The concept is good, but execution is poor.

The item is extremely heavy and hard to carry due to the fact the weight is so oddly distributed - and to make matters worse I could not fit the organ through the house. The shoulder dolly enabled me and one other person (both average males) to carry the organ out of my house, completely around the row of townhouses, up a hill, and in the backdoor. I feel this contraption is so efficient that in the future if I need to move something heavy, I could even have my girlfriend assist me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back Saver","review":"We have used this system to move several stoves and refrigerators out of mobile homes and it is fantastic.

Worked great. Also moved all our furniture. We didn't have it for the move out but bought it before we moved back in and the different was huge. Makes going around corners or up and down stairs much easier.I give it only 4 stars because for the price the shoulder straps should be padded. It should also have clips or some mechanism to secure the extra strap so it is not a tripping hazard.When going up and down stairs make sure you get the item lifted as high as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help, but somewhat limited","review":"The shoulder dolly is definitely a bonus when moving heavy furniture. The problem is moving up and down stairs. It was on the verge of being dangerous moving heavy objects up or down the stairs because there is not enough clearance for your legs. Therefore, the person higher up on the stairs has to straddle the object being carried which is difficult since there isn't much room to do so. We tried lifting the objects higher, but the person lower on the stairs then has a face full of furniture and really has to hold it with their head!But on flat ground, this dolly was a life saver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, could use improvements","review":"I bought both the Shoulder Dolly and Forearm Forklift and decided to keep the Shoulder Dolly and return the Forearm Forklift. This enabled me and the wife to move some heavy furniture down stairs.The design of the product is farily simple but it could use some minor improvements:1) Pad the part that goes near your neck - as others have mentioned it can get painful if you are wearing a t-shirt with your neck exposed2) Change the color to orange - moving through hall ways and dark areas the black did not exactly stick out.Other than that I really liked this product and for under $35 you really can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoulder Dolly is a back saver","review":"I've used this product once and found it to do everything it's supposed to do.

I have an appliance dolly that got a ton of use. I just moved homes, and it got very little use due to these easy to use straps. They make manuvering doorways much easier.

No tired arms or sore shoulders the next day. No longer will you have to worry about dropping your items because there is absolutely no discomfort. It's very easy to use and uses the strength of your legs instead of your back and arms. The item should be in every home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"Seriously, this works very well! It is much much better than trying to clumsily muckle onto large, heavy and awkward items (even if they aren't that heavy). It helps if both people using it are pretty physically able, but certainly increases the lifting capability of just about anyone! My wife and I moved our entire kitchen and appliances piece by piece into the garage on our own. So much better than struggling with these things solo and faster too without damaging everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performed as described but needs shoulder strap adjuster","review":"While remodeling this weekend we used this to move some heavy items. It worked great and made the move much easier. My only gripe is that the shoulder harness are set-up to fit even the biggest movers but doesn't have harness adjustment straps. My husband and I aren't the biggest people. Allowing for adjustment of the harness length would definitely help.Note: This items says load capacity of 400 lbs in the description but the instructions state 400 lbs per person for a total of 800 lbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful but not as easy as the ad says","review":"This product is good and works well. But like some said, it does not make you stronger. I got this hoping my wife would be able to help me lift some heavy objects but even though the position is better, she isn't any stronger so she was not able to lift heavy objects even with this Shoulder Dolly. The not so heavy ones though were a breeze to move and seemed lighter as our bodies carried the weight instead of our arms. Nice to have but don't expect miracles."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"saved the day\\"","review":"We moved on a hot August Las Vegas Saturday and my helpers in their twenties used the shoulder dolly system for the first time. \\"That saved the day\\" was the common expression. It takes a little getting used to, but is stable and allows moving big unwieldy items such as a large antique buffet stand better than any other technique I know of. I first observed this system when a refrigerator was delivered to the house. It isn't magic, you can't lift more than you could otherwise, and it's is hard to move things a long distance (shuffle, shuffle), but we were well pleased. The quality of manufacture seems excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best moving tool ever!","review":"These straps are a life saver. I have moved massive armoires, hot tubs, a 400 pound solid oak desk, and so much more. Most people I know were skeptical until they actually tried them, after that they keep asking to borrow them. They are unbeatable at moving large bulky items with ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I had also looked at the lighter-duty forearm forklift.

Works nicely.","review":"I purchased the shoulder dolly to move large appliances into a newly renovated kitchen. The product is well worth the expense and works as advertised. We moved a very heavy range and refrigerator through a tight doorway with relative ease. This was simply not possible by lifting the appliance without the harness (hands would have been in the way). It could be improved with the addition of padding to the shoulder harness. If you wear a shirt with collar, it helps. It also helps if the two users are of relatively similar height. We have moved a stereo cabinet complete with television and components estimated at around 600lbs. This also would not have been possible without the dolly. Be aware that there are a few different versions (this one is \\"Light duty\\") and I didn't see that when I ordered. Nonetheless, it is strong enough for most household furniture and appliances."},{"rating":"2","title":"moving made easier","review":"We LOVE the shoulder dolly! It's easy to use and well made, and made moving big stuff a breeze. Because you lift with your legs, there's no strain on your back. And we quickly figured out to extend our arms to lift the carried object higher and move it further from our bodies, to avoid banging our shins. The ONLY problem we experienced was while climbing stairs, when the object we were carrying would slide down the strap toward the lower person (there's probably an easy solution for this, but it really wasn't that big of a problem for us). Overall, a GREAT product that we are recommending to all our friends (and anyone else who will listen!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoulder Dolly LD1000 2-Person Lifting System Review","review":"Excellent product.Heavy duty nylon and hardware.Much much better than the arm dolley.The weight is placed on one's shoulder/torso vs. on the arm and unsupported back.Using your legs and torso to lift the weight makes it easy to move anything small to large, light or heavy items. Even heavy sofabeds or refrigerators become simply another item to move. No big deal.You can balance/stabilize the load that you can use just a few fingers to hold the item or even let go.We've moved a few times and this saved our arms, legs, and backs countless times.Definite thumbs up for this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"My friend and I moved a full size pool table from one basement to another.

They make an easy task of moving anything. I have used it to lift 60\\" plasma TV's, treadmills, refrigerators, etc. between me and my wife. After moving 2 or 3 times prior to having these straps, then 2 or 3 times after, I cannot recomend these enough. They are really worth the money in savings to your back and time. You will need fewer friends to help you move (and thus have to buy less beer and pizza) and will finish in half the time.Most of my friends who have helped me move now ask to borow them for their moves, and others have bought their own set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saves your back because weight's on shoulders and hips","review":"Great product. I used this to move a large, heavy entertainment unit with someone prone to back problems. When strapped in, with hands braced against the object, legs bent and back straight, simply stand up.

My husband had rotator cuff surgery and can no longer help me move any furniture. I have moved couches, dressers, a washer, a piano and a freezer using a skateboard. I prop one end of the furniture up and slide the skateboard underneath. To turn corners, you just set your end down, then tug the end of the skateboard not under the item in the direction you want to go. Lift again and walk forward. If the item is really heavy I center the skateboard under the item so it takes all the weight. The only time it doesn't work is when you need to go up a long flight of stairs. I have moved items up a small distance by using a strong board as a ramp. I'm always buying used furniture and I use this method to get things up inside my minivan or onto a trailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding","review":"As a former professional furniture mover this thing gives me the willies just looking at it. If it's too heavy to pick up, put it on a dolly. Forget about going up stairs with this contraption. It looks like it would stress the weakest part of the back.

My child has put it together twice and already is bored with this toy. We puchased 2 thinking the interchangeability would prolong interest. Not so. Also when the 2 car parts are joined, there are visible diferences in the joining seams, and the car direction is even worse.

You might not agree with everything Sloan says, but there is an obvious strength here, built during a lifetime of study and teaching. Sloan was yet another great teacher from the Art Student's League (other teachers included Bridgeman, Hale, and Nicolaides who published significant books of their own), and one of the major painters of the Ashcan school of painting.

At other places there are parenthetical references to an inset being \\"below left\\" when it is actually \\"above right.\\" These types of errors undermine the usefulness of a reference book significantly.

The good points about this novel is that the nature of Japan and her people are deeply explored, and that the actual writing is fluid, sensuous and clever.

Got them in black, I was looking for a stocking that wouldn't make my thighs look like encased sausages, and that I could wear with a garter belt and these were perfect. They stayed up by themselves on me, but I'll wear them with a garter belt anyway. They are soft, and I can tell they'll last a while, being only hand washed of course. Would most definitely buy again, very sexy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book that you must read.","review":"I strong recommend this book, I Have Arrived Before My Words, to anyone who is interested in homeless women. This book gives reader a picture of how five women, Gayle, Ann, Georgia, Dionne and Angie, struggled either from drugs, abuse, illness or neglect; and became homeless in the end. Although they were victims of abuse in someway in their lives, their survival was heroic. Each woman has her own coping methods to escape. These women's experiences were real, and it reconnects us with the dignity and humanity of our most marginalized citizens. This book gives these women a voice, a human face and a connection to the dark side of society. These women have been treated as insignificant, voiceless and faceless was the overall cause that they became homeless. All these women need now are their voice to be heard, and society should take care of these women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cristal (English 100 AD), USA","review":"This book was very enjoyable to read. Before reading this book I did not know much about the homeless. This book has opened my eyes to what life must really be like for the people living on the cold dark streets. I enjoyed reading the stories of the lives these women led and how they each have found a way to cope with the problems they have aquired. The stories of the women's hardships can hopefully help someone else not travel the same roads."},{"rating":"2","title":"five homless women's courageous stories","review":"In the book, five homeless women show us what real courage is. Though they were victimized in some ways through abuse, addictions, neglect or serious illnesses, which caused them to slip into homeless piece by piece, with their remarkable courage, they realized and solved all the problems, and began their new lives. Although some women's stories were kind of similar, i still recommend it becasue their courage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Find out what homelessness is really about.","review":"I Have Arrived Before My Words by Deborah Pugh and Jeanie Tietjen are autobiographical writings of five homeless women. These five homeless women talk about their experiences through life being homeless. If you are curious and want to find out more about homelessness, this is the book for you. After reading I Have Arrived Before My Words, I see homelessness in a different way. I never would have thought that being homeless would be so difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glimps into their Lives","review":"It's hard not to prejudge those we see living on the streets. We often fill out their life history for them; a drunk, a run-away, or a drug-addict. Have you ever walk pass a homeless person and thought to yourself, 'he must be spending all his money on drugs that's why he's homeless', or 'she must be a run away that's why she has no place to live.' Why won't they get a job or do something better? Well, after reading I Have Arrived Before My Words, a collection of five autobiographies written by homeless women, I've got the chance to learn how some people ended up this way. This book provides readers with incredible insight of the lives of Gayle, Ann, Georgia, Dionne, and Angie. I Have Arrived Before My Words also show readers of those who fought for better lives and those who gave up. This book is not just to gain different perspective of these homeless women, but it taught us a bit about ourselves as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading Material","review":"I Have Arrived Before My Words is a collection of memoirs of five homeless women. It contains stories of drug abuse, parental neglect, sexual abuse, mental illness, etc. Each memoir is not quite the same, and each women brings a different \\"light\\" towards the topic of homelessness. After reading, I Have Arrived Before My Words I never took into account of how and exactly why people were homeless. This book showed that it's a series of trials and tribulations that a homeless person may go through. It is not only because one is poor. Also, after each of the memoirs is a discussion written by either Deborah Pugh or Jeanie Tietjen. They provide more information and their own insight of each women. Overall, I think you should take the time to read this book. It's not long, and it's a great collection of memoirs of homeless women."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Have Arrived Before My Words (English 100AB)","review":"An interesting book to read, I Have Arrived Before My Words describes a society that victimizes women into becoming homeless. This book has showed me the many ways where people have fallen out of the American dream and into despair. Although I feel that the women in this book could have done things differently, it was wonderful reading this book to keep in touch with reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perspective changer......","review":"Before I ever read this book, I used to have a negative perspective of homeless people because from what I've seen and heard, homeless people used to be just beggers on the street, only asking for money because they were too lazy to find a job. Reading this book, however, made me realize that homeless people are REAL people who aren't \\"lazy\\", like I thought before, but just troubled souls. This book tells the memoirs of five homeless women: Gayle, Ann, Georgia, Dionne, and Angie. All of these women were not always homeless, but became homeless because of addiction, depression, unhappiness, etc. They tell their stories to help others not to follow their paths, and also help people understand that homeless people are just like the rest of us. I encourage anyone and everyone to read this book because it really was perspective changing, and I think more people need to get a reality check and understand that although one is homeless, one is still a human being."},{"rating":"2","title":"The inspired story about homeless women (Eng 100 AL)","review":"I Have Before My Words, an autobiography of five homeless women shows a picture how ordinary people battle against extraordinary hardships. The courage these homeless women displayed against abuse, addiction, physical and mental illness is inspiring. Going through the journey they traveled, we can see hope and loss, threat and challenge, passivity and positive entangle their lives. It is courageous for them to put their stories into writing. These women's stories are revealing and educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is very interesting but very sad.","review":"I Have Arrived before My Words is a book that repersents the autobiographies and the voices of five homeless women: Gayle, Georgia, Dionne, and Angie. The book is very interesting, for it reveals the secrets behind the closet door of the homeless. It shows a few paths which the homeless have followed. It also states the reason some people become homeless. It presents five homless women's memoirs very vividly. Gayle's painful experience with her parents and her boyfriend is shocking. Ann's experience in the military is sorrowful. Georgia's happy memories in the South, and her life struggles in New York City are very interesting. Dionne's resistance, even though she knows she is HIV positive, is astounding. Angie's bravery, despite the fact she is disabled, is exemplary. This book tells of the torture and the pain of being homeless, and may teach you how to aviod it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memoirs of homeless women","review":"The memoirs of the five women in I Have Arrived Before My Words reinforce the ideas that are most often associated with homelessness. It is not a book that I would recommend for several reasons. The writing in the book is fairly poor and the content of the memoirs leaves the reader with out a desire to continue to read on. The story line is very basic and does not grab the reader's attention. The content of the memoirs underlines the fact that these women are a direct cause of their homelessness. All of the five women make poor choices throughout their lives and do not have the courage to take responsibility for their actions. Reading has always been a part of my life, but if I didn't have to read this book for a class, I would have never read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Different kind of Life","review":"If you have no idea what it is like to go hungry, use newspapers for insulation, or worry about being killed while you sleep then reading this book may help you understand what a homeless life is like. The book contains short memoirs of five women living in a shelter and discussions about the memoirs written by the editors. The memoirs themselves are short and mostly clear. The discussions by the editors are a little long and less to the point then the memoirs. The book may help the reader to understand how hard it can be to overcome the patterns of behavior learned in life. No matter how destructive those patterns are."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Memoirs about 5 Homeless Women","review":"Who every is clueless about what homeless people go through in their life time, should take a glimps on these 5 sets of memoirs written by 5 women who when through a struggle.

A very realistic golf simulation with styrofoam balls and an array of different clubs. So much cheaper than the real thing, and just neat to watch or play. I'm surprised this toy hasn't been replicated and marketed by a bigger brand. I think I might buy more and give these out as gifts.UPDATE 9/19/12 - I haven't payed with this nearly as much as I thought I would. I guess because the green felt is creased in the box, so you have to let the wrinkles get out before you can have fun with it, and that just takes too long.

It is more than a little praise to say that not only Jonathan Coe's book contains enough material for several books but that the one he has authored is superior to the mere summ of its parts. It is rare for a novel to be both so cleverly gripping and so poignant, so well researched (I was flabbergasted by the precision of the part about industrial chicken production) and so funny.But there's also a political dimension in the book that is quite clear and a little disingenuous: all evil, it seems to say, comes from greed, all the greed is concentrated in the upper-classes: two more than dubious propositions. Happily I must say, otherwise one would be tempted to resort to the kind of solution suggested in the book by Morty Windshaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"One of the funniest, saddest, and most though provoking books I have ever read.

(of sorts)","review":"I've loved other books by Coe but this, an earlier effort, had me going until the very final pages when I felt things fell apart a bit; this, a four-star rating. The missing star is for the disappointing finale. Until the finish, however, \\"The Winshaw Legacy\\" is a great read that has all of Coe's strengths: biting social commentary, engaging characters and the ability to have this reader fall off his chair laughing when Coe delivers another unexpected one-liner.A word of warning to the casual reader: if you're looking for a murder mystery tale, this isn't exactly what you think it may be despite the cover and description. This is a much more detailed novel than that and you have to wait a long time to get to the chaotic events the cover illustration promises. It's worth it, of course, but is not the majority of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't cook evenly","review":"I thought dark pans were the latest and greatest. Well, I was wrong.

At first I thought it was badly translated from another language but sometimes it seemed it might have been written by a computer with a very limited vocabulary. Phrases are repeated throughout the book in a very repetitive, comatose sort of style. In addition, the content is a hodgepodge with ideas never quite followed through but then reappearing later in the book but never finished off. It could have used an editor to say the least.

It is extremely sturdy as far as the frame and the individual pieces that make each slot...It is not cardboard! The covers on the front edge of each slot do stay on and for the most part stay in the organizer. However, the one thing that I wish could be better is the fact that the papers don't easily slide out of the slots due to the covers on the front edge.

My Morning Jacket comes in like a warm coat to shield you from the flying debris resulting from worn out schemes and musical formulas hovering over our heads. With a characteristic reverb sound that connects their songs together, I can only convey do so much to convey to you what My Morning Jacket is about because their solid rock sound speaks volumes more than words can describe.The copy-protection crap aside (get it from iTunes, if it's such a big deal to you), you cannot afford to not play their music.

I personally enjoy music that has a dense,thick layered sound and this album has it in spades.Kind of like classic Southern rock filtered through the prism of late 70's Pink Floyd and King Crimson.Downgraded one star for an endearing but quirky lead vocalist who will be an acquired taste for some!Now to the point I allude to in the title of this review....I don't think it is intellectually valid by any standard to corrupt the review process by inserting the politics of copyright protection into an evaluation of the musical/creative value of any work!!!!Stick with the issue of artistic merit and leave the politics to the suits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they gotta sound like 38 special sometimes?","review":"Yo. check it. MMJ has some cool songs. They do on this album too.

I read these \\"awesome\\" reviews on amazon and went out and bought it. I was pleasently surprised by the first song...then it was kind of wack after that...second song was allright...then it got reall wack...Into the Woods was kind of cool...but man oh man...2 stars. 2 Stars.

I BOUGHT IT. As old-fashioned as that seems, I didn't download it off the internet, I wanted the artist to get some money. They made the music, they deserve to make some money off of it...it's only fair. BUT!!! If I want to take my CD (which I BOUGHT) and burn a track onto a compilation disc for myself or for a friend, I should be able to.

I find that if i am writing a paper or reading, having a little MMJ jamming in the background never hurt anyone. I agree that if you arent really used to MMJ, the drawn out instrumentals are tough to sit through, so give it a few listens in the background and you will fall in love. I dont know if this album is better than it still moves, but if you liked that one, then this one should really come as no suprise. Just honest music, from honest southerners.

I bought this because I really loved many of the songs on At Dawn, but I don't hear any of the best qualities of that CD on this one. The songs here have better musicianship and production quality, but the emotional content that I feel I can connect with is less.Besides that, it's curious to me how so many other reviewers think this music \\"ROCKS!\\". When I think of a band that rocks, I think of something like The New York Dolls or Nirvana, not Wilco, Radiohead, or MMJ. I'm just saying that so readers know where I'm coming from; everyone has their own concept of what rocks. I think Wilco is ok, but somewhat boring, and I find the vaunted Radiohead whiny and annoying.

I spent money on several live shows. I burned a song or two for like-minded music fans who went out a bought more MMJ discs and concert tickets.I don't think I'm exaggerating if I say that the technology has helped make the popularity of bands like MMJ.I went back and downloaded this CD for free.

I have used a lot of different oils compounded with a lot of different additives and this stuff is slicker than anything I have ever used. Even though a lot of brake cable housing comes with a teflon liner you still have to lightly lubricate the cable. The advantage of this stuff is that it is synthetic and will not dry out or damage the teflon liner in brake cable housing. Bicycle mechanics have more in common with gunsmiths than they do car mechanics. This super slick oil is unsurpassed for fine bicycle applications.

Watch closely - I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, but be careful not to tear the suctions...","review":"We bought this and it worked very well for us, particularly since we have twins.

Also, as someone else stated, when there is more than two inches of water in the tub, the liner starts floating. As the water rises, so does the liner.

The shallow end (opposite the spout) of my tub is angled and not straight up and down like the one in the photo so it cant be attached evenly all the way around.

Unless you bath your baby in only 1 inch of water (or you have a really deep tub and not the \\"normal\\" style) you will have issues with this happening. I fill the tub to about 4 inches or just at my daughters belly button. Its too bad because I really think this was a great idea. The rising with the water wouldnt bother me so much if it attached to my tub correctly to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not good enough","review":"Liner fits bathtub niceline and is easy to inflate.

Takes Horror To New Heights.","review":"As I read this book, I kept asking myself how far this story would go? Having finished reading it, I can honestly say that this author went the distance and held nothing back. Mr. Gonzalez created a very realistic and chilling depiction of a cold blooded killer that will be hard to forget. Shocking and addictive, I definitely want to check out more work by this author.I'm not sure why the last review by \\"hangedwoman\\" was so negative, especially since they already read the novella that Survivor was based on called 'Maternal Instinct'. I think \\"hangedwoman\\" secretly loved it but won't admit it to themselves. Why else re-read something? Am I sensing a bitter and failed author?The other 5 star reviews speak for itself and the fact that this book was recently selected to be re-released next month by the premier horror publisher in the world, Leisure Books, speaks volumes.

The drama, horror etc build up. Then the stupid writer decides to follow the Hollywood Horror approch, lets make the killer(s) STUPID, make them make the USUAL mistakes, forgot to lock the door, forgot to tied the victim down etc etc, the list goes on. 50pages later I throw away this piece a garbage book. And (SPOILER ALERT!!!), the Superwoman ending was just to ridiculious. This whole book is overhyped and feels like an only horror movie released in Europe in the early 80's....CENSORED!Stay Away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bad book","review":"I belong to a bookclub through Leisure Books. Every month, I get two new horror titles. This was one of them.I just couldn't find anything redeeming in this book at all. I didn't find any of the characters sympathetic. I did not care for any of them. In fact, one that replused me the most was \\"the survivor\\". After what she did, I didn't want her to survive.Some may say this book is bringing to light the snuff film trade and its atrocities. But truly, how many people are going to seek information on this vile subject from a mass market paperback?The author went way beyond what he should have. Yes, the description on the back covers let's you know this is going to be a gruesome book. However, it doesn't tell you that an infant girl gets raped, pulled apart and partly eaten, in front of her mother in a snuff film.I seriously considered not finishing the book, however I wanted to review it and felt it best to read the whole thing.Awful, just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncompromising and utterly unforgettable","review":"I have never read anything like J. F. Gonzalez's Survivor. There were times I actually thought of putting this book down and walking away (Chapter 17), but I couldn't do it. The story is so compelling, the danger so real, and the characters so believable, that I had to keep reading to the bitter end. I write horror for a living, and I thought I had seen it all. I was wrong. The villains in this novel are the vilest and most horrific creatures ever conceived. 'Animal' alone will give you nightmares for the rest of your life. Survivor disgusted me, enthralled me, and it actually made me cry. If you have a taste for real terror, and a very strong stomach, you must experience it for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on it","review":"If you have ever seen the movie 8mm with Nicholas Cage, then you will notice that this book heavily borrows on that film. The snuff film concept, the whole idea of the deserted area in the woods where people are murdered, the sadistic guy with a weird name like \\"Animal\\" or \\"Machine\\" that mercilessly kills and tortures. It's not very well written, extremely trite in parts, and it could have used an extra pair of eyes (or fifty) during the editing process. Lisa, the heroine of the novel, is a well-developed character, and to Gonzalez's credit, one does want to root for her to live and applaud her bravery. Also, to defend Gonzalez, it's very hard to write about snuff without using stereotypical and overused descriptions and plots because no one has really proved its existence or exposed a snuff ring. The book is graphic, overwhelmingly violent and very disturbing. In my opinion, it's weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like perverts f***ing babies...","review":"...this book is for you. I really enjoy good horror and thrillers. I'm a sucker for serial killers. But \\"Survivor\\" simply goes too far.

These are the memories of an obviously talented musician who happened to be propelled from the lounges of the Las Vegas casinos to travelling and working with and for the finest popular singer of the 20th century.

It's about a guy who's passion for music and the mastery of his craft bring him to the top of the heap, that is, becoming the musical conductor for \\"The Chairman of the Board\\". I enjoyed this book because it's the story of a humble man who followed his dream but always kept his feet firmly planted on the ground. I came away admiring Mr. Falcone's determination. His stories about Mr. S were insightful, entertaining and poignant. I particularly enjoyed his stories about the bandmembers.

Futhermore,I found it very revolting and very unapprioate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewer: A reader from ECU","review":"What a book! I have never been exposed to a book like this. The author's brillance is seen at the turn of every page. She offers a detailed insight into each character which allows the reader to become really involved. Alice's perception and cynical character makes the book great. The more you get to know Alice the easier it is to see and fully understand her constant battle. The two extremes Grant uses, Maeve and Syd, to show what Alice idealizes in each is phenomenal. I completely understand Grant's purpose in having lesbianism part of the story. Yes the sex scenes were shocking, but deal with it! They were necessary. The ending is very intriguing. I feel it leaves the reader with many answers, and the promise of a bright future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"This book was an easy read. I zipped it through in 1 night but it left me disappointed. It seemed shallow, underdeveloped, lots of chasing, one page of erotica, and a confusing, abrupt ending. If you're looking for a book to help you with an eating disorder, that is not the purpose of this book so you'd better do some more searching. It's fiction about a lesbian attraction that happens to take place at an eating disorder rehab, the focus is sexual curiosity and exploration, not eating disorders. I was aware of this so that's not what left me disappointed. It really needs a lot of work to be a good read. Decent lesbian fiction is REALLY hard to come by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely a fictional novel","review":"If you think you'll gain an understanding of eating disorders, you'll be disappointed, as this is merely a fictional novel. I suppose that's why it is listed as such. Continuing to battle my own demons, I found this book to be only midly interesting, and mostly a yawn. Some parts did ring true, however.It would have been nice for the reader (if not Alice) to have known more about Maeve, as she is a central character in the novel. Okay attempt as a first novel for the author. Won't seek out others written by her, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected....","review":"I am so glad I did not actually buy this book. I got it from the library. I read it all but many times I wanted to just stop reading it. It reminds me of a really, really bad soap opera. Its unrealistic and even though it centers around girls that suffer from anorexia, bulimia and over-eating its not really truly ABOUT the eating disorders. Its a lot more sexual in nature than I ever imagined and I hated it to be completely honest. If you want a romance novel then this is the book for you but if you TRULY want an understading of REAL people with REAL eating disorders I would find another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read the inside cover....very misleading...","review":"When I first bought this book, I thought it would help me to tap into my own anorexic mindset and give me more insight into the disease. However, after the first few chapters, it was no longer about anorexia but filled with raunchy sexual scenes. It just seemed as if this book was geared toward the anorexia issue when in fact it was geared WAY MORE towards the lesbianism issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"wished i'd known the real content!","review":"the lesbian slant was unexpected, and without a warning, not appreciated. as a young anorectic, i was scared by the detailed sexual scenes, and while i am by no means against such literature, i feel that the reader should be informed of the direction the book takes somewhere on the cover. i agree with an earlier reviewer that The Secret Language of Eating Disorders is a must to read if the reader is seeking info on eating disorders rather than lesbianism. The book however did provide an intense look at the much hidden lesbian world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant realistic look at women, food, & relationships","review":"This first novel focuses on a young women literally at theend of her rope as she starves herself to death at an eatingdisorder clinic. Having suffered a heart attack, 25-year-old Alice has recovered enough to participate in therapy.The novel does a wonderful job of bringing out the ironiesof life at the clinic - there is real humor here. Theauthor also zeroes in on the issues of dependency,desperation, and desire that lie at the heart of those whostruggle with the role of food in their lives. Finally,Alice's relationships with the people in her life,a new arrival at the clinic, force her to confront herselfand her own desires.This novel is well-written, intense and yet evenly paced.The characters are entirely believable and theirpredicaments provide us with new insights into the tumoilthat causes and is caused by our rocky relationships withfood.Celia Rabinowitz"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great.

Author spends about 80% of book going into way too much depth about all sorts of sciences and then ties it into Superman's abilities at the end of each chapter. After a while you find yourself skipping the science sections just to get to the Superman parts. Author also states throughout book that Superman came to earth before he was actually born-as a birthing matrix-to support his theory about Superman's adaptability to earth conditions. Is this a recent comic book change to his origin? For those of us who read the comics through the 60's-80's, and have seen all the Movies and TV shows of the last 50 years, Superman always came to Earth as a small child. This bit of revisionism is quite jarring-especially for the older reader who is more likely to pick up this book.

It doesn't cover much in the way of actual cooking techniques, but it's a fantastic and utterly evocative guide to 'cue culture; the people and places as well as the smoked meat itself.

It has all the features I was looking for-- in particular that it was fully washable and it had a drain spout.

But after using the machine about a month I started getting an error message on the LED screen and the machine would shut off. I always reset it pretty quickly so I could continue to use it. The messages came more and more often and today I cannot use the machine at all-- it instantly goes to the error message and I cannot use it and I cannot cook my lunch the way I wanted to.

The author apparently used a special word processing program which inserts commas randomly into the text. Maybe the \\"spell check\\" function was used sometimes, but that doesn't help someone who uses \\"their\\" instead of \\"there\\", \\"to\\" instead of \\"too\\", or \\"affect\\" instead of \\"effect\\". It also doesn't help someone who thinks the plural of a word is formed by adding an apostrophe and then an \\"S\\".All in all, this is a horrible piece of writing. Please, Mr. Taylor, if you intend to write any more books, find a good editor before your work is published.

I went on internet to check it out, and in the internet they are speaking about an alien called michael who is haunting the home.The way the book is written and the way the character said that he was made welcome in the house seems very unsettling, as this for me sounds like a family who is making all of these stone and egg throwing done so that they can make some money by pretending that there is a haunting.Please do not buy this book and if you want a good ghost read please read The Night that Stalks the Mansion, which is an excellent read, and a true haunting..."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE edit your book!!","review":"I really wish I had either read the reviews of this book or taken a sneak peek inside prior to purchase.

The sounds are muffled and not very loud. There are these tiny little STICKERS showing where the animal is supposed to go. My next complaint is that the silo keeps falling off.

She got so much for her birthday, and this is her favorite toy by far. She probably plays with this 90 minutes a day total. She even wants the farmer & pig to go in her crib during her nap. First thing in the morning when she wakes up she says \\"play farm!\\" I find it very durable and have not had any problems with this toy that other people mention.

We actually bought the older version, but took it back when we found out (a week later) that there was a newer version available. It was a huge disappointment. My son removes the silo faster than I can connect it back on. The animals have \\"fur,\\" which I thought was a really great idea until my son started biting the hair off of the sheep. The rooster slides across the front of the barn to send the other animals down the slide, and is not removable. By opening three different barn doors you can hear a \\"moo\\", \\"oink\\", or \\"neigh\\" and place those animals inside the barn. There is a location for the sheep, and in order to hear the \\"baa,\\" you push on its hay inside the stall. The only pro I can come up with is that the barn is much lighter in weight than the original. I am sorry I did not keep the original because now I cannot find it anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great step for Little People","review":"I purchased this for my daughter to keep her entertained when I was on bed rest.

I've read other reviews about how the fur makes them hard to clean but I don't agree. Even after repeated washing the fur is still in great shape.

My sister has the older version (not touch and feel) and her kids love it. We played with this about 2 times and then the cow's hair started to come out in little tufts in my son's mouth. It's not enough to choke on, but is still very disturbing. I called F.P. and they were helpful but I have to agree with the other reviewer who said the touch and feel animals are terrible..they are!

She would rather carry around the animals than mess with the whole thing. The silo pops off daily. I don't really know why bc it's really hard for me to pop it back into place. The sounds only sound if you push a button or close a door. So, I don't really know how it teaches correct sounds for specific animals.

There is no little farm cart, almost nothing that can be moved around (instead of the ridiculous chicken that can only slide... what chicken slides back and forth? I know it is a toy, but children enjoy realistic things too). And I cannot get past the price for this... seriously it can't even be worth $10. Older versions were far more stable and allowed for a lot more creativity. Shame on you, Fisher Price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep your kid happy for hours!","review":"Our daughter was having such a blast playing with this toy at her Gd Ma that we wanted to get one for our house. She plays for hours and entertain herself, giving us a well deserved break :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laaaaaame!","review":"My 19 month old received this as a Christmas gift this year. From the looks of it I thought it would be a great toy, but it's pretty lame. First off, that silo thing comes off way too easily and it's really hard to put back on. It came off literally within minutes of taking it out of the packaging. My daughter will sit and play with the toy, but only for a few minutes because it doesn't do anything exciting. There is sliding thing in the front that will push the plastic figure out through the side and it tumbles down the sloping barn. Whoop dee do. There are some sounds, but since ours didn't come with batteries I haven't heard them yet. There are also two little sliding windows on the side....not too exciting. Overall for the price of this set, I think it could use a little more pizazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is lame","review":"We got this for my son's 3rd birthday......... it makes no sense and is so boring, he hates it. The chicken slides back and forth (non-removeable), and all that this does is make sounds when you open barn doors and then you have a bunch of plastic farm animals. Don't buy it. The toys in the 70's by fisher price were way cooler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to do.","review":"This was our second most disappointing toy of the holidays! Cute animals and sturdy product, but the sounds only work if you open doors, and two of our sounds actually don't work. Then the product has a random \\"slide\\" that you can push the chicken on the front of the farm to the left and it pushed down whatever character is there onto the roof slide? Totally random and really not that much fun. The silo can store the animals but it is very narrow and a bit hard even for my two year old to stick her hand in to get our the animals. There are absolutely no other pieces that come with this farm and really nothing for the animals to do except stand in the barn so it really hasn't inspired any creativity or play. Instead the animals have wondered off this farm and have ended up in the Little People house and castle where they have a lot more fun. I would pass on this particular model, not worth the money and not a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"An oldie and a goodie!","review":"I am 37 and had the wooden version of this when I was little.

I bought one for my daughter 6 years ago and I was so pleased with how far the product had come. It was durable with many different areas of play. We gave it away when my daughter grew out of it and bought this one this year when my second daughter turned 1. I am SO disappointed! It is not made well - not as solid. There is no merry go round - something the other farm had. There is no place for the goat to be placed to hear his sound and the chicken is cannot be removed. There used to be a fence that could be constructed....it's just NOT the same toy. Additionally, I'm sure I paid less for the mode 6 years ago. What a shame. Would not pay $35 for this toy. I'm sure there is something better out there.

I read it as the last book of the Robin Hood trilogy and as I began to read I quickly fell in love with the series; I was fascinated, entertained and romanced. When I got to the last book I was dreading reading it (because it meant an end to the series) but Canham saved the best for last: Griffyn Renaud.

Sharon Green takes 6 main characters, adds in the enemies personalities, and gives you a real taste for their world, their society and how its run. She obviously put a lot of thought into the world's setting and the details make the story for me. She switches back and forth from the main characters to things going on in the capital to the neighboring countries/nations and makes it look fairly easy too. These characters really show the complications of life and what is involved in running a city, country and the politics of situations. I highly recommend you start with the first book and work your way through. I'm rereading them all for the second time and just thoroughly enjoying them. The characters are rich and distinctive and the author has really done a great job drawing the reader in."},{"rating":"1","title":"shortSighted","review":"I used to be a big Sharon Green fan. Seriously, I think I've read everything she's ever written. Sadly, I'm very disappointed in her latest book, mostly bc of the intimacy issues introduced. There seems to be a serious logical fallacy in her reasoning that they should swap partners on a regular basis. If she maintains this, I hardly see how she can escape making the guys be intimate too, yet she's never broached that issue. Not only that, but it's not as if women are always the same elements and men are always the same elements - so wouldn't that lead to a bunch of imbalanced blendings if some connections were stronger than others? I know the men's connection to each other is supposed to be enhanced by the women, but I just don't buy it - think she's needlessly going outside of her core, which has always been a strong anchor for me. This book leaves a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"The first book was very imaginative and creative. The following four books were terrible.

The \\"Blendings\\" series started out great, with fascinating characters and circumstances. But it just got ugly from there. The \\"Blending Enthroned\\" series has the potential to be so good, but I think there's just too much pressure on the author to churn the books out, and quality is sacrificed.

American Nation is great for the classroom environment. This book has great stories under \\"American Lives,\\" which talk about great Americans. Some of which are George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams to name a few. There are many colorful and well-illustrated pictures. This book explains in depth the great events of the United States up until 1877. Pay attention though because this book jumps around with the dates on the different subject areas, but that is so the same subject is covered in one section.

I don't want to take it back to the local service center because the guy was very rude to us everytime we've dealt with him. Anyway, exect great coffee for a while, then expect it to break and not get good service.UPDATE: After a few months I was able to get a hold of the company and they repaired it free of charge and gave me an extended warranty.

The DeLonghi service number blamed it on the plastic float in the water reservoir, the simplest and cheapest looking mechanism imaginable. I was having second thoughts about their quality control for a machine whose all-plastic construction did not inspire confidence to begin with, when the service person, after conferring with a colleague, decided there could be something more seriously wrong with the machine and that I should exchange it.

The 10 volume encyclopedia is great, no doubts about that but this concise version of it is nothing but an advertisement to the larger version.Yes, this encyclopedia is comprehensive, it includes philosophers and philosophy from all over the world but too bad not in sufficient depth to make it meaningful enough. It is assumed that this book is for the layman but frankly speaking, all it can do is to introduce the names/terms/concepts to the layman without being able to shed more light.If one would really want to know more, the Oxford Companion will do a better job.

The first Cars album came out when I was a freshman in high school. So when I hear the first Cars albums it reminds me of that time. Luckily punk rock and post-punk came along and saved my live. But was Ric Ocasek was one of the hopeful voices of that time. When I moved to NYC in 1996, I used to live near Mr. Ocasek. I lived in Chelsea, and he lived a few blocks away. I saw him often at Coney Island High checking out new bands. So he has a new album. You listen to a little of this and it rock in an Ocasek way. This is much better than the recent Alice Cooper and Billy Idol records. I am just thinking of some old timers who have come out with a record recently. Roc Ocasek has much talent. He has an ear for music. This is happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back Ric...Finally!","review":"Nexterday is most similar to his last CD, Troublizing.

My own view: Goldhagen's book is already on the ash-heap of history. When scholarly Jews like Finkelstein and Birn recognize the unscholarly nature of the book, it's done. I'm surprised that they didn't mention the attempt to \\"buy\\" Goldhagen a prestigious chair at Harvard (rejected, thank goodness!) on the basis of publicity about the book!Finkelstein expresses surprise at the popularity of Goldstein's racist polemic. Doesn't he notice the prevailing intellectual reign of terror which censors all but the standard version of \\"the Holocaust\\"? It exists. I look forward to his next book. I found Birn's part of the book less useful, somewhat pedantic, nitpicking and confused (probably because she is torn between academic honesty about Golhagen's raving prejudices and a desire to support \\"Holocaust Maxima\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nation On Trial","review":"Finkelstein's book a \\"A Nation On Trial\\" is an excellent book. It's not only a great book, it's a revolution. Finkelstein, jewish himself, dares to challenge the \\"Holcaust Industry\\". How amazing and brave this step was, can not be underestimated. It's quite obvious in his book to see that Finkelstein is concerned about historical truth and what we make of it. One of his main arguments is that less than a per cent of all Germans were actually involved in the destruction of the European Jewry. He asks his readers how someone can possibly accuse all Germans? Well, Goldhagen tried just that and failed. Finkelstein easily disproves Goldhagen in his interestingly written book. It's a must read for everyone who is interested in the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"The usual antisemitic rant by the same antisemites","review":"Norman G. Finkelstein makes a living out of his antisemitic stance and at times vicious attacks on the State of Israel. He and some of his confreres are too well known at this stage for their lies to be taken seriously by anyone that does not have serious mental problems. In fact, his entry in Germany is somehow restricted by his fear of being arrested and spending two years in jail. Free speech can only be free as long as hate is not its basis - like it was in Germany (and Austria) until Hitler's committed suicide, like the coward he was underneath a veneer of courage he never truly had.If one is an adept of antisemitism, one should read this book and feel less like an animal. For those that think - don't waste your time nor give charity money to such specimen of nonhumans as Finkelstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Nation on Trial","review":"Finkelstein and Birn's book is a revisionist, outrageous attempt atdefending the most indefensible people of all time. This workdemonstrates almost no scholarly support, but rather is a sweepinggeneralization that fails to refute a single principle of DanielGoldhagen.

Unfortunately, the author jumps from subject to subject and it's not clear as to what her point is. The grammar is bad and the sentence structure is way off. The tips on exotic dancing are not explained well and therefore, I'm not clear as to what she means. The beauty tips are nothing more than common sense.

I WILL NEVER recommend this book to anyone.The only thing I liked about the book was trying to guess where the periods went, where the exclamation points went and which words were misspelled.

The heater is really hot to the touch. This product did exactly what it claimed it would do well. I don't know if the other purchasers received defective units or if they had unreasonable expectations. I am extremely satisfied with this product.

I thought it was bigger than the normal 7-fin kind (with five fins in the middle and two on the sides) and that's why it would cost $79.95. The normal 7-fin radiator usually costs about $45-50, for example, see model EW0507, an even nicer DeLonghi, for $ 45.95.What I got in the mail was a radiator that looked very much like the model I had ordered, TRR0715, only it had 7 fins in total, 5 in the middle and two on the sides. It was significantly different from the picture posted on amazon.com in that it was much narrower.

I have other Delonghi products with which I am very satisfied. This one however, is worthless and expensive to operate. If you want retro decor, it looks great but if you want heat, look elsewhere.

When I found this bra it was the end of my search as it was very comfortable, didn't fall off my shoulder, and wasn't cut too high under the arms, with just right control.

I'm a little disappointed that the extra cars meant to support the boom arm aren't designed well enough to actually do that (the magnets are set in the wrong place), but that doesn't affect its play value in any way, nor has my son had any trouble maneuvering Rocky's boom arm through his sometimes elaborate layouts.

Maybe I'm exaggerating by giving it 5 stars, but it's only because I rarely get drawn into albums this much, and I don't think there are many DJs out there who push themselves as much as Holmes. And though I still contend this album should be heard straight through from beginning to end, \\"Bad Thing\\", \\"69 Police\\" and \\"Living Room\\" have got to be the best tracks on here.

By that time the other man, severly disfigured and by now a gutter drunk, has turned a corner and comforts the dying and formerly faithful man to find a peace of his own.

Those who are into reading western authors are quite familiar with the legendary Louis L'Amour's books. This beautifully fully illustrated book pays tribute to the author and the people, places, and events that inspired his novels. This is a coffee table type of book that covers a lot of material about the old west. This reference text begins with a short biography of Louis L'Amour and moves on to topics such as outlaws and law men, gunfighter profiles, cowboys and indians, the Texas Rangers, the Civil War, and many other interesting chapters.In conclusion, even if you are not into reading western novels, but love western movies, you will enjoy reading this book.Rating: 5 stars.

I would disagree with him on some of his opinions about the Civil War in Lebanon (mostly drawn from Robert Fisk), but he shed light on an ignored group of people, abandoned to their fate by the media and politicians in the West. The book might awaken the reader, and maybe knock some sense into us."},{"rating":"1","title":"With all kindness, but something is missing.","review":"This book is very well-written. I enjoyed Mr. Dalrymple's sense of humor and his ability to get the reader to the places as he describes them, but I feel he is not telling the \\"whole story.\\" I would like to see the documentation for the facts and figures he quotes and given there is little or none, I do not know what to believe.I have met the former director of Israel Antiquities Authority and he states, rather firmly that they do not preserve Zionist-only artifacts, that there is not a Zionist plot to drive the rest of the world out of Jerusalem.

I'll give you one example: \\"like flies in a Turkish market\\". I doubt the man has ever been to one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"William Dalrymple is one my favorite authors","review":"He could write about ANYTHING and it would be interesting. I am savoring every sentence of this wonderful book. I feel like I am in Mr. Dalrymple's back pocket as he travels to such obscure but important destinations. I've come to realize how difficult it is to say there is one true religion. Mr. Dalrymple shows how Christianity and Islam grew out of each other and how their practices and beliefs, while so different today, were actually very similar in the beginning. An important lesson for anybody today who thinks their religion should rule the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey Back in the Christian Timeline","review":"This book was recommended to me by an author and Catholic priest, who suggested that it be read as a way of understanding how Western Christianity will perish if we are not able to understand the lessons of the past and incorporate them into the future. As a ordained Christian minister, I have taken to not only showing this wonderful book to friends, family and parishoners, but buying an extra copy for the library at the parish. It is a wonderful, heart-breaking, interesting book that is very difficult to put down at night to sleep and leaves the reader full of questions about our current state of faith in Western Christianity. I cannot say enough about it's tale of lost religious culture(much I was unaware of) and the warnings to a future in the Christian faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"very versatile","review":"This is a great product to own.

We started PECS with our son when he was 22 months old -- just weeks after he was diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder. After attending the 2-week intensive PECS camp, we used PECS as the primary vehicle for communication for our son. We watched in amazement as our child blossomed as he discovered the world of communication. When we started PECS, our son had no functional speech and spoke only a handful of word-approximations. One year later he speaks fluently (although his speech is still disordered), often using 6 to 8 word FUNCTIONAL sentences. I am certain that it is the PECS system that brought him this far. PECS is so much more than just trading \\"pictures for pretzles\\" and this book is an excellent resource for learning how to use PECS to its full capacity. We recommend it enthusiastically."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Picture's Worth: PECS and Other Visual Communication Strategies in Autism","review":"I find this extremely practical and well presented. Detailed examples of actual working practice are given that are both helpful and thought-provoking. It gives excellent explanations of both the why and how for using PECS.

I got it today and tried it after my normal cardio workout. After 4 minutes, my thighs and butt felt like they were on fire and I actually had to stop!

I could not keep up with Chris Freytag and got frustrated. I gave up on this DVD, but am able to follow the simple exercises of her Get Moving DVD..So I am back to Leslie Sasone, and Get Moving. I do find Chris Freytag a little too chipper for me. I want to exercise and not be distracted. I love Leslies's personality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"I was hoping for something new and different. Well, this is definately the same old exercises that I steer clear from, they overdevelop my quads. I don't see how the strength portion of the DVD gets rid of cellulite.Chris Freytag may be an awesome personal trainer and have a tight and toned body, but if she anticipates making any more choreographed cardio segments she needs to learn how to be with the music. I just couldn't do the cardio part because it was off the beat. And, the combos are not easy to follow, the patterns are not logical. Sorry I have nothing good to say. I am an aerobics instructor , so I know my subject well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cellulite beware","review":"Chris Freytag, lead in many Prevention videos, zeroes in on one of the most illusive problems shared by tons of women---- cellulite.

Unfortunately, the main character seemed just as shallow for awhile because very little about her is revealed until at least the half way point. A little more character development early on probably would have helped increase my interest in her and her troubles. Not real suspenseful, but characters with juicy secrets run rampant in this book. The story itself flows pretty well, so if you want a political/legal mystery, this will probably be entertaining for you. Just not quite my cup of tea.

Although I haven't had occasion to use them for heating, YET, I did run them to burn off the protectant so there would be no smell when I did finally use them inside. The functions and operation are clear and straight forward. The units occupy a small space and the timer functions well, making it easy to turn the unit on and off automatically. The wheels and fairly light weight (27 lbs) make them easy to move room to room. The only real complaint I have is the power cord. It is only six feet long and is connected to the front bottom of the unit. This makes it difficult to position the heater because of the way walls and furniture are arranged in my home. But facing possibly $5000 in oil bills this winter, I'm looking forward to spending just a few hundred in electricity instead to keep my household at least tepid instead of freezing."},{"rating":"2","title":"good heater","review":"Gives off a more heat than I expected.

It's a great feature to have, for safety and convenience. The way it's currently constructed, the timer, and therefore the entire radiator as packaged, is UNRELIABLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok for small room but only lasted 2 years","review":"This heater did an ok of keeping me warm (while 3 feet away) in my garage/office 15 feet by 20 feet)... it took a while to warm the area but was ok.

When I finally got a human being on the phone to discuss the issue, I was informed that the heater had been cancelled last year. It was however still being advertised on line. I asked the DeLonghi customer service representative what I was suppose to do with the broken heater. She told me to cut off the cord and send it back. I followed their instructions the next day. After repeated calls to find out the delivery date of the replacement heater, it came just before Christmas. This entire fiasco began on November 8, 2012. The second heater stopped working after being used for 4 days. The timer did not work and therefore I contacted DeLonghi, USA and to date they have yet to contacted me. Amazon on the other hand was professional. They picked up the second heater and have returned my payment.

I have an in law apartment (900 sq. ft.) that I converted to oil heat 3 years ago from electric heat. This being 2008 and oil being at $4.00 a gallon, I considered to \\"convert\\" back to electric. I purchased 4 of these radiators and showed my mother in law how to use them. She puts them on level one at 1/3 the way on the heat switch and her apartment is warm within 15 minutes. She has her regular oil heat thermostat set on 55 degrees and uses these as a main heat source. It's a shame that oil heat is now more expensive than electric heat, but I am glad that she can now \\"switch\\" between each energy source and I get to choose which one is cheaper seeing I pay the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This product barely gets warm on its highest setting.

Nothing to assemble, except unfolding the wheels. Sturdy on the wheel base, so cats & dog can't knock it over. I did not notice any fumes or odors at start-up. My furnace is out, so living from room to room. This heater heated the room we were in more quickly than described. Take heed from the instructions & don't plug it with any other electrical products.

Great deal cheaper than the mass merchandise stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy noisy","review":"I was very unsatisified with this heater. It did a fine job of putting out heat, but I was shocked at how much noise it made. whenever the heating element would turn on it made loud popping and splattering noises. It sounded like boiling oil. We had bought this unit to put in our babies room, but it makes way too much noise to be in a bedroom...and we're not talking \\"white noise\\", it's a very loud and annoying popping sound.Thank goodness amazon has such a hassle-free return policy. I sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"great silent heater","review":"This heater is completely silent and I am really happy I picked it for the bedroom. It does take about half an hour to heat up the room but that's exactly what the timer is for!And as a data point, my wattmeter says it consumes 750, 880 and 1620 watts at the three power levels. That means this heater realistically only has two power levels. :PThe only other completely silent choice that I know of would be a fan-less quartz heater that heats with infrared, but I am a bit concerned to leave such a heater on during the night. I use one during the day because it is more efficient (directional heat allows you to heat your desk only and not the rest of the room)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate","review":"Years ago, I had two Delonghi oil filled radiators, also rated at 1500 watts, and this unit is definitely inferior to the older ones. It is made of thinner metal, has thinner paint, and gives off less heat. Following the advice by the reviewers here, I let it run on my porch for 8 hours to burn off some of the initial smell. The first two nights I used it for heating, the fumes it gave off were more noticeable than the heat.Update: I bought this radiator to use in my 11x10 bedroom expecting it would enable me to turn down my furnace at night, but it doesn't. I've run it now for four nights on high in different parts of the room, and it raises the temp just one or two degrees. So I'm lowering my rating to 2 stars, and I'll probably be giving it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great heat output!","review":"I can't stand blower heaters and have tried a number of radiant heaters, but this one is amazing as to heat output. The room is fairly large, but I had to turn it down when it got going. Radiant heaters take longer to warm up, but they don't dry out the air. Now I will set the timer so that it warms up before I get up in the morning and I expect it will be quite toasty. Wheels don't like rolling on carpet, but they get there and it needs another handle on the other side as it is hard to drive with the one, but otherwise this heater is a find!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Efficient but stinky","review":"In terms of what a heater is supposed to do, it does the job. It heats up a room pretty fast. It even heated up a New England garage pretty fast. Why would I want to heat up a garage? Read on.When I first took it out of the box and plugged it in, there was a strong smell of hot paint. Fine, I thought, it's like new car smell. Give it a day or two and it will be all gone.Thirty days later the smell is as strong as ever. One of the experiments we did was to try running it flat out for a while to drive off the smell. We put it in a cold garage and let it run and run. The garage got quite toasty in spite of it being in the 20s outside. But it also got stinky. Nobody will let me run the heater in the house any more. The fumes irritate their sinuses and throats. Besides, the heater also makes fairly loud cracking or popping sounds as it heats up and cools down.Amazon has been kind enough to grant me a refund, which is outstanding customer support, given that it's been over 30 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best space heater ever!

We do not offer service on this model. We regret to inform you that we will not be able to assist you with your inquiry.\\" They will not send the needed part to me even though they have it.

A plus for this item is its three settings, but the thermostat is very confusing to use. I can't say if the heater has saved me money or not. However, a BIG NEGATIVE is that it gives off a lot of fumes. the brochure says it only does this when its new but that seems to be very untrue. It smells a little like kerosene combined with a funky musky odor and it emits this constantly. I found myself getting sick: chills in my hands, feet and legs as well as shortness of breath. the heat it gives off is very good, a strong radiant heat that heats the whole room (my room is about 12' by 12'), but the fumes are actually a health hazard and I believe this heater should only be used if you are able to ventilate your room while you are heating it (which kind of doesn't make much sense)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does it heat?

I would not recommend leaving this appliance running while not in the room because it is a fire hazard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth","review":"It heats well but you will experience only if you are sitting next to the heater. If you are 3 feet away, you will not notice heating effect even after 3-4 hours. I still decided to use. After an year, wheels came out. One day, it fell on floor and all parts are separated.

There was a smell at the initial start up which others have noted but it was insignificant after about 3 hours of use. The smell results from a chemical which they use to prevent the metal from rusting during shipping. At high heat this chemical burns off and there is an unpleasent odor that comes off. After around 2-3 hours most of the chemical and smell are gone. After that this heater warms up a room pretty quick even on the first setting. My room is fairly small so I am not sure if the first setting could warm up a much larger room. Using the third setting burns approximately 1500W compared to 700W at the first setting so there is a massive energy consumption difference. Overall, this heater is going to keep me warm during the notoriously long and cold Wisconsin winters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great little heater","review":"First one didn't work out of the box, but was exhanged very quickly.

We've only had this a short time, but so far, very happy.Updated review 2/13/2013: This oil-filled heater is still working well, no problems noted. Even with a 2 year old grandson who like to twist the timer wheel, and click the unit off and on!

The retro model was fantastic and warmed our large baement real well. Couldnt wait to see how well the other one works. Other one finally came but I didnt mind the wait since it was summer. Well let me tell you - it put another model of radiater from Honeywell that I had found on clearance at Home Depot to shame. The Delongi Safe Heat Dragon warmed our huge family room and the other did not warm a small bed room - maybe I can return the other to Home Depot!If you want HEAT - buy this model - it is great for the size. I was amazed!!Tammy"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't warm me up!","review":"I don't understand all the great reviews. This heater doesn't keep you very warm. It simply heats UPWARDS, not outwards, so you have to literally hold your hands above the unit to feel any warmth. I live in a small one-bedroom apartment and it's been in the 50s and 60s outside and I'm still very cold with this heater turned on. So it's not working too well. Also, it has a weird smell which does NOT go away. If you have a sensitive nose or any perfume/scent-type sensitivities/allergies, don't get this!!!!! It seems safe and it doesn't take up a lot of space, so that's good... oh and by the way, in the photo it looks like a medium to dark gray or silver, BUT it's actually a slightly off-white color. Hope this helped. Bottomline: If you tend to be cold, get a warmer heater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original Unit and Its Replacement Leaked Oil","review":"I thought this would be a great product, but the first unit I received never stopped giving off the ozone-like smell that all these radiators emit in the beginning. So, I got a replacement (thank you, Amazon, for making that easy). Sadly, the replacement had most of the same problem. If I ran the heater constantly, the ozone-smell would eventually diminish. However, if I let it sit for a couple days and then turned it on, the ozone-smell would be back, bad as ever. This made me think that there was some small leak of oil in both units. I had to return the second one, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works.","review":"We bought this to put at the base of the ill-conceived floor-to-ceiling windows of our rental apartment and it works well.

We live in Hosuton where it rarely gets truely cold (the sunroom is at 60 degrees when it is about 35 degrees outside), and this heater does the job of warming up the room quite efficently. The room is quite large; 16 X 16 with a 20 foot ceiling; but after about an hour of turning the heater on, the room starts to feel comfortable. I am not sure how it would perform in colder climates though, as the heat it produces is mild and diffused. The great part is that even after being on for a few hours, the unit is not too hot, and does not burn if touched, making it very safe for kids and pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what they said it would","review":"This heater works well to warm a small room and keep it warm. This style of heater is not the fastest way to warm a room but is efficient for keeping the room warm.

She greatly lacks the skills in rhythm, tempo, and intonation that are necessary to perform pieces even as elementary as the Sammartini effectively. In fact, the third movement of the Sammartini rushes the whole way through. It seemed as though the pianist was a measure behind the entire time.

This is how music should always be recorded, simple yet intimate, simple yet complex. I have never heard a bow run across strings like this and never have I heard a recording where the sound of finger movements was captured; Beschi's cello is as alive as he is in the later suites. This is simply the most gorgeous recording of one of the most beautiful pieces of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beschi is a genius","review":"Beschi is a genius. I have far more than a dozen of the Bach Cello Suites and this one by Beschi is near the very top of the echelon. I would not compare him with any other performer as he has put his own stamp on these pieces - he is quick, nimble, sharp, articulate and always lively. He holds your attention! I highly recommend him as a preferred and refreshing change of pace when you tire of your regular Bach cello favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best book about Greenwich ever!!!","review":"Lords of Greenwich almost certainly belongs at the top of the N.Y.

But this one is really sinking k d to the lowest level. I can't tell you how many fans of hers have said how deeply disappointed they are with the mindless music she's been doing lately.

A relaxing album that gives you enjoyable sounds to the ear.A definite recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Light on k.d. lang","review":"k.d. lang comes back with renewed energy.

First thing I did this morning was log on to Amazon.com and buy it. Some lyrics are dorky (though that seems somehow appropriate when you see her on stage) but you can't beat that KD love song sound. In this album, that sound is better than ever. Let it melt you."},{"rating":"2","title":"lush","review":"k.d. lang is back with yet another solid release. While I don't find this release to be as groundbreaking as Ingenue or All You Can Eat, it really manages to combine both albums strongest points into a bittersweet tribute to summer love. The instrumentation is tight and lang's vocals are up to the usual . . . which is a very good thing. I love how she isn't afraid of being lush and heartfelt, which is a rarity these days. \\"Summerfling,\\" \\"Curiosity,\\" and \\"Simple\\" are all standouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"the soundtrack for a \\"Summerfling\\"","review":"Listening to this cd on a hot summer evening is the equivalent of eating a dreamsicle: cool, mellow, and relaxing. This is the mellowest of the mellow k.d. cds and it's extremely satisfying. The track \\"Summerfling\\" is definitely my favorite, but the other tracks have a similar feel. The entire cd has a very cohesive feel and the tracks seem to melt into one another. Put this cd on repeat and enjoy the warm summer nights."},{"rating":"2","title":"good job K.D.","review":"Believe the rave reviews, this really is a great CD.

This is an interesting set- difficult to peg. But I encourage everyone to give it a go- you won't be disappointed either. I especially like the first three cuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"I love kd lang's voice. I have three copies of all her albums: one at home, one at work, and one for the car, which are only CDs I have in my 6-cd changer. But I only bought one of Invincible Summer. Something said only buy one. Now I know why. It's disappointing. None of the songs showcase her truly talented singing voice. I think the best songs are the first and last: Consequences of Falling and Only Love. The songs in between are simplistic in lyrics and her voice doesn't cover the ranges of her previous CDs. I'd recommend Drag, Ingenue, All You Can Eat, Shadowland if you are a newcomer to kd lang. There you can hear the truly talented and remarkable voice she has in a variety of genres. I still love her voice, but this CD is not one I am putting in my CD changer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sun Could Shine Brighter","review":"I have immense respect for the artistry of kd lang and wow, what a performer. She showed incredible diversity jumping from \\"Absolute Torch and Twang\\" to \\"Ingenue\\" early in her career and then things began to stall. \\"All You Can Eat\\" was half baked and \\"Drag\\" well....dragged. And here is \\"Invincible Summer\\" all pretty and shinny. Each song has the depth and staying power of a soap bubble. Her voice couldn't be better though and is the best pop music has to offer. It is just a shame she can't find more challenging material to use it with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Me Off","review":"Targeting new audiences is a great goal. I'm not sure that the elevator rider audience will appreciate \\"Invincible Summer,\\" however. Gone are the deep, emotional ballads in favor of lighter, sappy -- very sappy -- tunes. \\"Summerfling\\" sounds like a track that would run at the opening of a Doris Day-Rock Hudson movie. \\"It's Happening with You\\" is so free and groovy, you can almost picture Marcia and Greg Brady in the frontseat of the station wagon swaying from side-to-side, mouthing every word with bright smiles. It's as if Lang has inhaled a whole bong of happy for her latest release. To be sure, there are a few redeeming tracks like \\"The Consequences of Falling\\" and Lang's voice is on but this consumer was hoping for a little more of \\"Constant Craving,\\" as I am sure were the executives at Warner Brothers. I fully expect to hear k.d. Lang's \\"Invincible Summer\\" playing on the speakers at the neighborhood Denny's within months."},{"rating":"1","title":"K D Lang","review":"I love K D Langs old music. This was so bad that I was relieved when there was silence between the songs. Dull, bland lycrics and souless melodies. Anything is better than this! Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"K D is slipping","review":"I really should have test driven this album before buying it. K D has slipped into syrupy/sweet and inane lovesongs that sound like they were written by a love sick teenager. No punch, no guts, no style. Her backup music is easily ignorable, and the entire album blends into one big blur. Perhaps K D feels that she's playing to a capative audience who will buy anything that she produces. Pretty sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed fan","review":"lang's new CD, Invincible Summer, may likely be my most disappointing CD purchase in a long while. Her newest release has none of the lush quality and surprisingly little depth of some of her previous popular CD's. Unfortunately, this comes off as a rather so-so crossover to pop. Get back on the ballad track and rich music and lyrics we have come to expect and love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemons","review":"Initially seduced by the breezy exuberance of Invincible Summer, k.d. lang's homage to the California sound, I soon grew to dislike the majority of these eleven overdone tracks. Her sense of fun is camp, which elevates two good songs, \\"Summerfling\\" and \\"It's Happening with You,\\" and she lifts up the simple-minded \\"Simple\\" by the remarkable power of her voice. Yet rarely has a significant gift been squandered regularly on substandard material. (Call it Whitney Houston disease.) Lang hasn't had a collection of first rate songs since Absolute Torch \`n' Twang in 1989. Her ode to joy is weighted by philosophical musing, as evidenced by this quote, courtesy of Camus(!), that frames the inner sleeve: \\"In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.\\" \\"In this world of lemons, baby, you're lemonade,\\" courtesy of lang herself, is more to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected a whole lot more...","review":"I have a feeling kd has been spending too much time promoting causes and, as a result, has deglected her talent. This women has the best voice out there but this cd has no hint of her incredible ability. It pains me to rate this one so low, but honestly, it's not that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"with kennedy flair","review":"This is an ambitious CD, musically, vocally, lyrically and more. It doesn't always hit the bullseye, but I give k.d. a lot of credit for trying. At first I did not agree with some of the choices she made, but after a few listens, the tunes become a wonderful soundtrack to any summertime activity. I grew to love this cd. Sophisticated pop music (is that an oxymoron?) that gets better and better. K.d. never seems to take the easy road, but it's usually worth it to take the trip with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately from the soul","review":"I think that this is a great CD that is definately sung with feeling. With her own personal style and upbeat personality she's fun to watch perform too. I definately like the breath of fresh air (Even if she's been around awhile) she's brough to the scene of top selling music... Hold on to your record sales Brittany Spears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"k d lang at her finest in years","review":"It has been years since I first fell in love with this Canadian country gal's resonant vocals, and it's been a few years since she released a wholly satisfying album... This is a Wholly Satisfying disc from start to finish. When k.d. wraps her voice around a song like \\"Suddenly\\", she owns it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invincible Ignites","review":"Graced with one of the richest, most expressive voices in music, k.d. lang brings a special flair to love songs. And so when she takes on a gossamer tune like \\"Summerfling,\\" the first single on her new album, she gives the melody all the warmth and languor of a sweet summer breeze.It's the perfect sound for an album about falling in love. Writing and recording in her new hometown of Los Angeles, lang takes the local influences -- Bacharach, the Beach Boys, techno -- and melds them into her own kind of majestic pop. And while producer Damian le Gassick adds some sleek textures to the songs, he's smart enough to keep lang's voice prominent in the mix.So if lang acknowledges the risks of romance in \\"Curiosity\\" (\\". . . basking in the sun/ seems dangerous and fun\\"), the joy in her voice is infectious. And inspiring.Invincible Summer ignites and infuses us with well seasoned love."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALRIGHT k.d.!","review":"This CD is more than amazing! It's INVINCIBLE! I was very hesitant to buy it, at first. My friends raved on and on and on and I was just like \\"Whatever\\". It was all hype to me. Until one night, I made a mistake. A great mistake. I thought I was putting Don Henley into my CD player. It was his case but I didn't look at the actual CD. Out comes a beautiful voice and a ravishing melody. \\"Who is this temptress and what has she done to Don Henley?\\" I thought to myself. I got very confortable and listened to the rest of the CD. Afterwards I looked at the CD and very nearly broke it in shock. My friends punched me in the arm the next day and welcomed me to the club."},{"rating":"2","title":"k. d. does bubblegum","review":"If you like the Beach Boys and general pop music (soda pop), you'll really love this album. k. d. seems very, very happy, happy, joy, joy, which is wonderful for her, but she has a range and talent that can do so much more than this. I miss the torchy, achy stuff like \\"Crying,\\" and the piece she sang on Red, Hot and Blue. I don't know why, but Shelley seems to be right, \\"The sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thoughts.\\" But, even though this album is not my kind of music, I gave it four stars because she's just so fantastic, even with material like this -- and I know that many people just absolutely love The Beach Boys, so for them, this album is indeed a treat, and I would highly recommend it to them. I'm still waiting for the album from her that will completely blow me and everyone else away, and she's one of the few people brilliantly talented enough to do it. She sings like a goddess. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love that kd!","review":"If, like me, you are a HUGE kd fan and if, unlike me, you do not already have this album, why?? It's a great source of listening pleasure. Track three 'Suddenly' is worth the price of the album itself, betcha can't stop playing that one once you have heard it, I just want it to go on and on.

The title of the album comes from Albert Camus' quote, \\"In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.\\" Her last two albums, \\"Ingenue\\" and \\"Drag\\" both had darker tones, and a sense of sad longing. The tone of this album shows that she has indeed come out of the depths of winter into the sun, offering upbeat, cheerful tunes. Her vocals have never sounded better! Particularly good are \\"The Consequences of Falling\\" and \\"Extraordinary Thing.\\" Grab a copy of this CD and take your sweetheart to the beach -- you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful album!","review":"Perhaps I'm partial to this album because I just started my summer fling!

Le Gassick is known for producing Moby and Madonna too. kd's voice sounds amazing and it is great to hear how happy she sounds throughout this cd. \\"Invicible Summer,\\" \\"Extrodinary Things,\\" and \\"The Consequences of Falling\\" are all top-notch. kd's new release is sure to please her ardent fans and will most definately draw in many new fans.

I rushed out to buy this cd after reading a great review which had caused me to expect it to be the record of my summer. I'm a kd fan since the mid 80's and I am really disappointed. It is just so much mediocre musak with too many synth sounds, and vapid sweet lyrics. I have listened to it about 8 times in the last three days, hoping it would grow on me, but I cannot for the life of me remember a single melody or lyric. Compare this to the new Sinead I picked up on the same day, played the same # of times, and spent the last three days humming every waking hour. I'm sorry kd, it's back to listening to your old stuff for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"k.d. does it again","review":"There's little I can add to what other reviewers have written, but most have based their thoughts on the stereo CD version. In this case, though, we're discussing the high resolution DVD-Audio release.Take k.d.'s silky-smooth voice and make it better? That's exactly what happens here. The added clarity and dynamic range are used to good advantage. My only gripe is that surround information is sparse, at best. The surround mix keeps most of the sound in the front, with very little happening in the back speakers. Still, a wonderful recording for k.d. fans.But if you're trying to show off your DVD-Audio system, you'd do better with Fleetwood Mac."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whole New Ballgame","review":"After listening to this fantastic album on \\"DVD-Video\\"(See review below),I went out & bought a \\"DVD-Audio\\" player to see if it would bring any more life to the surround sound. Although the surround aspect is still rather timid,\\"DVD-Audio\\" did blow away the \\"DD\\" mix as it should. Although \\"Dolby Digital\\" is offered for \\"DVD-Video\\" players,it cannot compare to the stunning quality that \\"DVD-Audio\\" brings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timid, Conservative Surround Mix","review":"It's interesting listening to the different approaches to mixing stereo recordings into surround sound. At this stage of the game, each mix almost serves a different philosophy of how to deal with sound coming from multiple channels. k.d. lang's approach, while the music is mildly interesting, could have benefited from a dramatic, bold surround mix. Instead, it holds back and pulls punches. I love how the WEA releases are playable in three different surround modes, depending on your equipment. But here, the results are timid and conservative. Too bad. This is one example of how a bold surround mix could have literally added a new and interesting dimension to an otherwise borderline effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, but ...","review":"Most of the songs chosen for this CD do NOT do k.d.'s voice justice (except for the Consequences of Falling)! I ordered the cd from amazon. When my package arrived I ripped it open and slid it into my player waiting for the greatest voice to sing me into another world. Instead I sat this with disappointment drowning my ears. I was expecting to be swept away like I was with \\"Ingenue\\" or the under-rated \\"All You Can Eat\\". If only I could pick the songs and arrangements for her! Maybe next time I will be swept away, because I sure wasn't with \\"Invincible Summer\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"regretably shallow","review":"I have deeply enjoyed kd's work, but I find her on going releases increasingly stylized, but empty.

She still has the best set of pipes in the music industry and she's wasting them on blandness. Her voice has so much range and clarity that it's wasted on music like this. She should concentrate on versions of 1940's big band songs, or a collection of some of the songs she's done in concert (like Roy Orbison's \\"Crying\\", or the absolutely mesmerizing \\"Barefoot\\" ...only available as one cut on the first \\"Unplugged\\" collection CD), or collaborate on an a capella CD with Bobby McFerrin ...now, that would be worth buying! This stuff isn't worthy of her abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Summer","review":"What a disappointment this CD is. I can't tell where one song ends and the other starts. It all sounds the same. I listened to the CD several times hoping that there was something wrong with my CD player but sadly that was not the case.I have been a big fan of K D Lang and this CD really is horrible.

They worked fine with my stainless CIA .357, which has the longer grips. The gel cushion is really nice when firing 50-100 rounds from small guns like these. Anyway it's just the combination of small fingers, short grips etc. with the .38 - if there's a women's model of this glove, I missed it, but I sure would like to try it since range time with the Airweight is punishing & that's the real reason I bought the gloves in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"So violent","review":"The Set up for this book was creative and had great potential.

He is at such an elevated status that a grand performance goes without saying.Here, in El Palacio De Bellas Artes, recorded live on May 12, 1990, Juan Gabriel, is accompanied by a huge symphony orchestra, mariachi band, grand chorus and also a young boys chorus which sings along with him and they also entertain the audience with their musical instruments.This tape set is in two volumes, and I prefer this Vol. I simply because of the length that the mariachi backs him up. With the mariachi, he sings many of his classics, which I can't identify the names of many of them. He speaks solely in Spanish.As always, he shines! With two brilliant costume changes, he looks like the great performer he is. The tape is 90 minutes.If you enjoy Juan Gabriel, the video and CD \\"Juntos Otra Vez\\" with Rocio Durcal is spectacular!

About a year ago, I bought a set of them to use at work and they were perfect...just like I remembered them. Today I went to the store to purchase replacements, as they old ones are starting to wear out, and was horribly dissapointed.The quality of this product has greatly deteriorated. The old markers had nice quality chisel tips. The new markers have a cheap piece of felt cut at an angle and stuck in the end. They do not color nicely at all, and trying to use them is very frustrating. They also do not smell as strongly as the old markers did.I am urging you all out there NOT to buy these markers. They are not what you are expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be great but quality has declined","review":"I've been buying Mr. Sketch markers for several years for my 4 kids (avid artists...LOTS of marker use). I just bought a new box and was very disappointed to see that the tips are different. They are a much softer foam and easily damaged, as my preschooler can attest. Nor do they draw a clean, fuzz-free line, even when brand new. The previous tips were indestructible and smooth, with long-lasting ink. I'm sorry to see the poor quality of these. Mr. Sketch, please go back to the old tips!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pastels are too Pale","review":"I was excited to get a larger box of these markers but was very disappointed that I am unable to use the 5 or 6 additional colors on my charts.

I bought a pack for my children a few years ago and they lasted for so long. It's amazing how much color they pack into each fun scented marker. I just bought a new pack for my daughter and they were just as good as the ones purchased 3 years ago. My kids are excellent about taking good care of the markers. They put the caps back on after use, and then I put them away in a cabinet until the next use, unlike the cheaper brands of markers. All the scents are wonderful (well, except for licorice!). My only complaint is that years ago these used to come in a styrofoam-like container with a sliding cover. I really prefer that to the box because after so much use the box wears out despite taping and retaping every couple of months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great markers!","review":"My kids haven't stopped using these markers since they got them for Christmas.

The owner's manual that comes with the blender will provide all the basics that you need to start blending, and you won't have to put up with the smart-a** attitude with which the writer tries to entertain.All of the major US blender manufacturers put out great owner's manuals for decades, because they realized that the more their customers used the blenders, the more blenders they'd sell. You can find excellent owner's manuals full of recipes on EBay for a few Dollars apiece. Most of what I've seen in this book appears to be adapted or taken whole out of some of those.Perhaps it's because I'm in my fifties and not a teenager or twenty-something, but I like cookbooks written by adults, for adults.

They'd all rush over for the mini-skit \\"I'm a cow\\", and go hysterical when the 4 Wiggles would stand together flapping their arms and raise into the air. But that's the old Wiggles tapes. The new shows feature rock video style \\"quicky-jerky\\" filming and lots of boring real-life stuff (e.g. boat on the river, playing in Central Park, the alligator guy talking and talking), and the tots don't follow whats happening, don't catch the sophisticated references, can't understand the older concepts. Basically, the Wiggles lose their audience trying to be more \\"professional\\". They have lost the style and the feel that made the tots love them. How sad.

This story tells of her awakening to the world's unpleasantries and discovering love.The characters were interesting and the romance enjoyable although predictable. It was nicely wrapped up with feel good ending that made you feel as though the book was worth it. Unfortunately, Sharon Shinn's creation takes place in a world that somehow seems incomplete.

I picked up this book and was very happily surprised.The beginning makes the book seem like an average medieval fantasy, but you are nonetheless drawn in by the superb writing style. Everything escalates and gets more exciting, more interesting, until you're flying through the book without realizing it. I could not put this book down for the entire second half of it, because it had gotten so good. It has points of aching romance, points of fascinated horror, and all of it ties together very well for a good ending for a novel.I recommend this book to anyone that likes some fresh and interesting romance and adventure.

When that effort stalled, she jump-started her Nashville reputation with a couple of solid albums for Giant. Looking back, it rather seems she jinxed herself by trying to be a Sheena Easton clone.

It shut off after not being in use for a while and the retractable cord was awesome for storing the iron. It seemed to iron fabric nicely and quickly. It put out a great amount of steam. We are not heavy-duty ironers, only about 4-5 shirts a week. After about a month or two, we noticed that the cord wasn't retracting very well and that the auto shut off would go into effect much quicker. We still managed to get our ironing done, though. Then, yesterday, the iron just died. The auto shut off feature took over always. As soon as you turned the iron on, the little red indicator light would start blinking and the iron refused to get even warm. It was a bit scary because the handle got pretty warm, but nothing else did. I would never buy this again. We bought it in October and 3 1/2 months later it won't work..."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are way better irons","review":"I bought this less than a year ago and it has already broken down. Just stopped heating. I can't seem to find a iron that lasts anymore. I had a Black & Decker that lasted about 10 years. I bought another B&D for $50 after a recommendation in Consumer Reports. That one last a year and I bought this one. Aside from just no heating there are other things that I don't like about this iron. 1. It's hard to fill water. Water spills all over the place when filling. My B&D had a little hole that allowed air to escape, so no spillage. 2. The reservoir cap is flimsy. You have to be careful to not break it off. 3. Because it has a retractable cord, the cord doesn't stick up away from the iron so it gets in the way. 4. The cord is too short. Doesn't give me enough to manuever around. I think I'll go back to a cheaper B&D iron if I have to keep replacing one every year. Maybe I'll get lucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem iron","review":"The first time I used this iron both the spray and the steam worked.The very next day the spray did not work...and after all these months is still not working.I would not purchase a Sunbeam product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky, leaky","review":"From the day I bought this product it was flawed.

Let me say that so far I am only to chapter three and have suffered through every page of it. It is filled with basic, common sense, (i.e., the best way to write about film is to take notes during the screening. and if you can, it's good to see the movie more than once), which is explained in several pages. Give me a break. Not only does he present basic knowlnedge but he repeats himself in so many words. The truth is, the only way to successfully analize film is to develop an eye for symbolism. No book, I don't care who writes it, can teach you that. It is something that must be personally developed. Why someone would waste their time writing a book trying to teach people how to do that blows my mind. I give it one star, cause after all, everyone deserves a little comething for at least trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent guide","review":"This book is an invaluable guide to writing about film.

THERE IS NO BRA. PERIOD. What there is, is a reinforcing panel that extends from the top seam to the hem, with absolutely no differentiation or other reinforcement to help hold anything up.

The proportions are off as well. I have a very small build and ordered a medium. Big mistake! I should have gotten a small. The tank goes all the way up to my underarms making it uncomfortable around the area, but it's not too big of a deal due to the fact that it is a soft, cotton material...not particularly something I want to work out in.

Through the storylines that he creates and photographs, Hogencamp works through some of the trauma he has suffered; from his alter-ego doll getting a pasting from the SAS (but getting his revenge later) to the loneliness of his life which he somewhat alleviates by having various female dolls in his stories represent specific unattainable women he meets in everyday life.

Amazon.com and the company who manufactures this tent were both very satisfactory in customer service and resolving this process, but we are now tentless and recovering from all the frustration this particular purchase caused us before looking into getting another tent (of a different brand).

This Canon will process and copy originals faster than the Panasonic. It won't transmit faster though b/c it is on 33K speed. On the line we use the fax for, we get about 1 fax every 30 minutes... light duty. So I don't know how it would handle faxes every 5 minutes.

At first glance the cover image seemed to be some sort of creepy beast glaring out at its audience. Possibly that was the intent, hence the title? Then it became apparent the subject was a very unfocused woman with wind blowing her hair. For me, this image was somehow disturbing and repelling. Finishing the first story \\"The Ugliest Pilgrim\\", I felt less than enchanted, but tried to read the next one. It was so confusing and cryptic, I left it and tried for a third. By this time I was fed up and decided I would not waste my time any further. Betts' writing style may excite some as being oh-so-hip.

I like the potential of The Loose Nuts, plus the cover art is, uh, interesting. Typical ska guitar, nothing special. Good horns, very together for a debut album (or at least the only one I've ever heard of). I like the singer's voice. Best song is definitely Wishen. It has great lyrics, a good sax solo (as most the songs do). And I believe it was on the American Pie soundtrack (which you shouldn't buy), giving the Nuts some notoriety. I also liked Roots, another good song. I did miss the Jennifer Aniston song though, which is good stuff. If The Loose Nuts keep at it, they'll turn out okay. So if you like typical third wave ska (a la Reel Big Fish's \\"Turn the Radio Off\\" and Less Than Jakes \\"Losing Streak\\"), buy this album.

It simply shows the text of each Amendment, then spends the entire rest of the video showing film clips from the news and asking, \\"What Right are these people talking about?\\". At the end of it all, the student is apparently able to identify a Right as being (sort of) in the Bill of Rights, but that's all.This tape is marketed to public schools, according to the tape's intro, but as an educational tool, I deem it worthless.

There is so much to like about this series and very, very little to detract from it. The two main characters are compelling, the setting quite unique, the culture clash between the north and south dramatic (I haven't been able to decide if this is a commentary on the differences between the north and south US in times past - but it is intriguing). As far as the sexism goes, until you have read the series to its end, any conclusions are presumptive at best. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire series and would heartily recommend them to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Female Character=Heroine on Par with Little Mermaid","review":"[Spoiler in the text] I originally picked up this book because I wanted a new genre to try with my husband. Since the back cover implied a strong male and female character we thought it would be a good choice. The male chauvinist protagonist didn't bother me, it added some character. What angered me was the inability of the female character to actually win a fight. The big climatic battle scene has Del being pushed out of the ring for big strong warrior guy to save her because she is too dumb to realize the other warrior has picked up new tricks and adjust to them. But never fear, warrior guy is there despite the fact that he is supposedly in a poor physical state. If the reader is expecting a strong female character who is capable of taking care of herself, it would be nice if she actually won a fight, especially in the climatic battle scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"It STINKS!","review":"I know that this review will probably never get put in, but I must give my opinion.If you can get past the first fifteen pages of this book than mister you're a braver man than I.The main character is a womanizing characature of a chauvanist pig. Now it may just be me, but I believe that the main character of a book should (if not be likable) at least get you on their side. His first appearance in the book where he has a tavern wench on each knee and lustfully eyeing the heroine of the story does not exactly cause one to evoke much sympathy for his situation.Also the author should work on her creating of a more realistic swear word; and also on not using it as frequently, such as once or twice per page.I have read worse books, but thankfully my mind has blocked them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.

I ordered it not knowing what to expect but enjoyed it so much I immediately had to buy the rest in the series. I love the characters and the way they relate to one another. When I bought the book I had read a review stating that Jennifer Roberson was simply trying to force her opinions on others about feminism but I only found it to be the way a man and woman would behave who both thought they had the right of it. She did not make the woman out to be perfect or right all the time and both of the main characters learned and grew to be more accepting of the worth of others for who they are.

Chapter two, author without any kind of prepartion took a journy in 60s, 70s, and 80s political turmoil in Iran. The story lacked introduction, body, climax and proper conclusion. The characters were not fully developed and there was no real story line. For example, author wrote about Samrad, who would do coup de grace and at the same time, he was a political prisoner. Samrad fate was unkown.Mr. MILANI trasnlated word \\"peykar\\" as beautiful. However, \\"payker\\" means war in Persian language.All in all, this book lacked proper story telling structure.Please be advise that this comment is meant to be constructive critism and there is no personal hate against Dr. Milani, as a matter of fact, I do not know him whatsoever, for further reading kindly read the comment section.Thank you.Doroud va sepas faravon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Dinosaur book","review":"A very good book.

I am going to throw away this CD. I don't want my child listening to songs that advocate hitting him or using such negative words like stupid.

Pet peeve perhaps but even still the book is not likely to be of interest to the current casual reader.If you plan to live in Talkeetna and want to know the history of the era written in small town newspaper gossip column style then read this book.

He gets off on tangents that seem irrelevant to the primary focus of his topic. He spends a lot of time and words building up the credibiliy of his primary witness, only to reveal near the end that this witness has credibility issues.

Boring and ordinary, a minor daughter of the Greek god Poseidon who has lost her memory; the setting is filled with new and strange creatures, faiths, beliefs and concepts and he has to go back to the Greeks? He writes horribly, flooding the pages with recursive descriptions of pain and discomfort rather than advancing the narrative, developing a character, introducing a plot...My best guess is that he spent a week reading nothing but his own work at TSR, drank a couple of gallons of ink and vomited on some clean sheets of paper.

I especially enjoyed Studer's personal story and recognition of himself as \\"the problem\\" and his transformation as an effective leader and organizational catalyst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book","review":"Was recently able to go to a Studor group seminar.

I wanted a mystery -- I got endless sermons. I know plenty of people who live real christian values, and they don't go about talking endlessly about Jesus. The \\"romance\\" was really contrived, with adult people pretending there are reasons for them not to date (I couldn't find any explanation), so that Ruby could agonize on every page about how much Wesley turns her on but \\"alas no! I must guard against temptation!\\". Like a bad Victorian gothic. The mystery got lost in all this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's fun, fast-paced, and an upbeat read","review":"Review by By Gretchen HoffmanRedheaded Ruby Taylor is back with more adventures in book two of the Ruby Taylor Mystery series. This book is just as entertaining and hilarious as book one. Ruby's crazy, stubborn wit makes this story as great and intriguing as Ms. Dunn's awesome title.Ruby's education (a master's degree in literature) finally gets put to good use. She gets hired to teach at the local university when one of the professors dies. But as Ruby begins to look into the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death, the more suspicious things appear. If that wasn't enough, Ruby has to deal with family issues that inexplicably pop up. Add a dash of romance (or lack thereof), her new faith, a piping hot mocha, and you've got Ruby's quirky life.Ruby gets herself into even more crazy situations in this novel. It's fun, fast-paced, and an upbeat read. My kudos to Ms. Dunn. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weights are o.k., case is not.","review":"Weights are average - they'll do the job.

The three different size weight sets fit easily into their slots in the case and the flat case can be slid under furniture or against walls for easy storage. The case is cheap and too much wear and tear could easily prevent it from closing. The outer material of the weights is good for exercise, not grimy or slick as some plastic coated or just metal weights can be. Also, larger weights are available from the manufacturer, so once I'd graduated to heavier weights, I was able to find some that were just as nice and easy to afford. A good set for a person just starting weight training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apex Neoprene Dumbbell Set","review":"I am using the dumbbells as part of my physical therapy.The product was just what I expected and I am pleasedwith the quality.

The carrying case is definitely way too flimsy it you're going to use it to carry the weights about. I simply keep the weights under my bed and slide the box out when I want to use them; so, for my purposes it does the job fine.The weights themselves are very nice with a comfortable grip and decently priced. Overall, I would recommend these if you want a nice set of weights, but definitely don't get this over something else simply because of the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandson Loves - but cord has come loose","review":"My grandson (age 2-3/4) is a total Thomas fan and especially loves the cranes.

We're about to take the crane apart (there are obvious Phillips head screws) and hope we can re-tie the cord.This is the first of many Thomas series that has had a problem, but since it's quite a bit more expensive than trains, I hope we can fix it.

Unfortunately, one could never tell that from this video transfer. There have been two previous editions of this film on DVD, both abysmal in quality. Razor Digital has a well-earned reputation for poor transfers, but I figured if the quality were merely bad, it would be a significant improvement over the previous editions. Unfortunately, the Razor Digital edition ranks with the two previous editions as unwatchable. In this case, the colors are extremely over-saturated and unrepresentative of those in the film, distorting its look. The resolution is also quite fuzzy, like a poor third-generation VHS copy. And needless to say, it is non-anamorphic, although it hardly matters with a transfer this poor. I hope that someday this film will get the transfer it deserves.

However, no one will tell you more about what the task of preaching really is than Lloyd-Jones, the finest English language preacher of the 20th century, without a doubt. Yes, he is 'old school'; but it is his kind of preaching that brings the power of the gospel to bear on people to truly change them -- not all the dramatic sideshow tricks of today's 'entertainment' churches.

While this is an OK watch for thriller fans, it is inferior to the original in every way. In fact the original is more intense, more graphic and just more fun! This film looked and felt like a Lifetime TV movie especially with Ward playing the new wife in this tame and pointless remake.If you looking to watch a film about a psychotic Stepfather, skip the watered down remake and look for the original, which has finally gotten a long over due DVD release this past year, no doubt because of the remake, so I guess the remake did serve a purpose after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Master Class In How To Make A Horrible Film","review":"So you say you wanna be a schlocky filmmaker?

Therefore, there is little or no suspense beyond the general startle by slasher set-up.

Here's just a partial: on the twelfth hole (a 150 yd. par 3) our hero hits a tee shot that leaves him 125 yds. away. This is presented as a normal occurrence. On at least one occasion, the protagonist's caddy, a purported expert on the game, advises him not to go for the green in two on a par four hole, its too risky, lay up and take your four. Huh??? And just wait and see how our hero takes down the bad guy, truly unbeleivable.Aside from the egregious golf errors, the actions of the police are inexplicable as well.Reading this book is like watching a train wreck, its so bad you can't take your eyes away.A total mess. Poorly written, poorly edited, unlikeable characters, too. Save your money and your time, stay away from this groaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars for this book!","review":"This is my second attempt to review this book. The first was too critical of the author to publish the review, or so they advised me. Let's start with what this book is not. It is not an attempt by the author to be funny. It is not a novel which displays the least understanding of the Master's golf tournament. It is not a novel which displays the least understanding of the game of golf - it's rules - it's nomenclature or it's history. It is - in short - the worst novel by a successful author that I have ever read and I have enjoyed Mr. Bernhardt's other efforts. It deserves no stars. It should be avoided at all costs. Fair warning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Golf novel at it's worst","review":"Terrible! To call this book terrible is an insult to all bad golf novels ever written. The author has no clue about his subject what-so-ever. How the publisher let this tripe get by is beyond me. The book lost me when the author mentioned \\"watertraps\\" and \\"pros' wearing shorts\\" at Augusta National. Silly putty golf ball centers, please. Anyone who has ever spent any time around golf knows that golf ball centers are made from Chinese herbs and goat eyes.I have read hundreds of golf books over the years, and this book ranks last by a long shot. Do not waste your time and energy on this poor excuse for a golf novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOUBLE BOGEY AT BEST","review":"Final Rounds was my first mystery in years. Being a golf addict, I was hoping this book could keep my interest. Final Rounds is a very easy read and the characters are clearly defined. Regretfully, Mr. Bernhardt resorted to old cliches with very little originality. The concept of the book is great. The lead character, Mr. Cross is predictable and its a real shame especially with his personality (big shot golfer, lots of talent, ladies man and etc.). The ending is totally unpredictable and had nothing to really do with the story. It's almost as if the last 60 pages were quickly written to end the nightmare. I really expected so much more and was very disappointed. The fact that I finished the more is more of an accomplishment than this literary work. Better luck next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the publishers should be ashamed of themselves","review":"This is probably the worst book ever written. Obviously Mr. Bernhardt knows nothing about golf and Ballatine Books should never have published it. Now I know why it was only $1 at our library sale. It is a 'tee box' not a 'tee off', people 'play golf' not 'golf' and who would even think that a 9 iron would be an alternate club to a driver? Augusta should sue for defamation of character. Aside from the golf gaffs, the plot was perdictable and stupid. Do even ask about the dialogue. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"FORE! Warned...","review":"The dialogue is so bad that it makes you forget how ridiculous the plot is. Do not, under any circumstances, even look at this book. Its only purpose in life is as a paper weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a golfer -- stay away from this book!","review":"Let me make this quick. I really like Ben Kincaid and have no intention of discontinuing buying and reading Mr. Bernhardt's books. However, I wish I had read the reviews posted on Amazon before picking this book off the bargain table at a not-to-be-disclosed local bookseller. It was below average as mystery and just plain awful as a golf story. STAY AWAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best","review":"If you believe that the Oscar Peterson Trio with Ray Brown and Herb Ellis was the best Peterson trio ever, this is a CD for you.

What more needs to be said or known?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Like The Instruments are singing!","review":"This is a great Hot Jazz, Bebop, Hot Jazz box set. I recommend this to anyone who loves music of the 1940s. This music will get you up dancing. A lot of the bands are forgotten, but they're remembered again through this box set. I wish they would make music like this today- Instrumental music. Its like the Instruments are singing. You'll enjoy this. If you don't I give your money back!

Many of us who actually use phones (including smartphones) for business have been repeatedly forced to leave these multimedia toys in the car befor entering a courthouse, high tech lab or many other locations that do not allow cameras. Treos and most CE machines suffer the same fate. The camera-free Blackberry is a godsend.Afer looking into the 7130c, I found a lot of terrific business features in a nice package. The phone quality and battery life are excellent, and the email works perfectly. The menus are very intuitive, and the suretype is a decent compromise for a comfortable size. My wish list would be for voice dialing and an external keyboard. However, there is not a whole lot to improve upon for the business user."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cingular Vs. Tmobile","review":"As a former 4 year customer of Tmobile, I was very pleased with the deal I got on here with this PDA. With Tmobile, I have been using the same phone for the last year. I wanted to upgrade to a PDA. I was willing to extend my contract, and the best they could do is give me $50 off on the Tmobile Dash. With Cingular, I have found a better rate plan, and I got a brand new PDA for free.

I never would have paid full price for this so-so album with only 7 songs on it. There's a few good songs on it - Flippin' Out and Wild Animal are sexy, Samuelle is a haunting sounding slow song, and Strap On Robbie Baby is my personal favorite because of the 80's rock guitar. The other songs however are very poor: Mechanical Emotion is a mechanical bore, Crazy Maybe is stupid, and the lead single Pretty Mess is plain - I have no idea why that was a single.One thing all the songs have in common though are that all of the lyrics are bizarre and make no sense, but of course, Vanity probably wrote all of the songs while high on drugs (she admitted during her whole career she was on cocaine heavily).Overall, it's a forgettable 80's album but it might be worth purchasing for a laugh as long as you don't pay much for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you need as a new parent","review":"My husband and I borrowed this video and four others from our local library. My first impression, before watching the video, was this is going to be one of those hokey, cutesy videos with Joan Lunden. I wasn't expecting much in the way of learning anything. Well I have now learned to not follow your first impression! It was well done and very informative. I am now looking for the video to buy. She goes step by step through different topics and has other mothers and her own childrens' pediatrician on hand to help answer questions. This is definitely a must have for new parents! My husband and I learned stuff that we never knew or thought of before."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the basics and more","review":"This DVD was an introduction to Israeli point shooting. The DVD also covered the basics of room clearing, structure fighting basics, as well as other topics not often covered in a DVD of this sort, or any where for that matter. For example how to search someone, how to reload a gun with one hand, obscure for someone who just wants defensive shooting, but very good to know and interesting to see.

It is a must see for those of us who want to learn about this topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read a lot better.","review":"I am a special forces enthusiast and I admit that i have read almost every book out there on the subject. Never fight fair is essentially a compilation of old war stories that often sound unbelievable and straight out of movies. If you like to hear old \\"core lore\\" and enjoy the simple-minded, entertaining novel then read this but if you are a military enthusiast like myself then try to steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good history","review":"Having read quite a few books on the SEALs, I liked this oral history of the US Navy SEAL action in Vietnam. It is hard to go wrong when you just let the subject tell their story and put those words on paper. The stories are colorful as well as insightful to the riverine operations the SEALs took part in throught the Vietnam war. Not only are stories told, but a look at weapons, uniforms and other areas of the operations are looked at as well. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the SEALs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very mediocre","review":"If you're a SEALs or Special Forces fanatic like me you'll read this no matter what any review says just because you're so desperate to clue into these guys' stories. I've read just about every personal account I can get my hand on and eventually found my way to this one. It's really not very good if you're interested in Vietnam action. One whole section is devoted to stories about skydiving. One chapter is an interview with Rudy Boesch's wife about her experience skydiving? Still want to read? Because there is so little battle stories I found the chapters on SDV operation the most interesting. All in all a very mediocre book. Read this one if you're really as desperate as I am for every word you can find about these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a good book, but there are better","review":"I thought it was a prety good book, I have read alot better but i think the reson why i gave it four stars instead of five , is because i have read so many other books on seals that i have read all the good ones and all the bad ones so i thought it was in between good and bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Finish","review":"I would have to agree with some of the other reviews. The original series is worth reading, but do yourself a favor and skip the Enthroned. The quality of the writing declined between the first and second series, and I am guessing that her publisher was disappointed in sales for enthroned and told her to wrap it up when she was half way through book three, leaving the ending rushed, disappointing and unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, and bad","review":"Should have stop reading after the first five books. I think the author just wrote the extra three books for money. The book is just full of stupid dialogue. No characters development. Everyone is so one dimensional. Problem solves faster than I can flip the page. I will be real careful from now on buying this author book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharon Green's Idiosyncracies Crowd Narrative","review":"Like some other reviewers, I was bothered with Ms. Green's insipid moralizing, whiny and paper-thin characters and tired plot devices. Honestly, how many times can Tamrissa pick a fight with someone? At first her new-found aggressiveness was endearing but by the end of the second series I had enough of the brat.And tea. Holy sakes alive, what does this woman have over tea? It is like a love affair...does Lipton give her a cut every time she mentions the disgusting drink?The first series was palatable (barely!) and this second series is pure drivel. One has to wonder: does the woman have any artistic intergrity or is she in this to 'make a buck' at the expense of her loyal readers (misguided as they may be)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"I just saw a showing of this movie at a theatre and I must say it was amazing. Great filming. It had an indie feal and would switch from scenes of surfing to that of the local area so you never got bored of one thing. It also has amazing surfers riding waves from greenland to inia. It is worth the 40 bucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The new Standard for Vintage Halloween reference","review":"This new book excells in the areas of detailed information and rare items not seen in the previous 7 books released on the subject. The scarcity index is a great tool for comparing rarity between items and will help collectors make up their minds when faced with multiple buying options. There is extensive information on dating items that goes far beyond what has been touched upon in other books, including histories of maker's marks. The photos are well taken and highlight some of the rarest and most beautiful halloween decorations ever produced. The book has a great feel to it, reads well, and is crisply designed.

Betsy Dillard Stroud's writing is as colorful as her painting. Her book is full of beautiful paintings, elegant prose, and creative ideas. Through her skill as a writer, she takes the reader on a humorous and interesting journey that combines technical skill with a masterful use of color. Even for those of use who are not artists, Painting From the Inside Out is entertaining and deserves a place on the coffee table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I went through my kitchen and replaced just about all my dinner ware and serving ware with Sango Nova Blue ware. It was quiet pretty and looked terrific when serving different dishes. The blues really made the food pop visually. Unfortunately, within a year, just about all of the dish ware was destroyed. I do not have a dishwasher, so everything is hand washed, but that should not make any difference anyway. Everything was developing micro cracks within months leaving me with chips on just about everything. When the dishes started falling apart (and I do mean that they would fall apart just sitting in the cabinet, just holding them when washing, or even while serving dinner) I had had enough. I threw at all away and replaced everything. While it looks pretty, this stuff is truly junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"good size","review":"I bought a set of Sango Black Nova dishes with completer set of bowl and platter. The set came with dinner plates,mugs and round plates, but I found I needed more plates for side dishes or desserts. I was delighted to find them at Amazon, and they were SQUARE. Of the two sets I ordered, one set arrived broken due to poor packing. Amazon made it easy to return and sent a new set in a timely fashion.I love these dishes. I have had no problems with chipping. They're in the dishwasher and microwave every day. I plan to buy more pieces or ask for them as a mother's day gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"uneven, chipped after a short time","review":"These are certainly serviceable plates that look good and have a good price. But they don't last. I've only had them for a few months and one has already chipped. Compare this with my fiestaware plates that I used previously - they've lasted 7+ years without a chip!These plates are also uneven on the bottom, so there's lots of annoying clattering while everyone is sitting down to eat, from the motion of poking around at your food, cutting with your knife, etc.I would spend a little more on something that will last longer without breaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these square Sangos","review":"Great plates. I use them everyday - lighter than most of the other pieces in set which is very nice. Fit almost as much as the regular dinner plates.

We've been using them on a daily basis for over a year now and there are no chips or cracks. They're lighter-weight than the large dinner plates, so they're easier to wash and put away. They stack nicely, and look gorgeous on their own or beside the larger dinner plates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salad Plates","review":"I really like square plates so when I saw these on Amazon I had to get them.

Do be successful, the writer must not only develop the idea in a short amount of time but must make the characters breathe and - most importantly - bring a resolution of sorts.

First, Hoyt does not use the traditional Japanese rendering of names, that is family name first, then given name. That upset me. Soon following that, this book was read under a cloud of suspicionfrom page 8 on. I quote from said page, where Hoyt describes the impact of Commodore Perry's visit in 1853, when among Japanese barons was \\"circulated the letter from American President James Fillmore...\\", prompting the question \\"Who the hell is James Fillmore\\"? When Perry sailed from Norfolk in 1852 the president was Millard Fillmore.Perhaps I'm picking at nits, but when an American writer can't get the name of a US president correct, that tends to cast a shadow of doubt over everything else he writes. That is a shame, for the book would have been an interesting take on the events described, had I been able to trust Mr Hoyt in the following 415 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bohm is incandescent but Behrens is a let down","review":"The biggest reason to acquire this set is the incandescent conducting of Karl Bohm, in one of his last performance of this opera.

To be honest, I'm not in an obstructed area and most of the channels came in before I plugged in the device to the wall (i.e. no amplification). All of the channels in my area come in except one, and it took just a little playing around with to get no skips. If it works for you, the picture will be great.

One worked poorly and one didn't work at all. The one that worked a little bit picked up some regular TV channels. It didn't pick up a single HD channel, and I live in Chicago where I know that HD channels are available. The unit that didn't work at all didn't even pick up regular TV channels.Even if they had worked, it would have been annoying that there was documenation in the box, and the Phillips web site doesn't even list this as a product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic doesn't hold up.","review":"I bought this to complement my cable service to get the local HDTV channels. After painstakingly setting it up to point in the right direction to get the right signals (took about an hour) I was informed by my girlfriend that she didn't think it went with the decor in the room and I could use it, but put it away when I'm not watching TV. Women... But I do have to agree, it is kind of big and ugly, but I'm a guy, it was working and I was happy. After raising and lowering the antennae a couple of times to put it away and take it back out, it broke. I took it apart and the metal screw that holds the anntena to the body was screwed into the plastic body!! How cheap is that?? The same screw also had a wire attached for the signal, so not only did the antenna come loose, I lost the signal. The screw hole threads were stripped.

In my house (metro DC area), I got weak reception of analog channels, and NO reception of any of the HD digital channels. The product didn't even come with any documentation to help me troubleshoot and try to improve the performance. After an hour or so of tinkering with angles, positioning, etc... I gave up. At least in my home, in my local broadcast area, this antenna was worthless for picking up HDTV broadcasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Rabbit Ears.","review":"This is no better than the old fashion rabbit ears. The \\"powered\\" portion of this antenna does NOTHING to boost the signal. I found this item to be almost useless since it does not pick up any analog signals very well at all.

I then came around to listening to this album, and I think it is brilliant. Her voice can bring me to tears (not in a bad way) and really bring out my emotions. \\"I believe in you\\" and \\"Rainbows End\\" have got to be my favorites, to the person who said Jessica Simpson could do better, what a joke. \\"What Hurts the most\\" also a great cover, she does justice to it. A great singer with a great album is what she is, I agree with whoever said they could listen to her all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"Well, I have been a fan of S Club since there were 7 of them in Miami. After the split Rachel came out with a very good album and I was wondering what happend to the others. I finally here that Jo has a new album out and I have to get it imported to the states.

She Does'nt have much range. She Just raises her voice. Her voice sounds shakey and unstable. especially on \\"Relentless\\" the very first track. I love the song,i really do but her voice sounds like any minute shes gonna break down and cry. I am not a great singer myself but,Jo Omeara needs some voice lessons. Her voice is very drab and boring. It's Nothing extra.For some reason she sounded so much better with S Club 7...you know what,the songs on the album are great,if Kelly Clarkson or Jessica Simpson sang them.

I never thought I'd be excercising to a video at home, but with a(nother) new baby at home, I can't always get out when I want. The music is soothing, and Collette's voice and the poses call to me from the other side of calm during my hectic day.

Well that track is as good as pop hits that never really hit gets, but the rest of the cd is just pure pop bilge. Find a place to download the one good song.

The establishment of the great Jewish and Christian religions should have been included on par with these other religions, especially as the book is published by a major U.S. tax-supported institution, the Smithsonian, and the vast majority of the Americans who support the Smithsonian are either Jewish or Christian. The Jewish and Christian religions have had a significant impact on world history and so a book of this type is incomplete if they are not covered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Study Aid","review":"This book has only three LSAT tests, but the study material included is great. It gives a walkthrough of practice questions. If you are studying for the LSAT, official LSAT books are the way to go. They are made by the test writes and are more helpful than other non official books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice starting block for those studying for the LSAT","review":"This is probably the first book you should buy in your LSAT preping. Keep in mind though there are free resources you can find, you just need to google and hunt around for them. You can even join a law school message board/forum and ask around for study materials there.Anyways, this book is a nice start because it offers you 3 tests, explanations for the wrong answers and some strategies for taking the test. It's a pretty easy read and they really work hard to break the test down for you to bite sized nuggets. It's not the last book you'll buy for the LSAT but it works and you'll probably feel a bit more confident in your abilities after using this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I havent recieved it","review":"Hi I haven't received my item and I did not even receive a tracking number for it. . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Way to Familiarize Yourself with the LSAT","review":"I've found this book to be a pretty good resource. They give background on all the question types you may find on the LSAT and suggestions for how to approach them. They include examples from previous tests and explanations for the answers. The book includes 3 previously administered LSATs with detailed explanations for the answers. Unfortunately, they are a bit older, so they don't have comparative reading questions. There is one example included with the background section though. Overall, I think this book is very helpful in familiarizing yourself with the LSAT, learning useful strategies, and getting practice taking actual tests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your money is better spent on other books","review":"The suggestions and explanations in this book are very limited. The best part about the book is the exams, but there are many other books out there that also have practice exams and also explain the solutions better. The most frustrating thing about this book is that on the practice exams, some of the answers don't match the questions. It is hard to get a feel for how well you would do on an actual exma when it is impossible to complete the exam fully due to not having answers that have anything to do with the questions. It isn't by design, just a poor job in editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very very helpful book","review":"This is a very useful book,I strongly recommend it, always buy the book which made by the people who make the test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Useful LSAT Prep Book","review":"This book has some of the most cogent/coherent explanations and general overview of question types that LSAC has ever produced. The explanations are top quality and the overview is good.The overview reviews some previous LSAT questions and discusses each of the three question types. It totals 40-50 pages of information.The PrepTests are all February tests, which are not disclosed to test takers and seem to feel different than other LSATs. The explanations are thorough and have some good, general tips on questions.The book is a little pricey for getting 3 preptests but is worthwhile, especially early on when you're having trouble understanding why you got a question wrong.Be aware that the book doesn't yield much in the way of really deep strategy work. You'll need to go to one of the prep companies' books for that kind of insight into the LSAT.The book contains:SuperPrep A; February 1996SuperPrep C; February 1999SuperPrep B; February 2000"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best LSAT book","review":"The Good: This book offers a great deal of information on the LSAT and being created by the same people who write the LSAT makes it useful. It contains a lot of actual LSAT questions which is great for when it comes time to do the practice tests.The Bad: The book uses the same, often confusing, language when describing the questions you will be tackling as the questions themselves. They do not do a great job connecting the dots between the review portion of the book and answering of the question. The review sections offer an overview of the four sections of the LSAT but do not give strategy as to solving them.I highly recommend the Powerscore books, the Logic Games Bible in particular. I am using this book in conjunction with that one because the LSAT SuperPrep offers so many actual, past used, test questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"I tried the Princeton Review books first and they were very difficult - by working in this prep book I realized that the Princeton materials were way harder than the test. This book helped build my confidence until I could tackle the more difficult questions in the PR materials, knowing that the actual tests published in the Official LSAT Superprep book were closer to actual test difficulty. I still used the PR materials too, knowing that if I could answer those tough questions then I could answer anything on the test, but I found the Official LSAT Superprep to be closer to the difficulty of the test, and more realistic by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is all right.","review":"I think that this book is all right. Maybe I am being unfair considering how boring the subject matter is, but it is hard to read this book for more than half an hour at a time. There are three sample tests in the book with an explanation to the answer that you should have gotten, which is really helpful. I like to read the beginning section on test strategy, and learn about the specific methods to answer each different style of questions. I will probably buy another book from another company because that was recommended by a LSAT prep site somewhere, but this book would be the only one if I was only planning on buying one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Recieved","review":"I never received this book.

When it arrived, it was all broken apart and tangled up. I had to fit it back together and use it. (No time to get an alternative now - it was late on Thanksgiving Eve). The smaller legs that are supposed to prop up the larger surfaces to make the adjustable feature just come out of their slots and let it collapse down flat. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I needed a small adjustable roasting rack, as I am usually cooking for two and this means small roasts and chickens vs much larger pieces of meat. I opted against a nonstick design because I kept reading about problems with the coating coming off on the food. This product is not non-stick so it has no such problem. It still cleans up ok but hand-washing can be a bit of a pain. Folds flat for easy storage.I wish the adjustable aspect of it was a little more sturdy. The feet come out of the grooves fairly easily when trying to position your meat, which is a not that big a deal unless you like to rotate your meat halfway through cooking. However once positioned it is fairly sturdy and could probably hold a much larger sized roast or bird than we usually use in our house. For the price I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a smaller sized roasting rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Mom and Happy Holidays!!","review":"When my mother in law passed away i couldnt borrow her adjustable roasting rack anymore and no one knows where it went. I had searched all the stores to buy one for her son. I found this on Amazon and it was here way before Thanksgiving for him to use. Every time we have used this our meat turns out perfect.

His destruction of the Jewish communities is excused away as a necessary act for him to establish Islam and unite the arab tribes. Muhammad was just like other tribal leaders but claimed he was a prophet of Allah. Story is interesting but very biased away from any judgement on the amoral actions that Muhammad did. It is not really a factual biography but one which has been manipulated in order to present Muhammad as a man of god. Truth and story become intermingled and therefore loses any sense of reality. Bottom line, the arabs were very war like and committed blood revenge for insults. Brutal men is really all they were. I would really not want to deal with any of these violent beings !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable, BUT.......","review":"Mr. Rogerson has written an excellent portrait of the Prophet, woven into the lives and times of Arabia in the 7th Century. While extremely readable, unfortunately it contains certain glaring inaccuracies. To name but a few:* He misquotes the first revealtion to the Prophet as being from Surah Ignaa (page 89). It should be Surah Alaq.* On page 91 he refers to Kadir, when it should be Layl-atul -Qadr.* On page 114 he refers to the Prophet's \\"daughter\\" Aisha. Hazrat Aisha was his wife.-Sami T. Ahmad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Reading","review":"It is well written account of the Prophet's life. However, at many places the author makes observations that makes one wonder! The inferences drawn at multiple locations appear to be in conflict the way Muslims believe. The problem with Western writers (non-Muslim) is they tend to rationalize events and injunctions as if Prophet mohammad recited the Quran on his own accord. It is because they cannot comprehend Divine intervention and revelations. The account must be read with other biographies of the Prophet to get a balanced narration."},{"rating":"2","title":"An antidote to \\"The Truth about Muhammed\\"","review":"I enjoyed this biography very much. I thought it struck a nice balance of respect and context driven history. The book is a nice antidote to the vitriole of \\"The Truth about Muhammed\\" by Robert Spencer on the one side, and the overly reverential view of Martin Lings biography of the Prophet (which non-Muslims might find hard to sympathize)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique Memoir","review":"What a unique and interesting memoir from Thomas McShane.

I was dissapointed. I didn't like the snowed in part, which seemed to be the climax, and the amount of sex when she didn't love the man disturbed me. I highly doubt it possible to be doing your teacher, learning, and staying friends at the same time. Mrs. Lackey also has an incredible amount of typos in her books. You would think she would be able to spell her own character's names. And last, I got tired of Talia feeling sorry for herself. That is one of the reasons that the plot (?) dragged. I feel that Mrs. Lackey is good, but she should have put far more thought and time into this book, writing and editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good overview","review":"Eventhough not all songs are as great as some of Seattle's grunge hype brought us, this CD is sure worth a good listen.

Even though Welles announced at the beginning of the program that it was only a fictional dramatization, many people tuned in late, and hearing what sounded like legitimate live news reports that killer Martians were attacking the United States, thousands panicked. The broadcast prompted a suitably contrite apology from Welles -- just 23 at the time -- on behalf of the Mercury Theater and CBS the next morning. The \\"War of the Worlds\\" is a classic, Welles is a classic, and any collection of important, historic radio broadcasts is incomplete without this landmark recording -- digitally restored and remastered on this CD.

No problem receiving it in mail or assembling, but the size is much too small and the option to increase tension in pedals for easy/hard pedalling does not really work. The pedals don't glide easily and it is really more of a novelty item. Additionally, rasing the seat level does not help as the seat slowly slides back to the low position. If it were $20.

I don't generally read biographies of actors but thought since he'd portrayed such an interesting variety of characters that there would be an interesting person behind them. However, I wouldn't know if there was or not. He seems to have led an interesting life but there really isn't a shred of the man himself in this book.Maybe it's too much to expect - I wasn't looking for dirt but I was certainly looking for substance and found nothing. \\"Everyone likes him, he's a man's man, he's a great actor\\".

I found it very vacuous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Softly, Softly","review":"I looked forward to this book with great anticipation, having just become a Sean Bean fan via a re-broadcast of the Sharpe series here in Canada. I was therefore majorly disappointed when I finally received it, and, started to read that what we have here is a major schmooze fest, your basic typical celebrity bio in which people say nice things about the star in question, &, that's about all. There is no nitty gritty, no digging to find out what really makes Sean Bean tick. He's gone through 3 marriages & it's all dealt with in less than 10 pages. On the up side there are some interesting quotes from co-stars, & colleagues. There are some interesting descriptions about how some projects got made, particularily Sharpe. Mostly, though, it's style without substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Fans who are new to the world of Sean Bean","review":"As I am a relatively new devotee to the works of Sean Bean (FOTR), I found this a wonderful guide to his past roles.

It turns out you can't do this and plugging in a Lacie drive with a Lacie power supply from a second drive (even if it's identical spec) can fry it!Great, huh?

If you want a hard drive that will not last and give just adequate performance during its short life expectancy Lacie is the way to go.

It was just as captivating if not more than the first book of the series. It was filled with a lots of action and descriptive visual effects. The writer adds in some back story for the characters that help fill in any blank areas left from the first book. It was greatly written, with lots of interesting dialog. I think it was a great all around book. Worth the reading time. It will make you want to continue reading on to the next books of the series and finish the spectacular story of Aaron Corbet and his friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I read several reviews stating this wasn't as good as the other books in the series, perhaps, but I enjoyed it very much.

This product looks good when applied, but slings all over the car leaving an oily mess. I thought that maybe i didnt let it dry, so the second time I applied hot shine I let it dry over 12 hours before I drove my car, and when I got out, it was slung all over my ride. I proceeded to throw the bottle away. The only reason I'm not giving this 1 star, is the fact that it might not stick to my tires. As previously stated Black magic worked well with my bridgestone's, but not my Michelin's. The tire shine that I find to be the best are tire gels. They have the deepest, wettest, glossiest shine, that I love and they don't sling. All of the gels are good, but eagle one tire gel is my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last long.","review":"After washing our car and our truck twice each (a total of 4 car-washes, so 16 individual tire applications), my bottle is empty.

I have been a teacher for 20 years and each and every day I have my students celebrate Earth Day by following the adage, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.

As soon as I put my foot in they try to curl under the ball of my foot, like you would do if you folded your bed pillow under to make it higher. I tried holding it in place with my finger while slipping my foot in with so so results. In any case even if I got them to stay in place for a little while the came out along with my foot every time I took the shoes off!

Under the specification it says the screen is a 720x480 but when I got my player and measured it out, it was only 480x234 at best. Now I know some retailers would describe a 480x234 as 1440x234 to make it look better than it really is, but I purchased this from Amazon thinking they of all people would have the right specs.

The first time that she used it to carry a cake to one of the potlucks at work, the lid popped off and the cake hit the floor. One of the sliding locks released by itself. Before leaving the house I checked it myself to see if lid locked correctly, and it seemed fine. Even now, around the home, we have used the locking lid but when you unlock the slides, the locks come out of the slots into your hand. As a baking pan itself, it is great. Just don't trust the locking lid that comes with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart and thought provoking.","review":"This is not quite Simak at his best but it is close.This is a book about human nature, and examines the idea of the pursuit of immortality in a very unusual way.The world here is a grim place with all the joy sucked out of it by hope in immortality, in many ways it is an attack on religion but the religion in the story is scientific.As well as the main plot we see snapshots of the world through little intermission chapters showing the activities of ordinary people.This is a very cynical book, which paints a grim picture made all the more disturbing by how believable it is, a little darker than Simak's norm.The plot is straight-forward enough with a few twists and turns thrown in and the ending is well done.The book is let down a little by the characters, none of them are very interesting, this is really a book about ideas and speculation not characters.A great read but with a more interesting main character this would have been 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to watch ; SHLOCK","review":"Wolf Creek is a familiar enough story line done many times by more skillfull and much more creative people.If violence for the sake of violence is your bag and dismemberment gives you a thrill.

Wait a minute. There is no way this would have happened in real life.

He really tortures one of them well, by aiming his rifle at her and making her scared for her life.

Liz wakes up alone from a drug-induced sleep to find herself bound and gagged, and that Mick has gone all torture and brutal on them.

Sure that makes sense. It's not as though they couldn't find the mine where the ACTUAL murderer was and get a crudload of DNA evidence and dead bodies.

The main thing wrong with this movie is that it is based on a true story. While, at the end, the only witness to give any details was Ben Mitchell(Nathan Phillips) who spent the duration of the \\"horror\\" part of the movie secluded from Liz (Cassandra Magrath) and Kristy (Kestie Morassi). The entire premise of the movie was the torture and murder of these two girls, yet there was no one around to give any statement as to what actually happened. Their torture was the only part that could have been susspenseful, yet again - it wasn't. The one sole acheivement was Mick Taylors creepy laugh in the back seat of the car.

I was extremly bored watching this movie, and really wished that I had not rented this movie after this film was over. Of course, this movie had some girls being tortured by a crazy fat ugly guy. You also see a nacked dead girl being hung on the wall. This movie is like the movie Hostel, if you are a girl who likes seeing naked girls prancing around, then do go see those movies. There must be ton of people who are in to porn movies in this country. Almost every movie that came out around 80s until now has bunch of nudity especailly of females.

Only living witness didn't see any of it!","review":"I won't waste your time rehashing what nearly every reviewer before me has stated. Yes, the first 45-50 minutes take forever. The blood and gore are pretty good but standard. The problem I had is that the movie is supposedly \\"based on true events\\". Oh really? since you are led to believe that none of the killers other victims escaped and the only escapee in this movie does not escape their bondage until the last 10 minutes of the movie(to basically desert the other friends who they don't know are dead or alive)THAT MEANS THEY DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER VICTIMS. Meaning the gore parts of the movie are nothing but made up scenarios. It may have been interesting enough if we hadn't been lied to begin with.

Quite frankly, this movie deserves no stars not even 1. I thought it was absolutely terrible. For one thing, let me just say, for the first hour NOTHING! happens. It doesn't pick up at all until almost the end, and even then it's just mediocre at best. I was nodding off in the theatre waiting for some action and NOTHING! happened. There are only 4 people in the entire movie 1 being the killer and 3 being the victims. It had no point or reasoning behind it. It followed every other slasher/stalker movie cliche in the teen horror genre even though it's suppose to be based on true events.

Is the movie cleverly made? Yes. But would the world have been worse off without it? Not a chance.\\"Based on true events\\" is a poor excuse. The problem isn't that the movie is violent. There are many very violent, very good movies. The problem is that the violence is for one purpose and one purpose only: to titillate the viewer. There's no attempt to understand it, no attempt to provide us with any insight, no genuine attempt to inform us, and not even any attempt to make us confront our own demons by getting us to identify with the killer.In the special features, the director admits as much. The goal of a movie like this, he said, is simply to scare daylights out of the viewer. Truth to tell, it didn't even do that for me. As I watched the last 40 minutes or so, I kept assuming that at some point there would actually be a point.

Im sure that the girls who died wouldnt like knowing there are people out there just staring at there deaths and torture. Where are the good horror films?

This is one of the worst movies I think I've ever seen. Maybe it just wasn't my kind of film, but I saw it in theaters close to when it came out and I can't think of a movie I liked less. Perhaps it was because my boyfriend, for some reason, took me to see it because he somehow thought it was a werewolf movie. Or maybe it was because nothing happened until about an hour or more through the movie.

In any case, this film offers an hour of amazing shots of Australia's outback, interspersed with some nominal back story and character development. Then a series of scenes of women being brutalized while the sole male victim is off-screen, to appear later as a possible suspect. The sole story arc is that 3 people go on a trip, then the women get tortured(and worse). Oh yeah, there are also a few mind-numbingly bad choices made by the women which allows for what happens to them. Kind of felt like the directors way of saying \\"Well you shouldn't have been DRESSED that way\\", but that could just be me. I hate it when a film acts like the women asked for their fate by making choices that, in real life, women wouldn't make. Just kind of left me depressed about the future of horror films, but the acting was great. So were the shots of the landscape. There you have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective horror film","review":"This movie really does nothing original, but it is definitely an effective horror movie. It starts with more character development than we see in the 'traditional' horror movies, and as a result, it is not a typical 'in your face' type of movie. The acting was excellent, and the suspense was palpable throughout the last half of the movie. I admit, the ending left much to be desired, but overall, I found this movie to be disturbing.I noticed that many reviewers criticize this movie for not having as much gore as other horror movies - If you are the type that equates gore with horror, then this movie is probably not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"and you think you have something to whinge about","review":"At last an Aussie horror movie to be proud of,and sum good oneliners ,throwen in for laughs ,based on real events in this country about 15 years ago which make it all the more chillingJohn Jarratt deserves to stand beside the best for his performance ,always the person you least expect, I don't know if you would show this as a welcome to the great outdoors , only if you wanted to get away forever,PS in real life the locals are very friendly and proud of their tourtist attraction , as they should be to"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST horror movies out there","review":"Wolf Creek has to be one of the worst horror movie I have ever seen.

Then when the \\"horror\\" part of this so called horror movie finally starts, you are suddenly reminded why movies such as \\"Scream\\" did so well in the box office (to poke fun at movies such as Wolf Creek). In so many scenes I kept hearing myself say things like, \\"run run stupid...no not there...just keep quiet..don't go there..don't get back on the road, he'll just pick you up.\\" At the end this movie failed miserable.

I bought the unrated version, which is over an hour and a half long. It took about 52 minutes before anything remotely tense or scary happened. I'll save you the trouble: in skipping the first 52 minutes, all you'll see are the three hikers partying, renting a car, sleeping, hiking, and finding their car broken down. While the action of the hikers being hunted down was in itself intense at times, it just didn't hold me like \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever!","review":"This film is not even worth my words.

Then I got one, what a let down.I was expecting the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre what I got was a super boring, thoughtless waste of my time. Sterotypical plot, there isn't even much violence in this film. The movie spends more time showing us how the trio got to Wolfcreek then what happened when they actually got there. The movie had alot of promise and could have been so much more, but really didn't live up to it's hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"The people who gave this movie good reviews must have been on crack! The plot was horrible. The events that the writer gave the actors to do were stupid. Only one of the victims had any sense of survival. When and if you watch it you will understand what I mean. Before anything starts to happen the movie is already 1 hour into its boring plot.The only part that I feel sorry about is that this happened to this group of people. I am even more sorry that this wasted 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life.The movie had no horror or suspence. Some how the \\"VILLIAN\\" has an internal GPS configured into his brain.

Yet, it was low-budget, clearly, and had a very hollow plot. If you like unexplained violence, but it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid low budget horror","review":"I agree with the reviewer who summed this up as solid low budget horror. Cassandra Magrath's character Liz receives the most screen time and is in many ways the protagonist. Yes it's been praised by the critics for its relative realism compared to other horror movies, and knowing very little about Australia this introduced me a bit to the beautiful landscape and gave me a sense of the vastness of the \\"outback.\\"What all of this adds to the film beyond giving it good reviews is hard to gauge. You might feel emotionally worse after this than other slashers. You identify a bit more than usual with the victims although their questionable actions during the action sequences will jeopardize this for some viewers. In the final estimation a movie like this one depicting horror in the Australian outback was overdue for production given the slew of serial murders in Australia, and it just happened to be Wolf Creek that comes to fill the role."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG, OMG, OMG","review":"This movie will freak you out and I don't scare easily. I watch most of the things that my friends won't. I think the hardest part is when I realized that someone actually went through this. After I watched this movie, I was telling my husband that I want AAA roadside assistance ordered immediately and cell phone chargers in every car. There is no way I want help from any \\"kind stranger\\". That look he gave Ben was really something. I had to stop the movie to prep myself for what he was about to do to Lizzie. Very scary and suspenseful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow, but good","review":"i liked this movie so bad, i was so waiting for the last part, that i couldnt fall asleep :Pgreat film... i hope more films like this were made"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would re-name this movie to Creeky Wolf","review":"Formula filled, nothing new, except the kids in this movie that get chopped up are the most stupid idiots I've ever seen.

The new Texas Chainsaw Massacare was scarier than this. This is possibly the worst scary movie I have ever seen.

Rent it first, it is just NOT worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolf Creek is Horrible... dont believe the hype.","review":"The only reason this movie gets one star, is because zero wasnt an option.Okay, if you are looking for a very very sloooow, meaningless movie that will waste 2 hours or more of your lifespan, try wolf creek. I'm a Huge Horror movie fan, and this movie falls flat in every aspect: boring script and untalented actors, an endless roadtrip that takes up the first hour (or MORE) of the movie. If you want to see people driving around the desert for no reason, (yawn) then try this.Also, by the time that anything 'Scary' happens.. its already too late. by the time the killing starts, its even more sleep inducing.This is nothing like the preview suggests, Trust me, waste of time and hard-earned money.

I must say after viewing it I don't see what all the fuss is about. It was neither terrifying nor a classic by any means. It was pretty boring for about 3/4 of the movie and then when the killer finally started his thing it was no big deal at all. Sure he was a lunatic and the killings were horrible but nothing we haven't seen in horror/slasher movies over and over and over. It was pretty bland and I give it a one star because I just don't think it was that good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential wasted","review":"I saw Wolf Creek at the initial theatrical release. I went into the movie with very little expectations. I have to say, with expecting nothing; I got very little out of the movie. As being a fan of horror films, this film was a major let down. Maybe because I left the theater before the movie could get going.The characters though young, were very naive. They could have made much better choices, but in order to perpetuate a long drawn out waste of time, they made bad decisions though out the film. I think the film would have been much more appealing if it was squeezed into 45 minutes to an hour, versus the length of a feature film.I recommend any other film over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz.......","review":"DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE TIRED.There, you've been warned...Wolf Creek is one of the most boring and slow horror dramas to come out in the last few years. What's worse, it portrays itself as some nifty little horror film but it is just a \\"dumb kids do stupid stuff and wind up getting killed\\" type of slasher flick.Halfway through the film, I was rooting for the killer or another meteor to come crashing down on top of the lame characters in this ode to boredom. Take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Stupid! For Real!","review":"Who are these people that are giving it a good review???

As a fan of horror, I found it rather predictable with only a few brief clips of anything remotely \\"terrifying\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolf Creek","review":"This film is pretty gorey. There is plenty of blood, guts and suffering.I reccomend this film to anyone who likes true stories about serial killers. This is an excellent film, both dark, and at times painful to watch the killer's sadistic ways he goes about torturing his victums...And what's also scarry is that fact that they have never been able to catch this guy who is doing all of these terrible things.

The lines unbearably tedious. Bad acting, bad writing, great scenery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Italy looks good","review":"One and a quarter stars for Italy, the remaining three quarters for Keitel. You might really enjoy this movie if you think Somerset Maugham is a good name for a beach cottage, that Oprah is smartly entertaining, and that things are going swimmingly well in DC where we are under strong and true leadership, Otherwise I think you should consider watching a good movie, something like \\"This Property is Condemned.\\" This Property is Condemned has weak bookends but it also has two things that this film lacked; a real story and good acting. You should especially avoid this movie if you are prone to think about the films that you have watched; the more you think about this one, the more you will dislike it.

Both characters need to learn about snobbery and prejudice, both need to find their confidence and trust their hearts, and yet Sam and Liddy are superficially, winningly, different from each other and from the run of the mill romance protagonists. And the writing.... oh, glory, does anybody, ever, will anybody EVER, write romance as skillfully as Judith Ivory? If ever romance qualifies as Literature With A Capital L, it will be in her hands. I wish, as always, there was more Judith Ivory out there to put on the keeper shelves.

However, since Ms. Ivory's last several books have been high on my list I decided to give it a try and continue reading.

I found most of the principles in the story completely out of character with their established personalities. In the series, you were left with the impression that Picard was extremely upset with Ro Laren's betrayal, yet in the book, it's hardly even mentioned at all. Another point, the author does a good job of describing federation prisoners suffering thoroughly at the hands of the Jem Hadar and Cardassians while doing slave labor, while the main character completely forgets them at the end to start his own life, no longer caring about his suffering comrades who are still prisoners. He even forgets about his best friend who helped him get through the tough times. No, I was completely let down. The noble Picard acting like the brash young Captain Kirk threw me for a loop also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the \\"Behind the Lines\\"","review":"Already wary of John Vornholt's writing, I was hoping this would change my mind...I was wrong. There is little or no action until the very end, and I was hoping it would be epic space battles, which I got from the cover. But the Enterprise is stuck in a starbase, and all the crew does is try to help some pathetic commander. And when they do finally show up, it's too obvious, and it was like an after-thought to add the rest of the crew in the story. The only two characters who really shined were Hasmek and Geordi, since they weren't used that much, and Vornholt couldn't screw them up. The whole Badlands part is pointless. I suggest to anybody that you read the Deep Space Nine series, because they're awesome in comparison. A war fits nicely into the Deep Space Nine universe, not The Next Generation universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Dominion War series yet","review":"In his second novel of the Dominion War series, Tunnel Through the Stars, John Vornholt crafts an incredibly exciting science fiction story that surpasses the previous Dominion War books in most respects. The story is a direct continuation of Vornholt's first entry in the series, Behind Enemy Lines, and follows Picard and his unusual crew as they attempt to destroy the secret Dominion project that threatens to doom the Federation. Along with this formidable task, Picard must also deal with a deadly threat from within his own crew. The novel is entertaining from start to finish as Vornholt creates a story that successfully combines elements of mystery, suspense and action. With all of these essential elements in place, Tunnel Through the Stars earns its mark as the best Dominion War book yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very average","review":"My experience is that it is not made very well for potenial snags, as earely in my use of the mit I caught it on a fender edge while washing the car and it frayed, and this has continued to occur; one does not expect a product such as this to start falling apart as it has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snag","review":"This hooks on ever piece of trim or gap on the car and then unravels.

The second is that we NEVER learn his real name.This book broke that second rule in more than one place. He described his name as being the British equivilent to \\"John Doe\\". He was called John by his 'fiancee'. Finally he was called Drake by the Field Marshal. For those unaware, John Drake was another spy character played by Patrick McGoohan and McGoohan made every effort in the production of The Prisoner to never make a direct connection between the two characters.

Men are just scum and can be arrested for merely looking at a women wrong. It really invokes a lot of emotion when you read what they do to men in the justice system. It reminded me of Jewish people being killed during the Holocaust just because of their religion. The reasons are stupid and,in many cases, didn't even happen. The end of the book was incredibly clever and you finally get the title of the book. Chris Farmer needs to write more books like this one. This book really makes you think and certainly makes you grateful for the system we do live in.

In \\"The Blessing of Pan\\" Dunsany tells of a village clergyman's struggle with an insidious encroachment of Paganism. It reads more like a Victorian novel (Dickens or Charlotte Bronte) than a horror novel - it's very homey, but with a sense if foreboding. It kind of reminded me of the movie The Wicker Man, in the way the Christian protagonist was faced with the (to him) unthinkable appearance of paganism in his comfortable Christian world.

While the history and culture sections are interesting, the lodging and shopping/restaurants sections leave a lot to be desired. Most of the businesses mentioned have either gone out of business or changed hands. This is especially true on Aitutaki, where only one of the businesses recommended was still in its present form! As another reader recommended, the book does not sufficiently cover home rentals which are a great way to stay on these islands for a reasonable amount (and most can be viewed and reserved on the internet!). David Stanley's Moon Handbooks South Pacific guide is a much better choice--it is more up to date and covers all the major South Pacific islands for almost the same amount of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Christmas Musical","review":"I collect Christmas DVD's.

The second pan held the batter for a few minutes but sure enough it also leaked. I re-locked both pans and this time used water to test.

There were always refreshments available for visitors, including adding more ingredients to stretch the meals. Barbara's ideas for entertaining were delightful and would make any party, luncheon, or overnight visit fun and exciting. The description of her friendship with the dear and precious lady, Mrs. Mary Cunningham, who was my former sixth grade teacher and friend, made the book even more special. This book, in today's rushed and technologically advanced society, reminds us that we should continue family traditions, especially through being hospitable to others--wherever we are."},{"rating":"2","title":"What might have been?","review":"I studied Tony Williams as a young percussionist in the '60's, McLaughlin I saw many times in the early seventies and Jaco Pastorius later. My ear knew what they were capable of as individuals and in ensemble. True I was expecting some kind of hair raising epiphanal synergy that would blast open my chakras or at least get me up to boogie even if only in spirit. What this shows is the enormous potential brought by these three masters who for whatever reason could not or chose not get it there in this group. It shows in the journey they took together as they were playing in 3 other worlds within the same piece and maybe that's where the magic is for some. Some listener in future will take the next step from this CD as an inspiration. I gave it 4 stars for taking the risk to make unique music not just to sell records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre release from musical titans","review":"No one would ever rightly say that these three players are anything less than sublime. But for whatever reason, this set doesn't work at all. These seems less of a concerted band effort and more of three musicians going in three different directions. Even classics like Jaco's \\"Continuum\\" are rendered depressingly weakly here. It's a shame, because this could have been a massive record. Instead, it's just kind of a disappointment and a reminder that even the greatest players aren't superhuman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste a penny on this one","review":"There is a reason this wasn't released in full for almost 30 years. It sucks.Read the liner notes, and even John McLaughlin told the studios not to release it back then, \\"over his dead body\\". He has since had a \\"change of heart\\", or maybe it was a change in his pocket book, because this CD should have never been put out.All three of these musicians are my personal favorites at their respective instruments, but this recording is absolutely terrible. Tony Williams' drumming is OK (not his best, not like VSOP Quintet) but was miked so poorly that all you hear is cymbals, so overbearing that they wash out everything else. Jaco, well, you can't even hear him on most of this recording, he is so quiet and also miked so poorly. And McLaughlin has a couple moments of Mahavishnu Orchestra-esque potential that never quite blossoms, the rest dragging and uninspired. My comments are the same for the live tracks as for the studio ones as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much drumming...","review":"I have heard this material a long time ago, when it first came out. As a solid Jaco fan, I adored his playing and interplay with Maclaughin, but I knew something was not clicking. After listening hard this time, I understood: Williams drumming is way far too complicated. It does not leave space for the guitar and bass to breathe. I supposse this guys were too excited with each other capabilities that they simply did not get the patience to listen to each other. Pity, such a wasted chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlistenable","review":"Pointless noodling. Yes, the three musicians featured in this live Havana gig (which also features some some studio extras) did, on their own, create some fine jazz-rock fusion, but together, as heard on this dull cd, hardly create enough of a flame to light up a Cuban cigar."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bay of Gigs","review":"Other than a great drum solo by Tony Williams that starts this disc out, a burning solo by McLaughlin on \\"Dark Prince\\" and a decent version of Pastorius' \\"Continuum\\", there is really nothing here to listen to. Much of the rest of this CD is Pastorius playing away from the changes and McLaughlin trying to salvage the proceedings by playing either louder or faster. Williams tries desperately to hold it all together while Mclaughlin and Pastorius twiddle away at each other. McLaughlin was never happy with the results of this meeting in the first place and stated for years that he never wanted this recording to see the light of day. Knowing Pastorius was going through a lot of personal problems at this time and probably wasn't in top form here, I bought this mostly out of curiosity. You're better off spending your money on both the new essential McLaughlin and Pastorius CD's that just came out. You can get this if you're really that curious, but don't expect much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen Carefully","review":"The music, and musicianship, displayed on this album was instrumental in changing jazz/rock fusion. That doesn't mean everyone will like it (most people don't listen to fusion), but it clearly set a standard for many other talented jazz & rock musicians.The liner notes clarify a lot of the back story, and shed light on why this is the only set of recordings from this group. A lot of work was done to bring quality of sound to the original recordings, and its sonic & fidelity qualities are good, but not great.Everytime the CD comes up in my juke box, I replay it several times.

I'd rather listen to jazz if I want something non-melodic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont judge an album via it's singles.","review":"OK I'll admit I bought thier best of album for two reasons, Song 2 and the clever artwork and after a few listens I loved it. What I loved in particular was the songs off that album which were taken off the album \\"Blur\\", Song 2 is a given but also the amazing calm and catchiness of Beetlebum and the electronicly driven On Your Own. So on the back of those songs, I assumed this was Blur's best album and bought it.I had high hopes on first listen and I was conflicted. How could an album with some such amazing songs be so... bad? The first few songs are great but once part 2 of the album kicks in you end up fastforwarding through all the songs until you reach the end. I've only listened to the whole album twice and couldn't again, and unfortunately the \\"white noise\\" path would be the one they followed in future years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful !","review":"This CD came out in 1997 and i had my hands on it in 1999.

( Blur tried to sound like a punk version of Beatles here )is another track that needs a little bit of attention, but still not enough to make the album a good one.The rest of the songs ( and a lot of them ) are just boring, noises , no melody, no rhythm...nothing. I can't even believe how come Blur is considered a good band.Publicity i guess , can make anybody famous and big. Talking about music, this CD should not even be in ''music'' category.

Damon, Graham, and the rest seem to be able to do any style they want and do it well. Incredibly strong from front to back."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're So Great!","review":"Oddly enough (since I'm American), Beetlebum is what attracted me to this album, and to Blur, who have since become my favorite band. Song 2 is perhaps the single greatest 2 minute song of all time, and M.O.R. proved that Song 2 was not a fluke, even as Blur suggests, and that Blur can rock for more than two minutes. Graham's first solo effort proved that there was more to Blur's music than just Damon. While it's impossible to look at Blur's career without comparing them to other bands at other points, it was great to see a band change directions and move on. Oasis should take their heads out for a second and realize that that might actually make them successful. People were getting tired of the same stuff from other bands, and as usual, Blur put themselves one step ahead.I realize that I've been rambling and incoherent, but this album changed my life, so to speak. I highly recommend that anyone who hasn't heard of Blur buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of the end","review":"\\"Blur's frontman Damon Albarn basically announced that he was withdrawing from the race.\\" This means, apparently, abandoning everything that made Blur's music worthwhile in the first place. The only thing worse than hearing your favorite band descend into unlistenable banality is to witness it being embraced (briefly, of course) by that vast, taste-bereft segment of the american population that made Song 2 such a big hit. I would like to think that Damon would shudder at the thought of his songs being played at frat parties and on Intel commercials (both of which all but negates the value of your art). While their next release didn't produce a ultra-profitable monster hit like Song 2, it did little if anything to restore Blur's integrity. Damon let a LOT of his long-time fans down with this one, who are now mumbling that the Blur's rumored breakup is coming two years (and two albums) too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, but not a bunch of Song 2's","review":"Ironically, Song 2 was the song that got me interested in Blur, and it turned out that none of their other songs (except maybe Chinese Bombs) sound at all like that, especially not on the earlier alubms . . . thank god their old stuff is good, too!

I first heard them when in their \\"Boys who like Girls\\" era, and my reaction was one of immediate distaste. Later, when I heard the catchy (if overplayed) \\"Song 2\\", I decided to be a bit more lenient. On recommendation from friends, I bought the self-titled album. My friends were right.I cannot admit to finding a song here I dislike. The fuzzy, juiced-up guitars, Albarn's maybe-I'm-drunk-and-maybe-I'm-not delivery, all combine to give us something with more fun and at the same time, more real pathos than Oasis could ever dream of.And yes, I still like \\"Song 2\\". How can you not dig a song that goes \\"WOO HOO!\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"13\\"","review":"Some people tend to think that Blur has changed their style on \\"13\\". It is not true, as they were always a challenging band who's looking for a change every time. Their selftitled 1997 album is no exception. Blur's strong musical elements are here of course, like Graham Coxon's beautiful acoustic guitar (Most notable on \\"You're So Great\\" and \\"Look Inside America\\") and Damon Albarn's quirky and cynical lyrics (Just listen to the lyrics of \\"Country Sad Ballad Man\\" and \\"Essex Dogs\\"). Also, some great and enjoyable British rock tracks such as \\"Beetlebum\\" and \\"M.O.R.\\"; And how can you mention this album without referring to \\"Song 2\\". This two-minutes-and-one-second parody that laughs in the face of contemporary American rock hits is already a classic, so go and purchase this album NOW. It's pure art.

Dr. Eland's book provides one blueprint for a transformation, and I hope military policymakers like Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld will read this book and consider Eland's recommendations.Although written before the attacks, the book predicts that terrorism is America's biggest threat in the coming decade, and proposes a defense policy that will reduce the chances of future attacks on the US homeland.

One recent day, I wandered thru the e-stacks here at Amazon, clicked on \\"Going Somewhere\\" because I liked the cover photo, and discovered to my great pleasure and surprise that he has aged gracefully as a man and a songwriter. A lovely piece of work this is, quiet, wry, bittersweet, unsentimental, mature. Nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"I discovered Colin Hay off of the soundtrack to Garden State, and after searching for more music from him, I stumbled upon this album, and how lucky I was!

This album is seriously a worthwhile purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic !!!(...)","review":"Colin Hay proves that he is one of the few pop artists with a voice.

My favorite comeback was, \\"I don't need it, I am immortal.\\"This story was exciting to the last page. Imagine hearing a murder taking place on the phone.

I guess I couldn't relate to her much.I'll pass on the rest of this series too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe this is COF","review":"I'm a loyal COF fan and I didn't really expected them to release the \\"Dusk and Her Embrace\\" v.2006 album but \\"Thornography\\" which would be a good album for several bands it's just the worst album for Dani and the crew. I expected them to follow the line they trace after \\"Nymphetamine\\" (which I enjoyed very much) but they definetely decided to explore some more commercial fields spewing out this cheap music for vampire-wanna-be teenagers. I cannot imagine Paul Allender or Adrian Erlandsson wasting their proven talent playing these songs live.If you're into bands like Nightwish or Tristania go for the disc otherwise stay away from it and play \\"The Principle of Evil made flesh\\" instead to remember what Cradle of Filth was."},{"rating":"2","title":"they write songs like a dark shakespeare","review":"cradle of filth have been around a while and i only recently discovered them. Midian still remains one of my faves. Thornography is a well constructed release. Where Nymphetamine seemed a bit rushed at times (some of the songs sounded kind of standard). Thornography is like a concept album. Their songs come from a different time lyrically. The songs sound as if the author channeled spirits of the past. Of course the anti-vatican theme continues as with most dark metal. Liberina Grimm and Lovesick for Mina stand out for me. For those who like cradle, its a must. If your not familiar with them i recommend Midian!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They are not so good as their previous albums","review":"Forget about Cruelty and the beast - Midian - Dusk and her embrace. This album is bad. It reminds me a little Nymphetamine with the childish melodies and the boring atmosphere. Its one of their worst albums and its only for Cradle Of Filth collectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"not too bad","review":"okay yeah this album is way more poppy then there other stuff. but its still got good songs and catchy hooks. so its not so bad. i would recomend you buy it if you can find it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Cradle of Filth Couldn't Sink Any Lower","review":"Yikes...this is the epitome of garbage here. Cradle of Filth have been going down the spiral since after they released \\"Lovecraft and Witchhearts\\" in 2002, which was a retrospective on their tolerable side of their career. I mean, after going to the Blabbermouth news blog and reading the blog about Villie Valo from *cough* H.I.M. *cough* making a guest appearance, that was it. I could no longer stand this band and Dani Filth any longer. The songwriting is basic, and the vocals are abysmal as always. Wow, Roadrunner Records has really jumped the ship this year, and \\"Thornography\\" is proof. This isn't black metal, or even metal at all. It's not even tolerable. Congratulations on embarrassing yourselfs, Cradle of Filth. Now excuse me while I listen to Satyricon and 1349 from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is bad.","review":"I find it hard to believe this is the same band that created Cruelty And The Beast. I liked all COF up to this release right here. Cradle hasn't been a Black Metal band since Cruelty, and after that they still at least had some good tunes. I can't believe they released this with a straight face. If they keep up down this road, they'll be seen on Jay Leno before you know it. It's bad enough they were on Viva La Bam on MTV, a show that pushes Billy Idol and other posers not worth mentioning here. The good thing about this? There's still great Black Metal bands around that aren't playing to 'the teenage crowd.\\" If this has you down listen to these Gods: Mayhem, Tsjuder, Gorgoroth, Darkthrone, Blood Ritual, even Dimmu Borgir hasn't strayed this far into teen/mtv land."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my my. I expect a tour with AFI to follow.","review":"I hate to be a COF hater, granted I've always hated their image,lousy videos and goofy attempts to be shocking. But every album from POEMF to Midian I would give 4 or 5 stars to(especially cruelty)After Damnation and a day they begin to slip then nymphetimine pushed them clear off. Instead of trying to pull themselves up they wallow in the same mediocre goth-core rock pool pulling the same tricks that were a bore on the last album.I had a hard time even getting through this cd without fading out and losing focus. I think COF may be dead. I'll leave it for the kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious crap!","review":"Yet another goth popstar posers lame attempt at black metal. Pretentious as ever. What's sad is these are old men but their audience are 10-14 year olds. Pretty retarded if you think about it. I bet they laugh all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Black Metal, but Great Music","review":"Yeah, if you look at them, they seem silly. But it's hard to deny these boys can create some brutal tunes. \\"Libertina Grimm,\\" and the experimental cover of \\"Temptation\\" make this cd worth it. As a fanatic of horror fiction, I appreciate the refrences to Barker and Lovecraft tales. They sound a bit like old Mercyful Fate at parts, or maybe its just me...A guilty pleasure perhaps, but I still say COF can hammer out some wicked tunes. A worthy album, IMO for metal fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Album","review":"This is a great album by Cradle. Best songs on it are Tonight in Flames, Foetus of a New Day Kicking, and Temptation. It may not sound like there older albums such as Midian and Cruelty but other wise it is still a good listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest opinion.","review":"I would like to start by stating that this album is not death metal, black metal, ect. Nor does the band claim to be. The closest they have been was Principle of evil made flesh........maybe, and they evolved from there. Cradle of filth sounds like Cradle of filth.Anyone new to COF will enjoy this cd. Even the people who have liked them from the begining will like it. It is a Very good cd. Not there best effort but worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The Majority of the Reviews here say it best. Besides the First Intro Track (which is surprisingly good) this record is terrible. It seriously sounds like Cradle has been deeply influenced by the vast number of terrible new and up-incoming bands they've toured with over the last two years. This Record makes Nymphetamine sound like Dusk and Her Embrace. Seriously, dont bother buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satan would be proud","review":"Not sure what the complaints are about... I own all of COF's work, and Thornography ranks right up there with the best of them. People who say Danni has lost his lyrical edge need to listen abit closer. There are so many metaphorical masterpieces in this album it's ridiculous. Yea, it may sound a bit different but COF lives strong!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good album from a great band","review":"OK..to clear a couple things up. First off, this is not a black metal album, and Cradle of Filth was never a black metal band anyway. They are a hard band to classify, I'll admit, but they were at no point a black metal band and even they can admit it. Anyone who can't apparently hasnt heard real black metal. Anyway, CoF took a new direction on this CD by focusing more on guitar riffs rather than the symphonic aspect of the music. While I loved their older CDs, I can be proud of a great band for making yet another masterpiece. It may take more than one listen, but anyone willing to accept change and move on will agree with me when I say this is a great CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad album... no really, it was BAD!","review":"ThornographyThis album is horribly dissapointing... seriously, it is an utter disappointment. The only good song on it is Temptation. I can't stand Byronic Man or Foetis Of A New Day Kicking... listening back to V Empire, Midian, Lovecraft And Witchhearts, From The Cradle To Enslave, this album is a mere shadow of what was once Cradle Of Filth's ultimate glory. Like I said, Temptation is a good song. I liked it. It's a nice music video too. But I highly reccomend staying away from this... *ahem* excuse the word pun, FILTH. If you want to hear some good COF listen to their older albums... I personally like V Empire and From The Cradle To Enslave.Or better yet listen to Slayer =D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sleeper songs","review":"The best song on the soundtrack is: Leavin Ain't the only way to go!

By the time you have converted the weights and measures in the book into metric units, and then worked out the zone units then you weren't hungry anymore! Also very unpractical for someone who has a very limited amount of time at breakfast and lunch.

Also, this book was intended to sell the \\"Zone\\" diet to the medical community by proving the scientific facts behind it. Fine and dandy if you've just got to understand every single reason for every single thing, but otherwise it comes off as TOO MUCH INFO!

I find him to not be a Progressive but one who openly criticized those who were progressives (including Dewey), communists or any big government ideologues. He believed in 'Liberalism' in the true original sense of the Libertarian meaning..not the current left-wing bloated government that wants to control your life meaning.

My husband has read the Henry James stories on which these episodes were based and said that they closely followed James's storyline. Of course, we liked some episodes better than others, not because of inferior acting, but just because of the story line.

There is little to no interaction outside in the beautiful countryside or hussle and bussle of the cities.The dialogue isn't stimulating enough to carry the confined space."},{"rating":"2","title":"a smash!!","review":"My first Sparks album, and what a treasure. Producer Tony Visconti helped them stretch their sound to new realms like swing jazz (\\"Looks, Looks, Looks\\"), marching band (\\"Get in the Swing\\") and pre-punk futuristic bombasity (\\"In The Future\\"). Songs like \\"How Are You Getting Home\\" retain the glam-rock wit and charm, while the uber-metal march of \\"Hospitality On Parade\\" adds a powerful irony to a song about the settlement of the Americas.Songwriter Ron Mael is in rare form here with a period piece about people stuck in a period-piece lifestyle (\\"It Ain't 1918\\") and the witty lament of a celibate marriage (\\"Tits\\") which doubles as a hell of a drinking song! Russell Mael offers a rare composition with the operatic sendup to a favorite fruit (\\"Pineapple\\") and lets not forget the irony of \\"Under the Table With Her\\", which is played with appropriate pomp by a string quartet.The brothers' greatest masterpiece in my book, at their glam-rocking, experimental best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upbeat fun from the mid-70s.","review":"I spent years trying to find this title...again.

My favorites are \\"How Are You Getting Home?\\" and the high-energy \\"In the Future\\" It does struggle a little with \\"Profile\\", but picks back up with their cover of \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand.\\" This disc may be an acquired taste, but hey...at least it ain't disco!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They had lost the plot by this one","review":"This album pretty much was the last gasp for the Maels aka Sparks. The rubbish they turned out aftre this album was pretty dreadful. Their doom was sealed when they had fired Martin Gordon and Adrian Fisher after the Kimono album. Gordon arranged most of the Kimono songs plus played bass and Fisher was an outstanding guitarist who played on Kimono and on a few songs on Propaganda.The good songs on this record are Happy Hunting Ground and In the Future. Looks Looks Looks and Get In The Swing are fair to middling. The rest of the record is a load of rubbish. This CD includes bonus tracks that include the dreadful \\"England\\" and horrendous remake of \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand.\\"Sparks could have been huge if they had stuck with the Kimono line up.

I also was a little disappointed in the way the butterflies looked when I got it, but I have grown to love them. They are just a little bit different looking, but they are still cute.

I keep expected it to get a little stronger, have some peaks and valleys... maybe some interesting sounds thrown in. But it does not happen.Even the one track with memorable vocals (the Sugababes) doesn't play right with me because her style of singing sounds more appropriate with R and B rather than ambient / electronica.If you are looking for ambient background music that breaks no new ground this may please you.

No matter the quality of the garnet, it looks like a complete fake because the silver around it looks like tin! The detail of the mold is very good, but again, the silver has no glimmer, no weight.I cleaned it with jewelry cleaner and there was no improvement.

I found a credible amount of useful information within it. The ballistics tables are real-world--unlike the dry, theoretical tables found in reloading manuals. Major Plaster sticks to the heart of the subject matter; he doesn't go off on those lame, sorry \\"soldier of 'fiction'\\" tangents that many authors do. He even authorizes the reader to photocopy range cards, practice targets, etc..., as long as the credit line is not removed. You can't get much fairer than that.

And I own quite a few. Maj. Plaster is a master at precision shooting and has given us the science of it in this book. This book scientifically teaches you how to put one bullet into a target at extreme ranges. It also teaches you about stalking, building hides, range estimation, counter sniping, mantracking, target priorities, camo in various environments, and something defensive books doesn't ever teach you, offensive tactics. I have probably read this book 3 times over, because there is so much detailed information in this book to learn. This book is written so that even the most unskilled shooter can understand. Survival and equipment section is just as informative. Buy this book before you buy or build your rifle, for it will open your eyes as to what to look for in a rifle and scope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Not only is this a how to shoot book.

I bought several books to improve my knowledge, increase my bench shooting and this is the only book that did what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate Letdown","review":"This book is 50% product marketing, 45% regurgitated information easily found on the web, and 5% common sense. If you've been shooting a while, have done considerable independant research on your own, and possibly compete, you do not need this book. Its overpriced and un-necessary. This is one of those books that makes me think buying books is for fools, given the information age we live in.

However, production-wise, it seems like this album has the good beats front-loaded. Dynomite and Brand New start off solid, and the rest of the beats on the album are solid for the most part, but there's a noticeable drop in quality, the songs towards the end are just not as catchy or filled with the same kind of fire as Dynomite (except for maybe \\"Bullet\\", which features Citizen Cope singing the hook from his \\"Bullet and a Target\\" song). Look for his sophomore release, Rhymefest is full of potential but needs to hit it off with either more producers or more consistent production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Album","review":"I'm going to keep this short and to the point. I don't like a lot of the rap/hip hop on the radio now. I try to find a few good artists and follow their work. Included in my group of favorites is Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Kanye, T.I., and old school Outkast. If those artists appeal to you, then check out Rhymefest. Most of the songs have nice beats, even if they are largely recognizable samples. I especially like the use of The Strokes guitar riff in \\"Devil's Pie.\\" This album is a nice alternative to the garbage being pushed on the radio and tv."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhymefesten","review":"best songs on the album: Build me up feat. the late O.D.B., Devil's Pie & Tell a story produced by Mark Ronsom for Allido Sound, other great songs are, Get Down produced by No-ID for So So Def, Bullet feat.

It's poorly produced and it begins with a rated R, maybe NC-17 scene of some vamps feeling each other up but no real sexual activity. The rest is common knowledge information on historic figures of real vampires, such as Vlad the Impaler. Sad to say, the only highlight of this documentary, is when someone was getting pierced by a needle...yeah something to get all excited about. This isn't worth spending money on, unless you plan on waiting for someone to sell their used copy for a lower price (like for a dollar) and even then, you're better off spending your time and money else where.

This film goes quite gladly over the top as it pushes the envelope of credibility, and it might be even more gleefully thrilling if the rising crime rates and levels of violence in Mexico didn't tend to support the view we get of it. Be forewarned, there's plenty of melodrama - picture a young woman escaping from police detention with a gun in one hand and a baby in the other. Then hang onto your hat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thriller, fiction or reality?","review":"I found Conejo en la luna a good thriller, with a very well done job by the actors. I found a couple of wholes in the story though. One of those wholes being the fact that someone can travel to another country with a different person's passport and not being caught somewhere along the line between boarding the plane and immigration? especially in this day and age. Other than that, though scary to see that a plot like that can happen in my own country, the thriller had a good flow. Was the film based in any particular case or is it just fiction reflecting a general trend in the country (power and money over law and respect)?. I've been living out of Mexico for a few years now and I wonder if the film was promoted or shown at all in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hay is the Best-Kept Secret in Popular Music","review":"You don't know me, but you can trust me when I say, this album is a great addition to your collection.

It's a good deal longer than it needs to be, and the greater part of it is given over to the attempts of four people to help one of them, a former Tower Keeper, perform the \`marital act'. Regrettably, there is not much lurid detail involved, so we're denied even something to appeal to our prurient interest. And it goes on for quite a long time. In many places the narrative reads like a first draft, and I kept wishing the author had gone through one more time to tighten up the prose. Later on there's a rather silly time travel sequence, a blast from the past as it were, which doesn't contribute a whole heck of a lot to the proceedings. The action picks up a little at the end, but so what. Unless you're a rabid fan who must read everything this somewhat overrated s.f. writer published, consider this one a waste of time.

This is a great group of ladies who sing tight 3 part harmony, and sound similar to Point of Grace. \\"You Call Me Yours\\" will transport you to the heavenly choir worshipping around the throne.

Some people develop this to a point where they see only energetical vibrations, thus being able to see through walls. The book doesn't teach you anything at all!!

But, I must remind you that this is the music soundtrack. The black is the score. So, for this, I don't have to say. It is good. I like track 4 because it is the bomb.

Gabriel delights the audience with more singing, dancing, doing a little \\"Twist and Shout.\\" Guest conductor Enrique Patron de Rueda has met quite a challenge keeping up with Gabriel who, clearly in tune to what excites the audience, is now on his own wild agenda. The pace slows temporarily but then picks up again and the audience is on its feet. The videographers capture some priceless audience reactions. As in Volume I, this video includes a lot of music that is not on the CD. There is an element of truth to the old adage that seeing is believing. In this case, what one sees is nearly unbelievable. What a performance! What a guy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An older version of Juan Gabriel","review":"Although the concert was in VHS format and therefore not visually as clear as I would want, the concert was Wonderful!!

It doesn't promise to make you a big winner like Mr. S does. What a shame, the Idiot's seem to be way more realistic. (B-t-w, Stoker is obviously a plant - go read all the Scoblete reviews.

The only reason I bought it is because Jayne Mansfield is in it for a brief second, seen attending a premiere. It is a crystal clear copy of this film, which previously i only had a horrible colector copy. It is typical of the Hippie type documentary films that were being made for Drive-in propaganda at the time in the late sixties. If you are thinking you can sit and enjoy an intellectual film about the sixties, forget this film. If your buying it because of some other reason, that is the only reason to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Hilarious","review":"Full disclosure: haven't seen it yet.What I did see is this film playing in the background of an extremely hip Los Angeles bar/club.

While on the face of things this may seem a rather bland arguement for a book, it is nonetheless a very important one in the field of Reformation historiography. Although the afterword of the book solidly disputes the monograph (the reader tends to wonder why it was included) Markish's work is hard to argue with and makes for an enlightening read. A must have for any Reformation scholar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doodlebop imposters","review":"This DVD is of the \\"old\\" Doodlebops. They look like they're wearing masks with big ears.

We catch it on Saturdays and I've had some difficulty sitting through it. However, my daughter, 18 months, loves it. I bought this for her and it's by far the best 4 episodes that I've seen. The more she watches it, the more I enjoy it. Now I watch it and can see the appeal. They are adorable little characters. The music is upbeat and fun.

It has turned out to be one of the best flashlights I have ever bought for that purpose. The battery life is excellent and it fits nicely in your pocket. For my purposes I do not want a very bright light and having the ability to switch between four different colors is a huge advantage at night when I may want a brighter or dimmer light. All in all it is a great light, I am bummed a little that the spring in the base has worn out, so I need to order another one. If you work in an environment where night vision is a priority, ie a cockpit, bridge of ship, etc, this is an excellent light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool light, weak clip","review":"The clip is a nice edition, but don't expect it to stay on the brim of your hat if you are running or brush up against something.

Read this. You will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"There was fantasy before Tolkein","review":"When I was in middle school I recieved a book for Christmas of short fantasy stories that had The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save for Sacnoth by Lord Dunsany in it. This story blew my mind, it was so imaginative and exciting and written so beautifully and I looked everywhere for some of his books and couldn't find them. Luckily, Del Ray has put them back into print. The King of Elflands Daughter is a wonderful novel, very beautiful and dreamy. Lord Dunsany had a large imagination and it shows. His writing is like reading poetry and his descriptions are very vivid. I loved the way Elfland was described, I recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy and is sick of pale Tolkein imitations."},{"rating":"2","title":"a marriage to Elfin","review":"Let us say first...dear lovers of faerie fiction,... that this author and this novel inspired Tolkien. That alone should mark it as being something special. It will, however, never find as exulted a place in literature as the Lord of the Rings will in our opinion. In this case, the student surpasses the master (as it truly should be). Still, this is a tale worth reading, of a somewhat arranged marriage between two individuals, a prince of Erl (a kingdom of mankind) and the King of Elfland's Daughter, who are not entirely suited to each other. The prince seems less interested in the Princess than in hunting unicorns to extinction. A modern version would have a faerie marrying a guy who spends all his time watching football on television.This is not your swords and sorcery style fantasy, although the unicorn hunting can be quite graphic, this tale is far subtler on the whole than that. If you love tales of Faerie, then this is one that should be read.kyela,the silver elves"},{"rating":"2","title":"A note on the library binding","review":"The pages are not sewn, rather they are glued.

I was a teenage boy of 18. I remember going beyond the fields we know, and to this day I have never returned. I was profoundly moved and found myself weeping. Even then I knew: this was the poetry of dreams. How does one describe the dream worlds of Lord Dunsany? This is heady stuff: a strange intoxication of beautiful prose that has to be experienced with an open heart and mind. This is some of the literature that inspired me as a boy to write and illustrate my own dreams. Wonderful, that this is back in print. DO NOT pass up THE CHARWOMAN'S SHADOW, or anything by this cerebral master. I hope someone reprints BEYOND THE FIELDS WE KNOW and OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY. DO NOT LET THESE CLASSICS OF LITERATURE DIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I bought this based on the effusive praised heaped by other reviewers here, but it was a waste of time and money.

I finished it out of my own stubborness but for the last half of the book I was just scanning through to see what happens. As stated by others Lord Dunsay writes good prose but he does little else. The story is stupid and the characters are one-dimensional. And the elegant prose can get irritating because much of it is just repeated over and over and over some more. For example, his description of Elfland is poetic - the first time you hear it! but every few chapters he has to repeat it (and it is a page long description). Anyone who says they enjoyed this book is just trying to be impressive and show that they can read 'high-level' fantasy. I am not sure if the other works of Dunsay will be any better but I suspect that his short stories might have a better chance since he would not run out of material and have to repeat himself.Better books to read : Dark Tower series, Silmarillion, Lyonesse series by Jack Vance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Very Exciting Story!","review":"Save your money! This got good reviews, so I decided to tryit. And I'm sorry I did. The story is not very exciting, doesn't make you want to turn to the next page & continue reading & its just, well...dull. None of the characters are particularly interesting either, the author doesnt tell nearly enough about them to make you care what they do. So save your money. If you think you might be interested in reading it...get it from a friend, the library or a used bookstore first. Spend your money on something really good like Stardust by Neil Gaiman or any Piers Anthony novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring waste of time","review":"An utterly boring waste of time. The book is full of words, a veritable word factory, written in pseudo-lyrical style, but the plot is predicable and as the reader nears the end of the book, the terrible realization begins to dawn that it's all leading nowhere. The trite ending eventually confirms the reader's well-founded fear.There is absolutely no similarity between the fourth rate plotting and second rate use of language of Dunsany and that of J. R. R. Tolkien. The Hobbit and Lord of The Rings are poetic, heroic, epic, something to which Dunsany might aspire in his dreams, but then he -- and his duped reader -- must wake up to real life....I should have known I was in for a disappointment when I saw that great self-important mediocrity, Neil Gaiman, involved himself in the book by writing an utterly meaningless introduction.As for Del Rey publishing bringing this book back from its well-deserved oblivion, they really shouldn't have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written but slow paced.","review":"I found the story hard to get into and slow, but afterwards felt like it was a good story.

Well folks, if you want \\"real\\" dub, check out Twilight Dub Circus. For me, this album works. It makes me feel happy-- it amuses me-- from the rhythmic vocal parts to the dub / electronic hybrid beats. Some pieces, certainly, are not as strong as others-- to me, \\"Supersoul Dub\\" seems a little single-minded, for example-- but others stand out nicely, such as both parts of \\"Retrograde Dub\\", a driving, rocking piece that rounds out the album nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battered: That's how I FELT in trying to read this text.","review":"Maybe some of the problem was the used textbook I purchased, but I really don't think so.

Planning a research trip/adventure for a year in Rio, and then writting about her life there obviously demonstrates Guillermoprieto's ability to earn money by doing what she likes. Her style is journalistic and if you've never visited a third world country you can get a good idea from her observations of what living in one, as an average citizen, is like, eg. people accustomed to little prosperity evidently will go to great lengths for entertainment, and to achieve a feeling of importance. If you want to learn about samba, well- guillermoprieto is not omniscient.

It's a good product but this container with its telescoping spout is a bad idea. I'm not sure why it telescopes, since my arms works pretty well in that regard, but the real difficulty is with the shut-off nozzle at the tip. If you touch the tip to the item you're oiling, it depresses the shut-off valve, defeating the purpose of the dispenser. If you're doing something like oiling a bicycle chain you need three hands - one to rotate the chain, one to hold and squeeze the oil container, and third to keep the tip from retracting. The original metal can is much easier to use.

Just a regular fine penetrating oil. The can with the telescoping spout is a disaster. This has to be the least ergonomic oil container in existance.

I needed to replace my old metal can as it was nearly dry, and made the mistake of purchasing this product.The engineer who invented the spout on this product should be fired AND exiled to a desert island. There are no instructions on how to use the spout, whether to cut it (as one would with the old containers) or just pull the top off. When I tried to pull the top off it wouldn't come off at all. I had to use two sets of needle nose pliers to separate the top from the oiling tube that you eventually figure out is down inside the container.The container appears to be like an old fashioned oil can where you push on the bottom to get oil out. In fact the plastic container is hard enough to deflect bullets.

However, when you combine the oil with this cheaply-made, poorly designed bottle, you get oil that is un-dispensable.The telescoping feature seems like a good idea, but then you realize that you have to use it, or no oil comes out. The tube will always be covered in oil, so it makes a mess. The red plastic cap is poorly sealed, and the tip falls off or comes open, leaking oil everywhere.Get this in a different package and you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, even for adults!","review":"The Thoenes stay remarkably true to Doyle's style of writing and give us a closer look at some of the great detective's assistants.

'Very nice of you to save the boy, Holmes,' Van Rorin said, ' but who'll save you?' 'Jump!' Peachy sobbed, worried for the life of his friend. 'No, Carnehan,' Holmes called from the deck, 'I would surely drown.' 'Quiet!' Van Rorin shouted......'Now it's time to dispose of you, Holmes.'Peachy heard a shot and sunk his head below the surface.

The first third of the novel is additional material covering the nine years after the big events in the previous books, on the anniversary of The Surge, and the climactic battle that caused it. Frankly I feel that a book could have been dedicated to each year in between, fleshing out some of the characters (and perhaps focusing on some of the lesser known characters -- this is a HUGE ensemble starting at the beginning with 113 \\"specials\\"). Once we get to the 10th Anniversary, Cover starts parroting Stracynski's work again, and there is very little additional information, and again we might as well have just read the Graphic Novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Fan of Marlon Brando so therefore.................","review":"Hi Folks, I viewed this play once on CBS Playhouse and absolutely fell in love with it.

Big waste of time. To start, the construction of these is very flimsy. The earpiece is made of hard plastic and seems very prone to breaking easily (I've only had mine a week so far). I have a somewhat average size ear, and I couldn't get the earpiece to stay in place for more than 2-3 minutes. Also, the sound quality is very tinny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it.","review":"So I'm watching this movie and I really dislike the main character, maybe it's because I'm not Jewish, I just can't relate to allowing everyone to walk all over you like pretty much everyone in his life does. He is basically a cuckold being that his wife is obviously cheating on him and he's too stupid to realize what's right in front of his face. How this man has gone through life being so passive and unassertive is something I would rather die than have to suffer through myself. Mind you that I haven't finished watching the movie yet, I've somehow gotten through an hour of it, but it's just so gd boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most definitely not for everyone.","review":"I kept hearing about this movie being one of the best of 2009 so I decided to watch it. The very first scene of the movie had me thinking I was in for something really good. But the best and only good part of the movie was those first 10 minutes. What I sat through after that was a whole lot of nothing. The only reason I was able to finish watching it was in the hopes that at least SOMETHING interesting was going to come up. Don't be tricked into buying this by the 5 star reviews, if you absolutely have to find out for yourself what this hype is about then netflix it. The most common argument to bash people who didn't like this movie seems to be \\"oh not enough explosions for you?\\" but really I like all kinds of movies slow paced or high action, but this is just not a good movie in my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not enjoy this film","review":"I am not jewish so I did not understand the humor in this film.

All style and no substance, they have taken the approach that way less is more and this movie is the equivalent of watching paint dry. And then, for good measure, it pulls an oh so artistic ending a-la \\"The Sopranos\\" which leaves you feeling kicked in the gut. You'll never get this hour and a half back. \\"The Shipping News\\" for me will always be the worse movie ever made, but this one is close to being the worse of the decade. Please spare me the \\"you just didn't get it, it's so profound\\" bull. Whatever existential meaning this carries could have been conveyed on a postage stamp. I'm just warning you that haven't seen it yet, you may feel enlighted and self important for choosing this one, but you'll hate yourself later."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this better after the fact","review":"The Coens do maintain perfect control over the look and timing and tone of this deeply weird comedy. I didn't even know this was a Coen Bros film until after the credits started rolling. Then it all began to make sense. Before that, I was sometimes confused by the point here: The prologue set in 19th century Poland implies that we are somehow going to be watching a modern-day horror film in which we must watch to see who will be exposed as a type of devil or vampire. When the circa 1967 part of the film begins, it seems to be some type of deeply weird Jewish comedy. Only after awhile, does the viewer settle down and soak up the comic details. The look of suburban Minneapolis at the dawn of the hippy era as flower power just begins to creep into the Midwest is exactly perfect, it seems to me. The soundtrack, mainly songs from the Jefferson Airplane's 1967 classic \\"Surrealistic Pillow,\\" is also powerful. If you like Coen brothers movies, you will want to catch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Letdown","review":"Big disappointment from Joel and Ethan Coen, who deliver a Jewish black comedy that is all setup and no payoff. \\"A Serious Man\\" (2009) has its virtues - Michael Stuhlbarg's engaging performance and the artful cinematography of Roger Deakins. All for naught, since the Coens keep the audience at arm's length while switching stylistic gears too often. A maddeningly abrupt conclusion ruins the entire film. Deeply personal yet oddly detached by Coen standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's all the fuss?","review":"A lot of words have been spilled out these review pages about the supposed esoteric nature of this film. Yes the protagonist is Jewish, and yes one does need to have an appreciation for droll humor, but if these are not obstacles to your viewing enjoyment, this is a straightforward, funny movie. The vast majority of viewers will easily relate to the problems that life brings into the protagonist's way. The ending does require an appreciation for the Jewish aversion to wrapping up something as complex as the human dilemma into a nice little package. The Christian worldview is intrincically more optimistic than that arising from diaspora Jewry. This last is no reason to not find humor, or interest, in the Jewish view of life; a view which does have some merit.

There is not much of a plot though and the movie moves really slow. The ending is a let down without really bringing the movie to a conclusion. I think the writers were trying to make a fable set in the 1960's. There are minor plot lines that don't come together in the end or lead to a climax. This movies moves as slow as the main characters life. Larry Gopnik's life is just a series of lower lows with nothing to make us care or have much interest in his life.

I found it to be droll at best, and downright pretentious at its worst. Basically, just like the series Seinfeld, \\"A Serious Man\\" is about nothing. That's it - nothing. The only problem is that the movie even lacks a punch line, something that the series Seinfeld made sure to deliver. I'm sure that the Coen brothers are laughing to themselves at all of the profoundly Earth-shattering \\"truths\\" that people are falling all over themselves to extract from this pointless movie.You want a \\"deep\\" movie that explores the random and existential nature of life, and yet reveals what really lurks in the hearts of men and women?

It does not. I cannot believe the Coen Brothers could have made this, given their previous films. Maybe a Jewish person would like it as it had so much Jewish customs and language in it.

If you're not familiar with them than you should not start with this film. The movie has a good openning scene with an old Jewish couple living in 18th century Europe. They end up with a curse struck down upon them.Then we are in present day Minnesota with a physics teacher and family man who is a descendant of the old couple(or maybe just another jew in another time). His life starts falling apart with one unfortunate event after another as he lets everyone in his life walk all over him. The movie continues with the usual Coen dark comedy.

Then again most of their movies only get better after repeated viewings.This won't be everybody's cup of tea.Still, if you like the Coen's previous style of dark comedies (and this one will rank amongst their darkest), their offbeat sense of humor, their meticulous attention to sets and details, the quirky characters nailed by some superb performaces, then \\"A Serious Man\\" should work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal film; just one minor quibble","review":"I loved this movie. I've watched the uncanny opening scene several times on Youtube. I'm puzzled by oneapparent dramaturgical error. The wife stabs a learned rabbi, thinking he is a dybbuk because she heard fromher cousin that this man had actually died 3 years ago. A dybbuk however is a living person who has been possessedby the spirit of a dead person. Its physical appearance is that of the living one, not the dead one, so it is notpossible for the rabbi to be a dybbuk in the way that the wife thinks he is. Of course, we can interpret that thewife herself misunderstands or does not know the distinction between a dybbuk and a ghost or revenant.This is only a minor quibble. The movie manages to be bleak and hilarious at the same time, in truly Kafkaesquefashion. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gift for my boyfriend.","review":"As Coen brothers films usually, it was long and it was dark. I kept waiting for something good to happen for the main character, but that's kind of the whole point of the film.

It is permeated with hope and practical realism - hope because he believes theologians and psychologists can work together and practical because he thinks integration is more about working on problems together than it is about harmonizing their disciplines. He proposes that the disciplines of theology and psychology are radically different in their methodology and purposes setting the stage for complementarity rather than antagonism. Theologians, he suggests, do well to remain silent about the causes of phobias while scientific psychologists might be cautious about expounding on the meaning and purpose of life. When a discipline knows its limits, each can make a contribution to the greater common good. This is a book worth pondering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recorded in a tin can","review":"I know the technolgy was not that gereat in 1972 but the quality of the recording is simply dreadful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Curly Whirly","review":"I love this product!

Then I pull it through all the strands, place a few horizontal clips at the top to help hold some lift and dry with a diffuser to bring out the curls. Once completely dry, I break up the stiffness by just scrunching the hair upwards. That breaks the \\"gel cast\\" or stiffness some reviews complain about. I'm left with soft, well-defined curls.

Talia is very cute, but poor and misunderstood by her family.

The whole chain of events is very predictable.When someone's a bad guy, they're a bad guy for good, devillish, menacing, power-hungry and without any kind of thoughts, doubts or feelings. When someone's a good guy however, they will be nice to Talia, help her all the way, and have their own personality consisting of only good things.

Now that I've read it I'm trying to get more in the series because it's SO good! As a horse-lover and fan of fantasy books written in the style of Tamora Pierce (an awesome contemporary author) I have been hard-pressed to find a book that satisfied my reading requirements.Ms. Lackey has an excellent character sense that makes people and places believable. Anyone from pre-teen up will be able to read this book and will probably enjoy it. The main character is not \\"perfect\\" and actually spends much of the book trying to find her place in society after she is cast out of her patriarchal home where she was verbally and physically abused for not being a meek and submissive woman.PS: The horses (Companions as they are called) are awesome!

Although some of the writing is a bit awkward, especially in the first few pages, it is a wonderful story of how a girl goes from being the black sheep of the family to being the nation's heroine.As for Valdemar being perfect, I tend to think not. Why would you need Heralds if the place were perfect? No one would be greedy, lie, cheat, murder, plot, or swindle. The imperfections in the nation are evident in books 2 and 3.

The only hint of something better comes in the stories the kids learning to be Heralds tell about the dark fates of their elders, but that's not enough to carry the book. It's sentimental tripe.The idea of the Heralds is cool, except that we never see them do any Heralding in this book, and the Herald name is misleading because they don't do, well, heraldry, but it's an interesting concept that perhaps the author developed better in another text.Anne McCaffrey's Dragonsong trilogy is a far better written coming of age fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not enough plot","review":"Although it is the first valdemar book, it was the fourth valdemar book I ever read.

Even worse, she doesn't act like a child who was raised in an abusive and patriarchal environment. Oh, we're *told*, more than once, that her guardedness is a problem and she'll need special help, but we're never *shown* it, nor is there much evidence that Talia's teachers and mentors are doing much about it, with once exception.I'm sure I would feel differently if I'd read this when I was a lonely teenager, but as an adult? *meh*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring...","review":"Arrows of the Queen is, I think, one of the best Mercedes Lackey books.

On average I listen to 10-15 hours worth of audio books per week and was really excited to see one of my favorite books finally available in audio format. What a major let down it turned out to be. A good audio book is performed, Carol Edie Smith mostly just reads this book. While she has very good diction (used to stage performances perhaps?) her reading of this book is almost a distraction - odd pauses and stressess on the weak portions of the text at the expense of the really significant moments really detract from Mercedes Lackey's prose. Ms. Smith is only capable of either speaking in her own voice or her voice with a Irish accent.

A brewing book based on the original \\"Clone Brews\\" book, should have gone beyond the great simplicity of the first.Isn't that the goal of every follow up? The mistakes are many, and often in this book; and this is a disservice to the novice brewer--who needs recipes to be fairly complete to build their confidence and repertoire. To say that this book is a \\"must own\\" for the brewers' library, and compare it to books like \\"Beer Captured\\"; is a misrepresentation of a incomplete work--that only seasoned brewers can decipher.

Many of the lyrics and background music reflect the band's original musical style on their first few cds. I personally, didn't like their first few cds.

However, this sequel should never have been made. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy reunite for another brief encounter, but it is more of the same without all the great scenery. Now they are older and more cynical and talk about the most insipid things. Julie is now a bitter, left-wing enviro-kook that whines about all her boyfriends not marrying her. Ethan stares at her with puppy dog eyes and a goofy grin and just vacuosly agrees with her anti-American rhetoric just hoping to get laid.

Julie should also stick to acting, and singing, in my opinion. She really has a lovely voice and gift for playing the guitar.

Not one kiss. Oh brother. Superb acting, superb setting, sublime love story... horrible horrible cliffhanger ending. And not even a kiss or love scene.

In fact, I will:Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, reunited after many years, walk around France and converse, not necessarily about anything of interest to anyone including, it seems, themselves. They occasionally take a break from their walking to sit down, while continuing to converse and continuing to not say anything of interest.

The one area, I believe could evolve is the basic 5 or 6 Pillar system that organizations focus- Quality, People, Growth, Finance, Service.

The storytelling here is clear and personal without simplifying the ideas or emotions, despite the inherent complexity of the subject. It is also one of the most lovingly shot documentaries you can find. The poetry in every frame and the beauty in each subject's stories creates a celebration of life in the most profound way. This movie should be required viewing for anyone who wishes to truly live and strongly suggested for anyone who will one day die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound and moving","review":"This impeccably shot documentary illuminates the world of hospice care from the perspective of the volunteers.

My comment is not about the organization but about this documentary. It could and should have been written and produced so much better. The interviews with the volunteers fell short, mostly, of giving the viewer a more comprehensive view of what happens entirely with being a Hospice volunteer. There was one good interview with a former volunteer who became a person in the end stage of life. She offered some \\"lessons for the living,\\" but this is where the title falls short. Not too many lessons to hear about, nor was there a good understanding about how to be a volunteer and what precisely one does.

Kadare does a good job of creating the tension that reverberates throughout the book. I was gripped with suspense and fear everytime Mark-Alem walked in silence through the dark, creepy corridors that stretched for miles on end. That really gave me the chills. Kadare also has a good grasp of his words. The interpretation of the book (originally in French) is superb - very easy to read, and manages to deliver the story in good style. The story is engaging, and it draws you into the world of the Tabir Sarrail, where reality and dreams are indistinguishable.

The thirty-five year mystery is solved. \\"Charleston\\" is a half-baked Italian rip-off of \\"The Sting\\". The byzantine plot concerns a dapper con artist(Bud Spencer) and his doltish minions trying to rip-off a stupid millionaire (James Coco) in a deal involving a luxury liner. Thrown into the mix is a stolen Gaugan. It gets so confusing that you don't care after a while. Sole selling point is Herbert Lom doing a riff on his Inspector Dreyfus character that played better when he was opposite Peter Sellers. \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" fans should note the presence of Ronald Lacey who played Todt in that film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic and uplifting","review":"A side-project from Greg Ellis' work in superlative music duo Vas (as _Portals of Grace_ was for Ellis' musical partner Azam Ali), _Kala Rupa_ is an astonishingly vibrant album. The tracks, labelled simply as 'Forms', are predominantly explorations in rhythm, without vocals - although Azam Ali does sing on a couple of tracks. This is a percussionist's album, and full of infectious energy. [For anyone familiar with the rest of Vas' output, think track 5 on _In the Garden of Souls_]There is a great variety in pace and instrumentation among the forms, offering something to suit every mood and ensuring that listening is never a dull experience. A large number of collaborators bring their talents to this album, and the result is a deeply 'organic' recording - one arising naturally from blending and experimentation with the instruments.

In Beloved Exile, more so than in Firelord, Godwin's imagination is free to run. The result is interesting, but with less of the high drama of Firelord.In both novels Godwin explores the difference between British and Saxon societies: the former being aristocratic, kin-based, honour-bound, poetic and chivalric; the latter much more democratic, land-based, law-bound, prosaic and pedestrian. These are stereotypes, for sure, but it gives the novels a sense that something is at stake in the struggle between the two societies.Godwin's portrait of Guenevere as a woman of power is compelling. Her power comes from her intelligence, pragmatism, and royal birth (unlike in lesser novels where she is often portrayed as a warrior-princess, or mystical priestess, or girl-next-door)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chacksfield at his best!","review":"This wonderful selection in a typical Chacksfield fashion provides us with classic arrangements of mid-sixties standards and famous soundtracks.

Very simple.I've got the computer sound output to a Yamaha MCR-E810 2-speaker stereo system (around $400).

Yoga dvds for beginners or the Himalayan Institute's Yoga: Mastering the Basics. The Lilias! dvds explain why you place your hands and feet in those positions and allow you to correct the poses for the best fit. If you can follow along with the audio, as you can with either of these dvds, without looking at the tv, a beginner can master the moves without difficulty or hurt. Romy falls into more of an intermediate-beginner catagory. She has a soft voice and the dvd flows a little more quickly than the aforementioned.

The untrained ear will probably call it noise, but a metal masterpiece lies beneath the wall of sound in Chaosphere. Meshuggah are apparently ingenious musicians who posess the ability to construct entire songs centered around constantly revolving, insane time signatures (my personal favorite being the 23/16 intro to New Millenium Cyanide Christ). Add to that lo-tuned, crushing guitars, expert drumming, unrelenting vocals, and some really demented soloing (first heard on Concatenation), and you have the technical brutality of Chaosphere.

Some good musicianship but not too much, just a lot of stupid riffing then another background guitar trying to sound all sci-fi, lmao. If you want the weird chaotic time signatures I recommend Dillenger Escape Plan over this band (I don't like them much either but they blow this band away.)

If a band can keep you confused in that way, wondering what they'll do next and making you beg for more, this is something you need to check out. Chaosphere is an amazing work of tech-death metal that could make anyone start headbanging after 10 seconds. The technicality can't be equalled, nor can the heaviness.

If ever there was a perfect soundtrack to any Terminator movie, Messhugah would fit the bill. There are only 8 tracks but that is plenty. Each track assults the ears without mercy.

Leaving behind the softer vocals (yes, singing!) of None and Contradictions Collapse, and vastly speeding up the hard hitting riffs from Destroy, Erase, Improve, Meshuggah has created a shorter masterpiece of modern music. Each song is intense, with no breaks in the madness (their name DOES mean Crazy in Yiddish/Hebrew), unlike previous efforts. Listening to Meshuggah is like listening to one gigantic instrument with vocals added in, instead of four instruments + singing. The tempo changes, the solos, the rhythm, are astounding in their complexity. Having taken their music to its logical conclusion, i find it hard to see where Meshuggah will turn next for a fourth full length album... If you're looking for intelligent, amazingly talented heavy metal, look no farther!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this will blow your mind!","review":"Contradictions Collapse was intense, REALLY intense. Destroy Erase Improve was better, so good that of my 300+ CD collection it is easily my favorite. Chaosphere is pretty much even with DEI as both have good points.

The music here is as brutal as it gets. Slayer, Strapping Young Lad, Emperor...all are brutal to be sure but don't surpass this (though each DOES have a CD which comes close, those being Reign in Blood, City and IX Equilibrium). Granted I am a HUGE fan of Meshuggah, these gods of music can do no wrong and Chaosphere drives that point home like an icepick shot out of an AR-15. Incidently, listening to this is similar to getting hit by that very same icepick, tearing right through you without mercy and if your not used to such brutal music, listening to this will be just as painful,.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive use of Poly-Rhythms and Time Signatures","review":"The first few times I heard this album I found it hard ot listen to because the time signatures sound as though the guitar is having trouble keeping up at times. Upon extensive listening I am just beginning to hear the genius in this album. The frequent use of poly-rhythms and strange time signatures such as 7/4 and 9/8 make this music INCREDIBLY diffucult to play. The intensity created by the guitars and drums on this album is only added to by the super-intense vocals. This is an album for anyone who sets their standards high in Heavy Metal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best metal Album EVER!!!","review":"Meshuggah's \\"Choasphere\\", in my opinion, is the Heaviest album ever made(Yes, Heavy with a capital \\"H\\"). As a fan of general music, in this case metal, I've heard tons of heavy, crazy grinding metal. For Example, Cannibal Corpse, Cryptopsy, Kataklysm, Deicide, Berzerker and Gorguts(as a matter of fact, I hate those bands).Meshuggah are heavier than all those bands. Beside the obvious brutal riffage, these guys can play their intruments better than anyone around. The music is tremendously technical, and very Original. It's obvious that no band(on this planet atleast) sounds like Meshuggah, however, the closest sounding bands to Meshuggah are; Cryptopsy, Fear Factory, Athiest, Cynic, Soilent Green and Living Sacrifice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product","review":"So I've never had this before. But my girlfriend kept on going on and on and on about how delicious this is.After a month of searching for a way to get it here in the US, I finally found a seller on Amazon.So, it's very interesting. The inside consistency is that of malt balls, however, the taste is nothing like malt balls. It's a combination of honey and sweet nougat (like the inside of a snickers bar (minus the caramel, peanuts of course)).I really like it. I'd recommend this to anyone. It's a shame it's not sold in stores here, I think it'd do quite well"},{"rating":"2","title":"honeycomb chocolate awesomeness","review":"They used to sell Violet Crumble in many stores here in Hawaii in the 80s, when I was a kid. It was always a treat to have one. Then, time went on and I sort of forgot about them since they disappeared from the shelves. And one day when I was really craving one, I realized I hadn't seen one anywhere in a long time. Then I got the crappy news that they aren't really easy to come by in the U.S. anymore. The chocolate is not too sweet, and the honeycomb middle is crunchy and light. It's unlike any other candy bar I've had (though I have not had the Crunchie bar people compare it to). Quite possibly my fave candy bar of all time.

On the level of interpretation, I believe that Munch's approach to the music of this repertoire is second to none. He just handles the Boston Symphony Orchestra right and has a way of accenting the wonderful tempos and themes; the result is magical! In the \\"Harold in Italy\\", who better than Primrose?

I had been eye-ing a few different water sprays, but I never understood why anyone would spend money on what seemed like just water in a can. Now I get it! I am very fair skinned and extremely sensitive to temperature changes, so when the air gets dry in the winter but the heat is blasting, my skin isn't happy. When I'm overheated, my face is very red and blotchy. My skin is also extremely sensitive to chemicals, so I have to be careful about what products I use on it. I keep this spray can in my fridge and after a workout or a hot shower, I spray this mist on and it feels amazing. You can see it dew up on your skin for a few moments and it calms down my skin by about 50% immediately. It also is great for spritzing right before you moisturize -- it locks in moisture really well. I will never be without this product. Highly recommend for anyone who gets red in the face and needs a natural, refreshing way to cool down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sunscreen on theplanet","review":"After purchasing half a dozen sunscreens, I'm only buying this one from now on.

It lacked almost everything.So movie is about this asteroid deal that breaks up and the bigger half is headed for the Earth. It missed the Earth but it somehow shifts the Earth's orbit closer to the sun. People start dehydrating, dying, etc. For some odd reason, only a couple of people can survive and try to make it North.Bad plot. It should have had more buildup at the beginning. The Earth gets hit or not should have lasted a little longer. It all happened very quickly. It was unreasonable that at 139 degrees, the people were wearing long sleeves and with minimal sweat.Bad acting. It was like they picked people off the street and gave them a chance. They have no personalities whatsoever, makes you lose interest very fast.Overall, i dont recommend the movie. Bad plot and bad acting. Good to see once, but only if you are very bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meltdown","review":"Got my dvd really fast ty so much!!The dvd was in very good shape and the sellers was great!Thanks again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meltdown Movie Disaster","review":"I agree. I had to come here and look up this movie because it was so bad. It may be the worst movie I've ever seen. I knew it was filmed in Canada because, although they say it's 139 degrees, everyone is wearing coats and jackets. Exploding cars was an oh my god moment. And I believe someone mentioned that the other planets may pull the Earth back into orbit, and then it starts raining and the movie is over. No words are spoken. I also loved the giant air conditioners they put on top of the vehicles with no power source for them. Very funny. As soon as any kind of disaster hits, people turn into sewer dwelling zombies with boils on their faces.

Favorite tracks are Painted Veil and Inside Her Eyes, although all the tracks are standouts. I'm bummed that the band has \\"dissolved/evolved\\", but they are new to me, and I'm happy to be so pleasantly surprised when I had no expectations. Go to iTunes, and download the Russell solo CD.

It has the same feel as BLOC with a great folk/country/rock/ blend and some awesome guitar work. The TOFOG lyrics continue to be inspiring with plenty of edge. The stand-outs are Never Be Alone Again (great duet with Chrissie Hynde), Inside Her Eyes (you can feel the struggle) and Swallow My Gift which can't be adequately described, but must be experienced. Listening to Folsom Prison Blues made me wish I was at the concert in Texas, sounds like it was one hell of a party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ways of speaking","review":"30 Odd Foot Of Grunt has continued keeping with their flavor of story telling music.

Too much Dave Wilkins influence here and I still remember the night in Austin drinking with him when he told us all how much he disliked the music of TOFGO and really disliked Russell Crowe. His lack of emotional commitment to the project is pulling it down. Time to clean house boys and get a new member or go back to the orginal line up.

Other then that all the songs sound much like Gaslight and BLOC, which aren't anthing to \\"write home about\\". Unlike his wife, Danielle Spencer, who has an absolutly beautiful voice, Russell's doesn't do anything for me. I always have felt that he sounds off key.

Street smart tough female cop with some trauma history, stereotypical close Italian NY family, ultra-brainy medical examiner with unknown past. The formula for success is there and the chemistry on screen is very good with the main characters. Rizzoli has love interests coming on and off the show as this early on, a steady relationship is death. Isles, well she isn't showing herself as relationship material quite yet but that doesn't slow her down. More development on the Isles character takes place form time to time but that is definitely a place where the show can grow. It can be a bit campy and I wouldn't put it at a Bones quality but then again, some episodes of Bones isn't Bones quality either. A good show and I really enjoy watching it and hope to see them further develop the characters into less characterizations and more truly believable people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a fan at first","review":"Initially I was not enamored with this series and did not watch the first season after dismissing it.

Eddie Daniels showed the way for modern jazz clarinet, and I hoped Leverett was going to do the same for bluegrass so I bought her 'bluegrass' album (and no, I'm not a die-hard bluegrass fan). After listening to it, I am not surprised at all that the majority of bluegrass players want nothing to do with her, and in fact I'm fully supportive of them not doing so. It seems that while she is a very capable klezmer clarinetist, she is a god-awful musician, by which I mean that she has zero respect for any musical tradition other than her own, and is always seeking the spotlight. There are only a few tens of seconds across the entire album where she attempts to play anything even remotely like bluegrass.

How do we seek out enjoyment in life? There is much more meaning in life than that weekly paycheck, and we keep searching for it. The loudest message for answers is those little voices you have a habit of avoiding. This performance is teaching us the lesson to listen before you are MADE to stop the fast merry-go-round we ride, usually caused from going to fast and breaking something you don't want broken. We have to admit though, the worse break is within our spirit. Money doesn't mend this, but listening to our spirit voice does.

With information from rare and hard to find sources such as \\"The Panarion of Epihphanius of Salamis\\", Josephus, Jerome, the Tanakh, and more Willis writes a convincing book that helps the serious student to define who the the early ecclesias were and the nature of their faith.If you have ever wondered about the original church and the true nature of their faith, this is an excellent book to add to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musically sublime, audio quality disappointing","review":"I have waited years for this album to be released on CD, but listening to it this week has been a big disappointment.

In addition to the Zune I recently bought a pair of entry level Westone UM1 earphones which are well worth the $120 I paid for them.There was not a lot of amplification from the Boostaroo that the Zune didn't have already - it just didn't add alot of power.Worse, there is a constant hiss from the pretty low quality circuitry of the Boostaroo. It did nothing to increase the sound quality through amplification and made it worse when listening to something like classical or jazz by adding that annoying hiss.I'll be returning the Boostaroo (bought it from Radio Shack) and looking at other options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boostaroo 3","review":"Upbeat Audio T613-BMC Boostaroo 3 Channel Amplifier & SplitterDesign does not allow for any type of mounting.

Yes, non-stick pans tend to burn around the edges, even if you decrease cooking time. Still, the edges burn while you wait for the middle to cook. The design of this pan is great: it's easy to use and a snap to clean. But the loaves are a little smaller than I prefer and I've tried my two favorite loaf recipes (many times each) so far, and the surfaces ALWAYS overcook, giving a crispy texture I'd rather not have in my breads. It'd been quite a while since I'd tried the newer non-stick pans, so I thought I'd give them a chance, but they're just as always. I'm sticking with the aluminum-type baking pans.

One of those ways is what and how much I read. While many of my friends struggle with eighty-page children's chapter-books, there's almost nothing I enjoy more then sticking my nose in the latest 400+ page novel. I don't usually read comics, but when I stumbled upon Strangers in Paradise, I was intrigued by the brief synopsis on the flap and decided to give it a try.SiP turned out to be one of the greatest reading experiences I've ever had. The plot, and characters, are complex but not imcomprehensible, and the art is fabulous. It's not for people like some of my rather illiterate friends, but I recommend the entire collection of Strangers In Paradise to anyone- comic book reader or no, age doesn't matter- who enjoys a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"SiP is the best \\"graphic novel\\" around!","review":"Strangers in Paradise is great. I happened upon one cause I liked the cover and instantly fell in love with Katchoo, Francine, David, and all the others. Terry, thank you for writing something that gets me thru my life. I only wish I had the entire series; I'm working on it. Give this a chance; it's impossible to say why it's so great, but it is. This is not your typical comic, it's much, much Moore. If anyone can give me info on this or just loves it, write me! Long live Katchoo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A comic book about relationships!","review":"In this first book of Strangers in Paradise you will enter in the world of Katchoo (Katina Choovanski) and Francine.In this story we find out that David has a crush for Katchoo, however, Katchoo seems to love Francine, but Francine is deadly in love with Freddy who does not love anybody (although he is so crazy to make love with Francine, at least once, that he is willing to date her for one year waiting for this moment that never comes!!!).Basically, Strangers in Paradise is about relationships: the friends that come in our lives, the ones that we fall in love with or that we hate, the ones that are true, and the ones that deceive us.This first book is very funny and introduces the main characters in the series. We also discover that there is something wrong in Katchoo's past, but this will only be explored in the next books of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites...","review":"My ex-comic peddling friend recommended this to me one day. I reluctantly purchased it, but was incredibly pleased with the results. I found myself reading & re-reading this comic several times that day.The story starts off deceptively simplistic, with Francine once again brushing off the advances of her boyfriend Freddie. Freddie, fed up with her refusal to sleep with him, storms out after a scene with Francine & her roommate Katchoo. From there the story goes into several different directions, some of which are hinted at (but not gone into) in this volume. It truly is an incredibly strong start to one of the greatest indy comics of our time.Would I recommend this to a friend? YES! This series has something for everyone... pretty girls, heartwrenching romance, and lots of action & intrigue in the later volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best New Music","review":"I have found little new music in the past few years worth spending my hard earned money on but this CD is worth its weight in gold.The first track \\"Take Me To The Sweetest Emotion\\" Is bound to become a classic!

Middle section picks up during WWII with the same officer now captain and introduces the Jeffrey Hunter signalman character. Finally we get to the action with the signalman aboard the German vessel where he heroically decides to slow up repairs. Although the cool premise carries the WWII portions, making them watchable, the whole movie botches the potential of that premise. The backstory is simply filler, not in any way motivating the choices of the poorly developed characters. Someone could remake this far better, first by eliminating the whole affair angle."},{"rating":"2","title":"jbw3","review":"I have looked for this movie for years under several names but always starring Jeffery Hunter.

The first book completely snared me: The story of half breed twins whose lives are changed for ever by a mysterious stranger. The second,though not as strong as the first, still held my attention. This third however was a disappointment, heavily bogged down in mysticism and self absorbed characters. The story could have been told in 150 pages rather than 400. Not only that, but loose ends are not satisfyingly tied up. The conclusion feels rushed but at the same time overly long. I know I was really hoping that the story would come back to some of the principals in the first book but it doesn't. They are little more then an after thought and the charas that the novel does focus on simply don't engage the reader's sympathy at all. Read the novel to complete the series but don't expect it to have the same verve as the first two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hero's Quest","review":"This book, being the final book in a trilogy about a character who becomes a messiah figure, would have been impossible to write well by most writers published today. This, as well as the fact that the writer is coming from a Pagan background, makes it doubly hard. You need to read the first two books in the trilogy to understand what she has done in this novel. Stealing Sacred Fire is the most esoterical of the three, but also the most complex in regards to what it has to say about all religions. I highly recommend it and feel that this was how the journey had to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"To all those whom are x-mas shopping...

I've found the fact of no female bowlers only a mild annoyance but after all it's only a game. The modelers nailed the styles of the pros and the fact that they get strike after strike just shows me that I have a long way to go before I go on tour! If you nail the power line and the accuracy line with the proper aim, strikes come very readily! As in real bowling, no two lanes are alike, even synthetics and you have to adjust accordingly..The \\"COSMIC\\" feature was really a kick! The only thing missing was the disco mirror ball!! Lots of fun!! You also get a variety of lanes and lane conditions and different games you can play...The \\"SKINS\\" game was very challenging!

The game interface is simple and has a very short learning curve. It does not require a manual! I've bowled in mens leagues for 20 years. If your looking for a lot of depth buy a different type of game. bowling is a relatively simple game and this title delivers with great play. good graphics, sound and animation (although a little dated.) my only beef is some unusal leaves for spare on occasion. Great pin action! I have strung 11 strike in a row in a single game with 2/3 spin and a down and in line. Ifyou really want a challenge try one of the balls that hooks out the door. You will be humbled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a bowling game, but frustrating","review":"Yes, this is the best bowling game out there. However, that's pretty sad considering that it still is quite unrealistic. Yes, it has the best pin action, but throwing the same shot does not produce the same results each time. I've found that I get splits in the game about 10 times as much as in real life, and I have found I bowl better in the game using no spin rather than some spinn - not realistic. The pro bowlers always throw perfect balls, get 5+ in a row, etc, while the player is stuck with split after split. VERY FRUSTRATING.The worst part? No women. You can't be a woman bowler in this game, which I find disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a bowling game with realistic Pin Action","review":"Great to see a bowling game get the attention it needs.

Not surprisingly, the film was more successful for Fields than for Miss West - who detested the Great Man until the day she died. Worth seeing for historical purposes.OVERALL RATING: **"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Comedian of all time","review":"W.C.

Unfortunately I made the mistake of not checking it out until the Amazon 30 return policy was up so it is unreturnable. Every picture stops about half way through and won't play any more. I wasn't expecting any great quality but I was at least expecting to be able to finish the movies once they started. Don't buy this collection. If you do then don't make the mistake I did. Watch it before the return policy date is up in case the movies freeze up half way through like mine did. If I could give it 0 stars I would because it was a complete waste of my time and money and I feel very ripped off but Amazon forces you to give it at leat 1 star to register the review.

Being a Fields fan all my life I have seen all these movies many times, but seeing them this clear and sounding so good was like watching them brand new. Only reason I did not give it a five was the fact that these were not Fields best work. Although I see the logic of putting the gems (Its a Gift, Bank Dick) with the studio produced less popular movies. Next set till put the same mixture togeather I am sure. This set is a MUST for all Fields fans tho and worth the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classics","review":"The movies are good fun of a by-gone day.

They are extremely good considering they were from the 1930's. The sound is great, the resolution is fantastic.

The cassette bills itself as the most often-used German words and phrases and professes to help even those with no German express themselves clearly. Words (single words, not used in phrases) like resume, references, interview, unemployment office, residence permit, politician, election, campaigning,etc. are what the tape has, along with a few brief and irrelevant (for the most part) phrases.

The grammar introduced is poorly explained, very technical, and often things you'll only use in very specific situations. Much of the vocabulary is obscure and useless in every day conversation. The layout is awful and the illustrations laughable. The only way this might be useful to you is if you are dead-set on learning traditional/simplified characters at the same time. The accompanying workbook, however, is pretty good as it incorporates interesting reading activities.I would recommend the New Practical Chinese Reader over this series combined with a good grammar book like Routledge's Modern Mandarin Chinese Grammar. Don't waste your time on this one; I spent a full academic year working through this book in a fourth-year undergraduate class and feel like I hardly learned anything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The description states that this has both traditional and simplified characters, but this is only true for the reading passages, not for the workbook exercises.

And more than once my teacher have to say that the text is not gramatically correct (he's a Chinese).Learning the voca is fine but the fact that most chapters are not related makes it almost impossible for learners to review and relate between subjects.The dialogues are very hard, very daunting in the sense that they are ways too long. I am an English learners and I am comparing between some best English textbook and this. Not to mention, the Chinese characters make it even more difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated editions","review":"I ordered this book as one of my course texts. After receiving it I learned that it had been superseded by the 2nd edition (ISBN:0887274811). I asked Amazon to exchange it for the new edition, but they sent me another copy of the 1st edition! Now they tell me they can't supply the 2nd edition, although you can find it on their site by searching with the ISBN. So I have had to order a copy direct from the publisher (Cheng & Tsui). There is also a 2nd edition of the Level 2 textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off, no thank you, not again.","review":"I bought an integrated Chinese level two workbook.

It also includes the 3 Scherzos (2 of which are incredible, to my opinion), 2 Piano Sonatas, and 6 or so Miscellaneous pieces including the famous \\"Fantasie in F minor\\"My point is that for a few extra dollars you can get at least twice the music.

The diamond accents add a lovely touch, but they are not overstated. The pink mother of pearl face is also beautiful. It definitely is very subtle. I wear this watch everywhere from story time at library to a nice evening out. I receive many compliments on this watch. One other great feature is that the watch is waterproof. I am a busy mom and teacher, so sometimes forget to take it off when washing dishes, bathing my daughter etc. I would definitely check out your local jewelry store to purchase.

Unfortunately the print for this DVD is very poor. Most images are washed out to the point identifying the different actors can be difficult at times. In fact it finally got the best of me, and I did not finish watching it. Old serials like these from the non-surviving studios must be rare and good prints even rarer. It is doubtful it would be economically viable to restore this one or others like it. The main hope here is if one of the volunteer projects funded by donations and a few of the studios decides to tackle these. Until then I would not recommend this one to anyone except for the collector that just has to have every serial available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"Under the best of circumstances this would be difficult to follow as the plot jumps all over the place.

Some rock critics rate \\"Dusty in Memphis\\" as head of rock albums, with its smooth, creative arrangements and her subtle but driving vocals.But what makes this collection so special is its inclusion of lesser known renditions like \\"If You Go Away,\\" \\"Give Me Time,\\" and \\"My Coloring Book.\\" Dusty can break your heart with her plantitive whispering voice.Highly recommended for all Dusty fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference on my bookshelf","review":"Fluorescence spectroscopy is a broad subject, and this book covers a wide range of those topics.

At times I had a difficult time distinguishing the practice exams that came free with the book and those that shipped with the CD.I also have issues with having sections on X.21 and Appletalk (as well as EGP routing protocols, etc) when the CCNA exam objectives do not state any need to know them?

Frankly I wish *somebody* would make an attractive, feminine sleeve that is sturdy enough for travel, has some sense of style, and doesn't look like a bedspread. This sleeve isn't completely ideal, but it's nicer than I expected. The main thing is, it's thin enough to go in a (packed) roll-aboard but still has enough cushioning to protect the laptop. The 15.6 inch version has enough room for my 13-inch Dell, and the power cord, and probably a few file folders. The handles appear sturdy and don't take up much extra space. And the black-with-orange-welt design is really quite attractive. The only real drawback for me is the heinous orange \\"Microsoft\\" tag (which thankfully I was able to cut off) and the zipper pulls, which also say \\"Microsoft\\" and which cannot be removed.

Having done this, this is little more than a narowly Islamic diatribe with some reference to Rose Wilder Lane. I cannot recommend this book.

I'm kind of balancing between the cost of the stone, how often I used it, and where I used it (i.e. on all the knives that I have or just some of them only; I have multiple stones). I rate it 4 stars because with its thickness that is quite thin and pretty soft itself, it doesn't last that long. Well, not really a complain, the other stones of this quality are ~ 1 1/2 bigger and cost more than twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine arrived broken, also stone is not as wide as stated","review":"About 1 inch of the end of the stone fell off when I removed it from the package. Will return and see what the replacement looks like. What really ticks me off, it's listed as 2.5\\" wide but it's not, it's exactly 2\\". I should have bought a norton. Won't buy anymore of this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"woodstock d1130","review":"I should have listened to some of the other reviews before buying this! The stone is broken into so many pieces Its crazy. Packaging was terrible and now I have to go through the trouble of sending this piece of broken garbage back."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly packaged, cracked on arrival","review":"I just received this item and it was so poorly padded, that it was cracked all the way through on both ends where they failed to pad it. I can hardly see being able to use it in its condition. i gave this a low rating purely for the reason that it was poorly protected and broken on arrival."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I saw a video of this sharpener, and had high expectations of it. I tried it and, oh, what a disappointment. It takes forever, I mean, forever to get the knife just decently sharp. Can't even get it close to what you'd call a sharp knife. Absolutely not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent me a chipped stone","review":"The stone arrives with a big chunk broken. It works fine to sharpen but I wasnt very happy about receiving a broken product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Stone","review":"One of the best stones I have worked with in some time. The dual grits are wonderful for edge refinement and then polishing to a razor smoothness."},{"rating":"1","title":"36% less stone than you paid for","review":"The stone is significantly smaller than advertised. A smaller stone is harder to sharpen on, and because waterstones wear out, the volume of the stone determines how long it will last.Amazon description claimed size: 2.5\\" x 8.4\\" x 1.2\\" = 25.2 cubic inchesActual size: 2\\" x 8.125\\" x 1\\" = 16.25 cubic inchesSo, you're getting screwed to the tune of ((25.2 - 16.25) / 25.2) * 100 = 35.51%I'm not amused. It's going back to Amazon at their expense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Combo 1K Grit and 6K Grit Water stone","review":"I rated this stone 4 stars. First of all i like the fact it had 2 grits on both sides. It sharpened to a mirror like finish. However waterstone tend to wear very easily, and the thickness of each grits is only 1/2 inch. The overall stone was 1 in so each side has 1/2 inch of the stone. The waterstone wore out very quick resulting in my lapping my stone every 3-4 chisel or plane irons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waterstone","review":"Arrive in good condition, takes some work to obtain relatively sharp edge on kitchen knives, but does work. If you are willing to spend the time, worthwhile buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the practice","review":"I have a drawer full of sharpeners, and this is the first one that has brought my knives back to 'just bought' sharpness. It is basically a very high quality whetstone. As such it is by no means easy to use, but there are lots of 'how to' videos out there, and with practice, the results are remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter stone","review":"If you're looking for the ultimate sharpening system, this isn't it. If you're looking for an inexpensive but serviceable water stone set to learn hand sharpening, then it doesn't get much better. The bang for your buck is hard to beat.1000/6000 is a good combination for knives that need a basic tune-up (I have used this to put a wicked edge on everything from a 2.5\\" Swiss army knife to my 8\\" Wusthof). The grit selection is a compromise when it comes to other tasks, though - 1000 is perhaps a little too fine (slow) for re-tipping or re-beveling, and 6000 is too rough to get a surgical sharp edge like you might need on a straight razor."},{"rating":"2","title":"sharpening stone","review":"This product performed as expected, great results. Will consider using this brand for similar use, am satisfied with this product.Great support from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good and great instructions","review":"It was effective and note that the stone will wear down as you grind on it, but it is normal and to keep adding water as you sharpen your blade on first the 1000 side and then finish off on the 6000 side. I noticed it helps to work on each side of the blade for over 5 minutes. Much cheaper than taking it done professional. A few practices make perfect! This is my first sharpening stone and I pretty happy with it. Ooh, it does make a skin crawling noise, to be expected, I had to put my iPod on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd time's a charm","review":"This is my first time using a waterstone, and it made my knives very sharp. It seems to be a quality product, and was easy enough for a beginner to use without wrecking my knife (or the waterstone) I had to order it twice from Amazon. Like other reviewers stated, my first one was broken on arrival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stone, but check carefully for damage.","review":"The stone itself seems to be of good quality. The only problem is that the factory packaging is not padded well, so mine had a corner crack through on the 6000 grit side. Unfortunately I had already started lapping it before I noticed (plus side, it flattens quickly). So if you get this, give it a good soak in water for 15 minutes to help find any damage. If when you place it in water you see air bubbles be sure to look carefully for any hairline cracks when the 15 minutes are up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the work","review":"The product works great... with wet surface creates that nice \\"schmeer\\" as supposed to be. I have still to hone in my technique but gave a very fine sharpening. It does it up the stone, but that's ok for my home use and 12 or so knifes. I like the whole \\"ritual\\" anyway. Only con, it should come with a base for that price point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but there is room for improvement.","review":"I thought this would simply be a nice book to have (and of course the cover looks cool). It's got almost every architectural term I can think of, but the page layout is a little cluttered if not cramped & the paper they used is a little odd for any book (heavy and rough).It would make an excellent gift for a perspective architecture student, but is really not necessary for professionals. Perhaps Burden could figure a way out to have the architectural dictionary work backwards (i.e. from the picture figure out what the term is)."},{"rating":"1","title":"After the Kiss","review":"I bought this book not on Amazon. I had to make myself finish the book, only cause I don't like to have books around I didn't finish. I had also hoped it would get better. The story just did not pull me in.the romance was ok, the story was just ok. I just don't know what it was about the book but I did not like it overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There is more to 19th Century Britain than the use of carriages and lack of electricity. The author tosses away cultural mores with nary a second thought, and that was ultimately too distracting for me. The writing strove to be profound and the effort put into it was noticeable throughout, where a well crafted novel simply flows. All this could have been forgiven had I found the protagonists more likeable, but to me, they were pathetically driven by their lust with nothing of substance in their characters to make them appealing figures. I couldn't see why they should be drawn to one another or us to them. It ultimately resulted in a lot of sex scenes that chronicled impressive gymnastics which this reader, at least, viewed with detachment. I reread the other reviews to see if I had misremembered them at the time that I ordered the book. Obviously, I saw things very differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Did I read the wrong book. Other reviewers called this book, Sensual, Erotic and a great love story. No No No - It was Boring I tell you. Mrs. Ranney what were you thinking. I could'nt wait for it to be over. The characters had no chemistry, no cute sparring back and forth no witty comebacks, no passion. The only scene they had was the ribbon scene, and that left me a little confused. In the books I read I like Passion, Good Sex but not always and above all a great love story. She just fell flat on all accounts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual, with the added bonus of a mystery","review":"This romance is a bit outside the common. It is set just after the Regency, but with the hero a most unusual war hero - a Code Master. There is a code to be broken in the story -- the code is the mystery of Margaret, a woman who is the puzzle wrapped in an engima. (A word of warning - the reader should not, as I did, waste time trying to break a code in the passages that begin each chapter - the code appears off stage, as it were.)The mystery is not in who the villain is, but what he did. If the incredibly sensual love scenes had not kept me reading, I would surely have kept turning the pages to discover what treason had been done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific book about volcanoes and people.","review":"This book is enjoyable to read: a great narrative that covers a wide range of topics about volcanoes: famous eruptions, effects on climate, how they provide resources, how they can adversely affect us, and more. The text has a lot of depth, but is cohesive and flows well. The diagrams are nicely done too. At the end of the book, the reader finds many helpful resources for volcano tourism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"A brilliant book for any volcanoholic. I am a geology student hoping to proceed to volcanology, and thoroughly enjoyed this book just for the sake of a good read on a great subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT PHONE","review":"MY WIFE AND I ARE BOTH DISABLED.

The reason for this purchase in general is because our apartment has wireless internet, so I wanted a cordless phone that does not interfere with it. After I have turned on the voice enhancement feature, my husband could not hear me while calling from his cell phone. I do not know the reason for that, but I turned it off. =)Besides that, i like the way it rings(couple of melodies to choose from, all are on the softer side so if someone calls at 6AM you wont jump up your bed) and the color!I dont know if I would suggest to buy it and claim its the best phone out there, but its aight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PRICE RIP-OFF","review":"Amazon is charging more than the regular $79.95 retail price charged by the manufacturer. You can buy it direct from Panasonic for $79.95. Shame on you Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't drive yourself mad.","review":"I got this book to find ways to support my body during chemotherapy. I came away feeling like I was going to die unless I ate blended salads and goat's milk every day and chased down a bunch a of random supplements. And I'm a very \\"natural food\\"-type of person who usually doesn't think much of going the extra mile to seek out complementary or alternative care. I'm not saying there aren't some good tips in the book, but it is really hard to weed through all the advice to find what you need. The author does quote many studies, but many of them only used animals as subjects, not people, so he's not always presenting conclusive evidence. The best thing you can do is rest, eat a well-balanced diet and find ways to support your spirit during this tough time. Stay away from anything that makes you feel fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is to extreme","review":"Some of the advice does make since. But, this book goes way over the top. You might as well live in a bubble and only eat kale and supplements. The main thing for cancer victims is to eat healthy and eat things in moderation. Kind of like you should anyway. Eat the good fats (omega 3), eat less sugar, eat more vegetables, and stay away from red meat. If that is what you got out of the book then great. But all the rambling of all the supplements is confusing, and not well organized. And maybe a recipe to give an example of proper nutrition would help."},{"rating":"1","title":"the guy is a quack","review":"Really??? People think that this guy helps tremendously with cancer? If that were true, then it would be all over the news and a HUGE deal. And, just FYI, it is not all over the news. Look at his credentials--nothing reputable.

It also discusses substances that cause or enhance the spread of cancer. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural Strategies for Cancer Patients","review":"Although I haven't read the entire book, I have found useful tips and strategies not only for cancer patients, but for the entire family. My main interest in this book was on foods that are nutritious and likely to improve health.

Even so, it has been a tremendous help to me in controlling my metastatic disease. It really gave me hope and a feeling of empowerment. It changed my life and very well may prove to have been a major turning point for the better in my health.I have a fairly good science background so this book was a piece of cake for me to comprehend. However, many folks might find a few of the medical words a bit technical. If so, just move on. The big words are not essential to understanding the important points.

I have heard of him in the club scene. The song that made me want to purchase this CD was tell me why. It is such a great song with great vocals. Traveling, together we will conquer, and alive are the best songs on the album. I am glad that I purchased this CD and plan on purchasing his future albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electronic Music doesn't get any better","review":"Every second of this album is carefully measured and scaled, it's a state of perfection in electronic music. Not much more to say, listen to this album and go to one of his gigs, you'll see what you've been missing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This album is the most disappointing CD I have ever gotten. PVD sets the drum machine to thump thump thump ... and doesn't touch it until it's time to shut it off. One song of this is monotonous, after 2 hours it's quite annoying. On top of that monotonous thump is a narrow stream of notes that in itself is well done but there is no composition."},{"rating":"2","title":"PVD is the master.","review":"Once again PVD takes you on a ride that you will never forget. With tracks like - Another Way, Avenue, Tell Me Why(The Riddle) Together We Will Conquer and We are Alive. This CD is filled with everything that we come to expect from PVD and more. If you like trance You'll love Out there and back."},{"rating":"1","title":"too commercialized???","review":"the first few songs on this album get it going but then it drops off dramatically. The songs seem too similar and don't flow like pauls previous albums.As a fan of PVD, this seems like he is going more commercial instead of sticking with the basics. I think that Vorsprung Dyk Technik is still his best album, too bad it is out of print, if it ever becomes available again, grab it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check His Earlier Works","review":"Here's a good album from Paul van Dyk, but I recommend his earlier albums such as 45 RPM and Seven Ways. If you're a fan of trance music, you owe it to yourself to give Paul van Dyk a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newcomer to Trance","review":"The very first song I heard from PVD was \\"For An Angel\\" in a cd compilation. I knew right there and then that he was one artist I'd be listening too. I bought that compilation and several of his cds. This one is one of the best. I especially love \\"Another Way\\". Just beautiful and dreamy but yet driving and melodious. I must say his music and mixing can inspire and uplift your inner self. Perfect to listen when you want to relax or workout or just get up and move. I have no regrets buying this cd. I've heard other trance artists but this one really does it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice CD overall","review":"I really enjoyed this CD. It has very good mixing. Out there and back is a VERY good song. I was somewhat disappointed with Avenue and Tell me why (The riddle). A good CD overall though. If you don't own it, you should consider getting this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Dykes me","review":"Good mix of Paul's classic style in which 2000 will be another great year for the \\"Best DJ in the world\\". Some faint hints of late masters can be heard in this album which should be a hit with clubbers who love to grind to classic beats. Again, just class brought to you by My Van Dyke, the man is back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme Perfection","review":"Paul Van Dyk's latest continues to lead this genre. As usual, his role in blending artist/producer into one is extraordinary. I have played this album over and over and seem to enjoy the sweet melodies and intoxicating grooves that Paul Van Dyk creates more and more. Extreme melodies in the song \\"Another Way\\" remind me of my longtime favorite \\"Voyage\\" by Trance Central. Both songs are the pinnacle of trance/club music excellence. Paul Van Dyk has shown yet again that he is the master of trance music."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the hell....","review":"I just bought this CD today, and listened to it on a LONG car ride. The ride was never so enjoyable. I kept rewinding and saying to myself \\"Now how the hell did he do that??\\" I mean it when I say that if you listen to Trance a decent amount, this will be up there on your favorite list. I purchased it because I had read an interview with PVD in the Sept.00 issue of DJ Times and he semmed like he only let the best go into his work. This guy knows his stuff. I love spinning his remixes, but when he produces his own work it is something different. It has the classic PVD sound and beats so many DJ's have come to know and love to mix. Soon to be a must to every collection.

One of the reasons that I picked this double cd up is, because of Avenue, which, I have from the PSX game cd Wipeout 3. It is a great song and I knew if the others were as good as this one it would be awesome. Well I wasn't disappointed. Most of the songs are excellent, especially Another Way, both versions. As a bonus on disc 2 there are 2 PvD videos, Tell Me Why and Another Way, which, I thought was a great bonus.

Out There and Back is solid from beginning to end without a boring track. Highlights include previously released singles Another Way and Avenue, as well as Tell me Why (the Riddle), Out There and Back, Alive, and Together We Will Conquer, with vocals for this song written and sung by his wife. Actually every song was a highlight for me. There's still no better way to experience PVD than to catch one of his 6+ hour sets during his bi-monthly trips to New York's Twilo, but this album comes as close to replicating his current sound as anything I've heard.If you like trance, if you like PVD, if you like music, you must buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"its good","review":"When I listened to this cd for the first time, I loved it. It's great trance thats fun to listen to, but it has some problems.Its very repetitive, even for electronic music.
