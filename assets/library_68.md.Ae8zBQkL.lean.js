Some of them were never recorded commercially, so having them captured live is a treat. Shaw, as usual in his aircheck performances sounds much loose and more spontaneous. It was a real treat to hear Frenesi with different solos from the band. The studio recording is so legendary that it was certainly exciting to hear the same arrangement played with the smaller scaled band with different solos. Also nice is the extended tunes that are here. Often, they would have to trim the arrangement to fit on the 78 record, so the live performances are sometimes longer allowing for more solos from the band member, so that too is a welcome treat. The sound quality is good, not great and is of variable quality, on the whole it's definitely very listenable. If you love Artie and collect his work, this is self recommending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"OK, I'm down with funk, and I've been down with the resergence in fusion/bugaloo/funk/jazz like MMW, Greyboy, Galactic.

But did they have to throw the turks into every jam? The mix was just too caustic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I bought \\"Cool and Steady and Easy\\" (BFE's previous album) and loved it; that album showed that BFE could work in lots of different genres with skill and a lot of wit. So, I was excited when this album first came out.I shouldn't have been. The collaboration with the Turks is interesting at first, but gets old very quickly. The songs all sound alike, and don't have the hooks and twists that \\"Cool and Steady and Easy\\" had. The rhythm is particularly bad--same drum segments, over and over, not even the slightest variation. I would say a definite 180 degrees from \\"Cool..\\", where jazzy horn solos were followed by a hilarious reggae exposition on a social revolution delayed by, well, just being tired.So, if you're looking for a first album to buy from BFE, pick up \\"Cool...\\"--that one's a winner.

It's basically how to use conventional methods on smaller farms. Whenever he mentions organic farming he talks about how HARD it is and how there are so many PROBLEMS. He's a big complainer. The reason he sees it as hard is because he's talking about replacing conventional inputs (for example chemical fertilizers) with \\"organic\\" inputs, as if that's all there is to it. The problem is that his *thinking* is not sustainable at all, so of course his approaches are going to be trying to muscle things into working in a system where they just don't fit.

I would be what most would consider a \\"city farmer\\" but I learned more going into a tractor implements store and a feed store and asking a few questions than I did with this book. The last 4th of this book does have excellent charts for weight comparisons and measurement conversions (ie. Windmill capacities charts, woodlot tables, densities of grain, etc.) but as far as useful farming, no. The examples do not really show modern farming equipment. The gates and things reminded me of something from the 50's with wood slide locks for gates, etc. I know some farms and farmers still utilize things like this but the modern farm tends to utilize pipe gates with chains, etc. This book is good for very basic, basic farming concepts like what a pre-teen learning about the farm would need. Not for the serious farmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This joystick loses calibration all the time","review":"I used to have a Saitek USB Gold, which is non-force feedback, and I was quite happy with it. Then I decided to get a force-feedback stick, and that was a mistake in itself, because these things don't really work very naturally in flight sims. That could be a matter of taste, of course, but what is not a matter of taste is that this joystick has some sort of auto-calibration, and that thing just doesn't work well. I fly for a couple of minutes, and then start noticing that it becomes difficult to bank to the left, and too easy to bank right. If I go to joystick properties, I see that the calibration is lost. Fix it, but after a few minutes the same happens. That renders the device pretty useless. I bought it in a far corner of the world, where warranty concept doesn't work like you would expect, so that was some money thrown out the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"no support","review":"i could not get the joystick to work, i called saitek tech support several times and recieved no help at all. when i did get to talk to someone they said that they would get back to me but never did. how does a company like that stay in business?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice joystick for the price","review":"Very nice joystick works in XP and Vista.The only sugestion I have, I would like it better if the throttle controlwere placed on either side of the joystick instead of directly to the rear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have never received the product","review":"I ordered this device.

By now it's too late.........I've tackled Saitek at length about this issue, but they insist that it's normal. There are other issues like the wandering rudder, which can be cured in the short-term by editing the registry, but this excessive deadband has no fix.If you fly flight/combat simulators I suggest you avoid this stick at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but close","review":"Force feedback could have been a little stronger...I also noticed that even though it's supposed to be self calibrating it tends to ride very slightly up and to the left when centered...I compensated for this by increasing my null zones in my flight sims...very good product overall though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent FFB joystick for the price","review":"The Saitek EVO Force looks a bit too sci-fi if you are like me and enjoy flying vintage aircraft, but one thing I have found from Saitek in general that their products are a good value for the money.I wanted more immersion from the IL-2 WWII combat flight simulator that I have been enjoying for the last few years, and this joystick delivers the performance I was after. Most importantly, as what ever aircraft I am flying approaches stall speed, the stick shudder tells me that I need to push the throttle to maintain attitude (and altitude).One thing (besides high tech looks) that I'd say is a shortcoming, is the spring tension is a bit weak. I wouldn't want to be fighting the full G-forces of pulling out of a dive, but perhaps adjustable force may be a feature that would make this type of product better.That being said, I am pretty happy with this product over all for its reliability and value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Responsive?","review":"I'm really surprised at the high ratings this joystick has received. I had high expectations after reading all of it and went out to get one.Out of the box it looked great; Loads of buttons and even a little blue LED... if that sort of thing turns you on.Then I calibrated it and tried all its buttons. It had several forcefeedback simulations - a helicopter, machine-gun, even what seems to be a toilet flushing. Still great.Then I installed a couple of flight simulations games and was totally dismayed at it's response, or lack of. It works great it you intend to sweep left and right accross the screen, but if you need accuracy, pinpoint targetting... forget it.

However, it needs the simple addition of a way to lock the pivot, so the legs don't move when you shift the book. Also the base is not wide enough, so if you are just starting or finishing a book and the bulk of the pages are on one side, the stand is wobbly.

From a musical perspective, the songs are all similar, cookie-cutter \\"Planet Rock\\" knockoffs with trite lovey-dovey vocals set in minor with similar, very simple chord progressions. \\"Cheap Thrills\\" and \\"From Here To Eternity\\" are perfect examples of producer Adam Marano's attempted compensation for creativity with weirdness.

Without spoiling the surprise amd wonder for those of you who have not yet experienced the magic, I can only promise that the 'Moonlight', the 'Appassionata' and the 'Waldstein' each hold delicious, hidden secrets as interpreted by the performer, and whisk you away into the mind of their composer each time you listen. A Great Escape, indeed! Give your ears a treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I use it with the Ground Control Pro, and it works perfect. The buffered input of the guitar is a plus, and the power through midi for the ground control. I am only running 2 cables (midi and my guitar cable) from the front to the back of the stage, so this simplifies things a lot, and no loss of sound quality. Definitely one of the best purchases i made, simplified my setup a lot and with the ground control controlling even my vocal processor, I finally feel i can focus more on enjoying myself on stage and not stressing out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Score!","review":"This is a great score from composer Harry Manfredini. Some suprising tonal cues. The music featured here sounded alot like Friday 5 with the tranposing french horns and bass trombone, only in its full synthetic glory. The music on the cd has much more of a \\"kick\\" in it than when I saw it in the theater. You only hear ki ki ki ma ma ma a FEW times on this cd, which I thought was a little dissapointing for my taste. \\"Virtual Crystal Lake\\" was a neat track in which you hear a cue from the very first Friday the 13th film. A lengthy score and while the movie might not have been that faithful to the old school Fridays, you can't say that about the score."},{"rating":"1","title":"craps","review":"On every computer I install this game on, the game freezes after I place a bet on the craps table and the dice are rolled.

Jupiter, Mercury, and Mars are my personal favorites, and the CSO renders vivid portraits of those works.A comment on the Penguin Music Classics series: I own ten PMC CDs, and I think that they have largely made excellent choices as to the recordings selected for packaging in this series. I particularly like the Schubert Symphonies 5 & 9 (Vienna/Kertesz) and the Rachmaninov Piano Concerti 3 & 4 (Ashkenazy/London/Previn)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs To Be An SACD, Too.","review":"If this isn't the finest version of Holst's best known creation, then I don't know what is!

The Belkin adapter was cheaper so I bought it instead - BIG MISTAKE !! I think the first indication as to how bad this product really was happened when my car cassette player literally spit it out and shot it across the passenger cabin in my car. Was my cassette player trying to tell me something ? I think so ! The adapter was reinsterted into the cassette player multiple times before it finally found the exact perfect fit to produce quality sound. I eventually purchased a Phillips cassette adapter for my iPod mini, and it works as intended. Shame on you Belkin for making and selling such a poor piece of equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belkin Doesn't Know iPod","review":"After shelling out $40 for a TuneCast that was very good at consistently delivering quality static through my car stereo, I thought there was no way anyone could muck up a cassette adaptor.

I drive a 2003 Toyota Prius, with the factory tape deck. I spent twenty minutes or so doing various (essentially voodoo) techniques to get my tape-deck to recognize the cassette adapter. No luck. It was, however, very simple to return. I am relatively tech savy, and have used several cassette adapters before, so the problem is one of compatibility rather than user error (the device is nothing if not straight-forward). I might note that my brother uses the same cassette adapter in the factory tape-deck of his '96 Land Rover Discovery and it works just fine. So perhaps only Toyota drivers need be cautious. Whatever the case, good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deplorable","review":"Absolutely 100% awful. Do NOT waste your money. This is the second Belkin product that I have regretted buying. Finally, yesterday, I threw it directly in the trash.

I bought a sony tape adapter [...] works perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tape Adapter is Trash","review":"I bought the Belkin because it is the \\"standard\\" brand for Ipod accessories. I should of read the reviews... doesn't work with Bose factory sound in my 2003 Maxima. Insert adapter and it switches from side 1 to side 2 and then ejects. I tried an XM radio tape adapter, and a Sony tape adapter and both worked. So it isn't the factory sound, it's the Belkin cassette adapter.

Whoever put it in the box to ship it must have not been looking, it was obvious the white powdery corrosive stuff was everywhere but at least not on the unit itself. When I purchased it the site said only 1 in stock. Mine must have been there a while. Again I had to provide batteries where they were supposed to be part of the purchasing price, oh well. Neat bright light. A bit bulkier than I thought it would be but still fits in the hand well.

I didn't think anything could top Raphael's performances on Instant Vintage until I saw him perform them live! He is truly a genius...a master.

Saadiq has taken others to another land and has formulated his own genre- Gospel Delic. This CD captivated the S.uga H.oney I.ce T.ea outta my ears. This has got to be a Grammy Award Winning album (in my opinion). Saadiq...Saadiq! Saadiq! Damn brotha, could you be any funky?!

This is a great debut; although it will not get much attention being that the music industry no longer cares for music. Here is a great collection of songs. nothing like tony,toni,tone or like lucy pearl.

Raphael is force to contend with!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness!","review":"I just dusted this one off and remembered that I had not written a review for it but I couped the week it dropped. Saadiq himself is Instant Vintage. Since Toni, Tony, Tone he has matured while still maintaining his musical genius and classy style. This whole project is so eclectic, R & B, and HipHop all in one breath that you can't go wrong. Lyrics that make you think, react, feel. Every track is one that I can appreciate.

I even loved his song \\"Ask of You\\" that he did for a movie soundtrack. I had extremely high expectations for this CD when it came out and was surprised that the radio stations weren't playing singles from the album. I picked up the CD based on his excellent work in the past anyway. Man, was I disappointed. I played it twice just to make sure I wasn't hearing things! This is probably his worst work ever! Not one track was memorable on the whole album. I am happy the other folks gave him 4 and 5 stars though, because I know this is not indicative of his great talent and I wish him to keep making CDs and not stop because of one lackluster production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instant Disappointment","review":"I found this album profoundly disappointing. After hearing Saadiq's contributions to many other artists (e.g., D'angelo's Voodoo album), not to mention his work with Tony Toni Tone, I was really looking forward to a soulful, melodic, slightly funky album. Instead I found a watered-down, overproduced piece of sugary fluff. No soul, and definitely no groove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not trippin'","review":"Frankly, one the most anticipated and most disappointing albums of 2002.

I rarely listen to this album and do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a solid start for solo greatness","review":"this cd, i love it. Yes, it is a little long but it's very uplifting and fufilling. he touches a lot of topics and has a lot of different sounds or modes which makes this cd so unique, even though the tracks on this album aren't as memorable as some of the t3's cuts it's still all in all asolid albumcaable of being played over and over again in your house, car and everywhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"Raphael Saadiq is a great Bay Area soul artist and this old-school style CD is a must-have for fans and soul lovers alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried...","review":"Based on the reviews, radio plays of other RS songs I decided to take Instant Vintage for a spin.I'm really disappointed.The orchestration is good, the beginning track shows that...but after that the lyrics fall flat.

This is the simplest solution since the sessions only last for ms. It has a good hands on approach to router configuration and network design but lacks hardcore application design that this topic deserves.There is no discussion on complex systems which require sessions to last for days and how to distribute state between multiple servers. There is also no discussion on locking mechanisms, determining load, primary/backup determination, latency across WANs, distributed objects, DB failover, server synchronization, heartbeat implementations, shifting load for scheduled down time, or dynamic router configuration or alternative scheduling mechanism apart from round robin.I think the title \\"Web Server Load Balancing\\" would be a more appropriate title and if that is what your goal is then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"I expected a lot more from this book that while admittedly was the first that covered the topic, but did not really explain things in detail. Half of the book is on configurations that you can download from vendor web sites and the real design issues are never really addressed.

What I found was far too much information that was simply digested and reformatted from vendor and free areas.I look to an expert on a topic to give new insight and twists to anything they write. The lack of any personal commitment or recommendation was surprising. Which made the book more into a mid-level technical guide with no path or strategy summary as I would expect.

The automatic switch however craps out in a really short time. This to me negates everything else. Three of them where the auto switch has died on all three. This is ridiculous. I don't shred much at all, maybe 10 sheets a day. Handles CDs well. But the near worthless auto switch overrules the positive factors. If I wanted a shredder without an auto mode I would buy one.

The first one failed after a few months, but I thought it was my fault because I used it a lot and when it failed I thought maybe I had overused it. I ordered another one because I would have two containers and I thought it would be better for changing out the basket when I was too busy to empty it. I liked the way the cutters looked - nice and solid. After a couple of months of average use (I tried to be more careful with the second shredder) it began to make a weird noise - like the cutters were binding. Yesterday I tried shredding 1 CD and it only made it about way through the CD before locking up. I removed it cleaned out everything from the cutter and now all it does is make noise. It won't shred anything . I just don't think this shredder is worth the money. I really need a shredder and now I have to find another one. I wouldn't recommend this shredder to anyone.

Both have done excellent in terms of their shredding power and low instance of jams or binding up, however they have both displayed an issue which causes me great concern; they will suddenly without reason begin running and will not shut off. Both have now done this on several occasions, and without any possible reason I can find, i.e. my Aurora AS1018CD was emptied and even blown clean with compressed air about 3 weeks ago and not used since- and the other morning I woke to find it running non-stop, and getting very warm. This has led me to not only turn both completely off, but unplug both from now on just to be on the safe side until I can have them replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickly Broke","review":"This product broke after a couple months.

It should be able to do moderate amount of shredding. Well after a few pages, an awful smell came out of the machine like rubber burning.

End of shredder. Buying a micro cutter one with only good reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"An almost great shredder","review":"I purchased this shredder to replace a dying strip-cut shredder. After reading multiple reviews, I settled on this one on the basis of cost, strip size, and capacity. Overall, the shredder has proven quite reliable and reasonably quiet. I have not stress tested it with 10 sheets of paper, but it does fine with 5. What keeps me giving this a 5 star rating is two minor things. First, the feed sensor is only in the middle of the feed slot. If you put in something narrow, like an envelope, you have to pretty much center it to get it to feed. Otherwise, it will stop and there is no manual feed button to force it through. Second, the strips are just a bit wider than I would like. It would be better if they were 25% narrower. Still, it's a decent product for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for","review":"It grinds up paper without a problem, many sheet at a time. I used it a lot for cards and CD's. It works great, but does heat up after a while. It's protection feature makes it stop if it gets too hot.

No problems, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"craptastic","review":"I specifically picked out this shredder because it was suppose to shred CD/DVD and it gets jammed every single time you put a CD in.

It is very powerful and cuts up the paper into nice small pieces. I really like that I can stick whole pieces of mail into it, like those annoying envelopes you get from credit card companies wanting you to apply for one of their cards.The only down side I found with this shredder is the waste basket. It's kind of small, and it has a safety device that won't let it shred unless it's on the basket it came with.

After only 4 basketfulls over a few days with many long breaks it began to smell plasticky even using 2-3 pages at a time. It never could approach 10 and try a CD, the noise it makes made me run for the fire extinguisher. All of a sudden it won't shred anything even a tissue without choking. Ive checked in the mechanism but nothing is fouling it that can be seen and its pretty open to see.Maybe I got a lemon but you could too.

We shred on average about 15 to 20 pages a day. So far so good!It has the feel of a very heavy duty machine, as it seems that no matter what you throw at it it does not sound as if it is struggling. Although it is rated for more, we limit ourselves to 6 pages max. It is also easy to empty, and does not take up much space.This machine replaced an inexpensive Staples shredder we bought on sale that lasted only 3 weeks.I'd recommend this unit to anyone with a planned use load like ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotta be a better choice","review":"Screws around gear cage had no lockwashers or thread locking compound, and vibrated loose.

To empty it, you have to take the entire top - shredder and all - off of the basket bottom, find a place to put the top while it's raining minute slivers of paper all over everything, and then go empty the ridiculously small basket.

January 2010 - March 2012). After opening the machine and poking around for a few minutes, I've determined the cause of death to be a burnt-out LED bulb, which acts as the sensor that starts the shredder when paper is inserted in the slot. Kind of disappointing that this little part is the Achilles' heel of the machine, but that's the way it goes.This shredder worked well while it was alive. I work in the video field, so I needed a shredder that could destroy DVDs of old projects. This one did the job, and of course shredded regular paper, business cards and credit cards, as well.

I've been trying to take care of mine and it is still running alright after 3 years. It has shredded scores of documents, several CDs, several expired credit cards and still pulverizes everything when I ask it too. It's a cross cut shredder so much of what you get out the bottom is confetti. Harder to get into a trash bag, but less likely of someone with tape putting humpty dumpty back together again.I would recommend the shredder but I'm sure it depends on your workload, what and how much you are going to shred.

I guess I got one of the units that quality assurance missed.I shredded one full basket without problems. I was impressed with the speed of the unit and pleased that while the basket is relatively small, the cross shredding process allows denser packing of paper than the older unit I was replacing. I was careful not to exceed the 10 sheet limit, I did not try to shred any credit cards or CD's, and I removed all staples before shredding.As the red light lit, indicating the second basket was full, I heard a loud noise followed by a high-pitched whine. A call to tech support verified that the drive gears has stripped. I was advised to return the unit to Amazon to avoid a shipping charge to the factory in California. I got through to tech support with no wait and the person I talked to was knowledgeable and spoke colloquial english. I mailed the unit back today."},{"rating":"1","title":"AURORA AS1018CD","review":"After about a year the shredder stopped working; the motor ran but the cutters stopped turning.

They have car trouble and out of nowehre, a mechanic appears and tows them to his place. Then some pyscho kills off the couple and credits roll. I will say the ladies death is probably the greatest straight to dvd horror kill of all time, i've never seen any better.The basic plot is a girl wants to get married but her family wont let her because she is suppose to marry her cousin. They kill off memebers of the wedding and I must say most the kills do look good. The last half hour was turned into one big comedy but it was funny and I did laugh. The killers are the worst since the horror remake of Prom Night. It's probably the only thing that brings down the movie. However, for three bucks it's a great buy and a great addition to any horror collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wedding Slashers does not cut the cake..or your fear","review":"Neither Mary nor her little lamb could save this movie, nor would they want to see it. The actors and actress' are uninspired, armature, and emotionless. The plot is horrible and the direction is the equivalent of a home movie. Do not rent this film unless you're looking for a chuckle at some extremely and overdramatic gore.However, the films first couple of minutes follow the lives of a couple just married. The acting and plot in this portion of the film is tolerable and even a bit entertaining. The problem with this is, its basically just a scary opener rather than an opener to the plotline itself. Beyond these first three minutes of film, \\"Wedding Slashers\\" is a piece of rotten cake.Note: I never rate anything one or two stars. Everything has its faults, but this is beyond bearable. A usually easy pleaser has been dissatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Shaun of the Dead' meets 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'","review":"Wedding Slashers does a great job of satisfying the ever-hungry Horror Crowd's appetite. If you are looking for insatiable gore and evil blood thirsty villians with names like \\"Sock Monkey\\" and \\"The Executioner,\\" then you're in luck. Wedding Slashers promises to shock and startle you from beginning to end - and pulling a page from 'Shaun of the Dead' - there are just as many scares as there are laughable one-liners.Word of advise - not for those who are weak in the stomach.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLOOD GORE AND IN-BREEDING TRASH","review":"I have a pretty flexible attitude when it comes to gore and/or sexual aberrations, but WEDDING SLASHERS pushes the limit. The tale of a young woman whose boyfriends end up dying horrible deaths at the hands of her multiply inbred family is ridiculously scripted and the acting is non-existent. The only \\"name\\" actor in the cast is Richard Lynch, who doesn't come in until close to the end as the potential bride's father. The movie treats its killings sadistically and there are characters in the movie who we never know who they are. A really bad and not one of those cheesy bad movies. Don't get engaged in this one folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cry at every wedding...","review":"and the fact that I wasted my time watching this awful excuse for a movie.

When I was in high school in the late 70's, this concert was shown on Night Flight or Midnight Special (can't remember which). Being a Rod Stewart fan, I recorded it on tape (Beta, VHS...don't recall). I watched it over and over. Yes, the quality of this DVD is poor. It's grainy and the video skips (not the DVD itself, but the video it came from). But for me, it was worth the $12 if only for the nostalgia. Rod and Ronnie are one of the great pairs of rock performers, up there with Page and Plant, Brian and Freddie, Keith and Mick. You will be disappointed if you expect a high quality video and a lot of Faces songs. But if you like Rod and Ronnie, and can get past the poor quality, this is pretty entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been one of the coolest but...","review":"I had already seen bootleg(black market?) stuff of this video before I bought this official one.

I have always liked early Rod Stewart recordings, but apparently that was because I had never seen him perform before. Rod is much more concerned with primping his hair, and shaking his butt than singing. The only redeeming value to this DVD is Ron Wood's guitar playing. Rod's stage antics, however, ruin even this for me. The best part of the show is when Rod leaves the stage during one of Ronnie's leads. Unfortunately, he comes back."},{"rating":"1","title":"46 year old rocker!","review":"Well, out of all my rock DVD's, this one takes the cake. I give the sound a 2 out of 10, Picture a 4.

The transfer is from a terrible 16mm film with breaks and scratches everywhere. And forget the sound... I bought it mainly to watch one of the great Hammond players, Ian McLagan...

I rarely break out but I do struggle with dry skin that lacks radiance. I decided to try this scrub because I love Burt's Bees products and I figured a scrub would liven up my skin. The first three days or so, I liked it. It's fun to use and smells nice. But after a while, I noticed that I had a lot of dirt embedded in my pores. My pores are normally very tiny and I don't get blackheads. However, I began sprouting dark spots all over my face, especially near my nose. Once I quit using this, my skin cleared up again. Maybe it's not meant for dry skin. If you do use this, I'd only scrub with it a few times a week and make sure you use another cleanser that has serious deep-cleaning properties, because this citrus scrub doesn't deep clean. I found a better scrub with that St. Ives stuff, but I guess this is worth a try. Just don't expect it to deep clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good for me","review":"well it smells so nice and it feels so nice and soft and well i honestly thought this worked for me but after like 10 days my face started to get black heads on my forhead and ckeeks so i stopped using its just breaking me out!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"This product smells great and leaves your skin soft and glowing.

Ive seen everything, mind you, from the 1963-1989 run (and I mean everything), and this is the stupidest and cheesiest one of them all. Having the Doctor battle bounty hunters and aliens at a rock and roll, 50s style holiday is as bad as it sounds. Terrible writing, bad music, silly makeup, etc., make this the worst Doctor Who adventure ever. It's worst than Hartnell's The Gunfighters (which was considered the worst in Doctor Who history until this one), and it's worse than the American TV movie of the Doctor.McCoy and the cast try their best, but they can't overcome the thinness and triteness of the writing. McCoy was a good Doctor (none of the actors who have played the Doctor are awful, in fact, they're all very good), but he couldn't save the show by this time. The show was going down fast near the end of the 80's, and it was cancelled outright in 1989. Episodes like this hastened its downfall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr who different style","review":"I'm one of those people who love Delta and the Bannerman.

Everything at the summer camp, Mel, Delta, Ray, Billie & the Bee-Keeper are all good. The actual Bannermen are horrible. The investigators, the navarino's and the background music is what gives this episode a bad name. So if you want to see an episode where the doctor dances to 50's music and rides a motorcycle, Mel is tolerable, and the doctor plays eccentric with a real eccentric, please join in. It has a different flavor than any other 7th doctor episode. If you are looking for a tight, action_packed story you probably need to move along.

But, Delta and the Bannermen is joyless pap. There is nothing redeeming about it. The acting is bad, the story doesn't work, the premise is ridiculous, Mel is at her worst, the bad guys make no sense, the supporting cast are totally shallow and make bizarre decisions, and worst of all it revolves around the 80s obsession with the 50s.I'd rather watch a marathon of Time-Flight, Fear Her, Two Doctors, Timelash, and Twin Dilemma over watching this again.

In one instance, getting the contents out required slicing open the carton. Once the contents had been put into a blender, the shakes were satisfactory --- creamy. delicious and filling. But not RTD.

Apparently the idea is to take the worst trash and promote it as the greatest and most valuable \\"art\\" as some kind of sick joke on society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful if you are not a devout Christian","review":"The author seems to imply way too often in the book that God is the answer to all.

Sulley is the top Scarer at the Scare Factor in the monster world. However, he finds his job in jeopardy when he finds a little human girl, Boo on the Scare Floor. Sulley doesn't know what to do and hurries home to consult his good friend Mike. Mike comes up with a plan to get rid of the girl and what follows is lots of laughter and chaos.Many children are familiar with the movie and if they are they will enjoy reading this book. However, even if they are not, the book is a self-contained unit and with characters like Sulley, Mike, and Boo, they will probably enjoy reading it anyway. Since the story contains monsters, it's a nice tale to read at Halloween."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet watch","review":"I bought this watch for my 13 year old daughter who is very petite.

This one did not deliver on what I enjoy reading in a romance novel. The heroine was childish and spoiled. Her aunt was too much of a nag. Although the hero was interesting, I didn't feel overwhelmed by him like I have with other Native American heroes. Plus, where was the sex??!! Most connoisseurs of romance novels do not necessarily like to read material that is \\"pornographic,\\" but SOME sex is expected. If you blink, you'll miss it in this one!! I felt like the author rushed to get her manuscript in and abruptly ended the last scene. It was so anti-climactic. If you like Native American romances, stick with authors who have the experience in writing them like J. Lindsey's \\"Savage Thunder,\\" K. Drymon's \\"Gentle Savage,\\" J. Redd's \\"Steal the Flame,\\" anything by Karen Kay, B. Joyce's \\"Darkest Heart,\\" or anything by Colleen Faulkner.

I never cease to be astounded by the degree of misdirection used by Creationists to justify Creationism. Creationists and creation \\"scientists\\" provide their (largely) scientifically-illiterate audience of believers with false arguments that are based on poor science, or no science at all. This book is no exception. Every single point in the book is easily refuted by anyone having any familiarity with the concept of evolution. By the way, the existance of evolution is a FACT, just as the existance of gravity is a fact. The THEORY of evolution is HOW evolution happened (natural selection, punctuated equilibrium, etc.), justa as the theory of gravity (general relativity) tell how gravity happened.

It works exactly the way I needed it to. It is easy to zero and easy to read. The only compliant that I have is that mine was a bit rough when I got it. It had various scratches and dings in it, and some of the screws looked like they had been replaced with non-matching screws. For instance the stop was held on by one phillips and one flathead. Kinda makes me wonder if I got one that had been returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just junk.","review":"Unfortunately this caliper is just junk. There are a number of rough edges and burrs remaining on the \\"machining\\" (I think its stamping). The slide feel is very rough and seems innacurate. The Starrett caliper, which this imitates, is precisely machined, silky smooth and always comes back to zero when the caliper is closed. Of course it costs $80.82 from Amazon and this one costs only $30.98 ($23.99 plus $6.99 shipping). But for the extra 50 bucks you get a caliper that you can use and even enjoy!!I don't know about the other similar brands: Quint, I-gaging, General, and Oshlun.

Dock Boggs obviously knew a good song when he heard one. This two disc set of his folkway sessions 1963-1968 is packed with fifty songs from the always reliable Smithsonian Folkways,enclosed is a thick booklet.

On that first record, she balanced bohemianism and single motherhood with humor and passion. This time out, it comes across as whining. Hey, Amy, we're all getting older, and guess what? It's not so bad. Get over it! Even more disturbing, the stylistic wandering of the music suggests that she doesn't have the confidence in the songs to put them across without some production crutch.

But with this movie, my desire for closure was outweighed a lack of chemistry between a bunch of flat characters. I tried to talk myself into finishing it, but I couldn't make it.I think there was potential with the idea but it was horribly executed.On top of a slow moving plot with poorly developed characters, quite a bit of it is disrespectful to God in a way that many people (myself included) will find offensive. One part in particular was even blasphemous, and while those particular characters were not shown in a positive light, the song \\"What a friend we have in Arlen. All our sins and griefs to bear.\\" was too much for me.All I can say is that I'm glad it was free through Amazon prime so I didn't waste my money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This romantic comedy was low on both romance and comedy.

The message was a good one: so many of us are searching for answers to life's big questions, like the writer in the story, but we already have many of the answers when we're pressed to give them to others. Both Lauren Graham and Jeff Bridges are charming in their roles, the disfunctional tendencies of their characters make you laugh and at the same time you feel empathetic.This movie is not a bad way to spend an evening at all, and in fact I plan to watch it again with my husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Obvious","review":"The premise is good, but it is just not for me.

The chemistry between the actors is flawless, without exception. The ending is satisfying in that it doesn't feel the need to tie up all the loose ends and it leaves you wanting more. I have heard it compared to As Good as it Gets, but I prefer this version. While it lacks the glossy main stream production qualities of AGAIG, it makes up for it in its every day heroes that are much more relatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Dumb","review":"These are two actors I love, but the script was just sucky.

If you want to see a romantic comedy,Answer Manworks well. It has some funny scenes (including Jeff Daniels' monster collection) and the usual awkward romance. However, if you also like pondering the BIG questions,Answer Manprovides some interesting food for thought. It doesn't so much provide any meaningful answers as to suggest where to look for questions. Perhaps most important question is whether our lives are shaped by our choices or events that happen to us - or both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it was free","review":"I found this movie to be hard to engage with, the characters thin, the plot see-through.

The script was well written, characters pretty well developed, the actors did an amazing job and flowed well together. However, I just feel that the ending left something to be desired. I feel that not all of the loose ends were tied up and that the story itself could have delved deeper into something bigger. Overall it was a good movie to watch and I recommend it to anyone, but I just wish there was a little more.

We rented the movie and watched it last night. I loved the movie, can't wait to see it again and have already recommended it to several friends. Jeff Daniels is hilarious! The script is funny and thought-provoking at the same time. The scene with the elementary school teacher made me laugh so hard I cried. (Of course, if you are too young to have ever been in a parent teacher conference, then your reaction may be different from mine.) And I loved the questions. Yes, the social themes are serious but they are handled in the kind of way that most people live life -- moving forward with some intense moments, occasional pondering, and a sense of humor.Some people have compared this movie with \\"As Good As It Gets.\\" Personally, I liked \\"Answer Man\\" much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remake of \\"About A Boy\\" without the funny","review":"The trailer of this movie over sells it. Basically a famous reclusive, living off the profits of his one good book, finds solace in a single parent who is struggling to start her business and juggle her 10yr son. Cue side splitting cross-class antics.Well, if you recall the Hugh Grant movie, About a Boy, then you have the rough guide to this movie. Except this movie, Jeff Daniels is no Hugh Grant and the script lets him down big time. Even the R rating couldn't lift this movie, with expletives all over the place, good comedy is funny without resorting to cheap gags.Fortunately this movie was free on Amazon Prime, otherwise one would have not given it a second look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This is beautiful garment.

He turned old traditional negro themes into a wonderful energetic symphony. Here you can see his true talents as an composer. In the first movement of the piece starts off with an slow adaigio that suddenly goes into a fast allegro. The second movement is the slow and beutiful largo. The third movement is the vivacious scherzo. This fast movement is only the prelude of what is to come in the fourth movement. The fourth movement is the most exciting movement of all. It shows the nervous energy which typical of the composer. This piece has to be, in my opinion, Dovoraks greatest piece he's ever written"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Symphony is one of the best around today!","review":"This Syphony is the best work that Devorak has every done.

Once I collected the bulk of the works from my favorite composers, I started to randomly buy CDs of different composers.

This is simply my favorite piece of classical music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Cute but no white noise sound!","review":"The stuffed animal is super cute but it's not as practical as I had hoped.

From the first day we used it, my 6 month old baby loved it. He falls asleep almost instantly when we turn it on. It is soft enough for him to cuddle with it too. Definitely a life saver.I like the idea that it has 4 different sounds and that it has a timer. I TOTALLY recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I was given this at my baby shower in 2010. The sound machine never actually fit in the hole in the Sheep's back. Ever. The opening is too small. Despite this, we did use each of the two pieces individually. As a stuffed animal and a noise machine. My son is not particularly fond of stuffed animals but it does consistently sit in his crib. The noise machine is small and portable which is nice. But when my son was 6 months and we transitioned him to his crib in his room (as opposed to our bedroom) - we found an alarm clock with a soother mode far more useful as it never shuts off and he seemed to prefer that consistent background noise.I found it to be a total waste of money. The only reason I kept it and tried to make it work was because my grandmother gave it to me. Otherwise it would've promptly been sent back from whence it came."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be a great comfort for my grandbaby","review":"I wanted to get a white noise machine for my daughter's baby (due in a couple of months) because I know how effective it can be for getting a baby to nap. She has a friend who has been a nanny and \\"Sheepy\\" was the recommended choice.It has four sounds. One is a heartbeat, another is whale songs.I was concerned that a soft item would not be appropriate for a crib or cradle, but there is a velco strap that allows you to secure it to the OUTSIDE of the crib.The sheep itself is very soft and cuddly.It was reasonably priced, compared to the other noise machine I am familiar with.I am very happy with Sheepy."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful invention","review":"we use this every day! my daughter is about to be 2 and it puts her to sleep every night. well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough","review":"The sleep sheep is soft and adorable, as well as easy to attach to the crib or pack n play. But it simply isn't loud enough. Newborns don't have very good hearing and my daughter doesn't even notice when we turn this on. With our first daughter, we had a regular sound machine and she would calm down as soon as we turned the volume up really high. The sleep sheep just isn't loud enough to make a difference to our little one when she is really fussy. My suggestion is to just go with a traditional sound machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it but hate it","review":"I love how it soothes my baby girl but the minute it shuts off, she's up crying. 45 minutes is not enough time to allow for a baby to get into a deep enough sleep.

I don't care how many times I have to change the batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sound after 1.5 weeks","review":"I received this Cloud b Sleep Sheep only 1.5 weeks ago. For some reason, the sound system is not working. It started by shortening the sound time, then it began turning itself off right after I turned it on and then all of a sudden, it stopped working at all. At the beginning, we thought it was a battery and so we replaced it with Duracell, but no luck...Think twice before ordering it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not working properly","review":"I am disappointed.

I hope they make refund on time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor execution","review":"First of all, 3 of the 4 sound choices are useless. HEARTBEAT must be for baby aliens, \`cause it's not even close to human and is not soothing at all. RAIN is just a 4-sec. clip very badly spliced so that you hear the splice more than the rain. Listening to a badly spliced tape repeat every 4 seconds is annoying, not soothing. The WHALE sounds might be great for whales who happen to live in a Haunted House, because that's what they sound like on this thing. The OCEAN sound IS soothing...until it stops 20 minutes later. The sound stopping abruptly wakes my baby up, which means I have to wake up every 20 minutes to keep it going! Can you tell I'm sleep deprived, and this thing isn't helping?I finally just put my Ipod on \\"repeat all\\" mode and let her listen to Mozart instead on the iHome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got a used product!","review":"When I opened the package, I was shocked to see it was a used product.

Each baby is different.I was given this sheep before my baby arrived and I was very excited after reading the reviews for it online. Much to my disappointment, it did not work for my son since day 1. It still does not work after 4 months. He does not care for the sounds nor do I. It does not sound like nature to me, it sounds like a radio.He prefers soothing music which calms him down and puts him to sleep.This sheep has the vintage look/color to it and it is really soft though. If it is safety to play with(I am not sure, have not examined it carefully), it could be a nice stuff animal."},{"rating":"2","title":"cloud b sleep sheep","review":"Great product my granddaughter loves it,but I'm not sure who loves it the most my granddaughter or my son-n-law. fast delivery time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, TERRIBLE quality","review":"I was surprised, given the rave reviews of this product, of the incredibly poor quality. I will start by saying my son seems to like this lamb and it is a great solution to having a white noise machine (which he uses at home) at daycare. But given that A) I have had this product for about 3 months, B) have washed it just twice, and C) it gets light use, just 1 nap/day at daycare, it is in AWFUL condition. Looks like it has been through a war. Just took it out of the washer and an ear has fallen off! The fleece is matted and the plastic netting foundation is showing in many small patches. So glad I didn't pay more expensive prices I have seen in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well!","review":"I got this for a friend for her baby shower. When the baby was born, the sleep sheep seemed to help him to sleep. The sounds would comfort him to sleep and shut off automatically. This is essential for new parents during the first few months. I recently got this for my sister-in-law who's expecting her first child. The timers on the sheep are a great addition. If your child needs the sounds continuously, I don't think the sleep sheep is meant for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life saver!","review":"I received Sleep Sheep as a shower gift from my mother-in-law. I did not fully understand what a wonderful gift it was until I attached it to the side of my 2 week old's crib at 2am and turned it on. She was immediately quiet and content and, before I knew it, sound asleep! Now at 2 months, she sleeps well and Sleep Sheep has become part of our successful bedtime routine. She likes the rain sound best.It is essentially a cute sound machine with Velcro straps that allow you to hang it on the crib (on the outside, of course, to avoid the possibility suffocation). I have chosen to set it to run for 45 minutes, but there is also a 23 minute setting.It will definitely be traveling with us at the holidays!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep sheep","review":"Perfect for comforting baby at sleep time, and as he or she gets older,other functions graduate too.So soft and adorable, a perfect future favorite lovey.

The sounds it emits are not pleasant. Too electronic and static sounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"I was really frustrated with the design of this product. For some reason I am completely unable to get the sound machine in to the giraffe and close the opening in the back. A bunch of us have tried it, and the pouch is simply not large enough for the sound machine. Perhaps our giraffe was just sown badly and others don't have this problem. Still, I wouldn't risk getting one that can't be used together.Even though I couldn't use the sound machine in the giraffe, we did try and use the sound machine portion anyway. Our baby spends a few days a week wtih his grandmother and we gave her that to use in the pack and play. however even just the sound machine portion didn't work well. It has a 45 minute shut off. Our baby would wake up the second it shut off. We had to switch to a corded sound machine that we sit outside the crib as this would not shut off during the middle of his nap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned...","review":"We need noise because of the sounds outside my son's window, and because of household noises, which were waking him up prematurely. Well, this product's noise TIMES OUT. As if one only needs noise while they're GOING to sleep...my son's most sensitive time is toward the end of his nap, and with a noise machine that runs non-stop, his naps can be extended by up to 45 minutes! NEedless to say, this product did not do the trick and has been in the closet for 2 years since I figured that out. (To make matters worse, before I realized it timed out at 23 minutes, it would wake him UP when it stopped making the noise!! Ugh...) My suggestion is that you get a GOOD white noise machine that will run all night long...those not intended for babies seem to be the best quality, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandmother","review":"I bought this sleep enhancer for a child of nearly two years.

Hopefully, the Sleep Sheep will arrive in time to be a Christmas present for our youngest grandaughter, due in July.

But we use the heartbeat sound exclusively - and the 3rd one just died. I'm so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too (two) many things I would change about this product","review":"We used this with our new baby and quickly found two major flaws.#1 - the volume doesn't go loud enough for a crying infant to hear it.#2 - there isn't an option to have the sounds continue through the night. Our baby would be sleeping soundly and then 45 minutes later when sleep sheep would stop soothing, like a light switch, baby would be awake and crying.It is cute and the sounds are nice, but the major flaws are too big to get past. A white noise MP3, which you can find for free and loop continuously on an MP3 player, works perfectly fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute","review":"Bought this for a baby shower gift and this is so cute and not as expensive as buying it in the big box stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't know what I'd do without it!","review":"I wasn't sure how often I'd use this gift. I've used it almost every day, several times a day for 6 months! And it has the original batteries. I don't know what I'd do without this. I generally only use the heartbeat sound, but he does enjoy the other jungle/nature sounds too. If he wakes up in the middle of the night, I turn this on and he's back to sleep. I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our baby's best friend","review":"Our 15 month old goes everywhere with sleepy sheep. It is cute a cuddly and really does help her sleep at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"first christmas present","review":"I got this item for my son's first christmas. We used it every night until he was a one year old. It is hypoallergenic and easy to clean. It needs a 9v battery but it lasts a long time. Some ambient sound systems are very expensive like the ones you see in Brookstone. There are only 4 sounds on this Sleep Sheep compared to something more expensive. There's a difference in that my son can hug and tamper with the buttons as much as he likes and I don't have to worry about him breaking it as opposed to something that's $150. He loves the thing and I'm sure it will be near his side as he grows even older. It's a sentimental stuff toy to him as opposed to a $150 dollar box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I just bought this for my 6 month old who has been having some trouble going to sleep without noise and music wasn't cutting it. She's a little old for the heartbeat or whale noises, but I can see how those could be great for a newborn. The ocean sounds, however, soothe her right to sleep. I was FINALLY able to just put her in her crib fairly awake at bedtime and she's just so relaxed for about a minute before dozing off. I only gave it 4 stars because of the timer. I wish it could stay on longer. I would definitely recommend this to others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Like a Charm!","review":"We use this just about every night. It has become part of the \\"routine\\" of bedtime. It works for naptime as well...I lay her down and turn on the sheep (I prefer the ocean sound, my husband really likes the whales) and it's as though she hears it and realizes it's time for sleep. 99% of the time she is asleep well before it runs through the 23 minute cycle. We do have the newer one with the 40-some minute option as well but haven't needed to run it that long. Since her bedroom is so close to ours, I have come to enjoy the sounds myself as I lay in bed at night! :) Maybe I need my own! I am all for any product that relieves some of the unpredictable sleep patterns and bedtime difficulties that come with every infant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"This is a must have! My daughter sleeps with it everynight, and my husband and I can also sleep with it because the sounds are not annoying like many other baby products. It has 4 different sounds and has a timer- I would recommend this for anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"Cloud B Gentle Giraffe Sound Machine is a wonderful product! Its' soothing sounds really help my newborn sleep every night! SO glad I purchased this adorable giraffe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple sound machine for baby","review":"We have used this sleep sheep during nap time and bed time for almost a year now for our baby. The background noise is really soothing for him. The sound is a bit garbled but it is still a great solution. There's a velcro strap on the back so it can hang on the side of the crib."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorts out","review":"We love the white noise for our little boy. He has a very difficult time sleeping without it. Ever since we got the giraffe it has randomly shorted out, but now it's to the point that it shorts so much it's not even worth turning on. Another annoyance is that there is no \\"constant on\\" setting--the longest it will stay on is 45 minutes. Our son wakes up when it turns off and he's definitely a heavy sleeper otherwise.The sleep sheep shorts out as well--definitely a quality production issue and not just a bad egg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Giraffe, choking hazard","review":"I just recieved this giraffe as a shower gift. The volume knob on the bottom without any pressure, popped off in my hand. Its the perfect choking size. Make sure to check yours, I was able to pop mine back on and off and it only seems to pop off when its at a specific volume.I will be returning mine, and I don't think I'll be getting another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids...","review":"I received this as a Christmas gift as I have been sleeping with the aid of a sound machine for almost 15 years (I'm 30 now), and am always trying to find what works best. I have a bedside Homedics machine, but keep having complications with the settings and sound volume. I have used phone apps (White Noise is really excellent), but have issues with the sound being muffled due to speaker placement, and having to turn the volume up enough that it disturbs my husband.This soft and cuddly giraffe is absolutely adorable, and the sound box is very easy to work with. I can sit the giraffe above my head on my pillow (kinda like a giraffe hat) and the sound is loud enough to lull me, while not disturbing my sleeping sweetie. Also works if I cuddle it as I'm drifting off.I couldn't be more pleased! (Yes-it is all right to sleep with stuffed animals when you're all grown up.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps my grandson fall asleep","review":"I just looked up this product to buy one for a gift. I was surprised to see that it's rating (before my review) was only two stars so had to add my comments. The Sleep Sheep was given as a gift to my grandson and is a big hit. It helps him fall asleep. And because the mechanism is housed in a soft lamb, it is protected from breaking when his 3-year-old sister throws it."},{"rating":"2","title":"She loves it...","review":"The first 3 months the Sleep Sheep did not seem to make a huge difference. She seemed to be on her own schedule regardless of her surroundings. Since she turned 3 months old, now she is 1 year old, she loves it and it is a must have. The back is helpful now that she is one year she cannot turn it off as easily and fall asleep. I turn it on the ocean wave sound. I fall asleep to it too on the monitor. It is so soothing and nice--better than a CD player, snugglier and portable. It is helpful to time it to her nap and goodnight time. Now, we can't travel without it! I put it in the car on trips, etc. Actually, we had visitors the other day and my best friend fell asleep to the sleep sheep in our bed to the monitor that was still turned on from the night before during baby's nap time, my best friend seemed in a coma I could not wake her up! And she often claims she can never sleep. She loved it so much she wanted to take it home. It works for adults too. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"i'm loving this giraffe! i had been using a blow dryer before i bought this. at fourteen bucks thats a great deal. you get a stuffed animal that interests a almost 7 month old and a sound box in one...very convinient. only thing i dont like is that for some reason the volume control is hard to turn on and off with one hand. i think the fabric rubs against it and makes it hard. but seriously great toy. making my life easier and thats what i like! one note. i thought that i would regret getting the giraffe instead of the lamb and i have not. the jungle sounds calmed him to sleep just now and that surprised me. the victoria falls sound like a blow dryer but more gentle. and i'm actually quite liking the drum sound or whatever it is for play. the heart beat i dont know about just yet...but thats the one that the lamb has too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep sheep - fundamentally flawed","review":"It doesn't have an option to stay on. After a max of 45 minutes it will shut off abruptly, no gentle progression to no sound - just sudden silence, guaranteed to wake up the f*ing baby - worse than having nothing at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Machine and Velcro Problems","review":"I was hoping for this to be an attachment object for my kids at night, but they (3 and 1.5 years) both can't keep their hands off the velcro and sound machine buttons. I had to remove the velcro lasso and take out the sound machine on the first night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of money!","review":"Horribly crappy product! I don't know what all the hype is about cloudb products and I'm disappointed I bought into it! I expected a quality gund-like stuffed animal. Nope! Such a CHEAP stuffed animal. The soundmaker is supposed to fit in a hole in its back - but it doesn't fit at all! It's not meant for cribs, so where or why would you use it??? Absolute waste of money, I will be returning it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea!","review":"Love this product! It's a must have. Too bad I did not discover it earlier. It's great white noise that I can put/take anywhere and lull my little one to sleep. I believe the timer is for 23 mins which most of the time is adequate for my baby to fall asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Sleep Sheep!","review":"Oh My! I was absolutely not going to 'buy into' this whole soothing noises thing. After 3 months of a baby who wakes at every sound and simply won't just fall asleep I gave in and started researching noise machines. We have been using the sleep sheep at nearly every nap and bed time for the past 2 months. There are 4 sounds. Heartbeat, Rain, Waves Crashing and Whales. The whales seem to be the winner. The timer is great as well so we aren't running batteries down. Speaking of which, we have yet to replace the batteries and like I said. It's used on a regular basis. Our little one also loves looking at him and loves squeezing it. Would definitely recommend and I will be buying this as a gift for any friends having babies in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"does what it says it does","review":"Nice item, well made worth the price, I would reccomend it for anyone wanting to dive a gift for a baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"puts baby to sleep","review":"I had this on my baby registry but I really liked it at the store and so I ended up purchasing it myself. And it is great. My baby loves it. She listens to the \\"play\\" setting everynight and she falls asleep to it. She is 7 months now and still listens to it everynight and now she actually cuddles it when she falls asleep. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for my child.","review":"You may want to try this sheep for yourself, but it did not work for my son. He is now almost 4 months old and he has not cared about this sheep and its sounds from day one. I have the soothing seahorse and aquarium soother and both of these put my child to sleep fast. I would recommend those products, but not the sleep sheep. What attracts him most is the light and he prefers songs to the sounds of the sheep. I give 2 stars to the sheep just because it is super cute and I think we can use it later as a toy. It is also very soft, so I think my son will eventually like it once he can hold things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality--shorts out","review":"While it worked, it was alright. However, after about 2 months of use it shorted out and will not work now. Same story with our CloudB giraffe. I also hate the 45 minute shut off and wish it would play continuously as to not wake him up. Save your money and download an iPhone app or go to a white noise website on the computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the giraffe","review":"My 6mo old loved her travel size giraffe so much that we got her the bigger one for in her room. She loves it! The only thing that I would caution parents on is that the larger giraffe did not have all the same sounds as the smaller one. Since our little one has listened to the smaller giraffe's sounds for 4 months, we were a little disappointed that the sounds on two of the buttons were very different (reason for loss of 1 star). I would suggest that you purchase in a store so that you can hear the sounds first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable!","review":"The Cloud B Gentle Giraffe is a great way to distract/soothe a fussy baby! It plays different sounds, and has a velcro strap to attach it to carseat or stroller. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its cute, and that is as good as it gets here.","review":"I was so excited when I got this in the mail and opened it right away to put it in my nursery.

I LOVE it - the soft sounds are wonderful. so I figured I needed the larger one for the crib. It does have a different sound, mothers heartbeat and I would have prefered the other water sound versus the victoria falls but it is still great to have in the crib. I would buy it again"},{"rating":"2","title":"so soft, our boy will love it.","review":"Like this as an alternative or addition to having a mobile in our little boys crib. Material is very soft, and whenhe outgrows the soothing aspect the lamb is very cute & cuddly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the new baby.","review":"I have ordered several of these little sheep for new babies in our family and for friends over the past few years. I always receive wonderful reviews from parents. It's the perfect gift for comforting little ones. So soothing! I will continue to make this item my first choice when I purchase new baby gifts. Excellent choice and excellent timely service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheep","review":"Very sweet and soft with soothing sounds. Still a bit large for 5 mo. old. Baby will love it more as time goes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep time","review":"I bought this for my 7 Month old Son. We had a bassinet that played similar sounds which helped him fall asleep. He loves the Sheep its portable for when we travel. It seems to be well made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute, not so well made","review":"This is a great tool for helping children sleep. The four sounds are very soothing.The issue I had is that the one that was sent to me seemed like it was a re-furb even though I bought it new. The stitching by the sound device crevice is coming apart all the way up to the sheep's head and the stuffing is therefore coming out! Otherwise, my son (1 year old) and I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for both me and the baby!","review":"I love the gentle sounds on this sheep to help me fall asleep too! The sound of the mothers heartbeat is my least favorite but the whale sounds, rainfall and waves breaking are right on! The Sheep straps right on the crib securely which is convenient. As others have noted a continuous play option would be nice or at least longer than the max 45 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just simply Amazing","review":"We purchased a heart beat bear for my son when he was a baby. With a new baby on the way we find these to be relaxing for our babies. With the music options is a nice. Since the new baby is a safari theme, this was excellent choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok...","review":"It's kind of big and awkward. The sound machine part that's supposed to fit in the \\"spine\\" of the giraffe keeps peeping out, so it's kind of hard when the baby bring it to her face. I feel like it could fit in better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but has a few flaws","review":"The sheep is very cute as a stuffed animal, but we ended up taking out the sound machine portion because it was too hard to turn it on when it was in the sheep and attached to the crib. And since it only stays on for a max of 45 min we had to restart it a lot. In the end this was also not loud enough. Save your money, time and sanity and purchase a sound machine that runs continuously."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have bought 7 of these","review":"This is a perfect gift for ANY mother expecting a baby... no matter what their decor or gender, it will become their most prized possession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep Sheep Soothes Soundly","review":"This is the second time I've sent a Sleep Sheep as a gift to a newborn. Both sets of parents tell me that their babies are probably happier and better adjusted since the Sheep joined the household, and will probably get better grades throughout school. :-)) Don't hesitate! Add a Sleep Sheep to your crib without delay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not a substitute for a white noise machine","review":"I was hopeful that this would help lul my infant to sleep to help train her to fall asleep in her crib. She did seem to calm to the \\"rain\\" sound, but it took her about 20 minutes to drift off, so just as she actually fell asleep, it abruptly turned off, waking her up immediately. So we purchased an actual white noise machine (which is also an alarm clock/radio), which we love. I also like that I also have options of playing the radio with it and have many sounds to choose from rather than being limited to only 4 with the sleep sheep. Though this is cute, I recommend spending money one something more practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamental FLAW","review":"FLAWED.As a number of other reviewers have noted, there exists a fundamental flaw in this product's execution: the sound _SUDDENLY_ cuts out after the timed period. This can abrogate any beneficial effects the soothing put-down sounds have had, raising your child from the state of sleep they managed to reach.All it needs is a min or two long volume fade down in order for this to be a great product, rather than the sadly missed mark that it is.I emailed them in the hopes they might forward on the device's plans such that we could do a quick DIY hack on it to introduce our own fader, but they didn't address the question, instead choosing to advertised future products. Disappointing.I like(d) it, but then have to be grumpy about it. Oh well. Perhaps it teaches our child to deal with the sudden removal of nice things, a bit like life, like expectations (ahem, case in point)."},{"rating":"1","title":"scary sheep","review":"I though it was a good idea to get this sheep for my newborn so I added this to my baby registry. When someone got this for us I was really excited thinking it would help calm the baby and put her to sleep...I was sooooo wrong. I found the sound very muffle and not soothing at all. The worst part was my baby hated this thing and was scare to tear every time she saw it. I end up using my tablet to play calming music for her instead. Had to return the sheep to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Love the sleep sheep. Initially bought it cause we were going on a trip with other kids and his sister and wanted to make sure he wasn't woken up, he's 6 months old. We use it at home now every evening, he knows when he hears it it's bedtime. Definitely recommend. I wish it ran longer than 45 mins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep Sheep saver","review":"Love this guy. Use it several times a day! Long battery life so far and the timer feature is great. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made Mommy sleep good already!","review":"Gave one of these to my pregnant friend - told her to play it now as baby could hear it then hang it on the crib after baby arrives to comfort him (yes - a boy!). The next day she said she had the best night of sleep she had since her belly got big! The other two are for a friend who is expecting twins - but I have not given them to her yet. I am sure she will love them as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but...","review":"I wish the timer could be set longer than 45 minutes as it sometimes wakes my baby up when it turns off. Other than that, she LOVES it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Cuddly, but sounds are less than ideal.","review":"I love the way this product looks and feels. It's much larger than I expected, too. I also like that the sound box is removable so it can be washed easily.My complaint is that the \\"heart beat\\" noise sounds like someone hitting a metal shed with a stick; the \\"whale sounds\\" noise is just plain creepy, and the \\"rain\\" noise sounds like frying bacon. The only noise that sounds like it should (and the only one we use) is the ocean wave noise; which is rather relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEET GIFT","review":"So I don't have kids but got this as a gift for my sister in law. This will be her first and I thought it was adorable. The volume control is great, has settings for 23 & 45minute timer, and the sounds are great. I'm excited to see which one my nephew will like the most. The best part is the sound box comes out of the lamb, so any child could have this as a cuddly toy and use it for soothing/settling pre-nap/sleep time for years. The lamb is adorable, its dark cream, super soft and lush, and slightly vintage looking. It definitely won't show dirt if it got dragged around the house with a toddler either. It looks much more expensive then I expected and is absolutely adorable. Better looking appearance wise then most toys/teddy's I've seen in stores.GREAT GIFT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy sound that did not soothe my son","review":"Some babies love white noise, but we didn't find this product to be very soothing for our baby. The heartbeat setting is so slow that it sounds very unnatural. The whale setting sounds more like haunted house noises. The rain and ocean noises are the only ones that don't sound creepy. For us, this was a waste of money. We had better luck with the Tiny Love Soothe and Groove Mobile, which plays music for 40 minutes, and has several different settings/types of music/white noise from which to choose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, cheap, cheap, cheap construction","review":"Short and sweet, great concept, the sheep is cute, sounds are pretty good (although we stick to the ocean sound usually), but we have gone through 3 of these so far and are ready to return the last one and try something else. All bought from Target, everyone of them has malfunctioned within 2 months. We got an exchange for the first one that would only work intermittently after 1 month of use. The second sheep would not switch to the 45 minute mode. Returned it for another one....after 2 weeks it will shut off if it is bumped slightly.....ugh. What a POS product. Would it kill the manufacturer to make a quality product and just charge us $5 more? Just a waste of a great idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Giraffe is good for sleeping.","review":"I had originally bought this giraffe for my son, so he can stay asleep, but he didn't seem to like it much, so now I use it, and it helps a lot. It drowns out other sounds, with gentle white noise (and other sounds you can choose from). It also comes with a couple of timer settings, 23 to 46 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turns off after 45 minutes!","review":"This thing turns off in 45 minutes! I highly recommend one without a timer! Your baby will most likely wake up when the sound turns off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, not great","review":"This product would be perfect if it had a continuous setting. We use the 45 minute option exclusively. It helps our four week old get to sleep, but he always wakes up when the noise turns off. We have to wake up and push the button again for him to settle back down. I would buy something different with the option to stay on all night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even get the battery box open due to cheap screws","review":"We bought this item to use in our nursery. The sleep sheep arrived in what appeared to be great condition and was really cute. Unfortunately, the screws used by the manufacturing company are so cheap, we stripped them by lightly applying pressure with the screw driver. We were able to get one out, but not the other. I can't comment on how the item works since we weren't able to gain access to the battery compartment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 6 months","review":"I put this giraffe on my daughter's wish list, and she got it from her aunt. At first, it worked fine, and my daughter loved it. After 6 months of gentle use, it died. Although a nice idea, this toy does not last and is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy sounds","review":"The soothing sounds from nature were really very creepy sounds, very ominous and fuzzy sounding which was unfortunate because it is really cute and soft. We returned the item anyway because the sounds were just not clear or soothing at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whole Family Loves It!","review":"We purchased this giraffe for our 6 month old son, but it's become a favorite of everyone in the family when we're sleeping away from home. All of our children are used to sleeping with a fan on in their bedrooms for \\"white noise.\\" It's not always practical to carry a fan with us when traveling, so this giraffe has come in very handy! At our last overnight hotel stay, we attached the giraffe to the baby's portable crib and put it on the white noise setting. Our toddler was in a portable crib near by and the giraffe soothed them both to sleep with no \\"away from home\\" bed time troubles. When it was time for everyone else to go to bed, we again turned on the giraffe and it nicely blocked out the noises from the parking lot outside and any noises from the hallway. We're planning another night away and the giraffe is at the top of our packing list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"The little giraffe is so cute & cuddly. The sounds are so soothing. I think my new grandbaby will love it!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great on planets where nights last 45 minutes!","review":"This product is great for parents who would like their kids to sleep for up to 45 minutes, then wake up. Those of us who would like them to sleep a little longer wish that it wouldn't turn off after 45 minutes! I have no idea what they were thinking? Some kind of ridiculous liability issue?This makes the cute sheep useless. I'd recommend getting a cheap radio and setting it between AM stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible/broken","review":"Great idea. Used it twice and then it broke.

Our 9 month old has a HomeMedics white noise machine in his room that we leave on overnight (love it). For camping we wanted a portable one. Our first camping trip, he'd wake up somewhere new and freak out (that led us to buy this product). We took this one on our second trip. This machine worked great. EXCEPT there is no way to use it without the timer! It shuts off after 45 minutes no matter what you do! He woke up about once/hour. If hadn't recycled the packaging already, we'd be returning this.

The only thing I wish it had was a way to encase the sound box inside of the toy later so my newborn can play with the lamb like a toy.

I actually bought two - one for his crib at home and one for daycare. We use the \\"rain\\" sound and as soon as he hears it, it signals to him that its time for a nap. I liked the idea of something familar that he'd have both at home and at \\"school\\". Often times they'll put several of the babies bouncy seats in a circle with the Sleep sheep in the middle and everyone snoozes listening to the rain. It's also a great way for us to signal to him that its time to go back to sleep whenever he wakes in the night for a bottle.The Sleep Sheep worked out really well for us ... I'd recommend it for anyone who is seeking a way to help their baby sleep. I've given several as shower gifts since getting ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep Sheep is the Best!","review":"My daughter loves to cuddle with the soft sleep sheep and I love this product because it puts her right to sleep with the calm soothing sounds!

It is perfect for helping a little one nod off for a nap or at bedtime. Excellent purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for new baby...","review":"We received one of these as a gift and tried it with our newborn baby girl. After 10 weeks it is hard to imagine sleep with out it. Our little one seems to find the noises calming and sleep better with it on. The \\"sleep sheep\\" produces 4 different noises that are calming, from a heartbeat to an ocean, etc. There is one noise that we have found annoying but have chosen not to use that setting. We have not had to change the battery yet.The sleep sheep has been so helpful that we have given it as a baby shower present twice now. If you have a little one on the way or are looking for a shower gift, we would recommend the \\"sleep sheep\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Quiet","review":"I really really wanted this to help sooth my 6 month old to sleep, instead of running our vacuum. But it's just to quiet, the loudest setting seems to be the ocean....but they all are still to quiet. Another thing that I dont like is the 45 minute timer, in the event that my son would fall asleep with the Sheep, he would wake up as soon as it turned off. It would also be nice if they replaced that semi-creepy whale noise with a generic white noise. I wish I had saved the box to return it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this little sheep!","review":"This sheep is awesome. It easily attaches to the crib or bassinett.

I had no luck with this and at times seemed to irritate her more than soothe her. Don't get me wrong works well and I've had no problems with the product just that this JUST DID NOT WORK FOR HER. Basically it was a shot in the dark when purchasing because you never know if something like this will help or hinder! Either way i now have an addition to my older daughter PILE of stuffed animals!

With no continuous play mode, as others have complained, you are begging for your child to wake up in 45 minutes at best when it's soothing sounds suddenly cease to be.

We liked it initially, but after five months of use the sound machine started to malfunction. The two sounds we used most often, showers and ocean, now only play for a second after pressing the button even though the timer is set for 45 minutes. We tried changing the batteries, but it didn't help. Now, a month and a half later, the other two sounds are going out too. We were not using the sheep an excessive amount, usually only 45 minutes at night time. Occasionally she would stir after 45 minutes and we would restart it.The sound machine is now useless and the sleep sheep is just a expensive stuffed animal. We've moved on to using a free white noise generator on the internet for bed time if she needs a little extra help falling asleep. I wouldn't recommend this sound machine. It is overpriced for something that only lasts a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Machine Too Low","review":"The lamb is very cute and cuddly and little bigger than expected but my main purpose for buying the lamb was the sound machine.

And it won't do what I need it to do. First, be careful -- it must be plugged directly into the wall socket(it won't work plugged into a power strip) and it needs a main USB port in the back of your computer unit (front, side, or alternate USB ports won't work -- less power to alternate USB ports they said). And the you have to download a 'PRO' version of the software hidden on their website in order to back-up your entire computer system. Be careful of folders within folders. Selecting individual files is very cumbersome and doesn't always capture the folders within folders. And, if you need to back-up another computer across a network -- this won't do it. According to Iomega tech support, Iomega doesn't have any product that backs up another computer over a network. Be careful.

The Turkish government used its right to get in and saved the lives of thousands of Turks out there. Why did they only took one third of the island? Because at that time the Turk population was the one third of the population of Cyprus.What do you expect? To let you kill some more Turks?

Every song in unaccurate when compared to the other tab books (I have of the Official NIRVANA song books). Probable, the only thing correct is the lyrics, but thats not the reason to buy this.The guitar tab is horrible, and useless. Its uncorrect on the simpliest songs, such as \\"Come as you are\\" and \\"Sliver\\". Actually, \\"Sliver\\" is unbelievably wrong. The bass notes are written for like 3 beats, when the intro has more than 15.The pages, and print the book uses is cheap and disturbing when you try to play the uncorrect songs. Its hard to look at, because they tried to squeeze everything into a small space, so they cut down on the quality of print and it looks like the authors spent no time to correct their errors.So seriously, this is a REALLY BAD buy. If you really need a nirvana tab book, i would get the greatest hits tab, or individual cds (Nevermind and In Utero)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't all that great...","review":"If you love Nirvana and you're looking for a cheap alternative to buying each individual guitar book than this is a good choice. Except, you'll get a very cheap product. This book is ok for piano players, horrible for guitar players, and ok on vocals. It is missing the song \\"Son Of A Gun\\" on Incesticide and does not contain \\"Plateau\\" \\"Oh, Me\\" or \\"Lake of Fire\\" from MTV Unplugged. It has basic guitar chords but I have found that many songs are written inaccuratly. Over all, don't buy it.

Growing up, he was my favorite kick boxer. Unfortunately, this book dates back to 1982, and I'm afraid it's showing its age. The stretching section consists of a good stretch routine, but there's not much explanation to go with the stretches. The kicking section primarily contains kicks that require the extreme flexibility for which Mr. Wallace is known. As a fan I enjoyed the book, but I did not get much new information that I could use."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disapointed","review":"Wallace's book just demonstrates some basic and advanced stretching techniques but doesn't give you any routines to follow and how to put them together in your workout.

Anyway, the song that pretty much everyone wants when Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby are together and walking towards Half Peak is called \\"Send Me On My Way\\" by Rusted Root.

Basically this cd has all the background music that you never notice and quite frankly don't care about. Most of you who want to buy this cd is the same reason why you would buy any other, because it has one or two (very rarely three) songs that you want to get.

For all of the reviewers who complain about Rusted Root's song \\"Send me on my Way\\" not being included, too bad. If you only want the score for that song, why not just by a rusted root CD, seeing as you clearly aren't interested in Film Scores. For those of you who complain about David Newman's full score being included, I feel your pain. But the CD, despite it shortness, does stand on its own quite well. And does include many recognizable passages from the film. Overall, I think David Newman's score to this movie is fantastic.

The other songs are weak and the lyrics forgettable. Imagine the phone book read to music, but very very quietly and without passion. That about sums up the rest of the songs.

It is fast, able to take extreme conditions, and probably less susceptible to corruption than cheap cards. However, a fast card may be of little to no benefit in the real world. After all, your camera can only write to the card so fast. This is why the Extreme III is of little to no benefit compared to the Ultra II in a Rebel XT/XTi. And if you use a card that is faster than the camera, you are likely spending more money than you have to. Unless you need the ability to withstand extreme conditions, the Extreme III is just overkill.On the other hand, you can read data from the Extreme III faster than the Ultra II. So you will be able to download your images more quickly with the Extreme III.

The box said no assembly required, but door wasn't even attached to the cage and didn't have the pieces needed to attach it. I had to attach it with zip ties. I also had to reinforce the clips which hold the cage together, make adjustments to the piece that holds the door open & and alter the eye hook on the side because it has too much give. It took a lot of time to get it working and it still doesn't work every single time...too much money for something requiring so many adjustments."},{"rating":"1","title":"these items all have defects","review":"returned first one ordered,second one had same defects,called havahart and was told all of these have the same defect"},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal Live Trap","review":"I have always had to borrow a live trap from my rancher friends when I need one so decided to buy my own. This one is large enough for a coon. There is a problem with the catch that sets the trap door. I had noticed in the reviews someone else had the same problem. It takes a lot of strength to set it and a lot of time to get it to work. The instruction pictures do not show the same as what the trap actually is. I have yet to catch a coon in this one. With the borrowed one I have captured as many as nine in two weeks. Because of the catch on the door, I can't give it very good ratings.

They have cheapened the design to the point that it does not function properly. Havahart should recall all of these units because the one I purchased did not work at all and I had to return it. Also, most, if not all, diagrams shown for this unit on the internet are of the old design and not of the flimsy design, another misrepresentation.I had the older design unit for over 6 years and it worked fine until wear and tear took its toll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed & Defective!","review":"Right out of the box this trap was a big headache. Poor instructions, very difficult to set, hair-trigger pressure plate (which causes it to shut with just a minor bump to the outside of the cage) and the poor craftsmanship (wire from uncut spring) makes it a little dangerous to the user. I have bought smaller Havahart's traps before but this was my first one for larger animals. I have always been happy with their small traps but this larger one needs a total REDESIGNED! Needless to say, I was very disappointed with Havahart 1081 and shipped it back the day after receiving it. The only remotely good I could say about my whole experience with it was that Amazon makes it easy to return and get a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"Works as expected. Already caught one Possum. I had a cheaper version of this type trap, and the animal was able to chew through the wires - not this one though. It's well made and should be able to catch the necessary critters. The only challenge is installing bait since it's so long, but that's a minor inconvenience.It also caught my cat - but while he was embarrassed, he wasn't harmed and ate all the food I had used as bait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains incredibly offensive pictures","review":"I loved the Babar books when I was little and my son is coming to love them, too.

However, my happiness at purchasing it turned to dismayed shock when I read about Babar & his new wife encountering \\"savages\\" on their trip. The savages portrayed are offensively stereotyped Africans - big lips, sub-human, stupid leers on their faces, mindlessly violent... it's been a long time since I saw such blantant bigotry in a child's book.

Cute elephants, great travel adventure theme, great pictures. Strange and very negative story. To address another's comments -- I do not purposely seek out offensive racial stereotypes to teach my kids. That's something you handle as it comes. And the audience of this is a little young for the cannibal/savage stereotype to be necessary. There is also violence (elephants injuring humans, war), rudeness, war prisoners in a cage, etc. I ripped out the offensive pages and donated the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More racist material.

You're saying that it's ok to say and display these racist depictions of African people, regarless of the time frame of when this book was written. What is wrong in 10000 B.C., is wrong today.

Her voice is as thrilling as ever - be prepared for goosebumps - and is used on great set of songs. Her version of 'The Whole Night Sky' wipes the floor with the Bruce Cockburn original. Christine gets better support on this LP from her musicians, with outstanding contributions from Richard Thompson, BJ Cole and John Surman.While there are many great tracks, a stand out is the cover of Tom Wait's 'Dirt in the Ground'; tougher than most of Christine's material, but attacked in searing fashion by her and BJ Cole.

It also includes the original version of I'm an adult now; which I haven't heard since I was in high school. To top it all off, the songs have been remastered in 24 bit, and the refreshed sonics are a real treat.

Oe would hope the author might have matured over the years and realized the book was a failure -- instead of throwing a different cover and recycling the exact smae book.The novel is the typical a poor little rich girl story -- a thinly disguised attempt of the author to embarrass her family and misconstrue the facts. When a child is kicked out of 14 boarding schools, one has to wonder: is it the boarding schools or parents fault or does the child (ie author) have such a nasty, entitled, intolerrable personality that no one wanted her aroud?

Some of the performances are genuinely funny--the first couple times you see them, at least. But the same characters repeat the same catchphrases and act out the same scenes with each other in pretty much every episode. I can see why it was so popular when it was airing, but it doesn't work as DVDs.It takes a lot to offend me, but I think that some of the material crosses a line. There's more than one instance of blackface, and an entire sequence of scenes about a mother who pimps out her teenage daughter at a truck stop.

Helper Lou and his 'disabled' friend Andy. Emily Howard the rubbish transvettite. Majorie Dawes, the fat fighters leader. Dennis Waterman the tiny actor who 'writes the thme tune and sings the theme tune' and other characters. My favourite is Vicky pollard the school girl 'yeah but no' she was based in Bristol where both Matt Lucas and David Walliams (creators) went to university and where i live.

It reminds me (a lot) of Mad TV, in that the jokes are obvious and lame--it lacks the subtlety, intelligence and wit of shows like Ali G or The Office.

The devil sends to envoys to disrupt, tempt, and destroy the tranquility of such a happy place.

The first one has a very nice violin part, and the trumpet part is really high and has a really neat tone, so I like it. The second of the two tracks is a reprise of Hubris (track 11 or 12) arranged for piano. Hubris opens with a haunting violin solo which is nonexistent in the game from what i've heard while playing. But the reprise is a much quieter piece, while still being Hubris. Whoever plays the piano for that song gets five stars from me.Overall, the soundtrack is good, but some songs are very repetitive, but that's not uncommon in fighters' soundtracks, so the SC2 soundtrack gets a 4 of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot put this book down!!!!!!!!","review":"To many Protestants in the South and other areas of the country, among the leading Presbyterian divines of the past century the name of Dr. John Redhead would certainly rank among the highest.

Then there's the obligatory fair \\"expert and social commentator\\". (This guy really needs to find a job). By the time we get to the actual sights and sounds of the fair -- all that's left is the construction of the Unisphere, a shot of a middle-aged couple eating the famed Belgian Waffles, and finally...a few minutes spent inside the GM pavillion. We might have seen more of the fair if those aforementioned baby boomers had showed us their scrapbooks. This video just has no soul. Should be in the dollar bin next to the checkout counter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SEVERE DISAPPOINTMENT FOR REAL '64 FAIR BUFFS","review":"I'd have to give this video a C minus- for anyone who cherishes the '64 World's Fair the way that I do, it's a severe disappointment. There were SO many sights and sounds to relive, they could have filled the entire video with glorified home movies and still photographs for 2 hours, and it would have satisfied fair buffs better than this. (Too much time was spent on the history of the fair's planning, interviews with fair attendees, etc..) Apparently, the \\"filmakers\\" were obsessed with only using actual \\"moving film footage\\" and had to hedge the rest with the interviews, etc. (Perhaps they should have taken a cue from Ken Burns, since there is a MOUNTAIN of still photographs from this memorable event that could have been used.) If you want to relive the fair, try to only rent this video if you can, and supplement it by finding old \\"Viewmaster\\" reels and collectible fair photo books- this video brings back a few memories, but not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly what I wanted.","review":"Instead of alot of video of the Fair itself, this DVD depended upon the recollections of many visitors, who were interviewed.While it was nice to hear their stories, it would have been nicer to actually see video of what they were talking about. Perhaps more audio of the Fair would have been good as well.Albeit was 1964/65, I'm sure this PBS Special could have gone back to the News Archives of the time and showed what type of coverage the World's Fair had been getting.I'll give it 1 star, because it brought back some nice memories, but is was not quite worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but incomplete","review":"A great documentary catching the essence of the fair. Living in Queens and visiting the park where the fair once was, but being too young to have attended left me curious about the 1964 events for years. This film satisfied most of my curiousity. The political background, the cronologic presentation, the highlights of the shows, and especially the interviews were insightful. This film would have been more complete with an extra chapter at the end showing what happened to the pavilions since. Maybe a future part two could include that. The DVD picture and sound quality is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"The photography, both black and white as well as color was of a very poor quality to say the least. The content deviates from the purpose of purchasing the DVD. Much too much time is spent on waving crowds, people recalling childhood memories and so many trials and tribulations in starting and finishing the project. All of this could have been compressed and could have been more meaningful. I could not sit thru the complete film. All in all it was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"World's Fair Video, a real trip...back in time","review":"I was very pleased and interested in this video. As a world's fair collector, I found the content, footage and the fairgoers' recollections very compelling and a joy to watch. I couldn't get enough and wanted more. I learned some interesting facts about this fair I did not know before viewing this video. I own the \\"World of Tomorrow\\" video about the 1939 New York World's Fair and consider 1964 World's Fair \\"Part II\\" of the other video. The only improvement I can see is losing the \\"90s\\" background music which I found extremely annoying and out of place with the time this fair took place. Judd Hirsch did a wonderful job narrating the video. If you are interested in World's Fairs or are just curious, this DVD is a must. By the way, I had an awful hankering for a Belgian Waffle when this videw was finished--can't explain why, just did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly easy to use","review":"I've had good success with this composter this season. At first, I put my kitchen trimmings in it, along with some leaves and stuff, but it didn't do much. Then I upped the ante ... I mowed the lawn with the grass catcher attachment, and got lots of green vegetation, and then I went to my local coffee shop and asked if they had any coffee grounds for gardeners available (lots of brown). You need both green and brown to make the compost start cooking! After a few days, with daily turnings, the composter was hot! Steam rose out of the stuff inside on the cooler spring mornings. Granted, for the rest of the summer, I had to put up with a lot of brown coffee liquid goo dripping out as I turned the thing, but no one said it wasn't going to be messy. So, all in all, it works great. I can't think of anything to complain about."},{"rating":"2","title":"let it rot","review":"Great, simple com poster.

It accepts a lot of compost-able material, and I generate a lot through home brewing. Problem was, I filled it up nearly to the mid point over the course of the winter, spinning it several times a week, until one time last week when I spun it, the spin-on top/bottom broke and all the compost fell on the ground. So, now I have a busted Tumbleweed and I'm sure it's not compost-able in the landfill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"get ready for a workout","review":"i have a SpinBin, which is a compost tumbler much like this one - and i don't recommend them like this (i much prefer the 'wheel' composter style). Get ready for a workout if you get a tumbler like this - the fuller it gets, the harder it is to flip... in addition, put on some dirty clothes every single time you get ready to do it, as the nastiest spooge (also known as \\"compost tea\\") will happily fly out the vents and all over you. also, ours cracked right by the seam - and we don't even flip it all that often because it's so, so, so difficult to do. we were better off with a giant hole in the ground, using a shovel to turn the pile manually. the only reason this is any better is that it's good for those who can't have a hole in the ground or need to save space. if you need to get a composter that tumbles, get the wheel-style composter instead with a compartment in the bottom that collects that lovely \\"tea\\" - nasty as it may be, it's the nectar of life for your plants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't wast your money","review":"I bought this tumbler about a year ago. I was very excited to get away from my compost pile and use the cleaner and \\"easier\\" tumbler method. Assembly of this product was nice and easy as it took 20 minutes tops. What I should have realized before buying the tumbleweed is the huge design flaw. You load the compost into the bottom of the bin and flip it every couple days...easier said than done. This thing is very heavy to rotate so my 11 year old son can't run out and flip it for me. When I rotate it, it is extremely heavy and you have to shake the tumbler to get the compost to move to the other end of the bin. It is really strenuous so I replaced it for another center-rotating model that is so much easier. Composting should not be so hard.You might as well drill a couple holes in a garbage can, put a lid on it and flip it over every other day. You will get the same thing for $10. I gave this two stars because it is quality, just poorly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Anyone who Lives in Cold Climates","review":"I am very disappointed in this product. Paid $200 based on everyone's generally positive reviews. We live in the Northeast and it worked effectively through the late summer and fall, but as soon as the weather got cold, it stopped \\"composting\\". Worse, after the first freeze, the bin contents froze and when rotating the bin in an attempt to loosen the frozen compost, the bin spun off its stand and broke into pieces when it hit the ground (from all of 6-12\\" up in the air). Not very satisfying for 4 months of use. And the product warranty doesn't cover use in temperatures below freezing (which I didn't learn until after mine broke). This bin is useless for anyone living in cold climates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I ordered my composter on a Tuesday with \\"Free Shipping\\" from Amazon and received it the next day! I put it together myself and have been using it for about 3 weeks. Super easy to use and no smell at all.

We followed the directions and used leaves, grass clippings, coffee grinds, and vegetable peelings, rinds, etc., and faithfully turned it a few times a day. Even after letting it sit for weeks and eventually months (we started it in the summer, so it got plenty of heat and humidity), when we emptied it again a week ago, we could still see the small leaves; it hadn't turned into compost at all. After emptying it, we hosed it out and then donated it. If it can't produce compost after months, it isn't much use. This product should be a big \\"Zero\\", but that wasn't an option here. Our title says it all . . . Don't Waste Your Money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in just over a year","review":"Not durable. Plastic tabs broke on one end after a year of use, so it was a very expensive way to generate compost.

Despite the composter being raised above ground, we had rats eat through the top and nest inside. I repaired the rat holes, coated it with a product that makes the plastic taste bad to steer away pests. Didn't work. Same problem occurred. We are now worm composting our kitchen scraps in my garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"The Tumbleweed is well designed, very easy to assemble and to use. The barrel openings at both ends are very convenient and rotating the barrel is quite easy. I use it as neater and more effective way to compost table scraps than throwing them in a compost pit, where it is difficult to turn over or mix with grass clippings and is unsightly. I probably will follow the advice of other reviewers and buy a second one so I can leave the composting load longer in the barrel after it is full, before I dump it into the compost pit.I also have a very large, more expensive aluminum barrel, that I fill twice a year in the summer with grass clippings and shredded dry leaves. It makes excellent compost but does not lend itself to composting table scraps all year long. I have not fully tested how well and how fast the Tumbleweeds product produces compost, but the fundamentals are there and the rest of the performance is determined more by the ingredients and the weather conditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"This wrist rest is great","review":"I had a cloth wrist rest and it worked good but I noticed that dirt would build up on the cloth rest and I could not get it off.

So it is with Johnny and the Bridge. Sounding in great voice, the boys re-visit many of their tunes from days passed by and make you glad that they did. With inter-spaced interviews between songs, the concert speaks for itself as it glides through the musical years on a sled of glass. If you enjoyed them then, you will enjoy them now. A must buy for fans who have been running the course for years, and those who are just joining in. A great concert by an ongoing class act."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells the aviation side of Hughes - the bad pilot side","review":"Well written and well documented book tells about Hughes life from the aviation perspective. Although it probably wasn't the author's primary intent, I was shocked to read how bad a pilot Hughes was with questionable flying ability and certainly flawed judgement.

The text is disappointing: repetitive, opinionated, insubstantial, more like desultory notes than anything else. The images are all black-and-white and poorly reproduced, and again repetitive and disconnected.There is too much horror in it. Bataille associates violence, horror, terror, pain, cruelty, with eroticism, madness, ecstasy, the sacred. Perhaps intense cultivation of pleasure creates a corresponding accumulative cultivation of pain. Why should this be so? I don't know except that we have what it takes to explore and we can explore in all and any direction.

As an application programer moving from FoxPro 2.x to VFP, I had many questions that went unanswered. However, I found a number of the missing answers in the VFP 5.0 documentation. I also liked that the book used the framework application included with VFP 5.0 for illustration, instead of an entirely different framework. Because the book's guidelines are consistent with Microsoft's approach, the VFP 5.0 wizards are far more useable. On the other hand, this book's discussion of VFP's OOP implementation is way too choppy and shallow to allow someone new to VFP to really use OOP effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Verizon Pearl","review":"Apparently along with several other types of accessories, this item does not work with the Verizon edition of the Blackberry Pearl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bionaire Filter","review":"The filter dimentions were off and the only way to fit in the holder was to squash it in.

As for the cart, the chrome finish is very nice and the cart is very easy to assemble, without looking at the instructions.However, it pretty much ends there for the advertised features. As a tv cart it's pretty useless, much too lightweight for TV and VCR duty. The most aggravating part however are the wheels. They're cheap plastic add-ons that don't fit at all snugly, leaving the whole cart a tottering mess that is just begging to collapse or tip over at the slightest wind or bump. In other words, the cheap-o wheels make this cart useless in any sense, unless you throw them away entirely and go stationary. So throw them away and if you want to use this cart in the bathroom or kitchen without wheels it's do-able. However, even then the price leaves this cart non-competitive for that light duty.

This book helps a mid-level practitioner understand more fully concepts and principals of Buddhism. Das certainly understands the Western mindset and approach to Buddhism. He doesn't indulge it, but makes it accessible for people who may have come to Buddhism later than others.It's for someone who more or less knows what's going on, but needs some reinforcement or extra study before heading into the really in-depth commentaries. I think a newer practitioner of Buddhism would be thrown off by the structure (it's spaced out a little more as to be more in-depth than a cursory overview).Bottom line: love it, but if you've never read anything about Buddhism, check out some simpler books (such as Buddhism for Beginners, or How to Practice) first."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 Favorite","review":"This is my favorite book by Lama Surya Das.

Loved it instantly. If I had one complaint, it was that they were only focusing on more up to date movies like Star Wars and major blockbusters such as Transformers and Iron Man. This DVD did exactly what I had hoped they would do: Attack the movies that made them famous, the low budget sci-fi films of late.Watching this brought back the same feelings that watching MST3K did back in the day. Don't get me wrong, all RiffTrax are funny. Just this style of movie is the kind that truly have it coming and its an easy target.This is definitely worthe the view for any who can't stand boring old sci-fi movies, are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, or just like sarcastic humor of any kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I have been using for a while and it is so comfortable for the wrist.

I have a desk job, and certain days I find myself using the mouse a lot.

I am suffering from some horrid wrist problems like many other people who work on a computer or play a hand-intensive instrument (drums and bass, in my case). This pad totally stabilizes the wrist and is convenient due to it's portability (i.e., you can move it different distances from the mouse pad or ON the mouse pad). Well worth the price.

It has no narrative, no structure. It is not a biography of London, it is the sporadic ramblings of a sozzled maiden aunt, only occasionally engaging. It jumps around all over the place both chronologically and thematically, apparently chasing whatever springs up in the author's mind, with no coherence whatesoever. Although individual sentences can be dynamic and often novel, the novelty soon wears off in the shapeless repetition of unrelated iterations. Tedious. A tome, a death knell, couldn't read it, agonisingly atrocious. Took it to the charity shop, where it's resale might do some good, but pity the poor shopper who rebuys it; should have a misery warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"A most disappointing \\"biography\\" about the British capital","review":"This weighty tome about the life of the city of London was a massive disappointment, and a grueling and nearly impossible book to read. It isn't a biography in the linear sense, rather it is a collection of short chapters about different aspects of the city throughout its history, including its rivers, churches, theatres, and outcasts. Each chapter consists mainly of quotes from other sources, and its lack of narrative flow makes for an exceptionally dry and thoroughly unrewarding read, which reminded me of an 800 page essay written by a college freshman. Anyone brave enough to tackle this book is advised to read it in tiny segments, or, as I did, skim the book to read the most interesting sections."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Biography\\" only in the loosest sense","review":"If this book were a biography of a person, say Abraham Lincoln, we'd get something like a chapter dealing with Lincoln's food preferences from baby porridge to his last dinner before going on to the Ford Theater. Then we would be treated to a discussion of what he wore beginning with swaddling clothes and ending with his taste in stove pipe hats. In other words, there would be only the murkiest and most difficult to follow time line, with Mr. Lincoln's life chopped up into arbitrary chapters, some of which don't even stick to their stated topic. Neither good history nor a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and incoherent","review":"For the life of me, I can't figure out why this book gets so much good press. Ackroyd has clearly never met a metaphor that he didn't like, and apparently feels that the frequent (and often bizarrely misplaced) use of such can replace good writing. The whole book reads like a giant editorial which has no point, and facts merge too subtly into half-truths, suppositions, and out-and-out falsities without any guidance to navigate through through them. If you're looking for a good history of London, look elsewhere. If you're looking for good commentary on London society throughout the ages, tough luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd Give it 5 Stars If...","review":"As all the previous reviews have made clear, this is a great book. There is nothing about it that would keep me from recommending it except that I think I would have enjoyed it even more if I already knew London to some--any--degree. I don't. I've never been to the city and have read very little about it before this book. So I felt a little overwhelmed and disoriented on this my first \\"visit\\". But what a great place it is to visit, even if just by reading this book, especially when you get away from the tour group destinations into the back lanes and dusty nooks and crannies. I may never really get to London, but I feel like I've gotten a glimpse of the soul of the city."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary chaos","review":"As an admirer of Ackroyd's other books, I hate to say it--but this book is a stinker. It's not a history but a series of anecdotes and scattered facts. The feeling of reading it is rather like reading an encyclopedia from cover to cover: interesting but scatterbrained. London is my second home and I've read many histories of her. As a companion volume, Ackroyd's book might be acceptable. But let the reader beware that this IN NO WAY will suffice as one's first history of London. This book needed a better editor to restrain its author's robust energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"Peter Ackroyd presents so much fascinating information about London over the ages within the pages of this book, and in such a readable fashion, I'd recommend it to anyone interested in London, planning a visit to the city, or interested in history in general. I've been reading my way through all his books, and have yet to be disappointed.London's past is uncovered layer by layer, yet masterfully linked across time, also."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Anglophile","review":"Those of you hankering for British history will love this book. It takes you through English history through the \\"eyes\\" of London.I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Feel Liike I Was There","review":"This is a fascinating book that traces the life of one of the most controversial and influential people in the history of Rock and Roll. Accounts from his early years by himself as well as his friends provide insight into how he became the fiery rock impressario that he was.It is, however, the accounts from the later years and the tales from his famous and infamous Fillmore Auditoriums from insiders such as Jerry Garcia and Eric Clapton that really make this book come alive. They make you feel like you were there (or at least wish you were) for many of the most crucial events in the history of Rock and Roll- Altamont, Woodstock, etc... Fantastic for the unabashed music fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"Slightly more mainstream folow up to \\"Direction of Motion\\" but still worth it.

I am an avid AE user, to date I own around 11 AE books and this one has disappointed me the most! I was psyched to get this book and anticipated it's arrival. As soon as I got it there was trouble. The most disappointing thing about software books is when the ... CD's content doesnt work or is non-existent. Granted some of the missing files are on the web site, but that is a pain to find and some of the extensions are messed up on sequence files. I am sure that the authors are talented and I know that FriendsofED puts out some good stuff I own many titles from this publisher that I enjoy.

The construction of each tutorial makes little sense, the plug in's used are not included, and most of the files you need are simply not on the CD. Those that are there are usually labelled incorrectly or corrupt.I wrote the publisher about the missing files, and they pointed me to a site that gave me the suspect files for only one chapter, the rest are no where to be found.The tutorials are badly written/organized, and incredibly tough to follow for even advanced users.

The foam is very firm... much less comfortable than the gel style of wrist rests. Also, the foam outgasses terribly... there's a strong rubber tire smell from 5-6 feet away. As you sit and use this wrist rest, it's strong enough to actually make your eyes water. I'm not usually sensitive to stuff like this, but these are just too unpleasant. You get what you pay for....

Had to get more traps recently and discovered the current models just are not as sturdy as the old ones. Model 1045 and 1050 both worked fine for opossum, feral cat, squirrels, rabbits and raccoons. Neither held a trapped armadillo, even though armadillo pictures are on the boxes and at least one place specifically recommended the 1050 for armadillos. The armadillo just kept pushing on the bottom of the closed door until the top of the trap was bent upward enough for the spring mechanism to just flop out, so nothing held the door closed.

Back off the many past and present statements made by prophets and apostles stating that Native Americans are indeed truly descendants of Israel and embracing this research... or 2. Sticking with the \\"prophets are the mouth-piece of God\\" mentality and dismissing this scientific proof. Quite the conundrum, I would say. Which way will it go?Myself, I think a few brave mormon \\"intellectuals\\" will choose the former, but without question most rank and file members will perform the mental gymnastics necessary to rationalize, justify and trivialize this damaging research and choose the latter.Great book.

The jacket compares the book to A Confederacy of Dunces (which I read May 8, 1981) but that book was funny for awhile--but this book is unrelievedly dismal and off-putting.

Set in Martirio Texas the book is narrated by 15 year old Vernon Little, a foul mouthed kid whose best friend shoots sixteen classmates and then turns the gun on himself. But the real story is what happens after, when Vernon unfairly gets linked to the murders and the circus that erupts. The author with keen and razor sharp insight satirizes small town America, the media and the public's gross infatuation with it, reality television, and even the constitution. Based on the direction this country seems to be heading at the present time I found this book more than relevant and almost a little frightening in it's accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding mess","review":"I just recently picked this book up at the library and seeing that it won the Man Booker Prize, I thought it would be a worthwhile read. I thought wrong - the book was frustrating and the characters seemed like cardboard cut-outs. It wasn't the steady stream of profanity that put me off, for what other language is to be expected from characters like Vernon, a 15-year-old rebellious teenager? It was just that the writing seemed to plod on and on and I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters. I wonder if I'm in the minority, that I simply didn't get it? Oh well, there's no accounting for literary taste, I guess. Two other highly lauded books that I found torturous to finish were Arundhati Roy's \\"The God of Small Things\\", and Kiran Desai's \\"The Inheritance of Loss.\\" As for \\"Vernon God Little\\", all I could say when I reached the end was a prayer that it had finally ended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vernon Little is a teenage version of Hunter S. Thompson","review":"Surprise Winner of the Man Booker Prize, this satire about a Columbine-like school shooting has moments of brilliance, and equal moments of tedium. Overall, the first-person narrative about a massacre in small-town Texas is swiftly moving, entertaining, and full of clever jabs at Hicksville, U.S.A., the media and the legal system. Told by Vernon Little, a 16-yr. old witness to the murders at his high school -- the gunman his best friend, Jesus -- the narration is written in a slap-dash, hip, disaffected voice that at turns feels like a teenage version of Hunter S. Thompson, but with a style unique to the author himself (in this first novel by Australian Peter Finlay, under the pen name DBC Pierre).The first 150 pages barrel along; the next 50 meander a bit; then the final 75 come flashing forth in a fevered run to expose all the secrets and tie up all the loose ends. A satisfying climax and, though definitely not for all tastes, a recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elements of Past Faves","review":"This reminds me a lot of three books: MY FRACTURED LIFE (Rikki Lee Travolta), CATCHER IN THE RYE (JD Salinger), and THE OUTSIDERS (SE Hinton).

I found it to be excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly disappointing","review":"DBC Pierre is an unusually talented wordsmith, with a keen sense for unique metaphors and similes. But his ability seems not to extend beyond such small-scale exercises. The novel is meandering, tedious and riddled with plot holes and improbable twists, and lacking in the kind of anecdotic detail that gives a story depth and texture. The topic is ambitious, grandiose even, but the treatment is amateurish and uninsightful. Finally, and most annoyingly, the allegedly Texan voice is utterly fake. It is incredibly ambitious for DBC Pierre to attempt to write in a vernacular that is not his own, and he fails miserably. The use of ridiculously quaint character names and homonymes is initially cute and works well, but overuse ultimately kills it.Maybe one day we'll find out why this book won one of the most prestigious British literary prizes. Peter Finlay's ultimate scam?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vernon God Little: Worth Not Very Much","review":"What a strange book! A surprise winner of the 2003 Booker Prize and certainly not what I expected.I suspect that many people, particularly the prudish and easily offended, will be aghast at the book and mark it down accordingly. I am not in that camp. The use of four letter words is fine depending on context and, in the context of this book, they are of no problem. The book, however, can be marked down for other reasons.I found the plot to be confusing. I found the characters to be little more than caricature. In fact, except for a brief section well into the book where Vernon is arrested in Mexico, I really couldn't wait for the torment to be over. Quite simply, this book has been given way too much hype.Having laid my cards on the table, this will still not turn people off the book. My opinion counts for little in comparison with a Booker Prize. Regardless, you have been warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'me ves y sufres'","review":"I really enjoyed this novel; there's no question that Pierre took inspiration from 'Catcher in the Rye' (one of my favorite books) but managed to create an entirely original work. Our teenage narrator is a 21st century kid, full of raging hormones, child of an inadequate mother. In the aftermath of a mass shooting at his school in Texas, carried out by his best friend, Vernon finds himself held accountable...Holden Caulfield dreamed of paradise in a field of rye; Vernon yearns for a beach hut in Mexico (in the company of the gorgeous Taylor Figueroa). Holden derided the phoney adults around him; Vern is well aware of the corruption in the media, everyone out to make a buck. Both characters retain a touching naivety and likeability that keeps the reader rooting for them throughout. Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"I confess.

Meet Vernon Little, under arrest at the sheriff's office, a teenager wearing nothing but yesterday's underwear and his prized logo sneakers.Moments after the shooter, his best buddy, turns the gun on himself, Vernon is pinned as an accomplice. Out for revenge are the townspeople, the cable news networks, and Deputy Vain Gurie, a woman whose zeal for the Pritikin diet is eclipsed only by her appetite for barbecued ribs from the Bar-B-Chew Barn. So Vernon does what any red-blooded American teenager would do: he takes of for Mexico.I like this book because the author needs few words to characterize the 'white trash' background and to describe the feelings of Vernon who is about to be accused of murder.If nothing else, this book reads like an engrossing mystery novel. One thing though: the novel doesn't ask much intellectual firepower to read it but is that so bad?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Response to Texans","review":"I'm from the Lone Star State and am proud to be a Texan.

If an American had written the book, I'm sure there would have been less uproar.The characters are over-the-top Texan stereotypes, none of them fleshed out, and the plot is pedestrian at best.

This is far from being the case. I believe that what other reviewers have said regarding stereotypes of Texans and Mexicans is a valid criticism of the story, and it disappoints in not being nearly as funny as we are lead to believe.

It seems to me that the author wrote the character and his surroundings for the movie rights. That in of itself is not that bad a thing. This is satire, meant to have caricatures and semi-unrealistic situations. See Candide or Confederacy of Dunces that is what it is supposed to do. By making the characters a little outlandish, one is able to address the societal issues without seeming as preachy.

For whatever technical reason the pointer suddenly jumps away and you then have to figure out where it is before scrolling back to what you were doing. If you have two duel monitors set up (as I do) your pointer often ends up somewhere in the other monitor (again, no idea why it does this) and your then scrolling around to try and find it.

I was expecting a very bright, solid blue. Instead I got a very dark blue, and the gel part is translucent. I would have never ordered it if I had seen an accurate picture. Also, this is very poor quality. The mouse pad part is already tearing loose from the bottom part that sticks to the desk(3 days later). Very cheap and not worth the high price.Also, I have a very small optical mouse(the kind meant for a laptop), so this works fine for me; however, if you have a regular-sized computer mouse, I am almost certain that this mousepad would be entirely too small to manuever the mouse around. On a good note, though, the gel wrist pad is very comfortable.This is the only reason that I havn't returned it(that and because it is too much trouble)."},{"rating":"1","title":"too short","review":"only .5\\" high not 1.3\\"other than obvious lack of function due to height, the material is good, no leaks, does not stiffen up over time, no bad smellInnovera is a better brand"},{"rating":"2","title":"comfy, but mousepad doesn't work with my mouse","review":"i have a razer laser mouse, and the mousepad attached to the gel rest doesn't allow the mouse to work, AT ALL.

My Logitech MX300 suddenly got a case of the jitters and moves in the opposite direction! As for the odor of the gel, there is a slight odor but barely discernible for me. The gel pad at first was comfortable and cool to the touch on the wrist but after a short period of time heated up and caused my wrist to sweat profusely! I'm guessing that this mousepad is better suited for the user who doesn't use an optical mouse. SHAME ON FELLOWES for advertising it as so!

It fetures an interesting \\"found music\\" section in the middle. \\"Backs\\" also has the same dreary tone.This is not to say the record is not a tour de forse. The playing is excelent, and all the selections are grade A, even the funk-blues track the band preforms, mid-album.

Even putting my nose to it and sniffing, I can't smell anything. So if there was a smell originally, it's completely gone away now. (I've had it over a year though.)

Now I understand why I never really took to the Mothers of Invention. Varese's composing style seems very heavy handed. Generally the brass and percussive pieces are really (and too often) over-layered and over-the-top, and his use of percussive toys is, all to often, way over done. The electronic experimentations seem disjointed and simple and don't really seem to fit well and the vocals seem a bit silly. Having said these things, three pieces (11-12 minutes of sound out a 140 minute-plus 2 disk box) did work very well for me - Ionisation, Density 12.5 and Dance For Burgess, which were all on disk 2.

Please be moreserious...The double CD is a light version of Varèse, and Chailly hasnot the personality (or, perhaps, the level) for a Varèse anthology. Even more: the most part of the pieces have been \\"revised\\", \\"edited\\" and/or \\"completed\\" by Chou Wen-chung, a bad composer, whose business has been to proclaim his condition of former Varèse student. This is not enough to have the right of manipulate Varèse's compositions after his death.

The grinding mechanism is of high quality. Twisting the little knob on top changes the grind from fine to coarse. I like to use sea salt, which is fairly coarse, but I don't like salt crunching between my teeth when I eat. With this grinder, you have complete control over that. In addition, this grinder has a nice, tactile, quality feel in the hand. I previously owned a beautiful German stainless steel salt grinder. It never worked properly and the salt consistently came out too coarse. That this was from Germany, where there is a fetish for precision, was a disappointment. That I had to toss such a nice but useless object into the trash was a small tragedy. With the Vic Firth Tronco, however, this was not a problem--and it's American made. Perhaps we have something to teach the Germans about quality--at least when it comes to salt grinders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"In my 50+ years of housekeeping and having owned a dozen or more of this type salt/pepper grinder, I am more than pleased with and happy to highly recommend this product.

I personally don't care for them but many other people might enjoy them.The 2 songs with Japanese vocals are: R*O*C*K*S and WIND. ROCKS sounds like a flashback to the 1980's but it is listen-able. WIND is an amazing song that was the 1st ending in the Japanese version of the anime.

There are a few beautifully rendered scenes of true happiness, but Chanel's life was far from the banal frivolity of today's wealthy pop tarts. She enjoyed the luxurious leisure lifestyle of her companion in the French countryside, but she never became dominated by it. As a period piece, this movie is well done from the vintage cars to the coffee cups.Audrey Tautou (nearly an icon herself) plays the part of Coco Chanel. She's perfect for the part. Benoit Poelvoorde does a masterful job as the carefree aristocrat with his magnificent chateau. He's complex, sometimes playful or downright silly, usually kind and accommodating, honest, and ultimately endearing. I did not like the early depictions of Coco's life as a cabaret singer. But, unfortunately, that was part of her life before becoming gloriously successful. I absolutely loved the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Subtitles","review":"Unless you are fluent in French, this DVD is a total waste of money.

At times there are none, then they will appear suddenly way behind making no meaning to watch is currently showing. I am sure that if I spoke French fluently I would have enjoyed the film. It is for this reason that I must say take a chance rent it if you are not fluent in French. As well the manufacture is at fault for the worngful sub tilting on the dvd.

Excellent actors go through the motions dramatizing these five non entities.All five characters are reduced to unconvincing cut outs. Their previous character development goes down the drain.

While I was disappointed to see that season 4 would be split into 2 parts, you have to be grateful that we weren't made to wait a full year to get the season. The extras on the DVD's whet the pallate of anyone with even an inkling of wanting to see how BSG is going to wrap up, and I eagerly await it's return.My only complaint with Season 4.0 is that it includes Razor, which I'm sure the majority of us already own.

Episodically present, at best.). Hello, we're supposed to shocked-SHOCKED that Helo led a mutiny? Starbuck was acting looney-toons. You'd have to be brain-dead NOT to mutiny. Silly stuff like that makes me grit my teeth.This series has been meandering and staggering toward some kind of conclusion for two years. About time it ended. Slouching toward Bethlehem indeed . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"BSG in HD","review":"This was a great episode of a great show. Watched in HD with my ROKU and it looked fantastic.

I have 4.5 on order in Blu-ray but that option wasn't available for 4.0. (I don't have cable so this is how I watch the shows and I'm waiting for 4.5 to be released.)It still looks pretty great despite not being high def. The sound is pretty good as well.There's less of Ronald D.

Now if I wanted this season I had to buy it again! They no doubt did that on purpose to get more money out of loyal fans. [...] They did the same thing with the miniseries and the first season. Although I kind of understand that since many people might have not known about the miniseries and just bought the season, but \\"Razor\\" was not that important to the fourth season or to the series - it was good, but not important - unlike the miniseries.Now lets talk about the episodes themselves. \\"Razor\\" (not actually part of the season) was good and so was the first two episodes as well as the last two, but every other episode was crap.

Others have commented on the content.I am incensed, however, that they have once again decided to make us pay twice for a single season by doing the silliness of breaking the season into a 4.0 and 4.5, and charging full price for each. They did this for season two, people complained, and they returned to sensibility for the season three single package.I will purchase season 4 when it is complete, and for a price that is fair for one season, not two.

They did it once before. Fine. But I just opened my package and found the Razon disc inside. I got Razor a year ago when it came out and was totally hyped. There was no reason at all they needed to include it in this package. This is a crock.Blah blah blah, the show is still good, but the story is getting a little hokey.

However the writing style is very poor. Almost the exact same thoughts from the main character are repeated over and over again from one chapter to the next. By the middle of the book I realized I could skip the last several paragraphs of each chapter because they were all repeats. This book appears to have been written by a high school student without passing through an editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"An improvement over his first book","review":"If nothing else, the slimmer page-count in this volume made it a much quicker read than his previous book \\"The Soccer Field Is Empty.\\" The dialogue was still more than a little stilted, and some of the amazing deus ex machinas lead me to roll my eyes.As with his pervious novel, Mr. Roeder clearly has a great deal of affection for his characters and the idealized world they inhabit. But with any author attempting to publish his own work, the affection can be a bit of detriment.With that said, I do admire Mr. Roeder's chutzpah evidence in creating this world and sticking with it.Decent book for the beach or an airplane, but not high art."},{"rating":"1","title":"High school creative writing 101","review":"While I won't say this book is terrible, I kept wondering if this was a high school creative writing class project. The plot is good. The characters are stick figures. The writing is really unimaginative and not very exciting either. As a quick read on the beach, it wasn't terrible, just not great. Could have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-publishing at its most mediocre","review":"With the difficulties faced by writers getting their work published, many have turned to self-publishing, and Mark Roeder seems to be one of those authors. But the merits of getting a book published by even a small press is an editor, something Roeder sorely needs. Typos, run-on sentences and stilted grammer make this problematic.He also doesn't seem to have a grasp on wrestling, a sport that's much, much better covered in the utterly fantastic PINS, where the author describes that world much better. PINS is also a literary book, but \\"Someone\\" doesn't go very deep, and while covering a topic very popular - teen jocks - it just doesn't carry it off. The author would do well to spend a few bucks having a qualified editor go through his next manuscript before sending it off to IUniverse."},{"rating":"2","title":"another super book","review":"I can honestly say this is one of my favorite books. The book has multiple story lines and none of them leaves you bored. I thought the story was gripping all the way through. I felt what the main character was feeling whether it was scared, angry or happy.I also liked the co-characters of Jon, Nathan, Taylor, and Mark.This is a book that should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Central Missouri Perspective","review":"This was an excellent read! I wish it had been longer, and hope there is a sequel to this book with Ethan and Nathan. Except for some typographical errors, which escaped the editors, this book read smoothly from cover to cover. The fear of coming out was addressed eloquently and accurately. The reaction to Ethan's coming out, in some cases, was less than realistic. And the book was more about the coming out and falling in love than it was about the \\"Someone is Watching\\". Actually, the title is a bit deceiving. If the book doesn't sound interesting by it's title, read it anyway! The story is sweet, touching and speaks a lot to the issue of unconditional love, compassion for others and loyalty...in the face of losing everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I skipped a lot of pages of tedious repetition and implausible story line. I wanted to like the character and see how the story resolves but remained disapponted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy cover Equals Fun","review":"I bought this as a gift for a friend and she loved it. She's keeping reading journals as she reads them. It's so fun to watch her fangirl over random moments. She loved Ethan and Nathan to bits.

When I tried it on my skin it doesn't feel comforting or make my skin feel better. I can't say it irritates my skin but it makes it feel sensitive. Some lotions that are not necessarily fragrance free but do well for me are Palmers Cocoa butter lotion, the Cocoa lotion at Bath and Body Works, and the Blue Spa body cream at Bath and Body works. I like the faint fragrance all of these lotions have and they don't irritate my sensitive skin or bother my allergy prone nose. If you are not fussy about lotions I guess it would be OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old-fashioned brass, dead room","review":"The interpretation here is great, Mr. Dorati is a fabulous conductor and the interpretations on all of the pieces are dynamite. The sound quality is good (its a mercury living presence release), though I must say it sounds like they recorded in a dead studio room. Also, the brass playing is very loud and blasting, without very good tone quality or any taste.

Within just the first few chapters, I could tell that I had made a mistake. First of all, I did not see the imaginative writing and illustrating I was promised. Instead I found amateur artwork, design, and story development. I abruptly read about a young boy left at home at night while his father worked because his mother had left them (unsettling for young listeners). And once Jim starts hearing and seeing \\"monsters,\\" that was it. My youngest two children (who have listened to many pages of Harry Potter) were too scared to continue and didn't even want the book in their rooms. This was not what I expected from the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Not the Freestyle I grew up on!","review":"I have never heard this music back in the 80s when Freestyle was popular.I am very curious as to why this is called Freestyle.Maybe someone can come and add info to help.The names who made it seem to be from the right culture though.Have a good day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Past and present majesty","review":"This cd is like the fantasy concert for all of us who love sopranos. Some we can still hear either in recital or on the opera stage but others have either retired or passed on and this is what is left for us to dream about hearing live. Marilyn Horne's sheer power, artistry, and vocal beauty make the hair on the back of my neck stand on end every time I listen to Cruda sorte! Zinka Milanov makes every note of Suicidio! register beautifully on your ear and heavily on your heart all at the same time. Leontyne Price's version of Vissi d'arte is second in my book only to Callas, who oddly is not on this cd. Every woman on this cd makes the music not only vocally wonderful but also emotionally telling as well. There is no need to speak the language in which they are singing to know what they are saying. They are all truly divas of the highest level."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gorgeous collection!","review":"I heard this CD playing in a music store and immediately bought it. If you are searching for a collection of the finest arias sung by the finest female singers in the world, this is it. My only complaint is that they did not include Maria Callas or Jessye Norman on the recording. If they do not qualify as divas, then who does? All in all, a fabulous album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking!","review":"I don't know much about the technicalities of opera, but I love the art completely. This is one of the best opera collections I've ever heard. The \\"Queen of the Night's Revenge Aria\\" is still one of the most beautiful songs ever, and Sumi Jo performs it incredibly well. Bartoli, Horne, Price, von Stade, and Flagstad are some of the greatest Divas ever, and this album proves it. Perhaps the only thing that could make this CD any better would be something sung by Callas, but it is awesome and wonderful without her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nearly perfect collection","review":"A terrific CD for any new operafan wishing to sample the best that opera divas have produced, or - if you're like me - a great way to listen to an assortment when you're not in the mood for an entire CD's worth of one voice or one composer. I rate it \\"nearly\\" perfect not because the selection is any less than wonderful, but for its omissions. Where is Callas? And Moffo? And, for that matter, where are Norman, de los Angeles, and Popp? I hope their absence from this collection means that a volume two may come along where they and other magnificent singers are done justice as the full-fledged divas they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT purchase this book.","review":"I'm a teacher in Bucks County, PA.

Mcoy Tyner assembled a tremedous lineup of latin musicians to create a masterpiece. Avery Sharpe's bass lines especially on Walk Spirit Talk Spirit are hard driving and perfectly compliment Tyners extended piano runs. The horns and percussion are all top notch and Bobby Hutcherson's vibes playing is always a treat.I recently had the chance to see Mccoy Tyner perform in NY and the group he had assembled for the evening included Ravi Coltrane , Pharoah Sanders, Charnet Moffett and Eric Harland. These guys were incredivble but the highlight of a superb set was Walk Spirit Talk Spirit from this CD. Moffet played the bassline in the same manner as Sharpe does here and the groove was unforgettable. I left the club and immediately picked up this CD.

The film remains effective as a horror vehicle, but does not have the same impact as the original or the 1979 Klaus Kinski version. The price of this version is attractive, but proves the old proverb \\"You get what you pay for.\\" If you like \\"Type O Negative\\", you'll enjoy this video. If not, spend a bit more and pick one of the other versions. Better yet, try BOTH of the other versions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible version of a great film","review":"The film quality was really bad. The music was innapropriate and overbearing. Silent films relie heavily on the musical accompaniment, and this score ruined this truly fine film. This version was obviously made for the promotion of a heavy metal band, and they seemed to have randomly exploited the film as a backdrop. We had to turn down, then off, the sound. I kept turning it back up to see if it improved or fit the film better. Unfortunately it did not. Ruined the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY OH WHY?","review":"I was quite excited to finally purchase this movie. When I saw it had a new soundtrack, I said what the hey!

The box was quite confusing as to whether it would have both versions. The soundtrack itself is good if you are on an acid trip, but other than that, it stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is one of my all time favorite movies. Type O Negative is one of my favorite bands. But the way this combo was put together is an absolute train wreck. There was so much potential in putting the music of Type O Negative to this movie, but it was horribly done. It's as if no thought went into the production at all. They just ran the movie and randomly picked out bits and pieces of songs and stuck them in anywhere with no thought whatsoever. Avoid this version and stick with the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm no \\"purist\\" but . . .","review":"Okay, my third try, here's the censored version: This was a terrible idea.

Placing Type O Negative over the soundtrack to a 1930's black and white silent film is like trying to watch \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" overdubbed with \\"The Monster Mash\\". Utterly awful.

I always wanted to see the Nosferatu movie, but once I heard the original music when I finally caught the movie on TV, I couldn't stomach watching because the music was so distracting. On a lark, I got this DVD because the soundtrack was new, and lo-n-behold, I loved it. The music was a wonderful, delightful enhancement that (as far as I am concerned) made the movie more than just watch-able, but thoroughly enjoyable.The music was set to the mood of the scenes, making emotion tangible and helping draw you into the plot of this wonderful classic.All in all, it's one of my favorite DVD's now and I watch it periodically just for the joy of it.If you have any doubts, rent it first, then buy it if you like it. I wouldn't want my collection to be without it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"RIP Peter Steele, Max Schreck, and David Carradine!","review":"One of the best vampire films, made all the more haunting due to its silent nature: F.W. Murnau was a true pioneer of his time. I have this DVD version with Type O Negative performing the soundtrack (as well as the video from their song \\"Black No.1\\") & David Carradine providing a pretty cool Introduction. While I have seen both the completely silent & soundtracked versions of the film, I prefer the latter. The music was selected well, though odd in certain places, and adds nostalgia and drama into the mostly visual performance. Given the silent nature of the film and the slower pace, this movie is not for everyone (especially those who like the \\"sexy charismatic vampire\\" ideal), but it is a great piece of vampire cinema history nonetheless and my personal preference. TON's music adds an additional layer of Creepy!RIP Peter Steele, Max Schreck, and David Carradine.

This \\"Pop Box\\" is really just an assortment of less-than-authentic looking reproductions of Warhol's personal correspondence & various other flashy gewgaws, all of whose novelty wears thin within seconds after viewing them. Maybe on an artistic level this collection might have worked if the publisher had made more of an effort in trying to make the contents look authentic rather than just settling for the cheesy looking knock-offs that we were presented with. On the other hand I do think this collection would make a nice introduction for youngsters (maybe combined with Lou Reed & John Cale's excellent Warhol tribute CD \\"Songs for Drella\\") who are just starting to learn about Andy Warhol and Pop Art, but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late Career Excellance","review":"Bob Cooper and Bud Shank had been friends and the music industry's equivalent of fraternity brothers for about 45 years when this album was conceived at the North Sea Jazz Fesitval just before Coop's death in 1993.

Swingin', solid blowin' followed by sensitive ballad treatments. This album was a pleasant surprise to me coming out long after Coop's death. Didn't even know it was in the can. And what a wonderful closing memory I now have of my uncle's mark on the world.

The Netherlands Metropole Orchestra is a fairly large group, with a full contingent of strings along with lots of horns, yet the arrangements are limber and airy enough to allow the group to swing. They are also very inventive and imaginative. Shank plays on half the tunes, Coop on the other half, and they are as hip as they've ever been. I found this CD to be a most attractive item.

Which portrayer of events and which writer, Lambert? Which business person or publisher? It is intriguing that so much effort was put into this book. Who protests too much? For whose benefit?Perhaps Lambert should take on someone else to test her ability with analysis, meaningful and meticulous detail.

So, in my opinion it is one of the best that I own. As many people have said in their reviews, it is good music. It is the kind that you can't label.

Just buy a couple Maglite brand plastic lenses for when they get scratched up.And obviously don't buy this glass lens if you are a peace officer or security gaurd; a crack messes up the light beam, which could risk your safety.Amazon should stop carrying this glass lens, with all the one star reviews on cracking. If your's cracked too just add another brief one star review. Maybe they eventually get flagged and read by Amazon, if enough one-stars are posted.The Maglite AA glass lenses that Amazon is selling are probably less prone to cracking since they are much smaller, but it may be the same cheap glass. I bought one of those for my AA Mini Maglite and it hasn't broken.

There's also some incredible photography to look at, many of which haven't been seen before. You get a semi-decent idea of what's going on on stage, anyway.

All the songs are mashed together to make one long song for instance, track number 4 is like 15 minutes but it is 3 seperate songs together kind of like a tape I guess. I dont know but it makes it harder to scroll from track to track thats for sure. I would say about 3 of the songs on this album are tight, but the best track on the album is \\"Emcees Come, And Emcees Go\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"ick","review":"I listened to Dr. Oz and I put it in some seltzer water and sweetner and it was absolutely awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"no more","review":"No taste; does not do anything for me.

There was no explanation of how a computer virus might \\"upload\\" itself into humans, which made this really hard to believe. While there was plenty of action (indeed, the whole book was essentially one big fire fight), I could've used at least a little thought, interesting ideas, or something else.

This story was about a Doctor falling in love at first sight. Derek was the doctor, but this book didn't go into anything special about him. The story was ok, but because I wanted more character development about Derek and didn't get it, I rated it lower. This is a short story, only 93 pages long. Sexual language: mild.

Even with all the ingredients I add, this soup only takes about 5 minutes to prepare. This soup mix is mostly Cayenne pepper which is really good for you. I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned this is good for a cold. It really cleans out your nasal passages. The only downside is the soup mix contains MSG. I have given these noodles to friends.

But, then after a few listens, I started to realize that this is a deliciously subtle album. It doesn't jump right out and grab me the way Shack Man did, I found you've got to put some effort into following the music, especially Medeski's always-brilliant keyboards. But it's rewarding work, because this is tasty stuff! I'd recommend this album as a nice doorway to jazz for all groove-music fans; if you find yourself focusing on the vibe when you're listening to Dave Matthews or 5000 Deep, then you'll dig MMW- 100% groove&vibe, no vocals and very little melody to get in the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and funky masterpiece","review":"MMW groove hard on this, their best recording to date. Every song compels you. The slithering groove of Just Like I Pictured It. The folding and explosive unfolding of Start/Stop (I've even grown to love the wacky turntablism at the end), the supercharged romp on Hey Hee Hi Ho. I played this disc over and over for weeks and it never disappointed. Medeski has an incredible sound, meticulously (yet spontaneously) wrought with vintage boards and amps at Shacklyn. Nobody sounds like him. A complete original."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fair album, but not representative of MMW potential","review":"MMW are some of the best bands producing music today.

I listen to this album and all I hear is a groove without any music. In this album the set up the same undulating grooves that they have in their past albums, but they don't go anywhere with them. John Medeski is one of the most talented pianist I have ever heard, yet any mediocre keyboardist could play most of the stuff on this album. I'll admit that I'm being a little harsh when I only give them one star, but when I know what this excellent band is capable of, they deserve no more.

Going to resell this soon. No matter how many listens, I am unimpressed.I like music, meaning chord structures that permit melody, sensible counterpoint, and harmonies however abstract...but this effort is generally lacking. To me its a little like Pat Metheny's \\"The Way Up\\" (which I own and listen to very occasionally)...someone might appreciate it for what it tries to do (stretch the concepts of music and jazz) and for the occasional tunefulness, but its not a \\"must listen\\".I wonder if Martin, Medeski or Wood have any Frank Zappa albums.

White's \\"One Man's Meat\\" and Max Alexander's \\"Man Bites Log\\". The prime difference lies in the time frame: Mr. White writing from a pre and WWII time frame and Mr. Alexander from a turn of the century (21st). Having shared the same back roads and shopping experiences with Alexander, I find his thoughts on the contrasts of urban and rural lifestyles to be honest and witty to say the least. Maine is \\"The Way Life Should Be\\" and to those of us who make this state our home, it is the way life is. Alexander captures the heartiness and joy of this lifestyle in his collection of essays. What E.B. White gave to our fathers and mothers, Max Alexander deals up fresh for a new generation that holds close to the values of former times. Thank you Max, for a work well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Max Alexander has a way with words - no mistake about that. Humorous, yet thoughtful, this book will touch every reader. Max's journey from the chaotic world of the big city, work pressures, and heavy traffic to farm life in backwoods Maine has a Garrison Keillor flavor as he describes his real-life characters and scenes in his life. I laughed out loud as he described his experience with guinea hens and his introduction to maple syrup production. This book an endearing, thought provoking, and just plain fun read. I look forward to Alexander's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Of Class Mill","review":"I've been using Vic Firth mills for years now and rate them the best of the nation if not global.

I got the pepper and salt mill and they both have it. It is beyond tacky. I should return these it's so hideous. Also, the carved signature is a different size on the salt mill. Why'd they do it? Other than that, this mill is of the highest quality and made in the USA. I'm keeping it for that but I had to wrap black electrical tape around it to hide this garish detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational!","review":"I read this book back in 1981. It is truly a work of art. Mary beautifully describes the relationships between the chemists, physists, scientists, and engineers who where members of a small group of people searching for the elements that make up everything around us. I found it amazing that they knew each other even though they were spread out all over the globe, and they were friends.After reading this book I knew I wanted to be a member of this group too. It inspired me to get a BS in nuclear engineering."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT! IT'S A TRICK!","review":"Like several people before me said, it has typos and unreadable screenshots. But that's not the worst. Sure, you get some CDs with the book but don't think they are a distribution. They are an incomplete, butchered distribution for which the installation software was NOT modified and getting anything done - like installing - with this big piece of *&#$ is next to impossible. Maybe a Linux 'expert' could piece it back together but not a newbie or somebody learning. They call it an 'evaluation version' but it doesn't give you a chance to evaluate it.The only way this book might be of use is if: a) you ALREADY have SuSE, and b) it has particular info you want. Since it commonly seems to take you to the edge of complete info and not get you there I would say there are probably better books to be had.

He has written an excellent, if not exhausive, history of international broadcasting through the end of the second world war, with an emphasis on American stations. (The are several volumes about Nazi propaganda broadcasts you could also consider).If you only read one book on the hitory of radio, it should be Empire of the Air. But if you read two, or have a special interest in shortwave (as I do) this is a good choice.

They are sung by such professional ensembles as the Poznan Men and Boys Choir, a Choral group from Krakow, and the famous Polish National Folk Song and Dance Ensemble \\"Mazowsze\\". All of these professional ensembles are well known in the Polish communities in the US and both have performed here many times. The carols are sung in both beautiful indoor and outdoor settings which gives an authentic air. The folk costumes from Mazowsze are dazzling as usual.The only setback to this video is that a couple of carols are repeated although sung by different ensembles. Nevertheless, it is still worth purchasing the video. I would strongly recommend this video for persons not of Polish descent as an excellent gift idea to give to your Polish friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"I enjoy car camping with my tent.

He takes such a simple activity of playing a board game and uses his extraordinary and creative imagination to turn it into an adventurous path through a jungle. This book is well written, for it is simple and short in length and each sentence does not go wasted. The illustrations defnitely capture your imagination because the drawings are so intense and magical. I also adore the creative spot where Van Allsburg includes his signature trademark. For all of the collectors of Chris Van Allsburg's literature this book is a must have, for it follows suite of his original and mystical stories. And to be honest, I wouldn't dare see the Jumanji movie, I couldn't see how any movie could do justice to this fantasy story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most comfortable Hands free I have found","review":"This is try number four to get a hands free set that I can put on while driving and not kill myself. The first three attempts were all ones that had an extended microphone. They were either impossible to get on properly without a lot of hassle or were designed by professionals in the art of ear torture.I have found this model to be very simple to put on and the quality of the sound I receive is excellent. I have asked those that I call how they are hearing me and they say that they can not tell I am on a hands free set. There is very little background noise and the quality is good.My only complaint is that the mute button on it is fragile and has fallen apart.

A great arranger and a fine leader made some exquisite music. On this collection, on a few selections, they do just that.But there are many tame vocals on here, softer sounding songs with a non-descript vocalist who inspires little admiration. There's a reason you don't (or at least I don't) know Kenny Sargent (and some of the other vocalists listed in the notes but not identified with their performaces): they aren't very good. They range from blah to downright dreadful: The Fable of the Rose and Would'st I but Kiss Thy Hand, Oh Babe, two songs that go so wrong you wonder how a good arranger could listen and feel pleased.Well, tastes change, and what sounded cool in the Thirties sometimes sounds awful. If these ever sounded good, they no longer do.Some good swing, when the singers stay away, but even at a budget price, this leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope it will get better with Jill and Kelly gone!","review":"I am very happy that MEMEMEJILL is gone..her insecurity was borderline sociopath.

For example, you might not find that specific sponge at the store to know if it is photosynthetic or not, but you can read about sponges of all types in detail and understand whether or not you should try sponges yet.There is a nice section on refugiums if you are getting interested, that is more complete than any other book I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute excellence","review":"I have an extensive library of reef aquarium books, including all Sprung & Delbeek series.

It is sad that only a few volumes are in print that zero in on the topic. \\"The Year They Burned the Books\\" is one of the best. I only wish the author had done more to develop the antagonists. As vile as Nancy Garden painted them, the reality of people like that is much worse. Our young people are mature enough to know that not all adults will defend their rights to think and read. Any child who has searched a school library in vain for a book they really needed to read knows this. Even in major cities like New York, even in enlightened schools, libraries do not stock books on their shelves that address every student's need. The solution that the young people in this book created for themselves should be an inspiration for students in every school. This is one book which should be available for any student who wants to stand up for his or her right to have ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"reader from new york","review":"This was a very controversial book. My teacher lent it to me because I was doing a project on censorship and this book was about censorship. I have read other books by Garden, and this one definitely lived up to my standards. I think that Jamie had tremendous courage to do everything that she did, and she could be used as a role model for many people. For people who want to know what the book was about, I'll tell you. When Jamie wrote an editorial on condoms for her school newspaper, it started off a chain of controversial events. The woman running for the board of education was against everything Jamie stood for. This book was very good.

It's okay for one watch at least, but don't expect the same caliber of Riverdance or Lord of the Dance. I think it was probably the \\"budget\\" look and the lighting but what really irked me was this: when I go to see an irish dance show, I go to see the dancers, NOT the musicians. To me, they showed too much of the musicians during the dance routines. The dancers would be dancing and the camera would show close ups of the musicians while you're missing out on the dancing action. They had some numbers that focused on the musicians only so I didn't see the need to show them profusely throughout the dancing numbers. All in all it was ok but not the best I've ever seen.

No more. I've had these for about three months, and they've been great. The bottom line here is that these are convenient, well-made, well-constructed, and reasonably priced.Technically, these are kitchen-utility shears rather than poultry shears, but the solid construction (no gap between the blades, smooth operation), bone notch and easy disassemblage make them a good choice for butterflying a chicken. There are a few other tools: a bottle opener (never hurts), nut cracker/ jar opener (works fine for the former, too small for the latter) and screw drivers at the ends of the handles (bafflingly useless).The size of the handles is fine for me - not perfect, though - but overall, as shears, these are a really solid buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, comes apart quick and easy for cleaning","review":"Everything about it is great!

The whole thing is very heavy duty and feels of quality and durability. If you open it up all the way, it unhinges very easily for ease of cleaning. When you put it back together, it's solid again. It's very easy to do and does not sacrifice sturdiness. These are all purpose kitchen shears and I can't think of any improvements.

It's just my husband and I at home now, so we need small packages of meat which are more expensive. Rather than buy expensive beef cubes, I buy a roast and cut it up myself. These shears make easy work of cutting off the excess fat and cutting the roast into cubes. Rather than buy chicken parts at over $2 per pound, we buy whole chicken at under $1 per pound and use these shears to cut it up. The shears cut through bone as easily as muscle.

FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!","review":"I found this product and thought that it was a new documentary movie on the band Evanescence since they released a new album last year and the title and description made it sound like it was a new documentary about the band, but I was sadly mistaken because when the movie arrived at my house I put it right into the DVD player I found out that the documentary was just an old documentary called After Midnight which came out about 6 years ago I believe and they are just trying to sell it in a new package, and a new title, but with no new information in the DVD at all. Do not stop liking Evanescence, or their label, or anything associated with either of those two things because of this though because it says right on the DVD that Evanescence and their label have nothing to do with the making of this DVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product labled wrong","review":"Advertised prodict was \\"Farmer's Friend Hand Salve\\".

For perhaps $200 it might be worth the money, but for nearly double that it's ridiculous! It has an old grayscale LCD display that is very dim, it has no rechargeable lithium battery and no USB computer connection. It appears to be aimed at Chinese speakers to translate into English, not vice versa. All the function keys and on-screen icons are Chinese characters only. The English version instruction manual is incomplete and would benefit from some decent translation itself!

While his future partner Bill Finnegan was busy writing top arrangements for the Glenn Miller orchestra Eddie was paving the way for experimental big band music. The arrangements showcase Goodman in a way Fletcher Henderson never did. Benny is really out there blowing up a storm especially on tunes such as \\"Benny Rides Again\\" and the incredible \\"Clarinet A La King\\". Artie may have had a bit more heart but Benny was \\"the\\" instrumental clarinet virtuoso. Eddie's arrangements of even the lighter pop material stand head and shoulders above their hit parade versions. With every repeated listening you can find subtleties not heard the first few go rounds. The version of \\"The Man I Love\\" sung by Helen Forrest is amazing. If you love big band jazz with an experimental flair this is a cd for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arty porn","review":"Twelve short stories or other \\"items\\"--all of a gay male pornographic nature--which apparently appeared previously in hard-core magazines.

I am a direct decendent of one of Maraduke Van Swearingen's brothers. According to this legend, Duke Swearingen and Blue Jacket were the same person. This so called legend is worse than fiction. It is a complete lie because it is about real people. Chief Blue Jacket was not a white man kidnapped as a teenager, as this story goes. Our family records show he was born in a different decade than Blue Jacket and, as far as we know, never lived with the Indians or became a chief. The true history about the Shawnee chief has been messed with by 19th century pulp fiction writers and purpetuated by 20th and 21st century psudo historians.

Firstly, the music and its interpretation are fine: I would rate these as at least 4 stars. However, the downloads have severe problems when the tracks change, a problem that I thought had disappeared: The tracks in Jeu De Cartes are meant to be played without break: The engineers have made a mess of the track transitions. Some are fine without any corrections. Some require about 0.4 second crossfades to smooth out the errors. But some require as much as 2 seconds, which, because of the length of the crossfade, results in sounds as if something is missing: the notes don't quite fit, and neither does the tempo.I would recommend that until this problem is resolved, you refrain from the download and go with the CD.Incidentally, the problem is quite apparent with iTunes, Windows Media Player, Nero player, and the Roxio player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zorn: not a classical composer","review":"Not a bad record. Far from. Simply not the best Zorn record to be found. Great admiration for the man with the thousand ideas but not a fan of his \\"written\\" music. Prefer Zorn with other projects: Masada, Naked City and his Film Work collection, in which his talent of chosing performers for his music, imposing his ideas on them and still giving them the freedom to make music that is unmistably John Zorn, are resulting in breathtaking releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a Big Deal when the Poles \\"invade\\" Chicago!","review":"Although the movie is in Polish, with English subtitles which are occasionally misspelled or mistranslated, it is very funny. It is an excellent subtle satire on communism as seen through Polish eyes, disguised as the misgivings of the intrepid heroes concerning capitalism and race relations as they journey to visit an expatriate in the big city of Chicago.Very funny and interesting scenes back home in their village and aboard a cruise ship as they venture to America. A dissertation on the evils of capitalism as pronounced by the official communist line while aboard an airliner headed to Chicago was priceless!Some (relatively) shocking scenes of racial prejudice by one of the travelers belay the official all men are equal communist view, as racism exists even in communist countries, if only unofficially. Not to worry, his prejudices are thoroughly trashed by movie's end. Very funny in the interim, however!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling to read but you can't put it down.","review":"It is truly chilling to get to know the minds behind the monsters that are portrayed in this book. To think that these people thought they would walk away and profit from such vicious acts just blows your mind. For me, this book was hard to read because the writing was so realistic. The authour goes to great lengths to re-enact the grim crime and the following pursuit in a way that brings the reader into the action. I have always loved a great cop story and this one now tops my list. These detectives really showed tenacity, creativity and dedication to solving this crime. I join the author in celebrating a job well done by the detectives. If you enjoy the ride of a true chase, you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treat for the discriminating true-crime afficionado","review":"This book is a real find in the true crime genre. Having never heard of Kraig Hanadel,I wasn't expecting much,but was surprised. His treatment of this true crime story is masterful,and excellently written, quite unlike some of the pulp-type paperbacks that are cranked out. Reading much like a detective, or mystery novel, it's all the more fascinating because the story is true. I searched for more books of the same type by Mr. Hanadel, but alas,no luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, overly dramatic and unfairly biased.","review":"This book was poorly written to say the least, overly dramatic and appeared to contain a number of inconsistencies. I query whether the only reason the cops were involved it is for their own personal gain and extra money that they probably couldn't make on a cop's salary. It is also rather unfair and puzzling about the intense focus in this book on Monica the girlfriend and her father?? Why is this writer so biased against them when they did nothing wrong but support a person they apparently (and incorrectly) thought was innocent? In fact, they seemed to be duped by Dana like everyone else. As the girlfriend, Monica seems to have been just another victim of this sociopathic liar who is now behind bars."},{"rating":"1","title":"detectives were vain not thorough","review":"The book lacked authenticity from start to finish. Important facts that contradicted the story were simply ignored and left out. The detectives involved come off as totally vain and angry, envious people, looking to find a high profile case like the Billionaire Boys Club or Menendez brothers murder cases. What these detectives were looking for was their own personal glory. How sick is that."},{"rating":"1","title":"naive people like me beware!","review":"This book is a very good book. When I read it, I thought it was the best one I had read on Buddhism and I decided to take a 10 days course. The experience was challenging but the big disappointment came afterwards when I applied for a second course and was told that hypnotherapists were prohibited by Goenka to take more than one course. I would have to give up my profession as well as my Zen meditation practice to carry on. In other words, there is a big discrepancy between what is written here and what is really practiced. I now think that this Vipassana group is just a cult around the person of Goenka, his prejudices and his hypnotic chanting, which has in fact little relevance to the teaching of the Buddha. Real Vipassana meditation described in the sutra is not hypnotic at all and much more complicated than the all body sweeping meditation, with eyes closed in a dark room which is presented as the only authentic practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendously inspiring...","review":"We are very fortunate that this classic introduction to vipassana meditation is now available as an audio book.The author, William Hart, gives a clear and insightful presentation of this technique, focusing on a typical 10 day course as given by S.N. Goenka.This audio book is very helpful to anyone who wants to learn both about this technique and, more importantly, about themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I found this book to be content-poor. There are better introductions to Buddhism, and certainly better books for the inexperienced practitioner. It is possible that if I was a student in Goenka's lineage, I would have gotten more out of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"no","review":"imho the intense focus on physical sensations, excluding observation of feeling states, thought, externals, makes this method unbalanced. creates freak-outs in many who attend the 10day 'course.' the stated goal of equanimity seems not actual goal. didn't need my body to 'disappear.' technique seems mired in cultivating bliss-states (as opposed to clarity) while claiming contrary. confusing and confused. looked great on the surface. beneath surface theory and methodology revealed is rigid, doctrinaire--counter to it's own claims and counter to true dharma. cultish. keep looking. I also want to add, (November 18, 2010) that a lot of the glowing reviews here are written by the 'true believers' and repeat retreat attendees and supporters. That's fine.

(from a person who attended the 10 day as well, has over 12 years of martial arts, taoist and buddhist meditation technique)find a good teacher, not a book, nor a 10-day given by a video tape with inept teachers...SN Goenka has a biased, single-minded view. Never knew dhamma was biased. Didn't Buddha say 10,000 paths to enlightement, and not one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This method is a disaster and very dangerous","review":"This book is but a sell on a 10 day intensive meditation marathon. I did my retreat a couple of years ago after reading the book. What a disaster that was ! People hallucinating around me, crying, some had to go to the HOSPITAL with depersonalization problems and receive psychiatric treatment. The organization was not ready to help and kicked out the very people needing their support while trying to keep it a secret from the other participants.Avoid it at all costs, Goenka is a dogmatic guru with no true knowledge. This method is based on a competitive philosophy and is the opposite of the relaxed approach that produces real and lasting results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really about meditation per se, but very good.","review":"If you're looking for a book on \\"how to meditate\\" you should look elsewhere. This book is not about Vipassana meditation technique, it's more about the philosophy that underlies it. So the title may mislead, depending on what you're looking for. However, having said that I found the discussions that are contained in the book to be extremely good and very useful from the point of view of Vipassana as an approach to life in general. So if you think of LIFE as an extended meditation, then perhaps the book really is about Vipassana meditation. Anyway, as long as you're not expecting a book on meditation technique, I highly recommend this one. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go - Enka!","review":"Goenka Rocks!If you haven't yet, go take a 10 - day course. Don't read about it, just go.

So I settled for this one. That was a big mistake. The wheels on this stand are only about 8 inches apart which makes your CPU very unstable. The spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the CPU. It is really a two person operation. Finally, if your CPU has a side access panel, you will have to remove it from the stand to gain access since the stand uses a pressure fit to hold it to the computer. Take a look at the 3M CS100 stand. I think it is a much better design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied With Purchase","review":"I was very pleased with the quality of this purchase.

Unfortunately, as soon as it is applied, it smelled most like, uh, a Bradford Pear tree in blossom, and doesn't fully go away. Maybe the odor is due to mixing witch hazel with one of the other ingredients, I don't know.I'd like to find a healthy deodorant, without aluminum and such in it, and that doesn't have a strong odor. I was hoping I had found it with this product, even though it is more expensive than average.

He left the heroine when she was pregnant with his child, got angry with her because she wouldn't have an abortion, angry with her when she wouldn't give her son up for adoption, fell in love with and married another woman, had a child with her and then after his wife died decided maybe the woman he'd dropped might look pretty good after all. He let everyone in their hometown call their son a bastard, never once in 18 years admitting to being his father(although since they both lived in another city he did have a relationship with his son and did pay child support) So, after all that he pretty much expected Kate, the heroine to be grateful that he decided it was \\"the right time\\" for them to be together. Personally, if I was Kate, I'd have jumped on Nicholas(the good looking boss)and told Max to hit the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost interest....","review":"I couldn't stand Max and the way he wanted to be accepted amd forgiven after all of the disasters he caused. I don't like how the heroine just seemed to forget all the years that she had to scrape by, all the insults she'd endured, and not to mention raising a boy all alone. As a mother and wife, my reaction to all that was annoyance because I sure as well wouldn't have given him a second chance (if I was her) and I sure wouldn't have forced my son to pursue a relationship with his father if he was anything like Max.

I use the cookie recipe provided on the box, roll a bit of dough into a log, fill the tube, and do one click per cookie. One tube-full is about 2.5 dozen cookies, ish (about one cookie-sheet full--yes, the cookies are of dainty size). Ten minutes in the oven and you're done! The first cookie per tube-full is weird-shaped (okay, for the cook!) but the others do well.

Guess $10 doesn't buy much these days. :o("},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last","review":"Well, I tried this other Wilton cookie press becuase the stainless steel one wore down. The comfort grip handle was great! The only problem is that the plastic collar split in the middle after the 4th batch. The dough started oozing out and I ended up having to get rid of it. I'm still searching for a press that won't break - I go through one every year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Set-up for dissapointment","review":"I agree with the comments about the cheap design. I was baking cookies with my daughters and after the second sheet of cookies the collar on the bottom snapped right off. This was my 3rd time using this press and I've used others in the past so I know I wasn't doing anything wrong - it's just a poor design. The collar should be made of metal to prevent this from happening. It was quite a disapointment for my girls after all of that measuring and mixing (for a double batch) to have it break when we'd just gotten started.

This cookie press made about a dozen cookies and then the trigger just wouldn't work any longer. The trigger has to catch on a notch on the plunger to press the next cookie out. After a few cookies the trigger skipped a bit catching the plunger and then after about a dozen it quit working altogether. It was a total waste of money. Ended up making thumbprint cookies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after using it once.","review":"This cookie press was easy to use and the first couple of cookies were good, but after the 12th cookie, the plastic ring collar broke. Now I can't use it at all. We used to use the old Pampered Chef cookie press and that broke too. Now, I am bound and determined to only use the new Pampered Chef Cookie press. It was a gift, but I thought it was harder to use, because you have to twist it each time, but at least it works and keeps working for hundreds and hundreds of cookie. Unlike this one. Amazon gave me my money back on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long","review":"This product worked beautifully while it lasted. I've had it for three years and usually only use it twice a year.

On the Wilton website they have many other recipes to use with the cookie press besides the 2 that come on the box. My favorite are the cheese crackers and the chocolate cookies. I get rave reviews for both. I have had my press for some time now and have used it many times with no issues like breaking of cracking. You do want to be sure to not twist the parts together too tightly as I imagine that could cause undo strain on the plastic parts. Nice that it come with so many designs especially the holiday ones like the tree, pumpkin and heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Don't waste your money on this cookie press...I may have used it all of 5 times and the plastic split at the top and bottom.

After using Wilton cake pans for years with no problem, I expected better quality from their cookie presses. I ordered one recently, and the very first time we used it, the trigger would not work to squeeze out the dough.

To say that his voice was remarkable is equally an understatement. There isn't much you can say about this man that lives up to the truth of his life and this recording is a good example. I've read reviews about this recording, saying that the acting is old-fashioned and out of date. Particularly in light of some of the more recent original pronunciation recordings, some of the actors do sound artificial. That, however, was the acting style of the time. Paul Robeson's performance stands the test of time, in my opinion. He could easily hold his own on any stage today. And anyone who has studied acting has heard of Uta Hagen. (Strangely, there are times when her delivery sounds like no one more than Marilyn Monroe.) This is a hard-to-find recording worth listening to if only for the symphonic beauty of Robeson's voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic film","review":"THE TELEPHONE features the one and only Whoopi Goldberg front and center, essentially delivering a one-woman show (with some assistance from an owl and a goldfish) and has a genuine twist ending that you will never see coming.Vashti Blue (Goldberg) is an eccentric, out-of-work actress who depends on her phone for everything she needs. We follow her story for one crazy night of mixed personalities and hijinks, learning along the way that this woman is in fact teetering on the very edge of her sanity. Solid support is provided by Amy Wright, Elliott Gould, Severn Darden and John Heard.Goldberg herself regards this film as the worst in her career (though I'd personally put MADE IN AMERICA in that spot). She sued the filmmakers and tried her darndest to have the film pulled but to no avail. It's not as bad as she'd have you believe. This film features her in fine form and I enjoy revisiting it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone - more like off-Broadway indep. stage play.","review":"This movie is not for everyone, particularly not for those looking for Whoopi Goldberg's trademark \\"speak up to authority\\" personality and humor. The play focuses on Goldberg's character, is very serious and pretty unusal. Has the quirk of a Twilight Zone episode but with a much narrower appeal. I liked it, but I don't expect too many to. I liked it as a \\"character study\\" and for the excellent acting and the ways the play (it's a play, in my view) take you by surprise. I've been trying to get a copy since I saw it when it was first released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoopi Goldberg shows her genius","review":"This 1987 film was evidently adapted from a stage play; only one set and virtually only one actess (Goldberg), who nonetheless shows her talent as a standup comic and keeps the audience entertained and intrigued for the duration of the film by doing little else than talking on the phone. She's an out-of-work, down-on-her-luck actress desperately trying to find work before being evicted. Eventually, the phone man appears to reclaim the phone since she hasn't been paying the bills. What happens next is an ending worthy of M. Night Shamaylan's Sixth Sense.

Upon close inspection the two pieces of metal are mated using just three tiny welded dots on each side of the main squeegee. It took very little effort for those welds to fail. Considering that this product is intended to rub roughly over patios many times, this is a major design flaw. The product says if you are not satisfied then you can return it for your money back- if you gave the receipt. I bought it during the dry season to be ready for the rainy season, so I don't have the receipt any more- too bad for me. At least this review may help save you your money.

With a plastic baggie placed in the catch you can eliminate one of the the items. One last note, some have said you can place whole apples in the feed, I've not found that to be the case. I've need to cut the apples in quarters, for easy passage. Which is certainly not a problem, I've found the whole process of preparing, making and drinking the juice to be utterly refreshing.

Also, I accidentally broke my juice collector piece and ordered a new one from Breville direct, it was only $15, showed up super fast, and they didn't charge me any shipping!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much mess","review":"Too messy, for a few oz of juice, $$$ spent on the raw stuff and then there is the clean up... for a glass of fresh juice I spent $50 the first day and 30 minutes cleaning it up.... passed this prize on to my sister.

This isn't from over-stuffing or shoving food down, either. Basic, proper use makes a mess, and it has a very hard time with even the smallest pieces of carrots and beats. The blade basket is supposed to be dishwasher safe, but the dishwasher never gets it clean. It has to be hand scrubbed with the brush, and the other parts half fill the dishwasher on their own, they are so large and numerous.

When the juicer arrived it looked clean and perfect. Upon inspection it was sticky and not clean at all. It has crud stuck on the outside of the switch area and was sticky to the touch. the grinding basket had white mold on it. It definitely had not been cleaned or \\"reconditioned\\". I was so disappointed. It did come with a book and other parts but the bottom line is that it isn't reconditioned at all. Its someone Else's boxed up garage sale grab bag special. If you leave food intact in a warm climate it will grow mold, some deadly. It had white mold all over the main food processing area. I would be careful before using these used machines.

Nobody mentioned that you had to repeatedly scrape out and clean out the basket or it didn't work. I thought you just put the fruit/vegetable in and out came a lot of juice and some very dry pulp. My pulp was extremely soggy and the juice was loaded with pulp too. I used a whole peck of apples to make 4 cups of extremely thick pulpy juice - what a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breville is amazingly sloppy!","review":"We ordered the rebuilt unit and it arrived promptly. On unpacking, we were surprised to find the top plastic dome cover to have been broken in shipping. But on further inspection, found the instruction manual to be covered with dark black notes from the prior owner. And then, we discovered the original owner's product registration materials included in the box! Breville must have many returns, judging from the volume of rebuilt units they sell. And the lack of attention to their packaging and the carelessness of sending out old marked up manuals suggests they are really a very sloppy company. BTW... the unit itself seems to work nicely.

It was made as an ornament to Toho Film Co.'s 50th anniversary and, like some events with a big build-up, is a chilling anticlimax. The star-studded cast are not capable of resembling a family of any sort, and certainly not the Makioka family, as Tanizaki wrote them. His book needed a classy scenario - what it gets here is pedestrian dialogue delivered in formulaic performances. Director Kon Ichikawa's camera does not know where it wants to be in many of the interior scenes. It tries every angle on for size. Nothing can come to life, cinematically, under this aimlessness. The art direction - the story is set in 1930s Japan - is perfectly evocative of 1983, when the film was made. It is also evocative of what many recognise to be a sterile period in Japanese cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great keyboard/mouse - at a price that's not so great","review":"Excellent keyboard and even better (laser) mouse.

And I'm a programmer, so I use them a lot, everyday.The special buttons are cool. I use the sleep button everytime I walk away from my desk. I also use the calculator button, and the custom function keys for all the MS Office applications. And the scroll buttons on the left, enter key on the left, and the close-window buttons on the left are very convenient.

The drama parts are uninteresting, the \\"thrills\\" don't come until the last ten minutes and by then you've already lost all interest in the movie. The pace is sleep inducing.

I like those teen slasher movies like SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, but this one was too weird and bizarre for my tastes. It was very well photographed and sometimes well directed, but the script and actors are very lame and really don't deliver anything special.It's the story of a former mental patient, Adrien, who is sent to work at a hip country club. She is soon involved in a wicked friendship with the sexy Brittany, who sees the image of someone else in Adrien, and therefore begins to act as her loyal companion. Through investigation and patience, Adrien finds that Brittany is nothing but an evil murderress.Like I said, the weak script and lack of talent in the actors destroy this would-be-good thriller. It's often suspenseful and sometimes scary, but usually it's quite boring and overly sexual to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This movie is absolutely amazing.

I loved how the relationship was progressing, but the last 2/3 of the book were just plain and boring, filled with boring details of the uprising. After that I also started to just skim it.I guess if you like this kind of romance genre (history and fantasy combined), you will love this book. But if you like books that focus on the relationship between the characters alone then you will find that all the war and history stuff is just not as interesting. Maybe that makes me shallow, but please, I read romance novels for the, well, romance things, not for the wars and history.

Bag was warm and comfortable and WARM. I am 6'2\\" 250 lbs and had no problems using it. Found this product on Eureka's own website for much more money as well. Worked well for what we will be doing, so although it might not be for everyone, it works for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky","review":"I ordered this bag hoping it would compress easily to a size small enough to fit in my hiking pack. I was a little disappointed with the bulky size. It was also pretty heavy. I also had some problems with the zipper sticking and the thermometer was missing from the zipper. This bag never made it to a campsite- I sent it back to Amazon yesterday. I am sure it would have been a warm bag, but I spent the extra money to get an ultra lightweight bag that fits into a well-designed compression sack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted","review":"My wife got me this peppermill for Christmas. I am very pleased with it for three reasons. It has a much larger storage capacity (and wider opening) than our last mill. This means I don't have to fill it nearly as often as I used to and I don't spill nearly as many peppercorns on the countertop. There's still some hoppers, but that's my clumsy fault more than anything. Also, I really like the locking grind adjustment. You can set it from very coarse to powder fine and it doesn't budge over time. Finally, as someone who is in the solid cherry furniture making business, I appreciate the beauty of the wood. Cherry is a hallmark of quality and this peppermill is no exception. The fact that it was Made in the USA was a big added bonus for me as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"My sons and husband love Top Gear. Me, I've gotta be in the mood for it, but do find it amusing on occasion. Only problem is they're able to get the episodes free from our local library.

I ordered this and only received switch covers with no switches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product OK, Labeling Bad","review":"As the other reviewer stated the switch cover is actually plastic and not metal as the \\"anodized\\" portion of the description implies.

It looks as thought it is chrome but the connector piece is plastic and so is the body that houses the filter. This shower head is very fragile and broke twice on me. Once while adjusting the angle of the shower head the connector piece snapped in two and the second when attempting to change the filter the body of the shower head cracked. It is a shame that the durability of the product is so poor because it is an effective filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Question Quality","review":"We got two of these less than 2 years ago. Don't let the word \\"chrome\\" deceive you. The head and filter holder are plastic. During installation, I dropped the head while on the hose. It banged into the wall and cracked the filter holder in half. Thanks to superglue it is functional. I could imagine if I had tried to have my warranty honored if I said I dropped it. Secondly, I shower less then my wife. So last time I went to replace her filter noticed about 25% of hose rusted out. So it is obvious this is not stainless and the word \\"chrome\\" should change to \\"chrome looking plastic\\". I do note less spotting on the shower walls so I guess the filter works fine. Overall, zero stars for false product description. One star for delivery system. And four stars for effectiveness. I will opt for a stainless steel product next time since I do not plan to buy any more filters for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap product - Don't Buy!!!","review":"Terrible product, not only did I lose water pressure, it kept falling off its rest when you turn on the shower - every time.

Included are some of their original compositions, as well as their \\"covers\\" of various pieces of classical music, including an incredible rendition of Bach's famous Toccata in D minor played with electric guitars, harpsichord, and drums.

Its too bad, great voice at one time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it but...","review":"When I was a teenager, Puckett was my hands-down favorite singer/band. I used to say I was one of his biggest fans, memorized all his songs and could even sing a bit like him... I saw him live in 1983 and then in 1984. He was OK in those performances, not great. In this DVD, he is, well, pretty awful.I couldn't watch the whole DVD. It was painful to see a memory get distorted. I have his old CDs (I had all the old albums till recently) and it is extremely noticeable that his voice can no longer sustain the power and warmth that it once had.It's a shame. Like so many performers from the '60s and '70s who should be retiring, they're not...I'll retain the old memories for now... By the way, his Europa album was mostly good. It's been awful since then with bad Christmas and other albums all self-published.At least groups like the Moody Blues still sound good live..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gary Puckett can't sing anymore","review":"I was really looking forward to getting this DVD but the singing is so different to the original with the Union Gap. Gary needs to give up or at least try to sing the same tune as on the CD or even take up singing lessons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible-Worst ever","review":"Gary's voice does not even slightly resemble what he sounded like in the 1970's. Terrible disappointment. From his tragic mugging for the camera to the lame interview footage, it was a disaster. It was the cheesiest concert DVD I have ever experienced. Don't waste your money on this joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Gary!","review":"Some performers are able to keep our attention with their ongoing talent. Gary Puckett can't. If you enjoyed the original Gary, don't expect it with this CD. Buy the originals when he could keep up with the best. It's gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary Puckett rocks on the stage!","review":"Many people thought Gary Puckett was a flash-in-the-pan,with or without his band The Union Gap. On this DVD,you'll see Puckett with a new \\"Union Gap\\" rocking live with his six Top 20 hits WOMAN WOMAN,YOUNG GIRL,LADY WILLPOWER,DON'T GIVE IN TO HIM,OVER YOU,THIS GIRL IS A WOMAN NOW and others. GP&TUG put out five Columbia Records albums between 1967 and '70,including GARY PUCKETT & THE UNION GAP'S GREATEST HITS(the '70 release) which features one or two original tracks. Then,Puckett went solo and also re-recorded the band's hits several times which were identical to the original recordings. Anyway,if you're a \\"solid gold oldies\\" fan,this item is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The day is done","review":"Do not watch this dvd ever. Save your money and buy something else. I recommend the 10 greatest hits of Gary Puckett and the Union Gap for about ten bucks. Remember him the way he was not the way he is. I saw Gary Puckett at the New York State Fair last year and he was so bad that people were laughing at him. He kept apologizing for his voice and the laughs were just louder and louder. I loved Gary Puckett in 1984 when he played with the Monkees and the Grass Roots and Herman's Hermits but the day is done now Gary Puckett. Please stop singing and retire your old tired voice and leave us with happy memories of days long gone by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I've recently purchased quite a few classic rock DVDs and have enjoyed every one until now. If Gary had at least TRIED to sing the songs somewhat like the originals, it might have been ok, but he butchers them. He sounds (and acts) like a tacky lounge singer, or as Simon Cowell would say, \\"Bad karaoke\\". He uses this quiver in his voice and all I can hear is the Cowardly Lion from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" singing \\"If I Were King of the Forest\\".Warning: Watching this DVD may be harmful to your memories of some great music. Watch it at your own risk.I doubt that I'll ever watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gary had an off night","review":"Sorry, but Gary Puckett obviously had an off night when this concert was recorded. He hardly sounds like himself. At times he's even a bit off key.It's not just a matter of aging. I have CDs he has done in recent years and have heard him in concert, so I know he can sound even better than he did during his hit making years. It's just a shame they didn't record him in concert another night.Gary Puckett is one of my favorite singers, but I found this DVD unlistenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this","review":"I agree 100% with the \\"Lost his voice\\" review.

Its not to huge but it is longer with dips in the sides so your fingers can more comfortably remove the magsafe at its base, instead of pooling at the wire (Which I never did anyway, that would be a definite a magsafe assassination).

AppleCare took care of the situation, and within 48 hours I had a new one (although they shipped only the central element, and not the plug nor the long cord that attaches to the outlet). That's okay with me because I have those parts from the original. But the inconvenience of even losing just one work day is very frustrating, because that's what happened, at a time when I couldnt' afford to be idle.I wish someone would invent a competing product of the same kind, with magnetic attachment, because that is a great idea. When your dog sidles up to you and sits on the cord, it's good that the cord will simply detach. (And no, I don't believe that activity is enough to account for the fraying and loss at the magnet head.)Poorly done, Apple!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"I am a die hard Apple fan, but this product is simply an insult to anyone who buys into \\"Think different\\". No matter how shiny and cool a product is, how \\"insanely great\\", a lowly charger should not ruin the experience. Mine is crackling, sparks fly, randomly disconnects/stops charging, while generating significant heat. I read all the reviews on the web and it is a shame that thousands have the same problem, yet Apple does not address this issue. The replacement chargers are not cheap and there is no assurance that they would last any longer than the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute crap!","review":"I really enjoy the idea of this item as it will definitely save some careless people headaches. However, I have two MacBooks in my home and have gone through six of these adaptors in eight months, which breaks down to 1.33 a month! The cords consistently separate at the connecter. I suppose if your laptop remained on a desk and you didn't travel a lot it'd last longer. They need to reinforce the wire where the cord and the adaptor tip meet. I would NOT buy one of these as an extra one, because it is highly probable you'll have an issue and if you buy them over the counter you only get a 14 day return policy. At least with the MacBook purchase it covers you from one-three years depending on if you bought AppleCare."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising and Tedious Exchange Process","review":"MLC Distribution shamelessly misrepresents the nature of this product. They attempt to pass it off as a new adapter by having Amazon list it as a new product. In fact, it is a used power adapter that has been refurbished.

I decided to keep it, despite the false advertising, since I really needed to use my computer. However, after using it for a few days, the adapter stopped working.

I never roll it up and jam it in a bag, but it failed anyway.The replacement, and all adapters since have been the newer \\"T\\" sytle connector with the slightly bigger strain relief. These have all experienced the \\"broken springs\\" problem. I'm headed to the apple store to buy *another* one of these things (for my 2006 macbook) tomorrow.

I'm an electrical engineer, so I thought I would just pull it apart and splice the bad wire out, but this thing's clearly designed to never be opened and broke into several pieces when I slowly pried it out.

All went fine until the camera recognition. I got all kind of confusing messages, I checked FAQ, there were over 220 but none was answering my question. One said that the CD provided is outdated and I should download the latest edition. I did but still no results. I sent a e-mail to techsupport, no answer. Finally I found from somewhere(because there is no tech suport number for USA in the manual)their number and called. A short fused techguy guided me through the maze of various procedures and finnally after 58 minutes of long distance call on my expense,he got to the amazing conclusion that the camera is bad, return and get a new one.Return?

The camera itself seems decent enough, but my problems were all with the software. I downloaded the newest software for the camera from the website and installed it on an XP machine. After installing the HUGE download, the machine would periodically crash and restart itself. Not good. I also tried to use the camera on a Macintosh powerbook with the macam driver (which is supposed to work) only to find that the camera would rarely adjust from a compeletly washed out appearance when using it with Skype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent hardware, horrible software","review":"This camera has reasonable hardware, shows good resolution and decent colors even in bad light conditions.However, the software that comes with it is horrible. Can you imagine 85MB download for a simple web cam driver? Which then unpacks temporary installation files to your Program Files directory (120MB more) and never deletes these temporary files (the actual driver and software takes ~60Mb more)? That takes half an hour to install (longer than it took to install Vista on same box - the whole operating system)? That installs TWO services and adds TWO programs to your Run list, slowing your 3GHz Pentium to the speed of 386 processor? And finally stops working after several days and requires reinstall?It could be a nice camera if Logitech provided simple and reliable drivers. But they did not, and it really makes a difference (in a bad way). I'll likely throw this trash away."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this ...","review":"if your looking for a great cam w/ mic , the Logitech Quickcam is a great choice for a reasonable price ....

I'm glad I did, because it couldn't have been easier to install and because it looks great! My brother bought one for $80 while I bought this one. Mine works better--even he agreed.

The installation and software are indeed userfriendly but it's the hardware's performance that really matters.Logitech ... how about answering this review and telling us all how to make the framerate work properly. I certainly would not recommend Logitech products after my experience of this camera. One other thing: yes, it is good with low light but I cannot get it to adjust to daylight!! Not much good for web-cam work out the window! Still, maybe I'm doing something wrong, something some nice person in Logitech could correct!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Webcam in the market","review":"I bought this before I went on a month long trip to India so that I could see my family. It did a terrific job - amazing quality. It is packed with features such as screen saver on demand, integrated microphone, follow-me feature etc. Sadly another Logitech webcam - not STX - I carried was lousy and my family couldn't see anything at all....The only negative side to this is the inconvenient design that you can't keep this on the monitor to stay steady. So I taped this camera on one of my speakers and move the speaker around to center the subject- pretty lousy workaround."},{"rating":"1","title":"Driver does not work with my system.","review":"Yesterday I tried two cheap webcams and finally decided to spend more money on this.

While it can work for this, everything about the camera is so poorly exectued that its very frustrating to use. Software/driver installation was and continues to be problematic. The mounting system is awful, the camera is rather large, and the microphone does not work half of the time. And when it does work the image and sound quality are poor.I guess I am spoiled by the iSight camera on my Mac, but then the iSight was much more expensive than the QuickCam. Given the low price for this item (I paid about $25 on sale) its OK and will sometimes do the job, but if you are expecting a good quality product, you'll have to pay more."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"is very useful to chat with my family in India. they are always happy to see me so clearly. with its inbuilt microphone i don't have to put on any headphones"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good one to use","review":"Comparing with other web cams, this is pretty clear and having features for low light filter.

I tired it on a with a Pentium 3, 860 MHz, 512 MB RAM and then on an almost untouched, brand new P4 eMachine, 2.8 GHz, 768 MB RAM. In my opinion it would be better just to have audio than to have every single syllable out of synch with the video, which I find to be very distracting. Other than this significant problem, the camera was a nice camera.I have since purchased a Logitech QuickCam Fusion (which is about double the price of the STX) and been very satisfied. Audio and video synchronization on the Fusion seems to be just about perfect, even when running it on a USB 1.0 port."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good video. Horrible audio!","review":"I bought the webcam based on positive reviews. The high resolution video is quite good, it operates good in low light (with the low light filter and color boost on).the audio (mic) however is another story altogether. after 10-20 seconds, the receiver (remote end) gets a shrill audio disturbance, more like a static noise/white noise similar to the one heard with the television tuned to an empty channel. this happens in every software, yahoo messenger, msn, google talk and even skype.after searching logitech forums, a LOT of people have hit this issue with this camera. and it seems to manifest itself with laptops for some reason. logitech does not yet have any answer for this, so if you are considering using this with a laptop, I would definitely NOT recommend this camera, even though I had high hopes for this combo of mic + video for under $40. my search still continues...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera for the price","review":"I bought the camera at Radioshack for $50...so Amazon is giving you a deal with their price.Compared to the Radioshack brand camera I purchased and returned the day before I bought this one- this works really well. The picture is more true-to-life. It's an easy setup. If you're going to be doing important business e-conferencing, then I would recommend NOT getting this camera. The picture has slow frames which wouldnt go over well with clients. BUT, if its for personal use like Yahoo Messenger, etc..then this is great. The picture quality is great, the color is good, in the dark, it makes you visible with the Led light, and the CD rom software allows you to make video and still shots to save onto your PC...its a great camera for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Webcam","review":"Its the best webcam in best price. good resolution. good quality. quality microphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cam for the price","review":"very good webcam.

I have a laptop and can easily use it even with my daughter in my arms to capture those great moments. And then off they go via e-mail.I was a little disappointed to find there is an extra yearly charge per user for live video though. We decided to wait on paying the $60 some a year, again per user (that adds up), til my daughter is older. Also, we've found it's not as good in low light. And if you have too much light behind who's being videoing, there's too much glare. So, the lighting has to be right.Overall, I'm really happy with it. It was super easy to install. Now, I send off video e-mails to family and friends and everyone loves them. What a great way to see our girl grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Webcam","review":"I love this webcam.

It was not just a matter of the screws popping out; pieces of the acrylic body broke away with the metal grinder.

Whenenver I try to put back a DVD or two I always seem to have about 3 other DVDs fall off into the back of the unit (it's against the wall)."},{"rating":"2","title":"best storage for this price","review":"I was looking for CD/DVD storage for long time.I have close to 200 CD/DVDs and didn't want bulk furniture item to stay in my living room.I came across with this one and before I bought it I was reading reviews for it on a different websites.And here is my review.This storage system doesn't take a lot of space and it is easy to assemble.I have my rack filled up almost up to the full capacity and it's very stable.But if you don't have enough CDs or DVDs to put on this rack they will not stay on it. If you touch one, the other disks will probably fall down behind the rack (if you don't catch them fast enough). To prevent disks falling off the rack you have to use plastic dividers.

The author clearly demonstrates a single-minded labor of love to preserve the overall personal story of this critical and singular period in American history. Another Amazon review complained about the somewhat unprofessional presentation of the materials in the book but this is exactly why I love it. It's like the very scrapbooks that the WWII generation used to put together - photos, matchbooks, dance cards, postcards, badges, sheetmusic, unusual war front news stories, posters, etc. The materials are organized in either topical or chronological chapters and thoroughly annotated. It's like finding the nation's wartime history in old box in the attic.

The exterior material seems very robust, but is not the most comfortable. The 15-degree rating isn't right at all; on a trip down the cool and foggy Oregon Coast, I began to feel uncomfortably chilly at around 30 degrees.However, the bag's main problem is that it doesn't pack down well -- a problem not helped by the mediocre compression sack that is included. This bag is simply too large for use on a backpacking trip or bike tour, and the space it takes up is space better used for food or water. A far better solution for any summer or fall camping would be to find a cheap down bag (30 degree down bags don't cost much more than this one) and a bulkier sleeping pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for me, zipper is weak","review":"I used this bag once and I doubt I will use it again.

I don't have any area in my tiny, old house where I can easily (or safely) anchor a resistance band.

The cutting edge of the blades is only about an inch and a half long! The \\"Torque engineering\\" that is referred to can surely only mean that the handles are longer than the blades and so providing a gain due to leverage - other than that there is nothing really different compared to 'regular' scissors. When the description refers to chicken bones does it really mean just chicken ribs and cartlidge? The pivot is a simple rivet - pretty basic (and cheap) for a relatively expensive pair of scissors.

I have uninstalled, reinstalled, not only Paperport 10, but also scandirect and pdf convert and OminiPage.

Everything ran at the speed of stone and my system crashed repeatedly.

We had never been there and had a wonderful time. The book is Fantastic and it got us through all the major tourist sites! All of my kids loved it, from my ten year old down my three year old. There is something for each of them. The book provides things to spot at each site. There is a maze, a word search, and more, including pages of information and questions about what you are seeing, like the history and map of Paul Revere's ride or the penguins at the Boston Aquarium. The book is both educational AND FUN! The pictures and graphics are excellent. The books fit easily on my kids' laps and they wrote in them with crayons, markers and pens. Now, each of my kids has a book they look back on to remind them of our trip. I highly recommend the book. You can't go wrong! When the next city's book comes out, We're There!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For our grandchild, the book added so much.","review":"We recently took our four year-old granddaughter to the Paul Revere House.Without this book, it would have been hard for us to make this relevant and fun for her.

This is the one.","review":"The dog-eared cover and pages tell it all. I carry this field guide birding while the others repose on the book shelf at home. The concise description of field marks and the handy range maps make it a most useful tool. The range maps are on the same page, so you don't have to flip around looking for them.

They are becoming interested in birds and I want them to have the best field guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some notes on NG's Field Guide, 3rd edition.","review":"The revised NG Field Guide is good in that it updates new names and splits, etc. but many of the pictures leave a lot to be desired, especially the hummingbirds, which are terrible! We only use it as a back up to Peterson or others. Also for some reason the author decided to re-order the 'natural' order of 'orders' so that this guide does not follow most other guides and is confusing to use occasionally. Maps are good but not entirely accurate or tend to show smaller, more limited ranges than actually is the case. Overall, a very good beginning guide for those new to birding because it is simpler [and less technical] to use. Enjoy! The bird world and the natural world is waiting for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly fabulous","review":"Improved in every way except the paper stock.

The taxonomy is not up-to-date. Canada Goose had been separated as well as the Blue Grouse and many others. I do NOT recommend you to buy this guide. Either wait for the Fifth Edition or go look for other good guides such as Kaufman (this one is a tiny bit outdated(Blue Grouse not split yet) but is easier to use because it has color tabs instead of thumbtabs) or the Sibley Guides (even more outdated). This Edition is a waste of your money so do NOT buy!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the Press Check?","review":"Can't believe how poorly this book was printed.

Didn't anybody go to the press check when this book was being printed? The colors are way oversaturated and the registration on some of the pages is absolutely horrible! As I bird lover, I want to know as accurately as possible what color a bird should be when I look at a guide and as a graphic designer, I assume that color proofing would be of utmost importance in a book like this.

Furtw'ngler is my all time favorite conductor of Wagner and he lives up to his reputation. The singing is also excellent, only marred by old recording equipment that does not adequately capture the wonderful performance. Any Wagner lover will enjoy these CDs, despite the less than good reproduction of the 1937 sound (which is why I gave it only 4 stars).Since writing this review a couple years ago, I must say that this is a CD that I listen to repeatedly.

The original game featured well known songs that were reimagined to fit in well with the drums. There were few songs that I didn't like and have fun playing with.The tracks on the sequel are unimaginative and bland. They all sound the same. It's about impossible to discern what song it is in song selection mode if you don't know it from the song title because the introductions to all the songs sound the same.In the original game, the songs were a bit different than the original including original vocal stylings and the music was arranged to sound cool accompanied by bongos. The new songs are just standard arrangements with substandard vocalists.On a positive note, the mini games are much improved and more fun to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply subjective and one-sided view of complex reality","review":"The author brings very subjective, one-sided and frankly anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli view of a complex reality the State of Israel exist.

As a reader it makes you hunger for more and more and more.That on it's own would be enough for me to urge others to buy it. But it also exposes the very core of the conflict.

And a divide there certainly is, but one that could so easily be straddled if there were more people such as Ms Nathan in this world.Whilst there may be many who might disagree with her, Ms Nathan's grasp of the Israeli socio-political nettle is honest, courageous,hard-hitting and thought-provoking. A person cannot read this book without being unmoved by the tragedy of the Palestinian-Israeli divide whether Jewish, Muslim,Christian or any faith.The fact that Ms Nathan is a voice from within the divide is highly significant.

If the screws do not go in the threading use some oil and work the threading prior to doing the full assembly (this will prevent you from stripping the screws). 3) As others have commented, the actual enclosure is very tight.

It would have been nicer if the cable were angled to the left or right instead of going straight down.- The cord is stiff, making it difficult to position the surge protector.- The creative design means that cables will cross over each other when you use all the outlets.Overall, it's very good for the price, but if you're like me and you like to keep your cables neat, this surge protector can be a little tricky."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't protect my equipment","review":"I love the design of this thing, but it didn't protect my equipment -- a power surge fried one of my RAM modules and one of my hard drives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goal!","review":"This little hockey puck scores big in my eyes. Sure, at first glance, it has a weird, almost unnecessarily unique design to it. But ohhh how much use you'll get out of that.Want to have one plug pointed upwards, for short cords that can't reach all the way down to the surge protector on the ground? This thing has that kind of socket covered. How about some plugs on the side of the unit, for snaking cords around a wall and into the Mighty 8 Surge? Not a problem. This little gem has so many angles and variations on the traditional surge protector that you'll never have to worry about finding a way to plug something in. The Mighty 8 Surge has you taken care of.Speaking of surge protecting, thanks to the Mighty 8 Surge I've not ONCE had any kind of surge issues in my apartment that, shall we say, has electrical issues on a daily basis. Trust me when I say this little hockey puck is a game-winner. Eight plugs for less than twenty bucks? That's not even three dollars per plug!

Good thing I did... when I went to use one of them... the front 3 outlets didn't work. Not the whole thing... just the front 3 outlets. Probably just a loose or unsoldered wire. Needless to say... I contacted Amazon and they are sending me another one and gave me a shipping label to pay for the return. 5 stars to Amazon as usual for their customer service! Anyway... I like the powerstrip, and hopefully I just got 1 dud out of 100.

When I did this, the unit immediately began making a humming and popping noise which was accompanied by a comforting electrical fire smell. Brilliant! After about 10 seconds of being plugged in, I was audience to a louder POP, a puff of smoke and all of the lights and power turning off in my room. I think there might be a slight quality control problem at Fellowes.

POP!So to double check everything, plug this device into an outlet at a friends home... same thing.. POP!Obviously my unit had some kind of internal short circuit right out of the box and was completely unusable.A new one might have worked great, but in my situation I sent it back to Amazon and will spend a couple dollars more and buy the 12 outlet 2,400 joule surge protector from Belkin instead.Thank God for great customer service from Amazon.com!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great design -- yes, even for a power strip","review":"This is how power strips should be designed this century. It eliminates almost all worry of big wall-warts occupying 2 or even 3 spots on a typical power strip. It's still ugly once everything is plugged in, but I don't know anyone that leaves their power strip out for show. It's very functional, allows you to utilize all plugs (assuming you have at least 3 non-warts), and provides surge protection. I was able to replace 2 strips with this one because there was no longer plug overlap (and I have an extra!). Because if its utility, I think it's a better buy than cheaper straight-6 models. Additionally, something to keep in mind with really cheap power strips is they may not actually be providing surge protection, only extra plugs. Read the label carefully.Finally, because the plug into the wall is at a 90 degree angle, it fits behind furniture much better. This power strip really was \\"designed\\", not just slapped together to make a buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great! All the adapters fit!","review":"Purchased this strip to go inside of a charging station. I ended up buying a compact charging station, so the strip is stored behind the station, as opposed to inside of it. Still, the device is just a little bit bigger than my girly fist and can fit all of my phone and camera charger paraphernalia no problems. Great design, right down to the plug that sits flush with the wall, instead of sticking straight out from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique shape ensures no outlets are blocked","review":"Works great. Needed every plug for my computer setup, and all the big power adapters fit in this surge protector. Happy with the purchase.Though the shape may not be for everyone... it may take a few tries to fit everything you want, and the result can be a bit of a jumbled mess. Also, make note of the shape of the plug in the picture. I know some plugs are vertical, and the tail will work for those, but mine are sideways so it could potentially block the second outlet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I Needed","review":"This product is great because it has a light and is sturdy.

U2 rerecorded or remastered this song for their Greatest Hits 1980-1990 compilation, and in my own opinion have made a song that is worse than the original. However, it takes a diehard fan to probably notice the difference. Never-the-less, if \\"The Sweetest Thing\\" is all you are interested in, go for the BEst of disc and if you can get the 2 disc version which includes the original B-Sides version and this reworking.My reason for giving this disc 4 stars is in the live tracks. Here are two tracks from the Red Rocks concert that did not make the Under a Blood Red Sky CD. Yet, these two songs are wonderful U2 songs, and they sound really great live. LIstening to these songs makes me wish they would rework the whole Under a Blood Red Sky album into a full concert CD. That would be awesome. As it is, if you like that concert CD and the U2 studio work before that, especially Boy, these B-Sides should make you happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome live tracks!","review":"The two live tracks on this are outstanding for early U2 fans - the Edge solo in Twilight is worth any money you might spend on this CD.

A far cry from having to use a manual stapler. I do have two minor complaints. The first is that mine did not come with the anti-mar piece that fits over the actuation plunger. This would help to minimize the amount of surface marks on the finished product. The second issue is that when using the smaller sized staples - 3/8\\" and 1/2\\" - it will occasionally misfire. It doesn't jam - just no staple is fired. The next one may be fine, or it may take two or three tries. Then it is back to normal. I have been using only brand name staples, so can't imagine that is the issue.

Some other songs which add to this compilation are \\"Send me an Angel\\"-Real Life (New Wave 80's), \\"Straight Ahead\\"-Nick Straker Band, and \\"Goddess of Love\\"-Soif De La Vie(not the full length version). One question is, why are \\"You Are Danger\\"-Gary Low and \\"Masterpiece\\"-Gazebo the short versions? These were some of the best in this colllection.

Along the way, he covers music, art, religion, philosophy, history, and biography, as well as, of course, literature, and merges them together in quite insightful ways. The book is strongest in the early Anglo-Saxon and medieval sections that set up the author's thesis and it can grow a tad bit repetitious in theme in the later chapters as he pounds home his ideas. Overall though, the reader should be fascinated by the vast number of examples from primary (and some interesting secondary) sources that pepper the book. The author's knowledge is vast and his selection of sources is unimpeccable. A frequently interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Albion","review":"Albion : Origins of the English ImaginationIt's possible to learn new information from reading this book, even if it does not have any obvious bearing on the stated thesis. That the thesis is itself a metaphor is one of the difficulties of mounting any kind of argument either for or against, and the author fails to do so. If the editor had been able to persuade the author to remove all of the unsupported assertions, inapposite literary anecdotes, and forced connective phraseology, the book would be about 20 pages long. It reads like a term paper by a 14-year-old trying to impress the reader with how many big (non-Anglo-Saxon!) words he knows, while not realizing that the topic is beyond his reach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring pedantry","review":"Ackroyd has an encyclopedic knowledge of English literature and so drops fascinating factoids and snippets of quotes throughout this long and boring book.

I was also pleased with the trilling and unpredictable ending; I felt the decision was the right one. I also think that Steven got what he deserved. Most of all, I think the author did an excellent job in writing this story, the suspense was overwhelming, it kept your full attention and last but not least, I would definitely recommend this book to everyone.

Sisters will be able to identify with Angela's need to believe and trust in her man....that is until confident Steven goes to far. Every sister need a sisterfriend like Pam...one who has your back, regardless. This book is as much about Angela's relationships with family and friends as it is about male relations. Angela is a honest, strong, generous, loving, beautiful sister. She is the epitome of class. For her, it's not about her money or material possessions. It's about realizing that God blesses us not only for our personal enjoyment but also that we may be a blessing to others.

I think I previously gave it 4 or 5 stars. I felt pressed because I read it as part of an online book group. Now I have to correct what I said initially.I did not like this book at all. I think that that writing style was poor and the characters juvenile. It was hard at times to follow the writer's train of thought. Grammatically, tenses did not agree, and the writer frequently slipped in and out of 1st and 3rd person voice. Another reviewer stated that a writer can at least go back and hone their craft. I hope that is true. I wish Ms. Moorman success in her future writing endeavors, and make the suggestion that she read other African American authors who have writing down to a science... like E.

The storyline itself isn't bad, but the writing needs major improvement. There were unneeded descriptions, flat dialogue, and I couldn't relate to the one-dimensional characters. The writing was juvenile in nature and offered zero insight. My suggestion is that Wanda studies books written by successful authors to see what it is that makes their books engaging and also take some writing classes that will help strengthen her storytelling skills.

It will easily fit 2 Large-XLarge air mattresses as well as gear.I've used it in the woods and got it wet and the rain dodger and floor were dry as a bone.I just returned from Burning Man and I have to say it held up admirably. The zippered windows and door remained dust-free. The only draw-back in that environment was the large vent on the roof, there is no way to zipper it shut. Usually the dodger covers the vent so you don't have to worry but when dealing with talk-like dust it's best to cover over it with a non-permeable material. I used plastic and pillow bunting to cremate a makeshift dust filter and it worked well.It was also able to withstand 50 mph winds.

I am of Scots descent and was intrigued to see the use of the backdrop of the Scottish struggle for sovereignty as a stage for the occult themes.I was very disappointed in the story and it took me a day or two to realize that one of the reasons is that there are NO WOMEN in this book at all - except for an evil pre-Christian Goddess. (Who doesn't even seem to have any female worshippers.) Granted the main characters are militant monks, but surely somewhere in their Scottish wanderings or in one of the subplots there is room for the distaff side.This book, and its sequel, The Temple and the Crown, are relentless in their portrayal of good Christians vs horrible diabolists of one sort or another. I'm slogging along through the sequel but whether I will actually finish the thing is in doubt. I'm amazed that it is possible to make the stories of William Wallace and Robert Bruce boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical fiction work with NO glaring inaccuracies!","review":"This book was a pleasure to read and hard to put down. It tied together the Templars, Wallace, the Bruce, the Celts, and more, in a finely woven Scottish plaid! I love Historical Fiction, and I HATE when they are historically inaccurate, but this book wraps itself around a framework of actual fact! Well worth the reading. I want to see more books like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, but poor execution","review":"I was drawn to this book by reading the back cover. How could anything revolving the story about William Wallace and Robert the Bruce be anything but good. I didn't even mind the battle between christian and pagan religions. It just seemed that whenever the Templars got in trouble they pulled out their Celtic stone, said some prayers and all was well. I was given the second book and will attempt to slog my way through it as I travel, however, I am so far not impressed 57 pages into it. I wish that the execution of this story and plot could have been done better as the idea was fantastic. I enjoyed some of the historical points of the book, but as written in earlier reviews they were repeated entirely too many times! I wouldn't buy this book if your looking for a fun, romping tale of the Knights Templar. Could have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give a hoot, read a book...but not this one.","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers that the initial premise of this book seemed promising at the start. The further into the book I got though, the more this promise started to wane. I only finished this book because I had paid money for it. The final chapters were actually skimmed rather than read (reading for enjoyment is not supposed to be a chore).As an example of what I didn't like about the book can be found in the last chapter, the coronation of Robert the Bruce. Numerous pages described who was there, who stood where, who said what. Very dry. I thought this was a novel, not \\"The Cambridge Journal of Historical Analysis\\"! All to what purpose? I still don't know. I was surprised that the authors didn't describe what Sir Whoisname's wife was wearing (that color of gown just does not go with her hair!) and how the floral arrangements were picked out by the monk with the bad skin condition.I'll end my comments with one word. Tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked/loved THE ADEPT series, you'll be disappointed.","review":"Don't bother, really, unless you can pick it up used, cheap!It's almost as though the authors want to take the leap and commit to mystical or esotertics, but just can't make the leap.

There are some exciting glimpses into \\"dark\\" characters and mystery but they are few and far between. The authors involve FAR too much conversation between characters and they constantly rehash the same things over and over and over. Chapter 35 was the true end of the story - great climatic drama. Chapter 36 was so incredibly dull that I skimmed it, read the epilogue and gladly put this book away! Not a keeper and not one I would recommend.

The guitar in question is an epiphone from the 90s, and had badly worn frets - but the fret wire was nothing exotic. I leveled the frets (a bit of work), then began crowning them with this tool (a lot of work). But this file was essentially worn out after 7 frets had been crowned. So I need to order a different file.I know that this file cuts in only one direction, and is not as expensive as the diamond files - consequently my expectations were calibrated for hobby-level use. But nevertheless the file should stand up to a complete set of frets before wearing down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made, expensive junk","review":"I received this tool and was eager to use it to crown the frets on a personally valuable instrument. First, I could not get the bits to stay seated in the tool - even using a hex key wrench to tighten the screw - poor design.

For example, Boucher presents capital input growth as productivity growth. The 'models' presented in the book are vapid space filler and could have been taken from an undergraduate's class presentation. All of the models could have been summarized neatly on one page rather than several dozen. Also, there are multiple typographical errors and citation errors throughout the book.The author likely used the phrase 'hedge fund' to tap into a hot topic in order to sell more books.

Early in the show Jackie passes aimless conversation with the audience off as \\"new\\" material. Even Jackie becomes frustrated at one point when he asks whether anyone is actually there in the audience. When his rambling fails to capture the audience he pulls material from his Broadway show out of his hat but without any comic energy. In fact, Jackie seems tired or bored throughout the show. Uncharacteristic for Jackie, his show seems unrehearsed and unplanned...as if he was asked to get up and wing it. Don't bother investing in this DVD as the title is misleading and the performance is poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wonderful comedian... but not here","review":"Jackie Mason is one of the great stand-ups, but you wouldn't know it from this performance. The production values are almost non-existent: 1 camera at the back of the auditorium which moves in and out of focus, no extras, no music, no features. All this, of course, would be immaterial if the show were magic. But it isn't. He's a little off his game, the audience takes a while to warm up (vehement anti-french gags don't go down well in Canada) and, as everyone else has said, the material is far from '100%' new. This is part of Jacky Mason's charm, and even the new bits feel familiar... it's in his tone, timing and expressions. But all three are off-key in this performance, so this DVD's only for completists. First-timers should look to buy a recording of Mason on Broadway or in the West End, where he always rises to the occasion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off","review":"What a huge disappointment.

Sadly, no sound but for the music. May have been another in the faded footage but I'm not sure if it was different.

I liked the idea of the immersible pot for easy cleaning. However, the electrical unit falls off too easily - in fact, the cord is placed so that it knocks itself off. But the worst part is the heat control. Despite Warm, Simmer, and 250 up to 300 degrees, in reality there are two temperatures: hot to the boiling point or OFF. At \\"Warm,\\" it kept at a constant rolling boil.

Each carol is preceded by a brief, written introduction to some aspect of the song. For example, \\"Here We Come A-Wassailing\\" explains the derivation of \\"wassail\\" as well as its meaning in context of Christmas. \\"O Holy Night\\" gives a two-sentence summary of the composer's (Adolphe Adam) career.The typeface of the words is a little too small and might be a challenge for those on the verge of needing reading glasses, but the scores themselves should be fine for all but the worst eyes.

Though the book is on architecture I can see how many of the principles apply to furniture making as well.

I think I could probably do the same thing with any building if I looked at it long enough. It sometimes felt like a real tough read for me (it certainly helped me go to sleep many nights). Given this book appears out of print and he hefty price I paid for it, I would certainly look elsewhere if you are coming from the same direction I came from on the purchase. An understanding of the golden ratio, shadow lines and looking at some classic pieces (shaker, federal, etc.) will probably yield equal or better benefit to your own furniture design making.

The only weakness is that there are moments during the rhythmic dances of the \\"Turangalla\\" movements where a very slight lack of rhythmic precision mars the performance very slightly. Shelley's piano playing is bright and polished, if a little forward, and Hartmann-Claverie's ondes martenot is well balanced.

For instances you need to be able to read music and have a fair amount of technique on your instrument. Other than that anything you might have problems with Mr. Arnold will answer via the publisher's FAQ section. Personally I think anyone serious about music should check this book out.

On the positive side, the two principalsMirella Freni and Sergei Larin are both excellent, especially Freni,who dominates the performance with her superb dramatic acting and fine voice. The supporting cast is also very competent.Unfortunately, there are many drawbacks. The sound recording is poorly balanced, it favours the singers to the extent that the orchestra is suppressed and the overall effect is distorted.There are no subtitles, only a hasty synopsis on the tape box.The conducting of Stefano Ranzani seems only adequate, but that could be attributed to the bad balance already referred to.There is no information as to the origin of this performance, it looks like a provincial Italian house with the irritating custom of loudly cheering and applauding singers on entering the stage.Fedora needs a great recording to show its worth.

So I would give Milwaukee the non. One thing to note, the quick connect is 1/4 x 3/8 (3/8 being the threaded end), not the more standard 1/4 x 1/4. Why 4 stars and not 5?

The Intuos comes with better peripherals (5-button mouse instead of 3-button and the pen has a rocker switch), is physically more robust, and is visually more appealing than the graphire. Wacom puts great effort into rewarding with little extras for the higher price you've paid for the Intuos.A key thing to remember with this product though is that it's only as good as the software you're working with and your knowledge of the software you're working with. Adobe Photoshop, for example, though great for touching up existing images, doesn't have a very developed set of brushes for \\"painting\\" with your tablet but you can, with some skill, create the necessary brushes to emulate pencil, charcoal, pen, marker, paintbrush, or airbrush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"The pen tablet is working as I expected.I was surprised by the fast delivery, in three days I already had the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I love my Intuos3. :) I bought it as a gift to myself, as I wanted to get into digital art and a friend suggested it to me.

I don't know how I ever got along without one.I was worried that 6x8 would be a bit small, but it seems more than adequate for my needs so far. The Intuos 3 tablet is pressure-sensitive, measures the angle of your stylus to the surface, and includes the function buttons, scroll strip, and a mouse. My only disappointment is that there isn't an 'undo' button on the tablet for use with Corel Painter. Otherwise, aside from using 'Ctrl+Z', I would never have to use the keyboard.I'm still psyched about this product.

Included in the product is Coral draw, and Adobe Elements. All of the software is shakey together. However, I like the idea, the pen and the tablet are great tools.Addendum to this reviewI am now on my third mouse - first one lasted about a year, the second one, the buttons on the side stopped working.

The larger size makes a big difference, too.I don't use the shortcut buttons very much because I'm so used to the keyboard for that, but I do like it that you can program them to do other things (open programs, for instance). Masking, painting and retouching photos is a nightmare with the mouse; a pen tablet is the only way to go!A small warning: learning to use any tablet is a little disorienting at first.

My little Graphire just wore out, and that says a lot about the quality of this product: it lasted a long time, even getting it second hand. The upgrade is even better. A sleeker more seamless design and it has a bit of tooth on the drawing area which makes the use feel more natural. No messy overlay, which I was constantly fiddling with on the Graphire. The touch pads on the Express Keys are a bit wonky, in that if you don't wait a few seconds, it will take you back up instead of down when you scroll (or vice versa), but all in all, it's not a big thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool Product!","review":"I use Photoshop just about every day in my business, processing product photos for our website.

The other is not a problem yet, but I continue to eye the point where my cord connects to the tablet - it just looks like without a heavier reinforced lead here, this is going to be the place where the cord gets a short.

A Distant Soil is probably best known for its art, a stand alone in the world of comic books. Her drawings contain a realism rarely seen in comic books, a realism that is propelled into the fantastic by the gorgeous cosume designs and extravegant sets.The villians are horribly evil and sometimes the story becomes a bit of a space opera, but the character of Liana helps to ground the tale and makes it engaging from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading product description","review":"This product has 3 functions within one stylus: PDA stylus, Laser Stylus and Ball pen.

Its method and perspective are right out of the Victorian age. This historian obviously is unable to take the perspective of the many diverse inhabitants of the ancient Near East. For instance, his results on 'identity' are based mainly on inscriptions. That is a problem because Greek and Latin inscriptions by no means represent the views of the main bulk of Near Eastern populations; rather, they tend to be written by the minority of faithful servants to the Roman rule, i.e. those people who profited from the imperial system. Mr. Millar admits that he had great problems with the subject because it was new to him. He would have had much less problems if he had learned to take the perspective of members of other cultures.

I was bitterly disappointed, however, as the grotesquely poor English (spelling and grammar) made the book unreadable for me.

Sometimes you'll work from the cartoon to the puzzle, and sometimes from the puzzle to the cartoon, but you'll end each page with both a smile and a feeling of solving satisfaction.

That moves towards collectiveforms in rural areas formalized and were built on family units that were the basis of womens opression.There is obviously the danger that any analysis written in the West can fall into the trap of a eurocentric view and not start from the realities of the Chinese situation and what realistically could be achieved in a mere 30 years but I feel that the author has a valid point and the book contributes to an understanding of the Chinese revolution"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fix for TSB - cruise control switch","review":"Fix for the cruise control cut-off switch located on the master break pump.

Its strengths are many: a bold writing style, a truly impressive handling of what must have been a huge mass of unwieldy source material, a fair rendering of the complex character of Joe Kennedy, Senior; and a skillful recreation of contrasting moods and settings--pol-mad Old Boston, prep-school football afternoons, dread Ex-Com meetings, breezy days on the Cape."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so good about this book or author?","review":"The inside jacket preview and the back cover reviews seem to be by those who could not have read this book.The author may be accomplished, but I am not impressed.

However, I ended up not wanting to finish it because it was really not very good.The narrator is clearly a troubled individual, self-centered and yet dependent on others, but it wasn't funny or interesting. A lot of the things she said or thought or did were offensive or twisted in some way. I couldn't really find much redeeming about her, especially with all the uses of the word \\"fag\\" and other offensive comments about Jews, black people, and so on.I'm really disappointed that NYRB has decided to republish this. Not only has it not stood the test of time, but I can't imagine it having been well-received at the time it was originally published.

Also, the light emitted from the bulb is softly brilliant, eminating the design etched in the plastic beautifully.

Sadly it falls into predicable patterns with the murderer so obvious I had to force myself to finish the novel. Orchids can be fascinating, but here they were used as a premise for mapping out events and their appearances began to read like directions. And to be honest, a few sentences were written so badly my jaw dropped. Skip it. Read Minette Walters, Tony Hillerman or Steig Larsson so you won't feel like you lost time you'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea/Pedestrian execution","review":"Having lived in Toulouse and traveled extensively throughout the south of France, I wanted to give Wan a try for both the setting of her mystery and the interesting connection it made to a rare orchid. Unfortunately, while the description of the area and the idea of a search for a rare orchid were interesting, the book was less than well written; the storyline most pedestrian and predictable. I would not recommend this work to a reader who likes the mysteries of Henning Mankell, Ake Edwardson, Karin Fossum, Qiu Xiaolong, Peter Robinson, P.D. James, Elizabeth George, Philip Kerr, Sjowall and Wahloo, Rebecca Pawel, Donna Leon, or Andrea Camilleri."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous and Vapid....Unless you are obsessed with orchids, stay away....","review":"I must confess I could not finish this book. I will generally finish a book when I've invested time in it, and care about the characters, even with major flaws.But this book was deadly, I didn't care about the characters in anyway, nor did the non-mystery compel me to finish the novel. The worst sin a mystery novel can contain is not having an interesting, and compelling mystery. At minimum it must give me something to detect!I feel that this book belongs with the \\"cat\\" and other niche mysteries, which I suspect are published to appeal to senseless consumers rather than actually provide a satisfying novel of mystery and suspense.Thus unless you are extremely partial to Orchids and have way too much time and money, read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"would make a great movie","review":"This is one of the best mysteries I've ever come across. After taking my time reading to about half-way through the book, from that point on I couldn't put it down. The writing is good, the characters are authetic, but the plot is superb!!

A work of great depth and breadth, it shows a master historian at his best. The analysis is rich and complex; just about every page is rich with insight and often turns upside down some old conventional wisdom (cf., for but one example, his assessement of the positive role the Vikings had on the redistribution of wealth and on economic quickening in general in Europe). This is a veritable tour de force, and one that should be required reading for anyone seriously interested in medieval history. Of course, some material is dated, and on some topics the author changed his mind later on in his career, but that does not detract from the force and brilliance of this classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small and self-absorbed","review":"I opened this book with great anticipation, thinking it would evoke California's San Joaquin Valley, its landscape, people, challenges and changes. Instead Varni has written a small, self-absorbed account, which appears to be largely autobiographical, of his unhappy dysfunctional family. Unhappy families can be the stuff of great literature but nothing in the telling here gives the book wings; humdrum, often cruelly-rendered details collect on every page, leaden and inert. Varni's bitterness is occasionally redeemed by patches of attractive writing, but the overall effect is that of being forced to listen to someone in a smelly bar pour out their sad tales of mom and dad. One can't wait for it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"definately had potential, but....","review":"I was so disapointed with this novel. Varni clearly has a love of words and language and there are times when this shines, particulary in part one. But in regard to story structure, the work is lacking. The characters had my interest initially but it never paid off and by the last 80 pages I was trudging through just simply to say I'd finished. The main character and narrator, Vincent, struck me as brooding and self-absorbed. Wanting to transplant himself but continually coming back to his roots simply so he could have a dysfunctional family to blame for his own hum-drum existence. Nothing new there. If you value your reading time, take a pass until the author (or his editor) have more experience and/or a story to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"A cruel and sarcastic novel about a creepy main character who is even less likeable than the flawed parents he can't seem to forgive for giving birth to him.

Although the information in this book is important to know in any situation, I purchased it with the intention that it would help my family and I to cope with any Y2K related problems. The book helps to remove a fear of the unknown by explaining how household systems work, as well as how we are all connected to our ecological systems.

When I found out it was the Titanic my recation was; is that it? Then there is about 400 odd pages to wade though of the same things over and over and over again until you reach the end.

The characters easily pull you in for an enjoyable read, which I did not want to put down. Willis also creates a good sense of place throughout the story.

I too wondered what research Willis had done in writing this book, it all sounds very plausible. This is one of those books that you wish were not just fiction. I enjoyed it just as much as I enjoyed Doomsday Book. I will definitely read more Connie Willis"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning work of fiction","review":"In her characteristicaly understated way Connie Willis lets us share a fascinating and unsettling exploration of near death experiences. Without ever descending into cliche or sentimentality she delivers a powerful and haunting story. Do not miss this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She should stick to short stories...","review":"I picked this up because I had read her \\"Impossible Things\\" and liked it, also because I liked the brief on the back cover. I give this a two star rating rather than a one because the subject matter is interesting. The chapters go on and on longer than they need to and the book sometimes seems like a first draft rather than a final copy because there are many things that haven't been taken out. I sped through the last 80 pages not because I was gripped by the book, but rather, after reading the first 700 pages, I had invested too much and just wanted to be through with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read 'Bellweather' first","review":"I have been a fan of Connie Willis for quite some time and I highly recommend her earlier time travel novels, 'The Doomsday Book', and 'To Say Nothing Of The Dog' and her very humorous short novel about fads and trends entitled 'Bellweather'. Her more recent book, 'Passage' concerns near-death experiences. It has the same humorous tone as the earlier novels but I found the novel disturbing and felt unsettled after reading it.I suggest that 'Bellweather' be read prior to reading 'Passage'. Otherwise, the reader might be so put off as to avoid the author's other fine novels and short stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call me a quitter.","review":"I tried, but I could not finish this book. I was halfway through-which had been a test of endurance-and realized that nothing had really happened. The author spends a lot of time on conversations between characters that frankly makes them even more 2 dimensional than were to begin with. All the characters come off as way too cute-they are really quite unbelievable, and yet, this is not intended as tongue in cheek. It only seems like it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost but not Quite...","review":"...believeable and not paced to avoid boredom. I really, really enjoy Connie's books and have bought and read all of them to date, but this one completely missed the mark for me. Yes, good starting premise. Okay, the characters are sharply and deeply drawn. But I felt the book could have been half the length and still accomplished as much: too much distracting avoidance by the protagonist of one or two jerk characters in many scenes drove me crazy and the characters do things that just don't make sense. And lastly, the ending did not at all work, I found it a total letdown on a literary level and also emotionally. I loved Doomsday and her more \\"scifi\\" books with time travel, I was enraptured by ..Christmas Stories but I just can't recommend Passage like her others."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I underwent a near-death experience reading this book.","review":"I really tried to like this book, but it had to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. It went on forever, and most of the novel consisted of people endlessly running a maze of corridors in a hospital. Except for Kit and the little dying girl, most of the characters were paper thin. I really thought near the end of the book that the endless hospital passages were the near-death experience. The message was bleak, and I was totally depressed by the end of the novel. I've not read anything else by this author, so my experience might be a quirk. Also, this book might appeal to someone else, but I had a terrible time with it and wished I had never read it. With all apologies to the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you interested in the idea of an Afterlife","review":"So many readers found this book too long. But I loved every page of it. I have read it twice in the past 8 years and will read it again.It's a meditation on ideas about the afterlife. The main character really doesn't believe in the idea but is working on a scientific study of it.The book has fascinating and real life characters with all their messiness and uncertainty and needs.If you have experienced loss and want to have some sense of what MIGHT Happen then read this entertaining book. It sends you down many paths even to the very last page. Which is as it should be. No answers but possabilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pity about the lackluster ending","review":"It's an interesting story, filled with tons of medical jargon (which may or may not be correct, I skimmed over it, taking it as fiction and at face value), and in its own way a bit of a mystery - one of those books that drags you along as you pick up one puzzle piece after another. I didn't want to put it down. The ending... ah, it was a let-down, honestly, but the rest of the book was worth the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a wonderful read but, you must be just that: a reader! The subject matter has obviously been well-researched, the characters are believable, and the ending was delicious! Don't approach this book with a microwave frame of mind ... it's best cooked the old-fashioned way, low simmer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"This author has done a masterful job of answering the question of life-after-death in a way that STILL leaves room for many interpretations. Yes, the story's ending gives a definite answer. Or does it? hmmmmmI inhaled this book, literally could not put it down, and I was sorry to turn the last page and know it was finished. I even stood over the stove cooking dinner with my nose in the book!I haven't yet read the 'Doomsday Book' but I have to take a long plane trip this week and I'm taking it with me. If that book is as good as this one was, my trip will be very pleasant, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent, terrifying, edifying novel","review":"PASSAGE takes on a phenomenon that is both physical and metaphysical, and does it with the authority of both a woman of science and of faith. This story terrified me, but at the same time moved me with the depth and unflinching detail with which its characters--who are like those people in your everyday life that you love, just regular folks who really matter to you--tackle the huge issue of near-death experiences, and in fact, death itself. The juxtaposition of ordinary, irritating, enjoyable daily life with the gritty reality of an urban hospital is the very essence of the dramatic effect of this novel. As always, Willis know what she's doing, and does it magnificently. I loved it. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cafeteria's not open! We got it the first hundred times!","review":"Well, I started this book with high hopes, because the subject matter interests me, and even in a fictional take I thought it would be fun. What a slog. What terrible writing. And the repetition and redundancy. If I had to read one more time about the cafeteria being closed (hard to suspend disbelief, in a large hospital it's only open two hours a day?, but whatever) and the labyrinthine setup of the hospital, over and over. Finally, I stopped caring and just started paging through to get to the end of the book, hoping for some quick summing up. Not a chance. Did this author not have an editor? Don't waste your money. If you think you're going to enjoy it, borrow a copy or download it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't impressed","review":"I had read positive reviews on this site so I decided to pick the book up but I wasnt thrilled at all. It was uneventful and slow moving and for the book to take 500 plus pages to finally get moving is way too much to ask.I kept expecting a Great payoff after a slow start but it never happend."},{"rating":"1","title":"READING THIS BOOK CAUSED ME A NDE","review":"I've read several of Connie Willis' books - To Say Nothing of the Dog; Doomsday Book; BellWeather - and I enjoyed them all immensely. So as I read Passage, I kept waiting for the book to hold my interest, and by the time I got to the end of the book I felt cheated to realize I had just finished reading a very silly story with flat characters, inane dialogue, and a pointless plot. Although the premise of the story is very intriguing, I just don't feel as though Willis had done anything worthwhile with her idea. Passage had none of the intelligence that Willis brought to her other books. If you are looking for a good book, don't pick this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rasberries","review":"Damn! So many pages, such a rotten payoff! This book is limp. I have loved CW's books, but this one must have been for the publisher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OH Please!","review":"Do not waste your time on this book! You'll see more flushed out characters in Dr. Seus than in this absurd novel about near death experiences. My favourites (not) are Dr. Hunk - aka Richard Wright and the Dickensian sick kid Maisie. The plot is largely made up of people describing in tedious detail how they got from one hospital department to another or what great lengths certain characters go to avoid other characters, leading up to a truly banal conclusion that is particularly long in coming because it is so hard to stay awake while reading this tripe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and predictable","review":"Based on a very weird premise, Willis tries for tension but achieves only tedium. The characters are not plausible, the plot is too easy to predict, and the whole is unsatisfying.I just hope I never have a near-death experience. I wouldn't want to run into any of the cardboard characters in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poorly told","review":"After \\"Doomsday Book,\\" I swore I'd never read Willis again. But the topic here - near-death experiences - seemed interesting, so i gave her another chance. Well... same ol' stuff, really. This is a wonderful story, hard to put down, with some engaging characters, and some good-sounding scientific speculation, and a truly haunting payoff. At the same time, it's an incredibly irritating read, full of characters and situations whose only purpose is to get in the way and annoy the poo out of the main characters and, I assume unintentionally, the reader. Connie Willis may be the world's most annoying story-teller. Her stories are told in a setting of non-stop frantic, frenetic, and frenzied mayhem, and almost all of it is petty, silly, everyday dreck that just kills the narrative. So. Once again, great story idea, terribly told. And this one really could have earned an \\"A.\\" Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to meet a deadline","review":"I was enjoying the book Passage, keeping the pace of page turning while waiting for more! But the more never came. I was so disappointed when I reached the end and didn't get #1 a finality to the plot, nor a reasonable ending. This was the first book I have read by Connie Willis and picked it up due to a review and the fact she lives 10 minutes from my home. I think with the way it ended Connie had a deadline to meet and abruptly ended it. I must admit I gave the book to my niece with the suggestion of using it in her book club in Breckenridge. I feel it is a great book to discuss and rewrite. I enjoyed the characters very much and felt they were well defined only abused by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Wow, did this book need some editing. I think cutting two-three hundred pages would have done this book a world of good. I was drowning,(excuse the pun)in the minutiae of Joanna's life, which really slowed the book down. Are writers getting paid by the word again?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately needs an editor","review":"I read this book shortly after its release and was terribly disappointed by it tedious length, her unfunny and tangential attempts to place screwball comedy in the narrative, but mostly by the intellectual dishonesty. She writes scathingly of the new age researcher who seeks evidence of afterlife in NDEs and thus 'spoils' her subjects for any further research, and then expects us to believe that most people experiencing NDEs visualize the Titanic. I didn't post at the time because, well, even the best writers can have an off project, but I am 50 now pages into Blackout, and ready to put it down. It suffers the same problem with bloat and unrestrained and unfunny screwball elements. Willis has obviously reached the point of success where she is no longer receiving strong feedback from editors who can work with an eye toward readability, and not cave in awe of an acclaimed writer. It's a pity. Willis's talent has been eclipsed by her schtick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlong and frustrating","review":"While there is some nice writing in this book and it gets off to a good start, eventually the endlessly repeated details about the characters' daily tasks is tedious. And don't get me started on the letdown that makes the last 300 or so pages an ordeal. After investing around 500 pages of reading time, I felt I had to finish, even though I skimmed the last 300 pages and missed nothing that I could see. The end leaves you with no satisfaction whatsoever. This could easily have been edited by at least 300 pages. It went immediately to the used book store after I threw it across the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been an non-fiction book instead","review":"Miss Willis' explanations of the NDE phenomenon--scientific and otherwise--were food for thought. That, to me, was all that was good about this book. The characters were one-dimentional. Joanna Landers did not interest me and her internal dialogues were repetitive. I repeat, her internal dialogues were repetitive. Richard Wright's characterization was \\"a really cute doctor\\" and he always sounded like he was reading some sort of scientific journal. Then there's this young girl, Maisie, who was nothing more than character reciting a collection of great disasters. Same with this guy who keeps talking about the Yorktown. Mr. Mandrake was a stereotype. Great characters define a good novel, and none of Miss Willis' characters were interesting. I would've gotten the same satisfaction from reading about NDEs (and great disasters) in a non-fiction book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coloradoan Kafka?","review":"Three comments for those considering buying this book: Reading Passage is an often exhilarating/maddening experience - 9/10ths of the way through I felt a lot like I did while reading The Castle or Amerika, an unbearable but addictive feeling. I thought during the last 1/10th of the book Willis's grasp of the material slipped a little, but not off-puttingly so. I think her best work is Fire Watch and Lincoln's Dreams, for those who haven't read her before - but this is a characteristic, daring, original book that I recommend to anyone willing to be seized and shaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Near Death Experience Just Reading This Book","review":"Other reviewers have written of its tedious attributes which I strongly echo. After 200 pages I wish I had started counting the number of times she avoided the; answering machine, pager, person, hallway, closed cafeteria, etc. Where was the editor during the manuscript review?Connie Willis has written a number of excellent books, as are noted in these reviews. This one is a real dud. I stopped reading at 300 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connie Willis does it again","review":"I have been a Connie Willis fan ever since I read \\"The Doomsday Book.\\" I've read that one 3 times. I was not disappointed with \\"Passage.\\" As usual, she draws you in and then turns things around. Great characters, great plot, well-researched, well written. You can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed...","review":"I wanted to like this book, but the characters fell flat, and the narrative felt forced. The concept behind it was interesting, but its exposition was prolonged and read like, well, exposition. I wish Willis had cut the book by half and then re-written it with good writing in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Message to Connie....","review":"Connie,in the book, one of the NDE characters is a Navy Veteran who cannot stop talking & rambling. Our heros, Joanna & Dr. Wright, are always trying to get him to shut up. And yet......this book rambles on and on about trivial things that do not add to the story. How many times do we need to hear about the confused map of the hospital or the cafeteria never being open. Good God, this 780 page book could have been a tight read at 200 pages.I'd go on with my scathing review, but then I'd be a hypocrite.One more thing: the purpose of this is to encourage you to be more succint in the future.Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed to be about 1/3rd shorter","review":"I really wanted to like this, but I couldn't finish it. About 4/5ths of the way through, after the last tedious plot twist I finally decided this wasn't fun any more, and not even worth reading to find out the ending. Her writing really needed tightening. She overindulged in extensive passages with lots of technical jargon, labored needlessly over character development, and after the nth foray onto the dream Titanic, where she seemed to go about a foot further every time, it was just too much for me. Often she seemed like she was writing for neurologists who were Titanic buffs, which is an awfully small target audience. I am actually fascinated by neuroscience and psychology, and it was starting to bore me. Those of you who aren't all that into it, I can't imagine would like it better. I also did not feel the obvious jabs at the Titanic film, although I too didn't like it, were really necessary, and they kind of knocked me out of the book's world each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this!","review":"This is one of the most fascinating and gripping novels of it's type that I've read in awhile, and a great exploration of what \\"dying\\" means without falling into New Age hokum. Plus, I'll admit I didn't see the book's surprises coming. Great characters, great plot and a damn great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitious","review":"Connie Willis is a decent storyteller with an extremely limited vocabulary. \\"Confabulating\\" appears at least a dozen times, as the single term to describe filling in memory gaps by fabrication. But that is just a striking example of what is altogether scratchy prose. Ms. Willis' writing is laudatory for a junior high school student.The book, about near death experiences, is repetitious to the extreme. The main characters are clueless doctors. There were many opportunities to explain medical constructs which Ms. Willis skips over to instead pursue the senseless scurrying of her lead character.If you like science fiction, there's not much to like here. If you like character development, there's not much to like here. If you like an intriguing plot, you've chosen the wrong book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a lot of filler!","review":"Connie Willis, whom I usually trust to turn out something interesting, did indeed turn out something interesting... The idea this book puts forth is fasinating, but it shouldn't have taken six hundred pages... This is a mystery story featuring the dull. Wait for the paperback, or better yet, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boggled by the raves","review":"I read a glowing review of this Book on Salon--a source I respect--so I felt fairly confident that I'd enjoy it. Instead, I found myself bogged down in a surfeit of unnecessary details and overworked themes (how many times are these people going to get lost in the hospital, for Pete's sake?) True, I was a little surprised by the culminating events, but I had a real problem with the author's take on near death experiences as versions of early 20th century disasters. If this is the case, then what did someone like Jesus see when he met his end?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A somewhat interesting look into the mind's inner workings","review":"I was completely underwhelmed with this story from an author that I'd heard such good things about. I kept thinking as I read that the story had it the limited creativity and imagination of a Lifetime made-for-TV-movie.I gave the book two stars instead of just one because of the interesting way Willis detailed how memory works and how the human brain deals with death.Unless you have a dying need to read fiction related to Near Death Experiences, I'd pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"As a fan of historical fiction, I first read Willis' \\"Doomsday Book\\" -- it was interesting, engaging and well-written. After reading it, I couldn't wait to get my hands on another Connie Willis book. Unfortunately the next one I picked up was\\"Passage\\".It was awful -- Don't bother reading it! Some of her ideas were interesting, and at first I thought it would be quite good. But then the crazy Titanic connection came up. It was hard for me to swallow -- I found it laughable and (for lack of a better word) LAME! Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this disaster of a book--pick up Doomsday instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One","review":"Fortunately, like some other intelligent reviewers, I stopped reading this exercise in tedium after about 300 pages and snuck a peek at the ending. What a waste of time, for reasons other reviewers have clearly used in their comments. Also fortunately, I know Willis is an excellent writer (judging from her short stories) and I will not let the crashing bore that is Passage deter me from reading some of her other novels. As for this one, skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Pain and Anguish.","review":"After reading Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog, I couldn't wait to start reading Passage. Unfortunately, after struggling through three hundred pages of the main characters constant \`rehashing' I realized I was wasting my time. I skimmed the next fifty pages, decided it wasn't worth skimming, read the last chapter and threw it in the trash so nobody else could read it. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a wretched book","review":"I loved Doomsday Book. When I saw another Connie Willis book, I bought it without question. How disappointed I was. It starts off with pages after pages of contrived impediments to two main characters meeting and getting together. Then it moves on to hundreds of pages of \\"oohh if I could just think of something.\\" Back and forth, driving around and back, doing the same thing over and over again. We have two MDs who are supposed to be smart, but they are so willfully ignorant that they can't learn anything about anything. AARGH! I finally gave up after about five hundred pages. I skimmed the rest of the book to confirm that it was going to be as tedious and boring as the first part. It was! Into the trash can! With a good editor, this book could have easily been reduced to a hundred pages or less. It might have been good then. As it was it was a terribly overlong, contrived, tooth extraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compulsive Reading","review":"Connie Willis fans will navigate some familiar territory in this book. The obsessed hero/heroine and the infuriating secondary characters with a gift for getting in the way of their quest. Sometimes the plot bogs down under the heavy weight of it all. Despite that, this is still the most moving, unforgettable book I've read in a long time.Prior reviews have done a good job of describing the plot without spoilers. Suffice it to say that this is a story that will keep you turning the pages well past midnight. At times you will be tempted to read ahead but for God's Sake don't! Other times you will think you have figured out where this story is headed. Guess what? You probably figured wrong.The night I purchased it, I was warned by the bookseller, \\"Do not start the last 100 pages unless you can read them uninterrupted. Truer words have never been spoken. Heed this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book is primarily one thing: Long-winded and boring. Even the \\"shocking turning-point\\" and \\"revelation\\" towards the end are trivial and contrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book from Connie Willis","review":"Really 4 1/2 stars. Another wonderful book from Connie Willis. Definitely reminded me of Bellweather, rather than \\"Doomsday Book\\" or \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog,\\" but without the rather unsatisfying ending (IMHO) of Bellweather.I personally would recommend one not read about the details of the plot etc. I myself pre-ordered it without any idea of the plot and thought that it was much more satisfying without any preconceptions or plot hints.If you enjoy Connie Willis I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"I just finished reading this book- all 700+ pages of it. I don't normally pay attention to page length, but I kept having to reassure myself I was getting closer to the end. Where to start? Before this I read Belwether by Connie Willis- a funny, interesting book. So i picked up this one thinking it would be as good. Instead, at around 400 pages in, it became unbearable. The narrative was long, rambling, confusing, and i found myself wishing the narator would get some counseling, or just shut up. She did neither. I slogged through the middle, hoping the story would tie together or at least lessen my frustration. Nope. The end was open-ended, contrite and completely unsatisfying. Don't waste any brain power on this one, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuchs is right","review":"Fuchs, first reviewer wrote: \\"Connie Willis is by far my favorite author and I am disappointed to say that this book doesn't hold up to her best work. If you are new to Connie Willis, by all means pick up \\"Doomsday Book\\" first...\\". Unfortunately I read Passage first and readily admit to being under-whelmed. Maybe she is better than this book--when I find the time I may try the others that Fuchs recommends. But this book was a long time getting to very little."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a twist...","review":"Yes, the book is slow. In fact, I really didn't like it the first time I read it... at least, until I got through the first couple hundred pages.Then I read it again.This book is full of both wry AND black humor, lots of scientific technobabble, and enough twists and turns and \\"oh, I know this I know this oh what is this\\" on-the-tip-of-my-tongue suspense. The twist at the end of (I believe) Part Two, when Joanna finally figures out what's going on, stopped me in my tracks. It is worth waiting for.Another interesting part of the book, often overlooked, is the labyrinthine nature of the hospital in which Joanna and her colleagues work, and the kender-like nature of Richard, who always seems to have what's needed.This book is worth getting and reading, several times, until you're sure you've got it. Then read it again; you'll be certain you missed something good. Buy this book. Right now.I'm not kidding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on","review":"Being a former critical care nurse this was of interest to me. The subject is almost taboo in this culture.

Her reseach was right on."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELLOOOOOO, EDITORS?","review":"This is still another book read in recent months that sorely needed editing. Does a reader really need repeated tedious references to the intricacies of the hospital's corridors? I got the idea after the initial explanation.Whenever I'm hit over the head with repeated narrative, I always feel as though this is done simply to pad the text.

It's really that bad, it's almost an insult to the band that this guy made the video. He act's like he's the bands friend, but has never met them. He interviews people that knew them before they were big and the say like, \\"yeah I was at a bar once and a band was playing the I think was named korn or something and If i remember right I pretty sure they sounded good\\" So you get the idea, don't buy the video unless you want to throw your money away. Email me and I will send it to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unexpected","review":"this dvd has no interviews with korn and no live performaces...thats why is has this titile"},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?","review":"I am a HUGE KoRn fan, so you can only imagine how POed I was when I saw this. The video doesn't even have the band, except for one part, which is 1/2 a mile away from the band. Plus, the host tries to be tough and cool by cursing, but he ends looking like a total jack-ass.

So i wanted to get every dvd/CD related to them. Then i bought it. It told me all the same info that i already knew before. I though it would at least have 1 interview with them, well it dosen't. I would rate this dvd lower than a 1 star but i can't. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Good","review":"I got this dvd without researching whats on it. I regreted it afterwards. Its not good, its not bad though either. Now a biography tape might sound good, you think that there will be interviews with the members, concert footage, and other stuff like that. But then i got it and it ended up to be a documentary. I was really dissapointed. Even though the information is really interesting, the person they have presenting it gets really annoying. You do get to see a lot of cool pictures though. I have this on dvd. Whats good about that is it has a trivia game which you should play only after the movie is over. If your a big koRn fan you might find some enjoyment out of this film like I did. But even alot of koRn fans will think this really sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's an insult to korn","review":"I bought not the vhs, but the dvd of this worthless peice of film.

Louisa was (we are led to believe) an early feminist, with frustrated longings. Gabriel is a mixed up rake. Their sexual fencing is boring and unreal. The submarine was the only really interesting part of the book.

(Which incidently I never mailed) Never Trust a Rake is so unlike her earlier writing that it's hard to believe it's the same author. I couldn't even finish the book. The story was uninspired and contrived. The writing was poor. The hero/heroine were never developed to any realistic degree. Their pasts didn't seem to shape their characters beyond their marked distaste for each other. I couldn't understand why Gabriel was so constantly \\"snarky\\" to Louisa. His character was totally one-dimensional. Ditto for Louisa. They snapped at each other throughout the book, and all I kept asking myself was WHY? 2 stars because the book held me for at least the first half. Barely. Anyone interested in reading what Ms. Putman is capable of should pick up a copy of A Passionate Performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so story, minor characters more interesting than hero!","review":"This was a disappointing book from Eileen Putnam. Although it had some amusing moments, overall I really could not get particularly interested in either Louisa or Gabriel. The scene another reviewer mentioned, where she stripped naked and demanded that he make love to her, was just totally beyond all credibility. As for the crazy rescues, the narrative was too improbable for words.The only really interesting characters in this book were David and Violet, and we saw far too little of their romance. Violet is the victim of a brutal marriage, pregnant by her husband's last rape of her; David is a traumatised ex-prisoner of the French, who believes he is incapable of being with a woman. Their courtship is beautiful, though far too little is shown, and I wish Putnam had concentrated on this rather than Gabriel and Louisa, who I really did not like at all.As for the submarine stuff... BORING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have Plan 9 from outer space rifftrax. I bought this dvd because it stated live. I thought there would be new riffs like they had done with reefer madness, but it was the same riff as the regular plan 9 rifftrax. There are some shorts and even music? For me at least the shorts were'nt that good. I would not have bought this If I knew the movie would be exactly the same.

I love the length of each kettlbell set/round in Kettlebell Lightning and they blend well together; I feel so accomplished after completing each one (takes about an hour an one minute, including the stretch and cool down).Her partner on this one, Alex Verdugo, is great. This was my introduction to him and I hope he does more work with Lauren or something on his own. Both of their cues and instructions are clear and encouraging. I rotate this workout among several others that I have; I'm always glad when it's time for me to complete it again.Five stars indeed.(Note: I haven't tried the indian club routine, but I might purchase some clubs for my birthday; a good reason to try something new...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauren Brooks Kettlebell Lightning with Alex Verdugo DVD","review":"A no nonesense routines and instructions.

Unfortunately. they were mistaken. By trying to cover both knitting & crocheting, the author doesn't give adequate coverage to either one. The instructions are not nearly detailed enough.

This book should have been split into separate books for each craft so more detail could be given for each one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for learning to knit/crochet! A real bargain!","review":"I am a new knitter and a fairly inexperienced crocheter. I was looking for a book to help me learn both skills, and this one delivered. It is quite a bargain for those looking for books that cover both knitting and crocheting.I love that it has specific tips and problem-solvers spread throughout the text. It helped me learn what I was doing wrong. It shows illustrations of all new techniques being described and photos of what different stitch patterns should look like which is really helpful for a beginner. It has a glossary and an abbreviations list. It includes a resource list for websites, magazines and yarn companies.I love this book and would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn to knit and/or crochet.

However, I have forgotten a lot of things since then. So I purchased this book to get some reviews. This book is extremely helpful along with a two hour class I took on knitting. The two hour class got me started again, and this book refreshed me on the more detailed things such as increase and decrease. This book is very basic, it doesn't teach much else beyond the basic types stitches. So if you want patterns, either look online or get another book. And if you have never knitted before and want to learn how to knit, I suggest either look for videos online or take a two hour knitting class. This book however, will be helpful in terms of after you have already learned how to cast on, knit, purl, and cast off. The book is in black and white if I remember correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adequate for the basics","review":"Some people have complained that this book wasn't in-depth enough for them... Well, the book is a guide! It doesn't claim to be an all-inclusive, comprehensive text. But it is definitely a great reference tool to learn the sheer basics. The illustrations and accompanying descriptions for learning the crochet and knit stitches are very good. Previously, seeing a pattern for a project would have intimidated me. Now I can understand them and have successfully created some articles that I'm very proud of.To get you started, I would recommend this book. It's quite convenient to have to different styles of stitching in a single book. I have found it to be quite handy as I continue learning to perfect my crocheting and knitting skills.Again, it's just a primer into these beautiful arts. You can't expect to become an expert overnight, but you will be able to tackle easy and intermediate projects for sure. I suppose it all depends on our individual learning styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"Great book , bid with confidence,This book is great for beginners.yes it is the bestThis is all i no to say about it"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Start But Not Beginning","review":"This book does attempt to provide detail information for beginners (I being one of them). It has great information on the basics such as types of yarns, gauges, understanding of the types of stitches, and so on. However,the pictures that accompany some of the stitches aren't always visually clear to understand because they are in two different colors (red and blue). I had hoped to find full color instructions but was sadly disappointed. The publishers should have spent the money for colored pictures in the instructions not the patterns."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK book...and old too","review":"This book did provide some pretty good pieces of information to take away, but unfortunately, the rest of the book is pretty poor.

I got sick and tired of reading about this new invention called the internet and how you can actually trade on it and so forth. If a book is any good, it ought to be updated periodically.

The children in these families strive to gain the attention of the parents by meeting the parents needs and never develop the ability to recognize their own needs or learn how to get them met. Dysfuntional families are everywhere. God uses Dysfunctional Families to accomplish His will. This Book,The Story Of A Dysfunctional Family: Dysfunctional Families Of The Bible--Jacob, is the story of the dysfunctional family that God used to bring salvation to the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are a Treasure","review":"It is rare to find a book that speaks so clearly and powerfully. I place it as one of my top ten books of all time--it is that good. The book is a framework to understand and make some sense of many puzzling, seemingly unrelated events. It has enabled me to put together the many pieces of a lifelong puzzle. The authors spoke to me and I thank them. What a find!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A clearly written and insightful book.","review":"I'm adding this to my small, but growing collection of books on Adult Children of Dysfunctional Families. This book is expensive compared to many of the $10-$15 books on the market, but I think it is so clearly written and helpful that it is well worth the extra price. I also liked that the author is kindly. Also, her patients make big strides in recovery and that is definitely inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"By examining case studies, the authors of The Narcissistic Family demonstrate that some families, that might be considered normal functioning from the outside, are in fact, operating narcissistically, and can have a disabling emotional impact on a child - showing that it isn't only overt emotional or physical abuse that causes long term dissociation and harmful behaviour.The reader gets a close up and revealing look at the formation of narcissistic behaviour and tendencies, and the negative thought loops associated with them that can lead to depression.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good overview of issues in narcissistic families","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. The authors clearly outline what happens in the narcissitic family.

This book is hands down the best book I've ever read to describe how narcissism affects a family. As the child of two narcissistic parents, this book helped me to understand things that hadn't made sense and accept some difficult truths. It is unique in that it deals with a narcissistic family system rather than focusing just on the narcissist. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST FOR ANYONE WITH A FAMILY( EVERYONE)","review":"Well, let me start by saying the book is great, but be careful why you're reading it, the book will take you to a rollercoaster ride as you start identifying your own childhood issues, as in my case,my therapist recommended I read it, But get prepared emotionally to cry, to vent outwith a friend, to take it slowly, because I started having a bad reactionon the first couple of chapters, why I say is great, because all of us have issues to work through and hopefully in the case of people who have children you dont repeat this pattern with them, in my case I dont, but this book gave me much needed knowledge to understand the mistakes my parents made, how I can heal, and how to notdo this to my kids the day I have them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beethoven Coffee Table Book with Distinction","review":"This Book from 1970 will look good on your coffee table or on your record shelf (it measures 12\\" by 12\\" - same as an LP).

What a mistake. The book is poorly written and the dialog is straight out of this century...not the 18th century. The characters are thin at best, the story trite and the reasoning ridiculous. Someone needed to take the screenwriter out and beat them, not make a movie out of the script. Also, they needed to find someone who could actually write a period piece to give the reader the flavor of the time...something they failed to do here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assume you know too much.","review":"This book is just too thin on substance to suit me. Too often do I come up dry when searching for a particular \\"how do I do this\\" for a maintenance or repair subject. It just doesn't go in depth enough even though it says it is built on a complete tear down of the vehicle. I actually have 2 books by this publisher each for a different vehicle and they are extremely close. I think there is a formula they use where they plug in just enough to make it appear vehicle specific. The areas of generalities such as basic overhaul are covered pretty solid in this book however; if you dont know a lot and are looking for a book to lead you through a repair then you will be better served to look elsewhere. Much better books are available here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent headphones at a reasonable price","review":"I purchased these headphones to use with my personal and work laptop. Given the price (under $10) I figured that I couldn't go wrong. The headphones are light, fairly comfortable, and provide decent sound quality. My one complaint would be that the headband doesn't hold the earphones tight enough to the ears - causing some leak of sound.Don't expect to be blown away by these headphones, but you also won't have to break your budget to purchase them.

A seam in the metal directly below the sprinkler head was split, so a constant stream of water squirted out of the base. And the black cap attached to the spike base was cracked, so water also squirted out from there. I attached the sprinkler head to a different base and it works great now. So, as sold the product was useless, but could be fixed by purchasing a new spike base or using one from a different sprinkler."},{"rating":"2","title":"An infectious mobilizing motivator","review":"This book rocked my world(view)!

This is the only historical book she has written, and while the period information is not very believable, the change in era is not the real issue. The characters do not seem in the least realistic, the chemistry between them is not very strong, and the story development is weak. I also did not like the secondary characters in this novel.

In the 80's, it was common to have abusive, emotionally unavailable heroes, and that's what the hero is in this novel. The heroine is childish and spiteful in her obsession to obtain her family home. In short, you have two pretty dislikable characters who misunderstand, fail to communicate, and deliberately attempt to control and to \\"top\\" each other. In defense of the book, I did, however finish it; I just didn't really enjoy it much. Ms Phillips has come a long, long way in her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your typical SEP book","review":"I have read nearly everything Susan Elizabeth Phillips has written and really like her work. I, however, did not enjoy this story, as I am not a big fan of historical romances, so I just couldn't finish it. If you're a fan of SEP's contemporary romances, just be aware that this isn't one of them. I also don't enjoy stories where there is so much aggression from the male protagonist. I know SEP typically shows hostility turning to warmth in her heros, but I had an especially hard time liking this guy, even after only reading the first third of the book. I guess I just don't like to see women getting walked on, and it definitely happened here.

From eary childhood not to know love and to learn how to survive without it and to carry that shield with you until adulthood until it starts to crumble, that is the story that Susan Elizabeth Phillips gives us. I can't wait for another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I love Susan Elizabeth Phillips, and was very excited to pick up her newest. Except that it's not new. \\"Just Imagine\\" is a reworking of an earlier novel, set in the South after the Civil War. In her preface, she explains that she had fun working again with an un-PC setting, but sorry, even with black characters with brains and ambition, I can't get around the fact that I'm supposed to cheer for a main character who owned slaves and who would have gone on owning slaves had not war intervened. The heroine, although \\"plucky,\\" is a spoiled brat and and a little too much like Scarlett O'Hara for me to bond with her. Especially after reading her contemporary romances, I remained unmoved by the heroine, the situation, and the love affair.My suggestion? Buy the book used or take out of your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I love Susan Elizabeth Phillips' newer work. The \\"football\\" series are among my favorite books ever. I read very quickly and my authors can never keep up, so I re-read books over and over. That said, I threw this book away after the first time I read it.The characters are completely unsympathetic, and the plot line is contrived and ridiculous. I didn't care what happened and in fact was kind of rooting for the heroine to end up alone - not what you want to have in a romance novel.Read almost ANYTHING else by SEP and you'll get an enjoyable story and engaging characters. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ew","review":"I love practically every single one of the Susan Elizabeth Phillips books I've read so far, except this one. This is the only book by her, that I had trouble finishing. The book seemed like a sexier rewrite of Gone With the Wind, where Rhett and Scarlet get together. I enjoyed the beginning of the novel where the main character disguises herself as a boy, but after that point (about the first quarter of the book) everything else went downhill. The plot seemed very contrived and the writing rather stagnant.

I skipped through some of it to pick up something of interest and found myself immediately tired of Kit being small in stature, anger, mouthiness and immaturity. I couldn't feel comfortable with Baron falling in love with a person he thought was a fourteen year old. It was really a boring piece of work that has been played out in so many novels. I read other reviews and may try the author again but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Save your bucks since books are so expensive these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Susan Elizabeth Phillips really write this?","review":"I was completely dumbstruck by this book, \\"Just Imagine\\". This was definitely not one of Phillips' better books. So if you are a first time reader of her, please try her other books. Where this one lacked laugher and imagination, her other books will inspire and promote you to reread it just to make sure the good parts were not missed the first time through them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very fulfilling. It was ok, but so far my least favorite of her books.","review":"The characters and plot weren't that good. Maybe it was due to being one of her early works. This story was first printed in 1984 and titled \\"Risen Glory.\\" It was reprinted in 2001 with the current title. This book lacks her witty dialogue which I love in her later books.CAUTION SPOILER: I didn't understand the characters during their marriage as to why they were so cold to each other. I didn't care for her actions in the end to prove her love to him. It seemed that they got back together too easily without resolving the prior coldness.DATA:Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: about four. Just after the Civil War on a southern plantation. Copyright: 1984.

If you have never read one of this author's books, don't start here. Cardboard characters, ridiculous potboiler of a plot, incorrect details throughout which distract (somewhat mercifully) from the period mood, leaden dialogue - there is nothing good to say about this, other than perhaps writing it showed Ms. Phillips the error of her ways and opened the door to her later, far, far better work.If you are an avid reader of her books, leave this one of your list to avoid admiration for this author. Anyone who is not willing to overlook straight out bad writing should avoid the book altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out Great, but turned Cold, Dark, and Unlikable","review":"This book lacked for nothing at first. Kit was adorable and beautiful and Baron was sensitive and gentle. So why did Kit and Baron turn to ice? After they became lovers, they turned vicious towards each other. I can't figure out why the author did this. There was never a good explanation as to WHY this happened, either. Who wants to read about two characters who dislike each other that much?By mutual consent, Kit and Baron put unexplained personal animosity aside in order to sleep together. Meanwhile, the unexplained rage continued to build. I started dreading the rest of the story, but stuck with it in deference to SEP. There would have to have been at least a drop of love between these two in order to have the sort of ending SEP gave us.The slavery issue was unfortunately accurate, but there's no way Sophronia would have ended up so blessed in the end, not with such ignorance in the world during that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"When I purchased this CD holder at first, it seemed to be a lovely solution to my DVD and CD problems!
