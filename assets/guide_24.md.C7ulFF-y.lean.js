Not long after the warranty period was over, the camera starting rewinding film in the middle of the roll, then started refusing to wind film at all, all the while flashing a meaningless \\"E\\" in the display. The camera shop said it would cost $100 just to open it up to look at it, and then give an estimate. So I've got a $300 piece of electronic junk sitting in my drawer. I wrote to Olympus and received no reply. Why should I - the camera's out of warranty. Well, I'm back to using the old XA, which is a gem. But my next point and shoot camera won't be an Olympus."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Style than Substance . . .","review":"I agree entirely with the reviewer from Germany - and actually had the EXACT same trouble with my camera, at nearly the EXACT same time! At just about a year, the camera became completely unreliable in its rewinding ability - rewinding on its own in the middle of a roll, or even worse,incompletely rewinding at the end of a roll, but indicating that it was completely rewound (and then THAT roll of film is toast!)Yes, it's sexy. And it attracts alot of attention. But just like all eye candy - it's great for a one-night stand, but not anything you'd want to be married to . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pictures","review":"I've had this camera for over a year now and have only one complaint. The buttons to enter date and time are extremely awkward to use. Other than that this camera is great.

The dispenser works well; you just pull the tape out to whatever length you want and rip. I have not had any problems with the tape getting off the guides and rejoining the rest of the reel of tape. The tape is fairly heavy duty (thickness), and it seems of good quality. What I really like about it is IT STICKS VERY WELL TO ALMOST ANYTHING. The downside is if you put it on a piece of paper and you later want to remove it, forget it. It isn't going to happen. (In other words the adhesion factor is very high.) I think it is a great product. Other tapes work reasonably well; this works extremely well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it stick? Mine doesn't!","review":"Maybe I bought the wrong tape type.

But does strong mean anything when it can't stick to a box at all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps I got a bad one...","review":"Everyone else seems to love this packing tape; perhaps I got one from a bad batch? Mine has almost *no* adhesive power - it feels as if it's sticking by static electricity alone. You can pull it off the cardboard incredibly easily; it barely even sticks to your skin, when you're working with it.** Note that I bought it from a local RiteAid pharmacy, not Amazon. **"},{"rating":"1","title":"HARD TO USE","review":"I found this product very hard to use. To start the tape I had to struggle with the tape to get is started and lost a lot of tape in the beginning because it would not start properly and only half the tape came off. Then I had to struggle to keep the tape flowing as I taped a box together. Being a former Army wife I have moved many times and have used packaging tape more times than I would like to think about and this tape was the worst I have seen. It is too bulky, hard to start, hard to remove protective cardboard from blade. All in all I would not buy this tape dispenser again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scotch Super Strength Packaging Tape Rocks!","review":"Scotch Super Strength Packaging Tape is the ultimate in shipping tapes. It cuts clean when you are ready to use the dispenser's strip cutter. It doesn't get balled up and force you to untangle it as you are holding your package closed. It is accepted by the US Mail on most of their official packing boxes as reinforcement. It stays secure, even when wet. What more could you want from a packaging tape? Sturdy, dependable and easy to use. This tape is the one to turn to when you need a tape to count on! Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super sized tape dispenser","review":"You have seen the smaller Scotch Packaging tape dispensers? Well this is its big brother.It uses full sized rolls of clear package tape, almost 2 inches wide and you have 38 yards to work with, so you won't be running out too fast. It starts very easily, pulls and tears with little effort as well.Now, if I had a lot to tape, I would get a tape gun, but if you are just taping the occasional box for eBay or ship to family or friends, this is an item you will want in your desk drawer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good tape, decent medium duty dispenser","review":"There is no question that this is high quality tape. Thick, with good tack, it does a great job of sealing boxes. If anything, it may be overkill for everyday use.The dispenser is more problematic. It certainly works fine for sealing a box here and there. If you only plan to seal a small number of boxes you can probably save a few bucks with a smaller roll in a smaller dispenser. Although this dispenser if refillable, if you plan to seal a lot of boxes you might want to spend a few more dollars and buy a tape gun. Although a gun takes some experience to use smoothly, the handle makes it much more comfortable for extended use. If you'll just seal a box now and then, but you'll eventually use a full role tape, this item is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scotch Tape is strong!","review":"I've tried different brands of packaging tape, but Scotch is the best!

I will always use Scotch packaging tape because it is superior to other brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says on the label","review":"It's hard to get excited about packing tape, but this was a nice product. I ship a lot of boxes since I do so much buying and returning on the internet. The tape is very strong, it's clear which I prefer to the brown tape, and the dispenser is a huge help. It's awesome not having to have a scissors handy and go through that messy cutting and getting the tape all wound up in a ball process. It's good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST packing tape!","review":"I send out boxes of books daily, some boxes weigh up to 40 pounds and this tape holds up. I have tried store brands that are supposed to be similar but they really aren't as strong. The Scotch brand is very durable and you can buy refills of just the tape. It may cost a little more but it is well worth the extra money to have reliable, durable tape that will hold your package together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Strength Packing Tape","review":"Scotch has created some super strong packing tape. I tested it out by packing some heavy books into a weak box. The tape held the box together even when the box was tossed around and dropped. I only used one strip of tape to hold the box together and did not reinforce it with multiple tapings. The dispenser was easy to use and the tape did not roll back onto itself. I would definitely buy this tape for heavy duty jobs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Strong, Easy to Dispense, but not a Large Quantity","review":"I just received a Heavy Duty Clear Scotch Shipping Tape Dispenser, specifically, theScotch Super Strength Packaging Tape 3500, 1.88 Inches x 38.2 Yardsfrom Amazon. This is good tape! I've used other clear tape products in the past, some good, and some not good at all. This tape feels strong and when I taped up a box, it held really well. The amount of tape on the dispenser looks like it's not full though, so I didn't give this 5 stars. For most people, this would be a good size, but if you were packaging a lot of boxes, I think you'd want a larger roll. The plastic dispenser works well on this, a design that 3M has used for years on smaller rolls. As with all of these types of dispensers, be careful, the cutting edge is sharp. This dispenser can be refilled, and a new roll would easily be put into this holder (it was easy for me to remove the full roll, and easy for me to put it back into the dispenser)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's some tape with a so so dispenser friend","review":"Firstly I was disappointed this wasn't a single Malt. You'd think a company called 'Scotch' would think their business model through a little more carefully.Now this packing tape is uber strong, more so than other brands I've so I used less when testing it thus saving lots of cash so I can buy more monkeys. Now it's sticky on one side - but here's the clever bit... it's not sticky on the other side! So your parcel doesn't accrue a whole bunch of unwanted fur balls, hair, other boxes and deck chairs during transit. And so when your package arrives it doesn't look like a Katamari Damacy ball. Very thoughtful of Scotch to give us only one sticky side.The dispenser needs work. Anyone willing to offer it a job?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick It to Packages With This Tape!","review":"So I tried (and failed) to be clever with the title, but the bottom line is that this stuff works. It's been my go-to standard packaging tape for years. It's certainly much better than the sort of brown tape I used to use that would frequently tear down the middle.I'd have no qualms about using this tape to send your more precious cargo. I recently used it to package an item worth about $1000 and wasn't at all nervous that it would come undone in the mail.The dispenser isn't the best. It's good at helping you cut the tape, but imperfect for keeping tape ready for the next unroll: it has a tendency to roll backwards and stick back to the main roll, and it holds the tape in a way where it can get stuck to other things if the roll is thrown into a drawer or something. That said, what do you expect for a free dispenser that comes with a $10 roll of tape?"},{"rating":"1","title":"legend video","review":"I mainly bought this video because I use the poem \\"Casey at the Bat' in my social studies class, and I thought that the video would be a great reinforcement.

Velcro is the only thing which secures it in the back. It is a decent amount of it, but really??? Velcro never lasts long. I refuse to use it for anything because it's extremely temporary in its usability. So even if this did fit me I wouldn't have kept it for that reason.Other than that, if you have a young child who likes to run or hike, the water bottles do fit nicely.

This is a ramble of a book that is selfindulgence at its height. My best advice would be to not waste your time, the few times he begins to ask and discuss good questions (genetic predispositions of types of social behavior, social transmission of \\"memes\\" etc) he cops out and begins to pontificate and ramble on. I can see why it's out of print. I'm quite sure a few tribes would \\"vote him off the island\\" to quote another mindless mess.

At least he's trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad book","review":"Beyond Civilization is a bit beyond me. This book was written by Daniel Quinn and is focused on humans and their interactions with mother nature. Daniel does bring up some good points about what we are doing to earth and how other societies have worked. It seems to me that Quinn has a problem with civilization. He thinks that this is outdated and we should go back to a simpler time. I also agree on this with him. I believe that we humans should stop overextending ourselves. But this book is just not that good. It starts too read like a science journal, like he is just jotting down notes and facts. This style of writing really turned me off. I believe that this book may be one of the worst that I have ever read. That is not to say that this book does not have a good message. Other people may like but this is just not my cup of tea. Which is why I cannot recommend this book to be read at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Quinn's book was great until the last portion. He carefully crafted an opposing analysis of what civilization does for homo sapiens, presented his argument effectiviely, and then ended the book with a joke. And the punchline wasn't even funny. Although thought provoking, the book is a waste of time. There is nothing good in here that was not in Ishmael."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you read one book by DQ, don't make it this one","review":"So, I'm going to give away the book:There's more than oneway to live.There's also more than one book to read, and itshouldn't be this one. The first book I read by Daniel Quinn was _Ishmael_. I found it to be profoundly moving. However, _BC_ takes a good 10 page essay about living live better and makes it into a cheap book. My advice: Buy Ishmael. Read it. Then read it again. Then read _When Corporations Rule the World_ by David Korten. Then you'll be itching to change the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Civilization","review":"This book reminded me somewhat of a daily devotional in how it was written. Each thought was expressed on its own page with its own heading. I liked the layout of the book and the thoughts on society. He wanted society to go back to the tribal ways of living. He didn't want society to lose its technology, yet he wanted us to use it for different things. He also believed that tribes were stronger together and more efficient. I like the fact that he had these ideas, but they would never again work in todays society. We are far too advanced and independent as a people to degress back to the tribal ways of the Aztecs for example. I still liked the ideas expressed and they really made you contimplate.....what if?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep an eye on us, because we will save the world","review":"Reading the Ishmael trilogy (Ishmael, The Story of B, My Ishmael) is a life-changing experience in that it brings to light so many self-destructive aspects of our culture, but it leaves the reader hungering for an obscure, unnameable something. Beyond Civilization sates that hunger.Ishmael and successors laid out the ideas, and Beyond Civilization provides ideas of what to do with it. In a very real sense, it is a blueprint for saving the world (something now very high on my \\"to do\\" list.) It's also a quick, easily digestible read consisting of a series of brief, one-page essays. Simply put, Beyond Civilization is a quick, easy read that will continue what Ishmael started: that is, change your life drastically and beyond retrieval. I recommend it heartily."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always wonderful and inspiring","review":"I don't know if you have to read 'Ishmael' or another one first, but I have to say, that everyone's of Quinn's books is a mind-changing experience. He says the right things in the right way and changes mostly the life of his reader forever. He did this with me and I will be thankful forever for this.So, this the last one I've read from him and although it's quite thin and very fast read, it's wonderful.

Short chapters that waste lots of paper that doesn't really say much. Attacks upon \\"big programs\\" that actually do work despite Quinn's protests. Make analogies about \\"new ways of thinking\\". Blame civilization collapse on a conscious choice to return to old ways of living. All of these arguments are suspicious.Better just to state this: We need to drastically reduce human impacts upon the Earth. We need to decrease our footprint, decrease our numbers, roll back the concrete, let vast amounts of land return to a primitive state and distribute the wealth that is left in a just and equitable way.Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal and disappointing","review":"After reading Ishmael, one could only have high hopes for anything by Daniel Quinn. Beyond Civilization does not measure up to expectation. Quinn does a good job describing how we arrived at our current condition but fails utterly to paint a way out. Perhaps that is asking a bit much, but that is what \\"Beyond Civilization: Humanity's Next Great Adventure\\" promises but does not deliver. If anything, Quinn's \\"new tribalism\\" looks a lot like cooperatives from the 60s and 70s. The best examples he provides of a hopeful future is a traveling circus and embracing homelessness. I can hardly wait to explain to my children how the best hope is to run away and join the circus. Somehow I don't think this is the stuff the inspires revolution, or even evolution. Sorry, this one is a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daniel Quinn gone mad","review":"Daniel Quinn really got me with this particular novel. Not only do you have to be very open-minded to even get a little bit out of the novel, you also have to be willing to take in new ideas about life. The organization of this book is very mind-boggling. Daniel Quinn's major point in this book in my opinion is our wasteful tactics on biomass. He feels as though civilization is what's going to break us. Quinn feels as though we should take several steps back and rethink the idea of civilization and whether or not we should have it at all. Daniel Quinn tended to be very random and off the wall with his thoughts making it very hard to comprehend what he was really talking about. Therefore I wouldn't really recommend this novel to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes....","review":"After reading \\"Ishmael\\" and \\"Story of B\\" and viewing the \\"Food Production and Population Growth\\" video, I had high hopes for \\"Beyond Civilization\\". Unfortunately, I was very dissapointed. I don't think tribes will catch on or provide a solution to our current path of ecological suicide. In my opinion, Daniel Quinn is best at describing the ramifications of current issues/problems in a way that is easily understood. He is not as suited to providing solutions to those the problems. I believe that Paul Hawken's book, \\"The Ecology of Commerce\\" is a great solutions book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Civilization","review":"Daniel Quinn has laid out the only reasonable solution to the seemingly impossible problem of an industrial/military domination of the planet. Using our inability to serve ourselves as the trap in which we seem to find ourselves, our servants are herding increasing portions of dependant mankind into the corral of mother culture. Becoming independent of the debilitating conveniences too readily provided, as individuals and as tribes, we can finally abandon a bad idea at its roots as exemplified by other civilizations whose machinery sits idle beneath jungle root and desert sand while their populations persist in more local organizations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept but not worth a whole book","review":"In the bookstore I frequent this book was under social sciences, I think it would be better placed in the self help section as that is what it reads like.I give Quinn five stars for his message and creative thinking, but its not a great book. A very dramatic title pulls you in and it then starts out with a really interesting conceptual theory about civilization, in that it is not a natural state for humans to exist in, Quinn then goes on to suggest that tribes are a more natural state for us humans to belong to. I agree with his damning assesment of civilisation but I am not sure his mostly vague thoughts about new tribalism is really much of a solution to anyone.With every essay my initial excitement slowly ebbed away as the book went on and on without building too much on its central theme. When Quinn started writing about his own personal 'walk' from civilization was the point where I started skimming looking for a change in direction, it never came."},{"rating":"2","title":"just awesome","review":"Reading this book was/is one of the most profound experiences in my life.I always thought that I was an alienated misfit.There is life outside of our souless corporate pyramids.I intend to spend the rest of my life trying to jump the wall If there is anyone in the NW USA that feels the same way please contact me at my E-mail address"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick Read","review":"Daniel Quinn's book Beyond Civilization is quite a revolutionary read. It involves a kind of broken fuddled mix of views as if put in a non linear narrative sequence. The book offers much-views on how our civilization somehow took a left turn away from the way we were supposed to go.The author seems to compare that the only way for our true culture to survive in a peaceful way is too compare our existence to a circus. In that we should all have jobs and work together for the \\"boss\\" to get things done. But this idea seems as if it like communism.Another way in which Daniel writing seems communist is the fact that he wants to institute programs comparing them to sticks in the river. He says they don't change the flow so we should come up with something new. But to be quite honest his idea about a circus is just a \\"stick in the river\\".Overall the book is mildly interesting; if of course you want to know about how some people may think about our culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"We've been Humans for 100,000 years...","review":"An permanent addition to my collection of books that have provided profound and unique insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book is a great disappointment. While Quinn does indeed do a good job of tracing a lot of our contemporary problems to \\"civilization\\", he offers no realistic way out. His proposed solutions have been tried and failed. Nonetheless he protrays his \\"solutions\\" as if he has masterfully delivered to us a great and insightful way out of our dilemma. That type of writing, in fact, is why I gave the book two instead of three stars. The thing that I found most annoying about the book is the tone of almost condescending certainty that he displays about his diagnosis of and proposed solution to our present problems. It reminds one of the arrogance of the \\"academic elite\\" whose tunnel vision and blindness to other viewpoints has helped to spawn our cultural crisis in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"....","review":"Okay, Daniel Quinn has some exciting and new ideas. His beliefs might even shock some of you. .... I enjoy Quinn's work (possibly because when I first read \\"Ishmael\\" at age thirteen I realized that I wasn't the only one with \\"those kind\\" of feelings and beliefs about society and our culture in general), but that doesn't mean everything he writes is interesting, fresh, or even particularly well-written. \\"Beyond Civilization\\" is possibly the worst book I've ever read (aside from some of the *joys* from the mandatory reading lists shoved down students throats in the public school system)! Whatever insight you gain from this book can truly be gained by reading \\"Ishmael\\" or \\"The Story of B\\". Don't get caught up in the DQ hysteria, think for yourself ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond stupidity","review":"The fact that so many people seemed to like this tripe indicates that there need to be more courses in critical thinking in grade school. The author Quinn doesn't seem to have even a grade school understanding of science, logic, history or human culture. Of course since his audience apparently is educated solely from reading the Sunday supplement and the Oprah book club that is sufficient. Since trying to review this book requires more brain bleach than I have on hand I'll simply suggest reading:Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of ScienceAlan Sokal , Jean Bricmont"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for me too","review":"This book left me feeling very flat. I love the way he has written it and one page chapters are easy to read and the right thing for our short attention spans, but ultimately he just raises more questions than he answers. Then again, maybe that is what he strives to do. I guess the truth is that there are no easy answers to get us out of our predicament and we all, I think, need to take a good hard look at our own lives and simply figure out what we need to do to bring balance and functionality and awareness into the tiny circle that is our own immediate existence. I am giving up reading this sort of book. I really think our own answers are inside us, and we have to undertake the responsibility of figuring them out and acting on them, instead of looking for someone else to show us the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-Boggling","review":"Every page of this book will knock your socks off--plus it's just a delight to read. In Beyond Civilization, Quinn comes out from behind the dark glass of Ishmael to reveal his own face and speak with his own voice. This is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Attempt at old idea","review":"I picked this up because a friend recommended this author after reading Ishmael. After reading some reviews maybe I should have read his other boks first, but I didn't.This \\"book\\" is such a waste of money and time. I'm not going to even begin with the ridiculous formatting and structure of the book. The entire idea behind it could be summed up in a two page brochure. You'd be better off just watching/reading fight club or trainspotting or any movie or book that says screw materialism and capitalism. Maybe this would have been a revolutionary idea back in the 50s, but this is all old news, nothing shocking, nothing new. Save yourself the few hours you would have spent reading this and go for a walk instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"complainers with no answers","review":"I'm usually very open to books and ideas of ecotopian and different ways of life but Daniel Quinn greatly disappointed me. Some of his philosophical ideas were great but I felt he left us open to how we solve these problems. One thing I hate in the world today is how people complain about government and the world issues but don't have any solutions to the problems. This is exactly how I feel about Daniel Quinn. For those of you looking for more problems to complain about, this is definitely a book for you. Don't expect to read this book and find answers to problems though. It is true that he briefly says things here and there about how we could fix our problems, but they aren't in depth enough to really read into. For those of you that are into politics or are looking into politics, this book may be a good read for you. It will definitely give you different perspectives on how to handle the poor in this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure drivel","review":"It's books like this that make me embarrassed to have spent the better part of my life working in publishing. Muddle-headed thinking, disgraceful writing, pointless(ly trite) \\"Big Questions,\\" and equally pointless, not to mention vague and simplistic, Non-Answers--all these make up the meat and bone of this scrawny dog of a book. Just who does Quinn think he is, anyway? Cioran? Nietzsche? Somebody--perhaps his editor, if he or she had even bothered to read the manuscript for this Cliff Notes version of Kultur according to Reader's Digest--should have told the author that aphorism doesn't suit him. Come to think of it, neither does rigorous thinking.

Beyond Civilization","review":"This is a very interesting book not in a good way. I thought it was interesting because I didn't know someone could get praise for writing incomplete and outlandish ideas. I found it very interesting that Daniel Quinn felt it was necessary to tell his readers about his other book Ishmael. I was caught between trying to find out if this book had a point or was it advertising for his other novel. Once you get pass all of the ads and autobiography, you find that Quinn has compelling views. What was very interesting was the fact that he praises tribalism but his ideas are very scanty. His ideas are not very well thought out. It's like he an idea ran through his head and he jotted it down without even researching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing, yet something missing","review":"Daniel Quinn's idea of Humanity's Next Great Adventure is to abandon civilization. Or maybe it isn't. He actually wants you to take your own initiative. Or follow his plan. Really, he's not even sure what he wants from you, and I think it comes through in his writing...he's not exactly sure what he's getting at, he fails to hit a definite point.He brings up some very good points, provides good examples for them. He wants us to change, yet he doesn't provide the means. Yes, he does say that we have to figure things out for ourselves. Unfortunately I don't think that's what people want to hear. His idealism is admirable and believable to an extent. However, when you begin to question the structure of his outline for anti-civilization...it seems like it would give in rather quickly. This book was interesting, but not concrete enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metamorphosis Brings Awesome Change","review":"Metamorphosis is my favorite on Shade of the Son's new album \\"Handful of Biscuits.

Numerous photos of doomed aircraft with wings sheared off, gas tanks exploding, gaping holes caused by flak that are both spectacular and horrific. One cannot help but to wonder what these men were thinking in their last moments. Overall this is a good book; I think, though, that there aren't enough pictures (some I've seen quite often) to justify the cost, and the text was somewhat sparse and did not offer much in the way of background information."},{"rating":"2","title":"kids clubs","review":"An excellent starter set of clubs for a child new to the game.

Master P's Gameface sold only 400,000 copies, not that impressive when you consider that Ghetto D topped 2 million. To make matters worse, the incarceration of two of their best artists-C-Murder and Mac- has diminished whatever strength the tank once had.The new 504 boyz project is a desperate attempt by Master P to put the tank back on the street. Unfortunately, the album lacks the creativity of the Cash Money releases. While Currensy can flow quickly, his verses lack the charm of verses dropped by Mac. A white boy named T-Bo is part of the group solely beacause of his race. Choppa has shown us that he can push units on the charts, but he too can't be compared to Mystikal.The project ought to satisfy NL fans, but true hip-hop heads will see right through P's pitiful scheme.

The fact that none of the actors is recognizable should also give you a clue as to just how bad it is. Thankfully, the movie is short. Unfortunately, it seems like it goes on forever.

The switch gets caught behind the tape cassette and won't let the top go down. You cannot bend the switch because it is plastic. Most times you have to take a knife and push the switch down at the same time you are putting the cover down on the rewinder to use it.

In clear and understandable terms Larry Swedroe first explains why few professional money managers consistantly beat the their benchmarks, and then goes on to explain why and HOW an investor can take charge and develop a self directed portfolio. He makes his case in very human terms and in an easy to read manner. Absolutely worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book educates, entertains, and challenges its reader.","review":"Larry Swedroe's book is unique and worthwhile in that it educates, entertains, and challenges its reader. Mr. Swedroe has excellent technical knowledge which he conveys in an easy-to-understand format. He provides entertaining examples which bring his lessons into sharper focus and he challenges many preconceived ideas that many investors have and illustrates their flaws. I highly recommend this book for either novice investors or experienced ones; it will change your perspective on investing, and, in the long run, I believe it will improve your investment performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on investing since Lynch's Beating the Street!","review":"In a clear and concise manner, Swedroe shows, no, convinces the reader, of the superiority of asset allocation and passively managed index funds.With complete explanations and interesting examples the reader is taught the basics of the efficient market and modern portfolio theory. Using the principles described in this book, an individual investor can both \\"eat well and sleep well\\", that is, can achieve excellent investment returns while actually lowering the risk in his portfolio.Even if one chooses not to implement the complete strategy outlined by Swedroe, the book offers insights into investing that cannot help but improve portfolio performance.This book is suitable for the beginning investor as well as the sophisticated person that makes his living from the market. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent. Buy it!","review":"I have read dozens of books on investments over the years however, Larry Swedroe's book shows that way that I choose to invest.

Mr. Swedroe explains why actively managed funds have such a hard time beating passively managed index funds, and his book goes on to show how to design a portfolio, based on modern portfolio theory, that not only increases returns, but reduces risk. The book is very helpful for those who have experience with mutual funds as well as those who are just starting and want to avoid expensive mistakes. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"substance over style","review":"A convincing, if inelegant, argument for passive asset management as the key to sound investing.

It's a very informative book, and it's fun to read! The only thing I miss, as an individual investor, is something like an overview of the index/passively managed funds that are widely available. The book focuses mainly on funds from DFA, and these are not easily accessible to everyone. How could a small, individual investor build a portfolio using funds from for example Vanguard or Schwab? What alternatives are there for the DFA funds? How do I start with 'The Winner's Game'? *Definitely* one of my favorite books, with 'Bogle on Mutual Funds'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-reasoned, persuasive case for an index fund investing","review":"The author does a good job of explaing why markets are efficient and why you shouldn't waste your time trying to beat them with managed funds or market timing. The low-key common sense tone of the book combined with the step by step approach of how one might construct various model portfolios make this one of the more readable and useful investment books around. The author uses statistical analysis to make many of his points, though not in a tedious way. I took advanced statistics in Grad school and found his approach to be coherent and valid. A recent article in the New York review of books (on other investment books) seems to support what the author has to say as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swedroe's book---The Only Guide to winning etc","review":"I have not received this book.

With \\"The Rehnquist Court\\" he pumps out a minor achievement and a heavily slanted analysis of recent Constitutional decisions. There's no denying the hostility toward conservative/strict-constructionist judges and viewpoints and this, as a previous poster noted, deeply taints the work overall. In addition, Yarbrough's style (which has always tended to the dry and tedious) is here especially mind-numbing: the interesting constitutional issues under debate are hidden amongst irrelevant facts and long-winded prose.

I, personally, don't want to read about women just like me with diagnoses similar to mine and then read about their death later on in the book. How is that \\"uplifting\\"? When and if the time comes when my disease can no longer be treated, then maybe I would consider a book like this useful.

Other than this I can say little else positive. The story was quite thin with attempts to develop the characters and their stories only creating a disjointed and uninteresting bore.

True, they were based on the 109 (completely different ahead of the canopy) and this was the days before CGI plus there were no flying 109s then (only 1 now as I recall)but it doesn't help salvage a turkey of a movie.

A discount DVD of one of the great flying theatricals of all time! And flown by the guys who were in actual aerial combat with each other at the this historic crossroad. It is also surprising to see so many actors who were young then, and have become far more accomplished and famous since, in this early movie. I flew Huey's in the Mekong Delta and I am still awaiting filming of that aviation moment. My book, OUTLAWS IN VIETNAM, will have to suffice until then...! I am glad to possess this piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed","review":"This movie was produced by Harry Saltzman, who along with Cubby Broccoli co-produced the early James Bond movies. It was directed by Guy Hamilton who also directed Goldfinger, Diamonds are Forever, and two other of the 007 capers. With that crew you would expect that this would be very much an action-packed movie for guys, and it is. The very limited attempts at human interest sub-plots fail miserably.Aerial sequences dominate, and there are enough WWII era fighters and bombers, such as Spitfires, Hurricanes, Messerschmitt 109s, Heinkels, and Stukas to satisfy any military hardware nut. No cheating with digital effects when this was made. That means that the aircraft are all flying just as they would have been during the battle of Britain. On the downside, some of the explosions are pretty fake looking by today's standards. But for sheer action and a dramatic re-telling of the story of Britain's courageous and heroic stand against the Nazis, this film cannot be surpassed"},{"rating":"2","title":"True to Life Depiction","review":"This is one of the best World War II movies I have ever seen.

Indeed, very little time is spent on character development, and the time that is spent is not all that well done. However, the cast and the acting are superb and the air battles, along with the photography, are outstanding. Perhaps one reason this film is a bit off-puttish to some Americans is that it is an all- British production, and the simple fact is the British makes film differently than Hollywood does. For example, in this film, when a pilot is lost, there is no dwelling on the sorrow or the tragedy; unthinkable in Hollywood.

The book has different types of workouts (endurance, speed, strength, etc)and has 2 versions per workout (one usually 500M less than the other).

I was giving a big party and wanted to make it a Tapas theme. I looked throughout the book and found ALLOT of fish dishes, not something I like. I did find a few other things, so I set off to look for a dough recipe. I Saw the Savory Pie and Turnover Dough for my Empanadas.It was a little odd the way she has you spread the shorting/lard onto the dough and fold it like a business letter. So Dumb! I made 2 batches (what a disaster!) and as I was rolling it out not only was it too wet. (I stuck to the recipe exactly) It was oozing out everywhere with shortening. I tried to make a tester empanada and it was kind of flaky, but way too chewy; Not something even less picky hubby would eat! It was a waste of my time and ingredients! I had to go online and do more research for a good empanada dough. I had to go out to the store for more flour.

We have tried about half the recipes in this book and haven't found bad recipe yet. Most authentic Spanish cookbooks tend to be vague but not this one.

It calls for 2 slices of onions ..does not give the type..could be white red or yellow...does not give the size of the onion or the width of the slices.On the plus side there are many wonderful recipes and menus.The spinanch turnovers are superb and two of the pates that I have tried are really worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got pregnant you can too","review":"Overall, very disappointing. Author has this grand idea that you can get pregnant just by having a better outlook on life ie: Marrying wealthy so you don't have to work while you are infertile, flying accross the country to the best doctors, going on spiritual journeys in Arizona. Some of the stuff was valid and mostly self-evident, eat healthier, start exercising, be aggressive on finding a good doctor and relax or meditate. My money could have been spent better elsewhere, sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comforting & Empowering","review":"I found this book to be very comforting. By sharing the author's experiences it made me realize that I wasn't alone. She shares the things that worked for her and leaves it up to you if you want to try any or not. She doesn't get too heavy or technical which is a refreshing change in these types of books. She touches upon some alternative therapies and some little things that could make a big difference. I found this book to be empowering. It made me feel that there are things I can do to help my situation.

Its just as boneheaded as the relative or \\"well-meaning\\" friend who chatters on with empty advice and the constant admonishment of \\"Just Relax, It'll happen!\\" implying that obviously, your mental/emotional state, not a legitamate disease process, is to blame.

I had two pregnancies (naturally) one ended in miscarriage and the other was an ectopic which caused me to lose my left tube in April of '98.After this very long and difficult struggle my husband and I decided to let go and live our lives.

I appreciate the author's positive attitude, and I and truly thought I'd found a book for me while I, too, struggled with infertility. However, I found it hard to relate to her difficulty in finding a decent gynocologist regardless of reputation ... and why stay with one you nickname Dr. Casanova! Also, I'm not in the same league as she and her friends: over a year of fertility drugs and IVF after IVF are not only totally against many doctors' advice but most people's wallets. But she lost me totally with her contradictory philosophies of communing with God and with crystals. I did like several of her suggestions for relaxing and getting healthy, and I'm glad she got her baby. Nevertheless, it made me really sad that she couldn't dedicate herself to any of her marriages the way she did to her goal of having a baby.

Initially with this and other rewinders, they are rough with tapes. Slamming at the end of the tape rewind isn't too good for a VHS tape over time. Along with this, the tape ends up looking unevenly wound throughout the reel, and in some cases the outer edge of tape, about 10 minutes worth, is buckled causing tape damage, and a nice buzzing tracking line down the screen upon playback. The concept of having a rewinder makes sense, because it does save wear & tear on the motor of your VCR, but the trade off is that you end up with damaged tapes. I returned this rewinder and just bought a basic JVC VCR to use as a rewinder. It's gentle with tapes, and gears down when it is coming to the beginning of the tape, unlike this Kinyo rewinder and others in this product line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monotype/Monoprint: History and Techniques","review":"I found the publication to be informative in all aspects of Printing.It was helpful in technique as well as history.

It does take good photos, and has almost every auto feature one could ask for. However my camera has experienced very poor reliablity and excessive use of batteries, compared to other autofocus cameras I have owned (Canon Elph, Pentax IQZoom, Canon Telemax). Without much hard handling or outdoor use, it has been serviced twice (defective lens cover/on-off switch, and shutter button failed). The red-eye feature results in excessive flash lamp discharge, and makes it hard to pose subjects, and uses batteries faster. Olympus factory service for each non-warranty incident is $$. Needeless to say, I didn't have it repaired the second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Recurring Electrical Problems","review":"I bought this camera in June 2000. Since then, over 2 years it has been returned for repairs 4 times! Each time the problems have been associated with the electrical system. The electrical system drains the batteries and eventually shuts down all of the functions of the camera. Perhaps mine is a dud. I have had 3 other point and shoot Olympus cameras, all were great until now. This one is a lemon. Besides that, I do not believe the APS system is particularly advantageous and would not purchase it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Camera, but uses APS Film and reliabiliity in Question","review":"Overall, if you want an APS camera, this one would be good. However, APS film is more expensive to buy and more expensive to develope (slightly), so I would look into a compact 35MM camera also. My camera performed well, but after a few years, the film slot won't open (jambed or something) , so I have abandoned it with a full role of film in it. Not worth fixing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems Good to Me","review":"I used this unit to repair a DVD that was skipping. I found the unit easy to use and able to do the job.

After the required 3 minutes of spinning I opened the cleaning unit and removed my disc. One of the drops had not even been touched. So, not only is it not fixing my disc, it can't even remove a drop of fluid.Also, there was some kind of contamination on one of the discs. It looked like a stain about 1/4\\" across and I was hoping this device would clean it off. It didn't.

First...... this piece of junk is completely useless... it uses sanding papers that actually so fine that doesn't remove any scratches.... Then the polishing pads that don't do any actual polish because the original scratches and the sanding paper scratches couldn't be removed.... And then the cleaning pads that has the same role as the cleaning cloth... so no need for all the noise and time to clean using the cleaning side and pads...The sanding papers were worn out after using for less than 10 times (for 2 DVDs... i.e. each DVD needs 5 times to run at the sanding paper side) and no repair happens. May be my kids' DVDs are too much scratched.... But I tried it on many DVDs... it was useless.2.

She then proceeds to investigate on her own, doing idiotic things like swimming out to an unlighted boat by herself at night to follow the person she thinks might be the murderer and breaking into someone's house because she's nosy.

This book is not aimed at a neo-pagan audience, but at individuals who are looking for something deeper and more personally spiritual. I found myself agreeing with many of the ideas in this book. The photographs by Steve Haworth are outstanding as well. Place this one near the top of the list of the recent group of body modification books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-fiction? Hardly.","review":"This book is joke. Having spent many years in the backcountryof Alaska and having had encounters with bears, the author's description of his encounters with bears are far fetched and implausible. The description of the bear in the crevasse with the author and the bear actually forcing the walls of a glacial crevasse to widen is simply ridiculous and impossible. The author describes the challenge of carrying a pan full of water withhout spilling down a treacherous ramp to his cookstove. Well how about filling your water bottle, screwing the lid on tight and bringing the water to the cookstove and pouring it into the pan. There is one example after another of this type of folly that makes you wonder if the author really climbed Mt. Hess. This book is destined to be a bad screenplay for a bad movie.

There are pages of boring details that I skipped. Unless you're a climber you will wear out the glossary of climbing terms. But the worst part was his experience with the bear. Billed as a true story of survival, the author MAY have climbed Mt. Hess and he MAY have seen a bear. But the rest of the story is fiction.

What a mistake. I suspect the author had some sort of encounter with a bear and then dreamed up a story that somehow made it into print after 22 years. A bear would not behave as portrayed in the book. The circumstances of its demise is laughably unrealistic. The choices made as part of the climb are not those of an experienced climber. I expected much better and am disappointed a publisher would have so easily allowed nonsense to reach print in the form of a serious book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst I've read","review":"This book is pages and pages of dull description of ice, snow, what the author had for lunch, dinner, breakfast, how he great felt about mountain climbing solo and how he didn't need food drops... etc. Once in a while, you get thrown a bone with a couple of pages about this crazy bear who has it in for him. Some of the descriptions of the bears actions are far-fetched and almost too human-like. I found myself not believing the story... not because it was so unbelievable, but because it reminded me of a tall tale.

Luckily it is short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"I don't buy the story. The author may have done this climb, but the bear story is a classic tall tale. There is just too much happening that can't happen. Mr. Fletcher knows climbing, but for someone who supposedly has climbed in Alaska before, he doesn't know much about bears. The most hilarious scene (after the one where he supposedly kills a grizzly cub by throwing his ice hammer at it)occurs when the bear rears up on its hind legs, jumps across a creek and charges him RUNNING ON TWO LEGS! Enough said. The most amazing thing is that he was able to sell this to a publisher here in the US. Revealingly, Amazon UK is selling the book in the \\"fiction\\" category, where it belongs.

The narrative is poorly written and filled with the European male explorer arrogance of \\"first\\" ascents. He claims to have not intended to kill the cub because of his great respect for nature, yet at every turn is cracking towers, rolling boulders down cliffs and stealing crystal from caves. I just feel sorry for the cub who died at the hands of such an idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is not only ficticious; it's very bad fiction","review":"First of all, the narrative is clumsy, but that can be excused in this sort of book. The larger problem is that the story is entirely unbelievable. My advice to Mr. Fletcher would be to do a little research before his next attempt to portray the figments of his imagination as non-fiction. Anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of bear behavior and biology will quickly recognize that this story is completely inplausible. My personal favorite was the account of the bear charging forward on its hind legs, \\"running as any man would do.\\" I will not pass judgement on whether the climbing account is true, but if it is, I would invite Mr. Fletcher to kindly confine his adventures to Europe. American wilderness has no need of hikers who take delight in toppling rock formations and prying crystals from caves.

I can't stress enough how this might be the highest fidelity live album outside of the classical realm, and many of the older songs have a clarity and power that they couldn't achieve on the studio albums (not every engineer knows how to properly mic a suspended bass spring).I recommend this both to longtime fans and anyone looking for their first EN album.

She sure deserved it for this and never even got a nomination.Prize Winner of Deifance Ohio is another wonderful film that somehow got lost in the shuffle. It's a beautful story beautifully told.

I was disappointed in most of the aspects. The whole movie was very suface, trite and didn't connect me to any of the people in a meaningful way.The mother was protrayed a bit too perfectly....like a wax figuire of sage advice and an almost brainless optimistic idiot. So many times when the jerk of her husband was pulling his violent BS...I wanted her to get a backbone and say something, ANYTHING. And the whole deal with her driving. Why all the drama? Why did the daughter have to learn so she could drive her too her meeting? Why didn't the mother just learn? Confused me.This could have been a great movie, but the performances were mostly wooden and fake. Moore is on my top 5 favourite actress list, so perhaps I was expecting too much. She just zombie walked through this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clichè. Very bad movie.","review":"Nobady coul save this movie. Even Julianne Moore (the best actress around).

Halfway through the movie, I'd become so attached to the character she was playing, I forgot all about Julianne and started loving Evelyn Ryan. What a performance and what a wonderful woman was Ms. Ryan. This is one of the most intelligent and poignant movies I've seen in years. It's worth owning and watching over and over. Here is a role model for young women. She showed brains, charisma, grace under fire and faith.Outstanding in every way...and not a dry eye in the house at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julianne Moore's \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" for the 21st Century!","review":"Julianne Moore is one of our finest and most diverse actresses. She gives once of her best performances to date as \\"The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio\\". Moore's charcter is one of the most memorable & inspirational that I have ever seen in a movie. She is a woman, who, inspite of getting a \\"raw deal\\" in life, refuses to give in to despair and self-pity. The way she treats and cares for her children is admiarable and appears to have born much fruit as they all went on to lead productive lives as adults. Woody Harrelson also gives a very good performance as her deeply-flawed husband. The movie will especially hit home (and may be painful) for those who have grown up in a home with alcoholic parents. A great movie to own and view again when we are tempted to mistreat others when we face disappointment in our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent tool to endure and love","review":"Excellent, refreshing true story. Contrary to the \\"Im not happy I'm leaving\\" mentality of today's relationships, the movie is a story of true love - that love which breaks through suffering into a higher, purer one. It is a joy to watch - it has a way of expressing difficult trials of a courageous woman while being fun to watch the entire way through.The whole world should see this movie. Also, although it charitably reveals how narcissistic behavior may be caused by great hurt or trauma -- it is not an excuse to make those around you miserable - the behavior still has to be dealt with. Wonderful, delightful ride of the human experience.

The Italian influences of the Alibrandi's in the opening and closing beats of the film - \\"Tintarella Di Luna\\". The sadness at the losses - \\"With or Withouth You\\". The 'schoolies' theme - \\"Weir\\" by Killing Heidi. Then the hidden gem of the CD - the awesome ballad in LoTel's \\"Teenager of the Year\\".

I have LOTS of experience in programming with procedural languages but was bewildered by an environment where snippets of code are attached to one control but need to reference some other control. I found this book helpful because it began at the very beginning and worked through the basic concepts quickly. HOWEVER, I don't know that I can recommend the book. It is for the absolute beginner in sense that it goes into very little depth but someone with little programming experience probably will not get much out of it. Compounding the problem is the fact that there are a lot of errors. With my experience, I could tell when something was an error but it could be confusing to a newbie.

While I did enjoy the manga, I just didn't get the same rush from the book that I did with the movie. I can't quite put my finger on why (apart from the lack of music), since the book is a very faithful adaptation of the movie. Perhaps it's because the book is told more from Sally's POV than Jack's or because the black & white artwork (while beautiful) lacks the colors of the movie.Would I recommend this to a friend? Despite not getting the same rush, I would. It's very well drawn & very faithful to the movie.

A macro flash is a MUST for this lens - especially at 5x -- because you need to be at f/16 to get any DOF at all. I have not purchased this lens - I am currently renting from local camera shop.

Artistically, Madonaa does a bang-up job. My only complaint is that there is unnecessary use of profanity. I could understand if it added to the performance, but it doesn't. It is filmed well and I have no compaints about the editing and camera-work.. Better than most concert discs.My absolute favorite thing about this is the spectacular sound quality. They got the mix just right. The vocals, the instruments, the crowd, all perfectly balanced. I use the \\"Miles Away\\" track to demo my HT all the time. It is just awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not your usual live concert recording","review":"The producers took the (high quality) concert footage as starting material only and *heavily* edited it: cuts, more cuts, lots of slightly accelerated or slowed pieces, and quite some CGI overlays. More often than not the result is good and matches the music.But sometimes I was disappointed - especially in \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" where they lost most of the fantastic translucent effects by zooming in too much. One star off for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good concert, average video quality","review":"Madonna is very well known for giving amazing shows with non stop fun, and this is not the exception. The only bad thing that I didn't like very much is the quality of the video of the concert, while the Bonus: Behind the Scenes, has a cristal-clear image, the concert doesn't have it, it looks a bit blurry in contrast to the bonus features. I need to try this in another TV set, but I doubt that that is the problem considering that the extra feature looks well.After some time, the video is not bad, the problem is that it has a blurred effect to make look better everything on the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend","review":"Beautiful, wonderful, loved the show.

I was disappointed that the Blu-ray did not include the audio CD here in the U.S. I attended the show in Houston with fairly good seats, but I was really looking forward to the video so I could see the little details that I missed in the live show. I am a little disappointed in the editing of the video as the shots are really edited quick and tight. It doesn't give the viewer a chance to take in much before the next edit.

Somebody know why they do that apart of marketing strategy...If you love Madonna and her music this is definitely a concert to have in your collection!! but I think since blu-ray is the next generation on HD concert like this one have the same treatment as dvd bring a little extra like the audio cd..enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sharp","review":"This is a wonderful closeup lens.

Great emotion in the book. I loved it. It is a story about fulfilling a dead father's dreams, and realizing she is fulfilling her own. Read the book. It is good time spent! Great immagination too.

After actually using them, I had to conclude that there is something very wrong with these. Some of the batteries don't seem to charge or hold charges properly. After putting them in a Canon flash unit, after a few days of very light use, the flash stopped working because it wasn't getting enough power. I had this happen at least twice with these but not with other brands. I would not buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst rechargeables I have ever used","review":"Like another reviewer here has stated, these batteries will last only 2 - 3 days on the shelf before they self discharge to an usable state. Yeah, their initial capacity is great, but once u take it out of the charger, they start self discharging FAST.My rechargeable energizers were nothing like this. They could have at least been use a month before they have self discharged.These are seriously the worst rechargeable that money can buy. By far. Even the made in china no-name rechargeable batteries that came with my charger does FAR better than these. Initially, I thought it was a AWESOME deal too... 16 batteries for only $$$.

I thought they are golden, but I was totally wrong. All other brands of rechargeable I had before can easily last a month, but these batteries can last only 2-3 days on shelf without using it. I cannot believe it. Called Duracell CS and was told that is NORMAL for their rechargeable batteries. NO! I don't think this is normal. How can you claim your high capacity batteries last longer than the others? Even my two-year old 1600 mAH can easily last 3 weeks. 2-3 days are not acceptable. Their warranty is useless as they said it is normal and nothing is wrong. DO NOT BUY Duracell batteries.

The batteries go dead after 3 or 4 days, if not used. The self discharge rate is the worst I have ever seen. The dipstick girl I talked to at customer service says this is normal. She refused to honor the warranty stating that Duracell does not warranty the batteries when it comes to self discharge, so if they lose their power overnight,your screwed. No more Duracell in this family. They have no idea what a good customer they lost and it was obvious that Duracell customer service is non-extistent. Duracell has slowly gone downhill in the past couple of years. This recent experience just confirmed what I already knew. Dont buy the rechargeables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor performance","review":"I bought these batteries brand new at a very good price but the quality was terrible.

Noticed erratic performance, so I replaced my charger. Turned out some of these batteries would only hold a charge for a few hours. I threw out the \\"bad apples\\", thinking that only a few were defective. (I had purchased several packages of these.) Big mistake. I should have returned them all.Over the next few months had more failures, even with the batteries that had previously tested OK. Some of these failures took place at very bad times, costing lost work and time. Eventually, they damaged an expensive camera, which had to be repaired at the factory.I have since replaced all of them with Sony brand batteries, which seem to be OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Dead Doing Nothing","review":"I don't know how these batteries got such a high user rating. The one's I bought on Amazon, although a good price are lousy batteries. I have two other brands to compare with and these Duracells don't last as long in my camera and worst of all go dead all by themselves in about two weeks without even being used.

They are supposedly sending me coupons for replacement batteries after I mail my bad batteries to them, it's been 6 weeks since I first called Duracell and they have not sent the coupons as of yet.

It's a must-have for any learner: it won't teach you the language but it provides an insight into why this difficult to learn language is the way it is. It's full of wise observations and fascinating anecdotes and gives a feeling for the culture and the people as well as Nihongo itself.

The outdoor scenes are very realistic in portraying what the rugged woodlands and prairies of the late 1800's were probably like. However, many reviews have claimed that this miniseries was closer to following the events in Laura Ingalls Wilder's book series than any other television series or movie has ever been, and after watching it we were very disappointed that it does not follow the books more closely at all. If anything there are even more differences than those described in Laura's books. I would not recommend buying this if you are looking for a closer portrayal of the events in the Little House book series. If you enjoy a different presentation for a good family movie, and enjoy the beautiful and realistic scenery, it might be a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little House on the Prairie","review":"I thought this was a really well done movie version of Laura Ingalls Wilder's Books. It really showcased the hardships faced by settlers in a realistic and believable way.

So far so good. The problem? He seems to find the same color combinations over and over again. Considering that there are sections here on Victorians, Art Deco, the Sixties, Earth tones, and Raves, one would certainly expect to find some drastically different color combinations. But flip back and forth between the \\"Rave\\" section and the \\"Victorian\\" section, and you will be surprised by how similar the schemes are. At least, I am.There are some minor assets to the book, but I would not recommend it. For those looking for swatches, I would recommend \\"Color Harmony 2\\" (ISBN 1564960668). Not only is it worlds better, it's also cheaper and smaller. And did I mention better?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Inspiration","review":"Rather than just show color combinations in a vacuum, this book uses real examples from different design periods to demonstrate the use of color.

It's presented well, an attractive colorful volume, with some commentary about the different periods covered. As a guide to color combinations for design, specifically web design it's pretty cool. If you are looking for something geared more towards the science, and psychology of color, then check out \\"Color: The Secret Influence\\", which is a more scientific (yet very readable) book about color and light. It does not focus on, or present color combinations found in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Twice Before You By This One!","review":"I was completely disapointed with this book. The description suggested the book would show color combinations to aid in the color selection process for designing print - more like a resource book.

So, if your after illustrations done in differnet color combinations - this is the book for you.

The maps are bad and there are less maps than in other guide books. The basic information on sights is difficult to browse. There is no background information on sights.

Also, the part that slides to erase is flimsy and hard to move across the screen, but easily broken. I dont recommend this toy for any one. My nephew is 3 1/2 and his was broken easily too, so I dont think it has anything to do with the age of the child, it is simply poorly made.

It's also nice to have the two rolls because if you are using the 1 inch tape you can automatically have a second roll ready to go. It seems a little silly to have to pay this much for the weight, but if you need it, it's worth not having the dispenser work its way across the table. If you don't do high speed taping or you just do limited taping, the lighter (and much less expensive) C25 would probably be fine for you. Watch the handling charges on theses items.

Sort of like what your clothes would smell like if you worked the production line at a Tupperware factory.I admit I'm very sensitive to these things, but the smell gives me a headache.

Keys fishing guide is going to kill a young man who wants to be a fishing guide like him. What....! There are only two fishing guides at this marina. The weaker guide is encouraging the young man (Peter Fonda) to become a guide while instigating the better guide (Warrren Oates) to kill this new rival. That will leave him as the only guide left when the other guy is arrested for murder. That's it! Typically poor acting by a young Peter Fonda, his character has no substance, he just says his lines, however he is surrounded by fine co-stars who bring some entertainment to the weak script. The subplots are as ridiculous as the main plot, and would be entirely written off as delirious if it were not set in Key West.

The single star rating solely reflects whatever novelty value some collector might get from owning an \\"innovative\\" (i.e. \\"unusual\\"), albeit utterly impractical design. It looks complicated ... and it is, as evidenced by the fact it comes with a dvd to demonstrate how to open/close the thing. The handle is comprised of three separate pieces connected by numerous bolts with a spring-loaded \\"external toggle\\" (hence the \\"E.T.\\" moniker). The blade is supposed to flip open and closed by a \\"push and release\\" of the toggle. I was momentarily amused with mastering this operation despite numerous safety, comfort and convenience issues. One major design flaw could not be ignored: when the blade snaps closed, the cutting edge actually strikes the toggle spring. This visibly dulled the cutting edge .5 inches from the blade point.

That was until I read this book. Looking good by starving or vomiting is not worth the horrific toll it can take on your body. Jenny was so courageous to share the story of her life. I've been through hell with doctors myself for bipolar disorder and, like Jenny, have gone from Western to Eastern and back again, finding myself in an endless web of frustration. Ultimately, Jenny finds that what is going to heal her is her spirit which is the one thing that never dies.

I have dieted and exercised like a crazy person myself and it has only made me feel isolated from the world and I'm glad I never slipped into any extreme like bulimia. But I see how it could really start an addiction.I am sorry to read some of the other reviews because they seem quite mean and I think this book can really help people who have eds or chronic pain problems. Jenny is brave and has fought through a lot. She's also very funny.

It's also hard not to be annoyed by her complaints about living in a world where she has access to anyone or anything -- doesn't she appreciate this on some level? I mean, c'mon. Ironically, her writing style is so cumbersome and cloying that if she weren't a member of the Ralph Lauren family, she'd never have been published.For a much more authentic, compassionate and well-written treatment of privileged youth and eating disorders, I'd recommend Lori Gottlieb's STICK FIGURE: A DIARY OF MY FORMER SELF."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHINY, PATHETIC AND WE'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE","review":"We've heard Jenny Lauren's story so many times before - - it's a tired genre - - and just because she's \\"of the\\" Lauren empire, are we supposed to care more about what she's been through.Millions of us either have been through it ourselves or know people who have.Most importantly, Lauren doesn't address the real issues in her memoir - - that it is her family that continues to perpetuate ideals of female beauty in our society. And she should have taken a stand. This is her responsibility. And she didn't have the courage to address it. What a shame.As someone suffering from bullimia, I was expecting a lot more, and she has let many of us down.I wasn't motivated, moved or inspired - - and that's why I bought the book in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a whiner!","review":"All Jenny Lauren does is whine, complain, and talk about how beautiful she is. She refers to \\"my beauty\\" about a dozen times and I only read half the book. This is a terrible book written by a self-obsessed spoiled brat. I'm so glad I checked this out from the library and didn't waste my money on this whine fest.

The sad thing about this book is that only through escapism has the author been aided.I think that doctor's misguide patients, routinely. I did not care for this book though. I felt it was whiny and an unending pitious vent. I wish the author well in her recovery, but am sad I wasted the money buying this, \\"poor rich me\\" rant. The author should be thankful for the family support and the freedom she has enjoyed instead of focusing so intently on the crackhead, the sexual acting out, etc. She really has problems and I hope she finds herself or healing or anything good. I would not recommend this book as it has affected me negatively."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Whiny Romp","review":"Ms. Lauren grew up, apparently, in a society with no values except looking good. In the process, she apparently began showing signs of eating disorders in childhood, problems that resulted in permanent physical damage. Even with her family's corporate interest in appearance, had they maintained some religious connection other than fashion, the writer might have learned respect for her body.That said, there's nothing in this book that shows she realizes her familial obsession with style and appearance is a root cause of her problems, or any rejection of a system which glorifies appearance at the expense of health and sanity.Not to mention that it's hard to feel terribly sorry for someone who has apparently never had to work a 40 hour workweek and live on a budget and was still able to pursue endless medical attention for her ills. Most people with chronic illnesses, self-inflicted or not, do not have those luxuries."},{"rating":"1","title":"i regret ever laying eyes on this book","review":"this book puts you in the chair of one of jenny lauren's many therapists and assumes that you care about every ache and uncomfortable thought she experiences. I myself have had an eating disorder and I can relate to some of the difficulties she writes about, but even with my added sympathy to her problems, I wanted to throw this book out the window out of frustration. this book is nothing but 300+ pages of jenny lauren's complaints and accounts of how difficult her life is and how all of her problems are somehow the results of others' mistakes and not her own inability to grow up and take responsibility for her actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SAD STORY, BUT DEAL WITH THE REAL ISSUE","review":"Yes, \\"Homesick\\" is a sad story but the author ignores perhaps the most important issue in what is supposed to be a memoir - - her last name is Lauren. As in Ralph Lauren. The family responsible for plastering billboards and filling pages of magazines with anorexic women. Couldn't she have devoted a paragraph to this issue? It left me curious as to how these images impacted her illness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty Memoir Attempts to Cash in on a Trendy Cultural Issue","review":"I was sorely disappointed by this \\"memoir,\\" as 90 percent of it seemed to be devoted exclusively to Jenny Lauren's bowel woes. Very seldom did she specifically discuss the eating disorder or its emotional roots, and the occasional reference to the influence of the fashion culture seemed forced and empty. She spent the first several hundred pages sharing the gory details of her gastrointestinal issues, yet she rushed through her miraculous \\"healing\\" with just a few vague pages. Having dealt with anorexia and bulimia myslef, I know there are much, much deeper issues at work, both in the struggle and the healing. Jenny Lauren chose to ignore these when chronicling her ordeal. The book lacked emotion and substance, and it left me hungry for something more."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN! YAWN!","review":"first of all i found jenny lauren completely irritating, immature and boring. she never stopped complaining which pissed me off. she was immature clinging to her parents all the time. get a life please. i kept hoping the book would get better but i was wrong. i stopped reading this book on page 164 if that tells you anything (there are 304 pages to the book). i could not take her crap anymore. i wanted to give this book ZERO stars but since 1 star was the lowest then that is what i gave."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good date movie.","review":"I ordered this movie to see Ian Somerhalder in a role other than a vampire.

Now let me say that I hated him for a short while after I saw this dreadful film. I love inventive stories, but this was trying to do way too much in a very short amount of time (plot wise). The premise is kind of neat and if it was done just the right way I think it could have worked, but it does not here. By the end of it my friend and I were watching it, jaws to the floor like \\"What just happened?\\" The characters are phony and the main character is so dense and unlovable. The dialog was strange and felt awkward most of the time. The story line was very ambitious, but highly implausible. I kept thinking \\"Maybe if it were Tyler's sister or cousin even, but not his fiancé!\\" He didn't even seem sad or lost at all and I could understand this if maybe they grew apart, but after finding out the way she died, not acceptable! Overall a HUGE disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ian Somerhalder is better than this","review":"Movie was long and drawn out.

The false note is the inane pseudo dating dialogue between Ian Somerhalder and Bijou Phillips where both actors seem too cool handed and smart to say silly dating things - that is very strange. It's hard to trust Ian Somerhalder's character because his lines don't match his face despite the frat boy haircut. The thing I loved about Bijou Phillips character is her imaginary roommate and her lack of sentimentality in her interactions despite her character's \\"personal tragedy.\\" I kept wondering if dead girl was closeted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Introducing the poor-fit slipper","review":"I bought these slippers for my husband's birthday present and we were both very disappointed in them.

This litter is worse in almost every way. It's dustier than Dr. Elsey's, it doesn't control odor as well (in fact, the litter itself has an unpleasant smell), and it does not clump as well. My cat tries to bury his waste repeatedly because he doesn't like it either. It may be biodegradable and septic safe, but with the downsides I mentioned and the cost, I'm going back to Dr. Elsey's.I still gave it two stars because it clumps a little bit and is better than an average grocery store litter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"A skeptic turned believer! After 20 years using grocery store brands, I bought this upon Vet's recommendation. And my three new kittens took to it right away. I scoop out once a day and both litter boxes remain odor- free!

I love that it is flushable since the litter box is located in the bathroom at my house. It clumps about like the clay-based litters--none are perfect. I was looking for something more environmentally friendly since the clay for other litters has to be mined (look that up for some interesting reading). :-( There is some dust, but not as much as the clay litters and this is not as \\"dirty\\" as that dust is anyway. I don't find my cats tracking it all over the house but they did track the dust from the last clay litter I tried. I agree with others that the price works out about the same. When I switched litters, I mixed both kinds together & it worked out fine. The only thing I can think of that would be better is having the cats use the toilet (and I'm thinking about getting one of those kits to teach them how!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't cover bad smell!!","review":"It smell nature by itself, but can't cover the pee and poo's smell at all.

For me, it wasn't the smell, which was bad, it was the tracking of fine dust EVERYWHERE that made my hardwood floors dangerously slippery.

Changed to my old litter after only a couple of days."},{"rating":"1","title":"My kitty was upset","review":"I have been usingPrecious Cat Kitten Attract Kitten Training Litterfor my kitten. World's Best Cat Litter, Clumping Formula was free with purchase at the pet store. It is something I've been intrigued with, so I got it to try out.I mixed some of it with her cat litter and she was not a happy cat. She jumped in, to use her litter box but instantly looked upset. She smelled it, tasted it, complained and then jumped out without ever using it.I switched back to Kitten Attract and she jumped in before I had a handful of it in the box and did her business. Obviously, she was holding it in and couldn't wait.I guess if I ever wanted to switch, I would have to use a separate litter box next to her regular litter box until she decides to try it, but I don't think I'll do that. She'd probably sicken herself eating it before she ever actually uses it."},{"rating":"2","title":"is the best litter I know of","review":"Unlike the other reviewers, my cats (three of them) like it just fine and I love the fact that I get *no* litter box smell --- which includes none of the litter-deoderant smell you get with most sand or clay litters. I guess it depends on your cat...It clumps well. It is bio-degradable.

It is very high priced which does not really matter IF it was the best available litter. The very worst factor is the lack of odor control. I have two cats and have never had a problem with the smell of the litter box but this litter was terrible! The natural corn material might be the only good thing about this product. It has a money back guarantee so I will attempt to get my money back.

I switched to it so my cats wouldn't be breathing in clay litter dust. Now they breathe in corn litter dust. Their little paws are completely covered in dust when they get out of the box. It cllumps very well and has good odor control for their urine but ZERO odor control for their feces. My whole apartment stinks after they go. (I also think it messes with their digestion when they clean themselves but that is just a theory - it seems like their poop smells a lot more since using World's Best). I tried Yesterday's News very reluctantly because I prefer clumping litter. I was shocked at how good it is. I hate that you have to change it every week but there is NO DUST, it doesn't track and it has fantastic odor control. I have two cats that share a litter box and they took to the Yesterday's News with no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"It clumps well but...","review":"I gave it two stars because this litter is one of the best clumping litters I've used thus far as it doesn't break into little pieces from multiple cat use. This product is made from corn and when you first pour it in, it smells like corn (a little weird but okay, it's natural.) It's been three weeks and I can't take the smell anymore. Not only does it not cover up the smell of the cat poo but also it's beginning to smell like rotten food. I wish they would come up with something that would clump this well that doesn't begin to smell over time. I won't buy this product again. In fact, I will be dumping both litter boxes tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake","review":"This litter is too expensive for what it's worth....it is more than messy, has a \\"unique\\" strange smell and I won't purchase it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible smell","review":"This smells terrible, even when the box is clean. I agree that it tracks a bit less than regular litter, but it is somewhat dusty (I find white paw prints all over the house) (and I have a litter mat), and smells terrible. The smell bothers me the most, it is just overpowering. I clean the box everyday, but it is still bad.

When finding nothing we moved our washer and dryer thinking maybe the kitten hid food that spoiled under one of them. Unfortunately after investigation the smell was undoubtedly from the litter I purchased and has made the entire room and my cats paws smell like vomit!

I put plenty of litter in each box, and the cats have never had diarrhea. However, the smell from the litter is that of strong vomit, and it's enough to bring me to the point of vomiting myself.If you live in a large house, or have your litter in an unoccupied basement, then this shouldn't be a major issue. If your living arrangements are rather small, then you should choose a different litter.

After a few days, it takes on the aroma of rotting food, like a bag of garbage left out in the sun.Perhaps if scooped every day, it does not develop this smell, and it really is the world's best cat litter.

I used to be so excited when a new issue arrived, now it could sit for weeks before I open it, and even then I usually only peruse the pages and not really read the content. What used to contain no advertising, now does. The magazine itself has grown thinner through the years, the recipes not as down home as they used to be. What irks me more than anything is to see the great issues in the grocery stores that are not part of the home subscription (and cost $9.95 each at the store).

The tape tears easily and neatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"This tape rips easily without the use of scissors or a dispenser, but I still find a dispenser easier to use, especially for taping boxes. The end sticks to the roll and you must find it each time after you rip the piece of tape off the roll. I can see how this tape would work great if you mail things frequently on the go and don't want to carry around a dispenser, but for home use such as packing boxes for moving or even shipping more than one box at a time, I would still opt for the dispenser. Great idea, works as promised, more of a gimmick than a useful tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great invention, but at a premium price.","review":"Apparently, tear-by-hand Scotch tape has been around for years. I have never seen an advertisement for it (and I watch a lot of television and read a lot of magazines!). I assume this is because 3M considers it to be a niche product.I finally was able to try it out and am very impressed. I found that it ripped easily. However, there is a reason it's not a popular product, and that is likely due to the high price per square inch. If the convenience of not needing scissors readily available is important, this is a terrific purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"New favorite packing tape","review":"As much as I love playing with a tape gun, I really don't need one anymore. This tape pulls off the roll with ease, then you just tear it like you'd tear a piece of paper. I couldn't believe how simple it was. When I first saw the description, I thought it would be more like surgical tape (with perforations or embedded threads).Nope...it looks and feels like normal packing tape.Not that I won't miss my tape gun--because I will--but it sure is convenient to have this small roll of tape in my packing center.As happy as I am with this product, I'm dinging it one star for price. The current price of over $14 for two rolls seems pretty spendy. Hopefully the price drops over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised ... quality product","review":"Scotch Tear-by-Hand Tape works just as advertised ... it seals boxes securely, but can be cut without having to resort to a pair of scissors or a tape dispenser.Now the only slight negative is that the Tear-by-Hand Tape carries a price premium over my current favorite,Scotch Super Strength Packaging Tape, and in my case I don't ship so many things that I would justify the added cost of Tear-by-Hand Tape. But by all means, if you don't feel like dealing with a dispenser or scissors then Tear-by-Hand Tape is a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tears Easily and Easy to Use. Pricey.","review":"I use packing tape to seal packages and to tape down table cloth covers. This tape works just as well as regular packing tape for both situations. The difference is that I don't have to have scissors or a tape gun with this tape. The other difference is tape price.The tear by hand tape is handy. I like that aspect. It tears easily without bunching up (most of the time). The tape keeps my packages sealed and holds down my cloth table covers in outdoor wind.If you don't like using a tape gun and find yourself fighting with standard packing tape, this tear by hand tape is a viable option. I wish it were a cheaper option. 5 stars for ease of use. 4 stars for price."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy to use and still works just as well as before","review":"I love this tape. This is probably the best one I have ever came across and I can't believe it took this long to come up with something like this. It has always been a pain for me to mail out anything because it requires cutting the tape with scissors, getting the scissors stuck on the tape, cutting myself with the cutter, etc. This is clumsy-proof tape. You just get the length you want and simply tear it. It tears really well and actually tears in a really straight line.The tape itself is still just as good as any other mailing tape. It sticks well to the package and does not come off easily. This is definitely something I will keep getting. Goodbye to old mailing tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here before I could even wonder where it was","review":"Best tape for the returns I have for my online shopping....goodly sized rolls!

I won't use anything else. It easily tears by hand: no need for scissors or cutting holders.

The best invention since post-it notes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Packing Tape","review":"First off, I've made three moves in the past 3 years and packed things myself each time. I used cheap packaging tape in the prior 2 moves and was completely preplexed at how it didn't peel from the roll well, how the end made itself invisible so it was hard to get re-started again and how it tore off at any time. Cheap is not the way to go. This tape is amazing in that you don't need a dispenser to cut it. You merely tear it off with your fingers and retain the end for the next taping. The 4 rolls per packet can do a lot of boxes in a hurry. This tape is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best packaging tape ever","review":"I've been using this for a number of years. It's fast and easy. Scissors are a thing of the past when you're working with this tape. The only downside is it's sometimes difficult to find in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the occasional shipper","review":"This tape certainly fits its description -- you don't need any tools but your hands to tear it. It is an excellent quality shipping tape for the home shipper -- but ouch, the price. A pack with a 100 yards will easily cost you more than tape you can't tear with your hands. No doubt it's convenient, but if you're shipping more than one box a month, you'll quickly need to buy more of this stuff. The thickness rivals other quality Scotch shipping tape products (which I have regularly used with a dispenser; a package from my local warehouse club.) The adhesive is great, but not excellent, as I'm noticing some curling on boxes when applied (you just need to push it down a bit more when applying.)In other words, I give it a qualified good review. You just need to realize this is NOT cheap tape and that it's only for the occasional shipper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, I'm reviewing sticky tape!","review":"Not a piece of equipment that one could get too excited about: however if you need packaging tape, I would recommend this over the other variety that tends to rip apart easy and needs something sharp to cut it. This tape saves you from needing to locate scissors- it's a very handy improvement and it's too bad this has not become the next standard for all clear packaging tape to mimic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive tape that tears straight by hand","review":"This tape is pretty impressive for the following reasons:- No dispenser is needed- It tears straight by hand- It is pretty easy to remove if needed yet has adequate sticking powerSince tearing the tape by hand requires slight dexterity and strength in the fingers, those with arthritis or the elderly with limited hand strength might find it difficult to tear. Otherwise, this is a great product that eliminates the waste of a dispenser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you!","review":"I love this Scotch Tear by Hand Tape!! A bit of background here, when it comes to taping box's there's one thing that *always* happens to me--inevitably I cut the tape the proper length just to have it curl up on itself and become useless... Well, Scotch Tear by Hand Tape has stopped that problem! I don't have to worry about the tape curling up on me, or the scissors failing me at the last possible second, I can just tear it by hand and place it on the box. It makes setting up boxes directly in the post office much easier and faster, too! So far, I've had no problems with this tape and haven't heard any negative feedback from the recipients of the packages, either. If you ship a lot, then this is something to look into getting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Packing has never been this simple!","review":"My company ships out a lot of items and I have been using a tape gun for many years. I was a bit skeptical trying out the new Scotch Tear-by-Hand Tape since nothing has ever been able to retire my tape gun. However, this time, we have a winner! The Scotch Tear-by-Tape was easy to use, sturdy for shipping, and easy to tear. My only complaint is I wish they would make bigger roles :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenience at a price","review":"This tape does deliver on its \\"tear by hand\\" promise and it works as well as the Scotch traditional packaging tape.Scotch Packaging Tape, 2 Inches x 800 Inches, 6 Rolls (142-6). It is more convenient to use and store not requiring a dispenser with its sharp edge or grabbing for a pair of scissors. However it does cost substantially more, 2 1/2 times more than the regular packaging tape. If you only use tape infrequently or if the cost is not a consideration you would be quite happy with the performance of this tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tape, Easy to Use!","review":"If you hate dealing with packing tape with a dispenser, then you will love this tape. It has the same quality and strength as ordinary packing tape. But you can actually tear off the length that you need without a dispenser. Tearing the tape is very easy too. Highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pack Boxes Without Sharp Teeth or Scissors","review":"Packing tape usually comes with a dispenser with sharp edges to help cleanly cut the piece of tape. This product cleanly tears without much effort or the need for sharp tools that might not be safe to have around children.This wide Scotch tape tears cleanly without much effort but it's strong enough to survive shipping through the mail or UPS. We used it to pack up some holiday presents this year and welcomed the ease of use! I don't see a need to buy tape with a dispenser any longer, this is our new preferred shipping method."},{"rating":"2","title":"works pretty well","review":"I found that this tape performed as described; it is easy to tear by hand and seals packages. I don't think it is as sticky/strong as the usual type of tape, but it is adequate for most purposes. I noticed it is much more economical to buy the four-pack, so if you use a lot of tape, that would be a safe bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Scotch product","review":"When it comes to adhesives, Scotch is always the best. This tear-by-hand tape continues that tradition. It is clear and strong just like the normal scotch packing tape, but is easily torn by hand (and usually tears straight as long as you get the right start). It does not feel 'super sticky', but when you get it on your package and try to pull it off, you can see that it is indeed stuck on there pretty darn good! Unlike the bargain brands, it's thick so I don't have to worry that heavy boxes will 'pull through' the tape. Overall, I don't think I'd purchase this tape myself because it's more expensive than the regular stuff, and there's no real advantage to using this over the regular stuff. But, it does take up less space in the drawer, so if you're one for removing clutter, this product would be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need for a serrated cutter. Very convenient.","review":"I got interested into this packaging tape as it seems to eliminate the need for a serrated tape cutter. It is quite easy to cut by hands, it just need a little tug of your fingers. I was surprised, that it also cuts smooth, even and very clean as regular tapes split or cut in a haphazard way.So, the verdict is that it is very convenient tape to use. No need for a pair of scissors, nor a serrated tape accessory which I have suffered a cut before.If there is a con, the tape is less strong than regular tapes. I taped an envelope and a box, and then I tried to rip both the envelope and the box to see how they held up. Both instances, the tapes ripped easily compared to regular tapes.I love this tape; I even used it to a lot of gift wrapping this last Christmas. I may only be a little wary to use it if security and safety is very an important concern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"If you're anything like me, you can never find anything you need when you need it-- like scissors for cutting a strip of packing tape to seal a package. I usually use tape dispensers, but I feel wasteful when I don't buy refills and instead just buy a whole new plastic dispenser. Problems are solved with this tear-by-hand tape, which is surprisingly sturdy considering it takes nothing more than your two hands to rip it. It's actually thicker than tapes with dispensers, which I wasn't expecting, and is very easy to tear.The only things that I could find fault with is that the roll is a little small, which makes it easy to lose especially as there is no large dispenser to hold it, and that it's expensive for how little you get. However, for some the convenience of tear-by-hand may be worth the extra cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than white milk!","review":"Love it, Love it! Best thing since white milk!

It looks like I made the right choice. This one C-O-O-K-S for the full 79 minutes!! And what a supporting cast with such names as Gene Ammons, George Benson, Kenny Burrell and Grant Green just to name a few!This one is good from start to finish. It's an excellent introduction to McDuff and it compels me to want to explore his work further whether it be the recordings from which these tracks were drawn or those outside of what's contained here.If you're into organ-driven small combos, you can't go wrong with this one. Jack McDuff is smokin'!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Party Time!","review":"Ain't nothin' but a party! This is wonderful infectious soul-jazz, McDuff, of course, was a master on the Hammond organ, and he shows off his stuff with empressive ferocity over the course of this 70-minute-plus collection. But it just isn't McDuff on the organ; you have a veritable all-star cast of jazz musicians helping him out on each song, names such as Grant Green, George Benson, Kenny Burrell, and Red Holloway. There are times when McDuff gets going and, cliche it may be, but it sounds like his organ is on fire. Really, you can almost feel the temperature rising as he blazes away on that organ. This is funky, soulful, and swingin' stuff. If you enjoy jazz organ players such as Jimmy Smith, you need to have this outstanding Brother Jack McDuff in your collection too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginner's best guide","review":"I'd say it's one of the best books out there for beginners. It takes controversial topics that are abtruse to neophytes and explains it in a simple, unbiased manner - always allowing two sides to argue the subject to the best of their abilities, neither lacking. I felt the chapter about God really covered the logic and ideas behind both sides; atheists and theists. In fact, for anyone I have met that shows interest in philosophy I recommend this book and The Story of Philosophy by Bryan Magee. This is one of the best books I know for beginners, though Bryan Magee's book is more for the intermediate, seeing as how it takes a short look at the studies, teachings and history of key philosophers throughout history, such as Plato, Socrates, Machavelli, Newton, etc. in a chronological order.My favorite chapter is the vegetarian chapter. Seeing as how I'm an ethical vegetarian, I feel it points out the flaw(s) in eating meat very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy with a Twist","review":"This is a great starter book for children.

As many, many reviewers have pointed out, alll the elements come together neatly in this musical, which is quite rare. The ensemble is particularly strong (each member of the cast is strong) and the songs and music remain wonderful to listen to despite the revisions.The CD is equally outstanding. The sound is clear and crisp and even the packaging is creative (love the fan!) Of course, nothing beats seeing the production since the CD contains only the songs, not the dialogues (and you should see the wonderful, colorful costumes!)

It stars the first Asian Tony Award winner, Lea Salonga. Let me just say that she has a large following in Southeast Asia, and considered as one of the most talented singers around. However, the new FDS is a disappointment. The attack on Love Look Away is inappropriate. It is supposed to be a countertext song, however LEa delivered it like a Miss Saigon. Very typical. Jose Llana's voice is very nasal. At first, it sounds so earnest, but it gets to be a little bugging. The musical is so repetitive. I hope Lea would really analyze3 the material she is doing. Hope she learns to do proper character analysis. The rodgers and hammerstein material might not be well-known, but it is still a classic. If it cannot be done properly, do not tamper with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Mess!!","review":"One of the most beautiful scores written for the 1960's stage has been put in the muzak blender and what comes out is banality. All the music arrangements are predictable and the dance music is a rip-off of \\"Sweet Charity.\\" The performances are wooden and one dimensional and David Hwang Howe's re-assignments of the songs is absurd. No wonder business was so bad.I have no idea why the R & H Organization allowed this to take place. The original book is almost better than the score. I think the original wasn't a huge success because it was poorly directed by the inexperienced stage director Gene Kelly. What a shame R & H didn't get Jerome Robbins and Bob Fosse involved. I'll bet they would have jumped at the chance.Why not trust in the masters and get Jerry Zaks to direct the original?"},{"rating":"1","title":"oh gee, what a bummer","review":"For those who loved the beautiful original cast album, this one is a stinker.Lea Salonga, who is supposed to have just come off the boat, sings with an American twang. In recognition of her star status, she sings \\"Love Look Away,\\" which was sung by another character in the original.For those who saw the Broadway play, the question was, \\"Why did Lea Salonga play the demure girl with her brassy delivery? Shouldn't she have played the Americanized hotsy patootsie?\\" Easy, if she played the one who sang \\"I enjoy being a girl,\\" she would have had to wear a towel (like Nancy Kwan) and she needs a beach towel to hide all that fat.Her singing is so far from the evocative one of Miyoshi Umeki.Henry David Hwang should be strung up for this parody he has made of a beautiful classic. Or maybe he should be forever condemned to mutilations of well loved plays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good revival - some of the updating works , some doesnt","review":"I have to admit I miss the lyrics of the old \\" Chop Suey \\" and the the song \\" The Other Generation\\". Some of the re-written parts sound touching , some leadenly politically correct. Like the new orchestrations but some of the tempos are odd- e.g.\\" Love Look Away\\" has some odd sections.

And if the characters spoke English with a thick accent, then the show would have perpetuated the condescending attitude the original Flower Drum Song production had, which is one of the things this new version is rallying against!Language in the show is obviously used for audience communication purposes, not as an ethnic identifier, a BASIC technique that's also used in the movies.

The combination of American late 50s sound with Chinese sounds only makes the orchestration more beautiful.I wish I had seen the musical, so I could also witness the great choreography and costumes this musical is very famous for.

For some unknown reason I had a difficult time hearing the music the night I saw it and felt that the energy might have been low. But, this recording opened the window for me for this beautiful music; I have already listened to it three times since receiving it in the mail yesterday. Already I am looking forward to returning to New York and plan to see it again.

She was a fine singer, but sadly Mahler was not her forte).. Both Gramophone and Deryck Cooke gave this reading very high marks. The quality of the Leinsdorf recording is extraordinary - one would not guess that it was originally released over forty years ago.

Amazon lists the retail price as $28 reduced to 13.99 but the APC web site lists the price at 12.99.... a dollar cheaper than Amazon. The low price makes sense because it only has 240 joules of surge protection per the APC specs (which amazon conveniently left out of the description).

When removing the tape from something, it comes off cleanly. It marketed as a mailing and storage tape but I was always suspect about how strong it really is because when I use it on cardboard boxes, I would always easily able to pull the tape off cleanly. Perhaps thats a good thing when opening boxes, perhaps it takes a while for the adhesive to fully be intertwine with the box, either way, I was never confidence of the product. But I was really hoping it would be a multi-use tape - again, the structure of the tape itself was strong, and it does work well on paper products, but the adhesive never holds to anything else, such as my wall, plastics, and fabric - I'm only saying this because its lower-grade product like its magic, or even masking tape did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sticky enough - peels off","review":"I've used a lot of packing tape over the years and I am dissatisfied with this brand.

If the water temperature is any warmer then cool (as the enclosed slips of paper warn), you will instantly lose the paint on the base of the glass. For some reason, the paint on the upper portion of the glass seems at least a bit more durable. Also, for whatever reason, Block Basics stuck a circular glued on tag on the top of the base covering a portion of the paint.

The story is wonderfully written with a number of twists and turns. The story is set in Shotgun, Texas in the 1800's. One twist in the story is that the deputy is a woman by the name of Liberty(Libby). She \\"backs up\\" her Sherrif brother(Griffen) because she is a very good shot. However a stranger comes to town and turns everything upside down for Libby. Hence the romance story.

If you've got lots of cash and want to see your custom design come to life this book may be for you.

Putting heart in to what's usually regarded as a mental or social game, Ms. Post breathes a life of understanding into what otherwise would be a trite lexicon of customs. To the modern individual, it promotes ideas of selfless acts and words to create a better society, just be advised of the pitfalls of judgementalism, acts for the sake of routine, and false demeanor.

I really liked MBV's \\"Loveless\\" album because of it's wall-of-noise and very non-pop sound.

Ms. Eisnitz research does turn up the bad in the food industry with regard to meat production, processing and distribution, however; she paints the whole industry with the taint of the worst offenders. Also, she either has not studied the worst examples of fruit and vegetable production, processing and distribution or she would, under the same premise inferred from this book, recommend we don't eat anything. I grew up on a family farm and still have close ties to many who farm for a living even though I don't.

Slaughtering of Red meat livestock has never been a pretty sight, i will say(since my father was a professional slaughterer and butcher for 28 years), but generally the treatment of the animals is godd.

She approaches the topic from several distinct views, raning from the treatment and abuse of slaughterhouse workers, to the cruel grotesque way in which the animals are raised and slaughtered, as well as the political motivations that allow the industry to persist on in this illegal and inhumane mode of operation. Ultimately, Eisnitz reveals how the meat industry puts profit above the our safety (through diseased animals, bacteria, feces, and other contamination), non existent worker \\"safety\\", and she presents how the meat industry makes a mockery of our elected governemnt, with the USDA protecting profits, not us.

Since USDA seems unable to conduct surprise inspections, one must assume that USDA is in cahoots with the meat industry, surprise surprise. The filthy conditions and working environment in the chicken slaughterhouse is unbelievable, but the information came from so many different sources I DO believe it. I was not a meat eater before reading this book, now I have earmarked pages to show to carnivorous friends when they come to my house. The filthy conditions alone are enough to turn anybody off eating meat, but add to that the incredible cruelty to the animals, specially those described at the hog slaughterhouse, makes one believe the workers at the plants have absolutely no feelings at all. This is so shameful and slaughterhouses should be investigated by somebody other than the USDA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent....although difficult to read","review":"At first I have to say that this was a difficult book to read. The author makes you look at where meat acutually comes from. She takes you from the bright aisles of the grocery store to the kill floor. She exposes the practices of the meat packing industry who not only mistreat the animals that are being slaughtered, but also the workers who are processing the animals. Opens your eyes to the fact that if these companies don't care about the working conditions of their workes, don't care about the treatment of the animals...then they don't care about the consumers either. Makes a strong case for becoming vegetarian without being preachy. Writing style kept me engaged. I am glad that this author took the chances she took to produce this book. It is definately worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing documentation of greed.","review":"This book details many ways in which corporations and our government turn a blind eye to human and animal safety when it might cut into the profits of mega corporations.

This book is well-written with its interesting anectodal stories of the lives of the folks working in corporate slaughterhouses and how they are affected by their daily \\"grind\\".

I am not a Mao defender -- much of what he did matches the actions of Stalin or Hitler -- but history is best presented as evenly as possible.

There is no doubt that the Chinese people suffered greatly during the whims of Mao's reign, and that many people continue to suffer today. However, my objections to this book is that it is painted as a scholarly work, and as it is one of the most biased histories I have ever read, I find that I view the whole work as flawed.There are many sweeping assumptions about Mao's motivations, gleaned from scant or small pieces of evidence, or interviews with third parties. Some of them seem so far fetched that I found myself cringing.I have read \\"Wild Swans\\" and enjoyed it as much as can be said for such a harrowing story. However it is with this knowledge that I can see what the authors are trying to achieve with this book. They do achieve it, and have stirred up considerable controversy with this work, but I feel some of the scholarly merit has been lost in the ranting."},{"rating":"1","title":"a book full of misuse and misinterpretation","review":"I kept reading this book for half month then gave up--no need to waste more time. This is a book full of misusing of materials and misinterpretation. For people who lost their father or mother in the culture revolution like one of the author, they have all the rights to hate Mao personally. But this does not mean that they can misinterpretate history from a very biased view. There are many times during my reading that I just laughed out how the authors try to portait Mao as an uncomparable evil monster. It is no doubt Mao has many shortcomings and many very wrong decisions. But it is so funny to try to describe him as a such monster full of horrible evils.If you do not want to waste time, no need to read this.

They ignored or delibrately chose to neglect facts that did not support their views, and only mentioned facts consistent with their views.

This is so judgemental, not an objective way to represent history."},{"rating":"1","title":"The mao-maoing of Mao","review":"Unfortunately, this exhaustive tattle-tale of Mao has all the earmarks of an insider's pisstake on a former hero with whom the biographer became disillusioned. Author Jung Chang was a Red Guard at the age of 15, but grew to despise the party and its leader, as is made abundantly clear in this hideously revisionist examination of the Chinese Communist revolution. The obivious problem is that neither Chang nor collaborator Haliday are particularly distinguised historians, nor do they prove up to the task of taking on the monumental historical figure of enormous complexity that was the real Mao. Having lived a third of my life in East Asia, I am acutely aware of what passes for scholarship there but what is often merely biased translation of anecdotal heresay. I suspect that much of this book consists of just that, and not much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fabulous Jung book.","review":"Mao is an excellent read, loaded with information and difficult to put down. Years ago, I read Wild Swans which was a page turner and Mao is also. Jung and her husband have spent many years researching this book and it shows.

Fast, you win; slow, you lose. Any organization, political or corporate, that cannot translate the constantly falling cost of information into higher information velocity, is doomed.This excellent work shows how Mao raised information costs for everyone but himself, and brought information velocity to a dead stop, effectively shutting the door to China's future. His methods were unspeakably brutal -- one Holocaust per quarter during the Great Leap Forward -- and his interest in those closest to him non existent.Editing: Four Stars.

This books is full of lie, just like many similar book written by oversea Chinese, the purporse of this kind of book is simply make sensation, and make great money. Those people who bought their books is joked as \\"Yuan Da Tou\\" in Chinese which means fools who like to spend money by cheated.To lie in court is crime, I don't know why writing book by lying is not crime.

The authors put together a strong argument for the first sentence in the book which basically describes Mao as the worst despot ever. I do not doubt that the book is well researched. However, I wish the authors would have provided citations and footnotes. That would help to lend the strong anti-Mao message more credibility. Maps at the beginning of the book are not very helpful. However, Jung Chang's insights into human nature make this book an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Myth of Mao Continues On and On and On","review":"\\"Mao,\\" tells a story that is as unknown to the world at large as it was unknown to Nixon and Kissinger as they, and others, attempted to negotiateour involvement in Korea and Vietnam. Mao was behind it all, including the genocide of 70,000,000 of his own people. Never have so many peoplethrough out the world been so ignorant of the evil activities of a nations leader for so long a period of time. Mao, the man, makes Hitler and Stalin look like sunday school teachers by comparison. Mao trained Pol Pot with the same ideas for the destruction of modern civilization that he forced on China.

The excesses visited upon so many hundreds of millions of Chinese people leaves one speechless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skeptical","review":"I stopped reading at about pg 300 as I began to suspect that what I was reading was more of a screed than a biography. While I have no doubt that Mao was a murdering, incompetent butcher - it's hardly a debatable observation and was of course a well-known fact before this book came along - I just got the feeling that there was a pseudo-religious zeal in these authors' portrayal of everything Mao ever did as evil, corrupt, ineffective at best and disastrous more often than not. They get their foot on Mao's throat on Page 1 and don't let up. Now while he might deserve it, I just never got the sense that what the authors were saying was necessarily totally accurate.

The ways they selectively presented and intentionally misintepreted evidence are oftentimes childish. Their theory in historical explanation is simple: 1/ Mao was responsible for every bad thing happend to the Chinese people (and many others) during the time he lived on this planet, and 2/ all other people were just dummies being manipulated by Mao in any way he wanted (and this includes not only the Chinese people, who struggled, suffered, and sacrificed for their ideals, but also foreign leaders of all ideological persuations).The Yale historian Jonathan Spence gave a polite but damaging review of this book in last year's New York Review of Books. Anyone who can find that review should read it before spending time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"As a work of history this book is terrible. As a work of dubious fictional value, I guess it'll do. The author has an obvious axe to grind here and it shows thru on every page. Blanket claims are made and without any proof. Just the authors opinion. That is fine in a work without significance, but not in a historical book. I guess maybe I was expecting something from this book that it wasn't. As a serious look at Mao and communist China this book is a major disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Maoist Propaganda of the Worst Kind","review":"Much like her other book, \\"Wild Swans\\", this is another piece of Imperialist-apology and anti-Communism that would make Joe McCarthy proud.It reads like cheap fiction, and in the end, has little historical value.Read \\"Red Star Over China\\", \\"Fanshen\\", and \\"From Ike to Mao\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"This is one of the most overated works of history I have ever read. I have seen better written essays from a teenager. It is written in the style of a tabloid newspaper article.

I managed to read the first 10 chapters hoping this book might provide a new perspective on Mao's life. However, this book turned out to be a completely biased joke. It seems to me what happened was the authors decided Mao was a devil and then started collecting or more accurately distorting the fact to fit the view. In these ten chapters I have read, most of the critical claims cannot be substantiated and most of \\"facts\\" either cannot be verified or can be interpreted in a completely different way. This book certainly should be read as a conspiracy book or a pure fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"China's Monster","review":"The complete biography of Mao Tse Tung, dictator of China, who was responsible for the deaths of more than 70 million Chinese during his reign of terror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but biased,Disinformation Bad writing","review":"Shameless lies all over.

It's not really the \\"untold\\" story, more like the same old retold politically correct story about \\"Mao killed millions\\" based on crudely faked statistics.

Readers will learn much about Mao that the American media has refused to cover over the decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"A history on Mars","review":"If you are familiar with the history of China in the 20th century, you will find that Mrs. Zhang is telling a story on Mars, not on the earth. Many so-called 'facts' in this book are simply faked by the authors or just from hearsay. Some are even jokes, e.g. the astonishing claim that KMT General Hu is actually a communist spy! The authors reach this surprising conclusion without any solid evidence (most of the proofs therein are without any reference).Therefore, the only comment I can make on this book is that it is about a history in the authors' mind (or on Mars), not in China, Earth. It is targeted at attacking Mao, not discovering the history. Anyway, it is not bad to regard it as a collection of jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"a deeply flawed book","review":"this is a passionate book borne of horrendous personal experience; what it is not is a valuable history of mao and his era. while deservedly exoriating mao for everything from his ruthlessness to his womanizing, it provides no insights into how mao triumphed. rather than repeat reviews that have been written, it is strongly suggested that interested readers turn to andrew nathan's devastating and meticulous review in the london review of books. this is, in the end, a book to confirm manichean views of china, not an effort at serious historical inquiry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story I read from the book is not true","review":"I read the book quickly. Unfortunately, my impression is that the authors did not tell us the truth. I cannot conclude that she/he lied completely. But, at least, the authors misled readers like you and me too much. I understand that Ms. Zhang's hatred toward Mao, her father died during Mao's culture revolution period. But if you are writing a book, you should be serious about the truth of history, you should not fabricate histroy due to your hatre. Am I right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Gabbage","review":"I give the book an one star because there is no 0 star to select. I would say this book is 5% facts and 95% fibrication by the author. It becomes a fashion to trash the late Chinese leader for some Chinese living abroad who have personal agenda or want to make money by meeting the taste of some very few die heart anti-communists Westerners. Mao made mistakes in his later life but his contribution to China is far far greater than his mistakes. Mao's legacy in China will live for ever, Only the majority of Chinese people know how great Mao was, not those who just want to distort history to make a buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate Mao","review":"I hate Mao, would have been a more appropriate title for this book, as it is obvious that Jung Chang does. While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, it should be presented as such, rather than in a book that is meant to rewrite history. Jung Chang tends to simplisticly interpret specific actions of Mao, without placing them in the wider context of the disarray that existed in China. The reader cannot help but feel that Jung Chang is forcing her subjectivity onto the reader. Any profound revelations of Mao is lost in this poorly written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suitable for Extremist Agendas Only","review":"One thing stands clear from reading the many reviews: those supporting this abysmal biography are clear-cut, tinfoil hat right-wing ideologues on the rampage against 'The Liberal Beast'.

I don't blame the authors for trying to make a couple of dollars by sensationalize and distort history to their liking. no one can really say their version of history is 100% accurate, but this is almost cartoonish in nature. I just hope some poor person don't actually believes any of this non-sense.So read this book for fun, but please don't take it seriously, and god forbid please do not bring anything up from this in a discussion with your friends or family who are knowledgeable in Chinese history.

The cruelty and devil-like mentality is extraordinary. Documented proof of Mao's mass murders for the sake of his personal power. Also, by reading this book, you learn tons of small facts about Chinese customs and people, which is fascinating. Strongly recommend for any intelligent thinker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly executed","review":"I bought this book because I was hoping to read a new account of one of history's most glossed over mass murderers, but I was very disappointed by the lack of simple foot or end noting of the authors' sources. One can not write a book that calls into question the veracity of some of the most prominent events and people of the 20th century and then not offer actual evidence. There are many better books than this about Mao that do offer sources. Read those instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unscholarly, retreads same old ground","review":"I had to put this book down after a couple hundred pages. I am not sympathetic to the left in any way, but this book is very weak. There are no footnotes. As another reviewer said, the authors lay into Mao on page one and don't stop. Could your point of view be a little more transparent please?Essentially, they argue that Mao is an opportunistic, incompetent, sadist. He wanted to have power in order to be cruel, but it he came to power despite himself and his bumbling actions.So what is their agenda? What does it prove if Mao was not a true believer, contrary to all the evidence? Would the famines have been better if Mao \\"really\\" believed what he said?Don't buy this confused, amateurish pop-history book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relentlessly Brutal","review":"If a picture is truly worth 1,000 words, Jung Chang could have drawn a crisper portrait and spared us the repetitive and monotonous diatribe that stretches over 600 pages. This depressing narrative is peppered with painstaking details on each solitary injury, strategic blunder and character foible of Mao over his long and lethal lifetime. As insightful and illustrative as all this might be, she could have chosen a few select examples and still made her points about what a savage, conscienceless thug he was.The best chapters are those that depict Mao's scheming interactions with fascinating world-stage characters ranging from Stalin and Khrushchev to Kissinger and Nixon. The entertaining anecdotes about his personal habits and odd scatological humour add colour and lighten the dismal recounting of the fate of the mind-numbing millions who suffered under Mao. But, overall, the experience of reading this lengthy tome can be as relentlessly brutal as Mao himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Green Book","review":"This poorly written book presents Mao as a ruthless imbecile who became the monstrous ruler of around one billion people. Ruthless and monstrous he may have been, but how an imbecile could have achieved this is beyond me.That Mao was rather a bad man is not really news. One redeeming feature of Jung Chang's book is that it might lead readers to better, and less vitriolic accounts of this great tyrants life. There are many better books on the subject. Ross Terrill's biographies of Mao, and his wife Jiang Qing, \\"The White Boned Demon\\" are both quite good. Also highly recommended are \\"Life and Death in Shanghai\\" by Nien Cheng, and \\"The Private Life of Chairman Mao\\", by Li Zhi-Sui.Whether or not any of these books will have a lasting or positive effect upon humanity is highly unlikely as I think there will always be populations subject to rule of despots. It's the nature of life. It has always happened, and is happening right now in many parts of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. The substance was thin at best. It was not what I was expecting. I thought there would be more detail on Mao's life. A more pronounced understanding of the man and what drove him. What was presented appeared to be no more than speculation. I really don't think that Mao's preoccupation with his bowel movements is overly relative, yet the author felt this was important enough to mention more than once. Just a very inept presentation of the story of a man with significant impact on world history.

Also: \\"Zhong Zhuzing (who we shall now refer to as ZZZ)...\\" Then why not also \\"refer\\" to Mao as MTT throughout?

Secondly, it doesn't make sense that this is printed as such a glossy durable map, like one that you would use frequently on the road, or in the streets, because this map won't do you much if any good during your travels.

The texts are fairy tale type fables, totally unconnected with the prints, which are unidentified and undated, presented in an unsystematic hodge podge.The author claims to have identified erotic literature dating from 5000 years ago. Pre Shang dynasty! What literature is that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A much needed testimony","review":"No doubt New Agers and followers of Eastern mysticism (especially Sai Baba devotees) will dismiss this book out of hand. However I wonder how many of them have the same experience of the Eastern path that Tal Brooke has? My only quibble is that I'd have liked to read more of what happened to Mr Brooke after he left India. Also some parts in the middle are slightly boring but then I guess they were necessary to give the reader a real \\"feel\\" of day to day life in an ashram. This book should be a real eye-opener to anyone who reads it with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for more details?","review":"If you have enough patience for more details and Hinduism terminology you may consider the unabridged version which istitled \\"Lord of the air\\".See also my review of that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avatar of Night","review":"The book starts by a fascinating story about a youth {the author} in USA who lives in the time of chaos {the 50 to 80} and his spiritual search leads him through the basics of East Asiatic religions namely Hinduism and Budhism and related teachings. He lives 2 years together with Sai Baba in India . Baba is one of the most strange \\"Holy\\" mans of India. Tal Brooke finally discover the demonic nature of this and all similar teachings ! In short the Christian/Biblical view of Good versus Evil he discovers is fundamentally different from ANY other religion ! While the book is probably the most interesting I have seen it is also scary in the extreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction presented as facts - A Character Assassination","review":"The book is a one-sided, misleading, malicious, biased, prejudiced, fictional, character-assassinating attempt of one who is actually helping the humanity. Tal Brooke's account is a revenge because of him being admonished for indiscipline in the Ashram. His attempt to tarnish the image of such a spiritual leader is indeed a sacrilege. What is mentioned as truth is actually a lie. Many of the events mentioned by the author are also not true. He has carefully camouflaged fiction with facts. Though he is careful in his language, he does achieve his purpose. His purpose is to tarnish the image of Sathya Sai Baba. Readers who have never before seen Baba, are bound to be misled. The author has the clear intent of Character Assassination. This is a book written with a good language and style but with a bad intent.The readers of this book better be forewarned that the content is actually fiction and lies disguised as facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLY WRITTEN!","review":"It amazes me that someone can actually find this book to be \\"exceptional\\" because Tal Brooke is a hippie! I think that this book is based on one of Tal Brooke's LSD trips. Tal....please do your research.......you are only embarassing yourself! To the rest of the readers, please read Sai Literature, you will quickly find that Tal's book is based purely on his LSD trips!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close","review":"I can't even give this books a half a star, but because of the requirement of the website, I have to give it at least 1 star. This book is nothing but a lashing out of people who do not understand Divinity or its embodiment. Who are we to judge until we have reached the level? Give up foolishness and try to understand the significance of the Masters. They do not need to do anything, but they do it for us. Don't ever purchase this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Spiritual Counterfeit: isTal Brooke","review":"Tal Brooke attempts to smash the ocean, to shoot the sun. Like many Western animal-eaters, Tal had an addiction to animal flesh which contains trioxypurine, uric acid, more addictive than caffeine, dioxypurine. He was not able to maintain the vegetarian diet of Hindus and true Christians (Genesis 1: 29, Genesis 1: 12, Daniel 1, Isaiah 65, Isaiah 1, Revelation's 5th angel, Jesus' command to feed the hungry. Jesus: ye are whited sepulchres (literally in the Greek, sarcophagi, flesh eaters (sarx flesh phagus eat). When Tal Brooke was in the Georgetown cafeteria he said to a woman with a vegetarian tray \\"You're not still into that nonsense are you?\\" The Texas cattle industry, the Iowa pork industry, the Arkansas poultry industry, the Massachusetts and Maryland seafood industries, the primate research establishment.. are all threatened by the advance of dietary nonviolence."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE SEAMY SIDE OF SAI","review":"Tal Brooke's revealing of his experiences with the famed Indian holy man, Sai Baba, is fascinating and revealing. Certain to infuriate Sai Baba devotees, the book is well written and addresses the man behind the \\"God\\" mask. It is certain to make the reader think about the pursuit of Eastern gurus, who, in many cases, are ultimately unmasked for the frail human businessmen that they really are. Brooke undoubtedly has taken quite a bashing for his outspoken book; however, with the ever burgeoning television and newspaper articles which confirm his original findings, he can finally be appreciated for the effort he made to get the truth out to an often hostile audiance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tal Is A Pioneer","review":"Tal Brooke takes on the Indian guru Sathya Sai Baba revered by many as an avatar. Though a bit egocentric in tone, Brooke is the first to write of the darker side of Sai Baba, a story now echoed and confirmed by many around the world. Well worth reading whether the reader agrees with Tal's return to fundamentalism or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth the shipping","review":"Some of the paint came off after the first time I cleaned the glasses (by hand).

The reading can be tedious at first but stick with it and you'll be in for the literary ride of your life.A conglomeration of rejection letters, journals, poems, love letters, and notebook pages interspersed with a storyline about a writer writing about a writer, it at first glance appears to be the writings of an easily distracted child. As one delves deeper into the work, however, it takes on the appearance of an abstract painting, each part a different color that when brought together as ingeniously as Sorentino has done, form what one can only call a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was a HUGE fan of \\"God on a Harley\\" - and so when I saw another title by Joan Brady, I scooped it up with much enthusiasm.

We bought this battery to replace the original Sharp BT-H32U battery as we wanted to use the camcorder during our overseas trip. It seemed to charge OK but once we started using the camcorder in Australia (where it was winter) it started functioning strangely.At times it would show flat battery, then show full and at times switch itself off. Often the charge would not last very long at all compared to the original battery. As a result of doing one or more of these functions in quick succession, it jammed the tape in the camera and nearly lost us all the video we had taken. Luckily I managed to remove the tape without breaking it, but from that time we used the camera sparingly and did not switch it on/off too often when we did use it.Overall, I do not believe it is too much to ask that something as simple as a camcorder battery be reliable - which this one was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't rate a product in the negatives but this one is.","review":"I was thrilled.The battery arrived today.

I love the combination of a gift that is both a primary book from their teacher, coupled with the larger message of the poem for the recipient who is soon embarking upon confronting life on his or her own! A very special and meaningful gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Rocks","review":"This book is awesome. It is a wonderful and inspiring poem by Maya Angelou, filled with intriquing and probing illustrations. The illustrations do an excellent job of depicting the complex emotions of children's fears, while the poem teaches them to overcome their trepidation over the world around them. I plan on transferring this story onto chart paper and having my Kindergarten class memorize it in the fall. Reciting it together will be an excellent way for them to begin the day with confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undecided","review":"The pictures are abstract looking and dark in tone. The book makes reference to; ghosts, bad men fighting in the dark, and cougars in the park. I'm not sure my 3 or 5 year old children had thought up these bad things on their own yet. While reading them the book I felt uneasy about the dark pictures and scary references to things they may not have even thought of before. I'm still undecided if it will be helpful in convincing them that they don't need to be afraid of life or if it will convince them that life is pretty scary and they ought to be afraid! There is one reference to 'having a lucky charm up her sleeve' that protects her from the bad stuff and also allows her to walk on the ocean floor without having to come up to breathe. Those are both useless defenses in the real world so the book doesn't offer any real reasons to not be scared of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"But The Pictures In This Book Did","review":"While life may not scare me, the pictures in this book did. Perhaps had I been familiar with Basquiat's work I would not have ordered the book in the first place. But I also thought the poem was a bit oversold by some of the other reviews I read. The poem itself is only a few lines long, while the book is more like 20 pages or so. Several more pages are taken up with bios of Angelou and Basquiat. Mainly, the pictures are ugly and seem to me to be completely unaccessible to a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Bosh","review":"What a deep, deep woman this Maya Angelou is. At least this book ADMITS it's for little kids, unlike a lot of her other work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I thought this book was excellent.

This is a wonderful story for children, as well as adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable read","review":"Well! The first three chapters I felt were very slow - to be honest I even wondered whether I would finish the book however - all of a sudden the book hits you with action, magic, war, master vampires, betrayal, ghosts the lot - turned out to be a really good read and i've ordered the next book - not as good as Anita Blake but an ejoyable read anyway"},{"rating":"1","title":"A confusing book with an unlikeable heroine","review":"I've been looking for a new series to start since I read Mercedes Thompson Novel by Patricia Briggs. I loved the characters and the fact that she involved fae, werewolves, shape shifters and vampires. Needless say when Amazon recommended Karen Chance's a Touch the Dark I jumped at the chance to start a new series. However, this isn't the series for me. I hate the main character and find it hard to sympathize with her. Most of the time, while reading, I found myself hoping she would be caught and killed. The author jumped around so much giving useless information that when I wasn't hating or being annoyed by Cassandra I was utterly confused by the irrelevant information being tossed around throughout the book. I can say that I did re-read the book in a way because many times I had to re read a page to see what was going on and why Cassandra was being melodramatic. I feel as though I wasted money and time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three hours of my life I'll never get back","review":"I was looking forward to this book and was tragically disappointed. The heroine, Cassie, is vapid and boring. Fifty pages in I was hoping for someone, anyone, to kill her. The backstory was delivered at such an awkward pace that I couldn't figure out why I was supposed to be rooting for her. There were too many characters and zero character development. If one more historical personage turned out to be a vampire I think I would have thrown the book at the wall and screamed. The scenes were choppy and went nowhere. It felt like the author was trying to throw in every paranormal contrivance possible. I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone I liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disppointed","review":"I bought this after reading Kelley Armstrong's series and while in the middle of Laurell K. Hamilton's series of novels. I found myself wanting to get to the end of the book, only so that it would be over. I was bored reading it and found myself even drifting at times. I even found myself rooting for something to happen to Cassie. I couldn't feel anything for the character. And it jumped around so much, I was like 'huh'? When I started to read it, I thought, ooh, vampire gangsters, that's cool. But there were no gangsters in the story, but for a few minutes. And I don't want to spoil anything but the cheese factor with the choice of well-known villains turned vampires, like Jack the Ripper, was ridiculous. Most of the story actually took place in a hotel room where everything was explained to the main character. I was very disappointed with this read. Not worth continuing with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book","review":"I was disappointed by this book, I wasn't able to connect with the characters in the book, it was kind of all over the place, just not well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it!","review":"Yikes. I really wanted to like this book because it sounded like a really interesting premise and such a different idea than most of the paranormal romances. I found myself reading and rereading certain parts just to try to figure out exactly what was going on. I was more than halfway through the book when I realized I still didn't know why she was taken - then I decided that I really didn't care anymore. I was also hoping there would be some romance instead of these strange convoluted interludes. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't even know..","review":"One of the worst books I have read. I have hundreds of books, I'm very open to reading different things. Love Sci-fi!!! But this one? BORING! I dont even know whats going on half the time! I got to page 200 and still had no idea what was going on. I thought I just accidently picked up book 2 or 3 in the series, because for a first book, it is very confusing. They go into history a little, but the description of the past is vague. Too fast paced. Things need to slow down and go into more conversation and backround. I usually read books of this size in one day. It took me five to get through it because it did not capture my attention, mostly because i just didnt know what was going on!! Keep your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better choices out there","review":"This book is has way too much going on in it. The multiple story lines and choppy transitions make it an unenjoyable read. I felt as if the story just did not flow! I picked this book because it was the first in a vampire/paranormal series. I enjoy reading series. I will not be buying the second book in this series! It is all I can do to get through this one. I am still in process of reading it and it taking me much too long. I would highly recommend the Sookie Stackhouse series by Charlaine Harris if you enjoy Vampire/Paranormal with much more character depth and story line.

I should have checked another of her books out at the library first. This book started out well, but by a third of the way through, too many characters had been introduced, there was too much explanatory/processing of thoughts material, and it devolved from there into a boring, tedious read. I did finish it, but I wanted to throw it across the room when I was done. I hate spending 8 dollars for a book I don't like. I highly recommend Patricia Briggs and Ilona Andrews if you enjoy this genre. They are the best I've read, and I've read all of their books over several times now.. they are that enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"i was Seriously disappointed with this book i had a feeling i wouldnt be able to read it.i got so many good reviews and i read the plot synopsis years ago and knew i wasn't going to like it.

Would she please stop babbling?","review":"This has got to be one of the worst books I have had the unpleasant opportunity to read. The \\"heroine\\" has got to be one of the most annoying characters and she just does not shut up. Part of a story line begins and all of a sudden it's like she leaves the middle of the conversation into a wild babbling rant about herself, you get to the point where you just skim over her drivel to get the point of the encounter.And I am not sure what the point of even putting Tomas in the book was, they have little to no interaction as if she shares something special with him and yet they have never held a deep conversation.In the end she ends up messing around with her \\"uncle\\" an older vamp that comes off to me as rather gross, but hey..Two big thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to read the next one!","review":"This is the first Karen Chance book I've ever read, and I have already ordered the second book in this series. This book had me entranced from the beginning. I can't wait to continue it and see what happens to Cassie next! I think anyone who likes vampires and the paranormal will love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start","review":"The book started so slow and confusing (for book 1 of a series, not good) I put it down but eventually picked it back up and I'm glad I did. After a while the author found her pace and by the second book the world she created became intruiging and worth reading, but I had to stick with it to get the literary pay off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over enthusiastic author bogs down w/ too much plot","review":"I wish that the author has shown a bit--okay a lot--more restraint inthe plotting of this book. As it is, there is so much going on inthis book that is hard to take in. In this first book alone, there ismore than enough plot for an entire series.Not that the story or the supernatural world that Cassandra lives inisn't interesting, quite the opposite. But as a reader, I din't getto enjoy it very much because I was constantly being crammed withplot, plot, and more plot (except for the abrupt and extremelygraphic--and long-- sex scene that seemed very out of place given thetone of the rest of the book).I would have liked to become more slowly immersed into the worldrather then getting thrown in and never being allowed to come up forair. I would have read the rest of the series if the former had beentrue rather then the latter, assuming that the graphic sex scenehadn't been included. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"had potential","review":"This story had a lot of potential, but it fell short in many ways. One it jumped around a lot. And then some of the action scenes I had to reread a couple of times to get just what was going on. For some reason the story just did not flow right. I read many books, a lot I check out from the library, buy or get from my book club and this was one I had picked up to add to my collection based on reviews. I hate to say it, but I was disappointed in this book. If you are looking for urban fantasy pick up Charlaine Harris, Sookie series, or the new one from Patricia Briggs, Moon Called, or the Rachel Morgan series by Kim Harrison, or even the Weather Warden series from Rachel Caine, There are so many in this genre, this book wasn't the worst but it fell short of where it could have gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok but confusing","review":"this book was good at first but got very confusing fast. Too much time was spent on the whole politics of the vampires and not enough on the charactors. Might get the next one in the seies at a used book seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"Confusing and virtually plotless. The author would jump from present to past all the time, and normally I wouldn't mind, but she does it during fight scenes. It gets confusing when one minute everyone's in a fight for their lives, the next the main character is lost in her own thoughts about the past for pages after pages. When I was half way through the book, I realized nothing's happened yet. It had all been about Cassandra's ramblings of the past. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Ideas, Poor Execution","review":"This book had so much potential - the alternate reality that Karen Chance has created is new and refreshing and could be very interesting to read about, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. I thought the quality of the writing was absolutely dreadful - Chance just couldn't translate the story on paper. They way Chance bounced around between subjects was confusing at best. The typos were horrendous and sometimes the dialogue just didn't make sense. Chance also tried to jam pack too much information in this first installment when since this is a series, it would have been beneficial to reveal things in later books to keep the reader interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"On and On","review":"One of the worst books i have read in a long time! The author goes on and on about stuff that doesn't have anything to do with the plot AND she repeats! To add to this growing list of complaints the heroine is somewhat annoying, and is too caught up in herself. there is too much going on, and hardly anything gets explained until the last three chapters. As a person who values their time and reads alot of books to know crappy ones, take it from me: don't waste your time, money and sanity by getting this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TMI","review":"When I started this book I thought it started out ok, but then the author introduced way too much information and it was somewhat distracting. It was as if she had all these great ideas and couldn't narrow it down and didn't have a clear way of putting it together the story-line. I read a review that it was very distracting when you have an action scene and then several pages of background in the middle of it. I quite agree. There was just too many different paranormal/mythical ideas in the first book. Not sure whether to blame the author, editor or publisher on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! Cassie is a strong, intelligent heroine and I like the new twists Ms. Chance weaved into her story about vampire and magical lore and politics. I also liked that there are many different types of supernatural beings in this world from Seers, Vampires and Weres to the lesser known Satyrs and Mages. I do agree that there was alot of backstory but, I think that it was necessary so that the reader understood the main plot line. This book almost reminded me why I loved Laurell K Hamilton's earlier work in her Anita Blake series: the heroine is strong, the vampires are powerful and sexy and the story is so well developed that you kind of get sucked into this world. I looked up Ms. Chance's website and was excited to find that there will be a second book, 'Claimed by Shadow', coming out June 2007. I would recommend anyone who reads LKH, Kim Harrison or Charlaine Harris to go out and buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Omg boooooring.....","review":"Was I the only person I found this book super boring, sometimes when an author puts a lot of details into the book it makes it so boring and that's what happened with this book....

I usually check the reviews and I tend not to lead my judgement be believing in them... But I didn't like this book at all and I'm glad I borrowed it from my library instead of making a purchase on it because I would of been upset about it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted series","review":"I really tried to give this book a chance. It took two tries to read and two weeks to finish. The plot is very convoluted and the chapters are way too long. I like plots like Kim Harrison's, Charlaine Harris', and Patricia Briggs', but this confused me and never became interesting. I even read the second book in the series hoping it would help me appreciate the first. However, I found the series itself, totally unappealing. I think the author could be very good tho. I will try one of her other series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Paranormal","review":"I bought this originally because I love the Sookie Sackhouse series by Charlaine Harris, and Charlaine recently wrote in her blog about how much she enjoyed Touch the Dark. Well, I wasn't disappointed. Darker than the Sookie series, but wonderfully inventive and with a sense of humor I enjoyed. I'll definitely buy the next one from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"the main character is a vapid idiot.","review":"what i said. I gave it two stars b/c i like Karen Chance as an author, but otherwise....How does this idiot merit more page time than Midnight's Daughter? I don't read fantasy so I can hear about some pathetic poor namedropping idiot with a bimbo brain and gogo boots auditioning for a role in a one star bodice ripper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep reading!!","review":"This book is an uneven start to a truly awesome series. As many reviewers have said, the pacing in this book is jarring - action scenes interrupted by too much explanation. But Chance takes care of that in the next book (Claimed by Shadows) and in Embrace the Night - WOW! The next two books are so good, keep slogging through this one and it will be worth it. I would have given this book on its own 3 stars, but have given it 5 because the next books in the series are so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool New Fantasy","review":"Very cool concept. At first, I thought it was going to be the standard sexy vampire book, but it ended up being a lot more than that. I really didn't see the ending coming! I like books that surprise me, and this one definitely did."},{"rating":"1","title":"had the potential to be good story but is very disjointed","review":"This could have been a good story but is more than a little difficult to follow with the pace extremely fast and the herione jumping from one situation to the next with barely a pause in between. Not to mention flashing back & forth in time. Characters go from friends to foes to friends again in rapid sequence. And then, it was over. Or was it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much, too soon","review":"There's enough setup for about six books here, which unfortunately leaves little room for an actual story. Too many players, too much yakking. I waited and waited for something to develop between the characters, but gave up about 5/6 of the way through the book, just couldn't sit through any more talking. The author has taken every supernatural element she could think of and stirred it all into a Laurell Hamilton-type soup... without the whining, which is good, but also without the sex. The whole thing reads like an over-elaborated adolescent fantasy, one of that kind where the actual fantasy never gets going because the fantasist has to get every detail of the setup right before she can begin. Maybe next time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"I really wanted to like this book. It started off well but I found myself struggling to get through it. I think that my main problem is that it seems derivative of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series. I started seeing similarities everywhere and it took away from the story. Also, the explanations of Cassie's world are overly convoluted and somewhat confusing. The story also ends rather abruptly - obviously setting up a sequel.I might give the sequel a try, maybe I can forget my disappointment by 2007."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars is generous!","review":"I can't believe how many positive reviews this book has. I don't know about the rest of Karen Clark's work, but this is just a BORE!! The main idea is sort of interesting but nothing really happens and Cassie is SO stupid. If you want to read it, make sure you borrow it from a library or a friend or pay no more than 50 cents for it. You'll regret paying full price for this snooze-fest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately seeking Editor","review":"I feel strongly for this book because I really wanted it to be a success. I made it through only because I forced myself to finish it, I hate leaving books unfinished. But it was a CHALLENGE. I still have the second book sitting unread on my shelf, I am interested in the storyline but I just wish Palmer had a better editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touch the Dark: Cassandra Palmer","review":"Great series to start with if you are getting into fantasy with out the romantic babble. Not that there isn't a romantic hint. The story is strong and magically creative, though the frame work of the storyline has vampires, witches, mages, etc it's not the same old kind of wash, rinse, and repeat theme. Cassie is a great character that you can relate to and in some way really want to be inside her story. This story is funny, sexy, action packed, & attention holding. The author flows from one chapter to another sending you into a tale spin just when you think you know what's going to happen next. Karen Chance describes her characters so vividly that you can picture each face, time, clothing, and location. She can lose you in the language and the world that Cassie is trying to survive on her own terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah blah blah","review":"This book starts out all description, lots of narration and no action. Then it's a line of dialog followed by a paragraph or three of technical detail before the dialog is continued. There is no character development - I am left with no identification with any of the characters. The one character that I expected to develop - Tomas - could have been a great hero/love interest, but he just fell to pieces - scapegoat style. The main character - I can't even remember her name - made few hard decisions - everything just happens to her. She never grew, never developed into the strong ass-kicker that she could have/should have become.I have no interest in continuing the series. I have forgotten it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good first book - room to grow","review":"This is a nice first book to a series. The author introduces the characters, and by the end of the book, we know who is who, basically. The author does take a bit too much time giving back stories (maybe she should have started the book earlier), but the characters are engaging and the story is unique. Cassie has a complicated problem that will surely be addressed in future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"It was an okay book. The idea was great, but it's very involved and you feel like you're only getting a small part of the story for most of the book. The writing was good, but so much was assumed that it was very difficult to follow. But it's definately worth a read, though I won't be buying the sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocking new author!","review":"Some new vamp fiction that isn't all about sex, but has just enough to make you sizzle. I enjoyed Chance's view on the vamp world. Lot's of twists and betrayals to keep you reading to the very end. I hope there's a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it","review":"This book was very bad from beginning to the end i felt like i was about to go to sleep. It was boring and i think the most exciting part was at the very beginning when she saw her name in the paper saying that she was dead like 30 minutes after she started to read the paper. If you do not beleive me then buy the book and get mad because you didnt listen to me because it is a bad book!!! I am mad that there wasnt an option for 0 stars because i would have picked that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cliched, but readable","review":"What can I say, all the men desire her, but she keeps her virginity despite her overwhelming, burning, crazed, (did I say burning? Oh, yes I did.) pulsing, lust. So, hot heroine, desired by all, had by none. But, it's readable and decent escapist literature, and I liked the historical touches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first book","review":"There is a a lot of material here building the world that Cassandra (a seer who attracts and can communicate with ghosts) inhabits. It has Vampire mafia who raised her. The vampire Senates who govern the vampires, Weres, Wardsmiths, and others. Good character development and plot overall. Not much in the way of humor but some. A couple of rough places in the story but nothing bad.Overall and excellent read if you don't mind a complex book. The authors view of time accords well with current theroretical physics seeThe End of Time: The Next Revolution in Physics, this is a theoretical physics book but requires only basic trig for comprehension; although the concepts are difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be a Saudi","review":"Being a Saudi and having read the book, I found it to be excessivily utopic and somewhat out of touch. The truth of the matter is that our country has serious issues that require long-term solutions. Identifying the core issues relating to education, society, politics, religion and economy is the begining of a long hard journy to reinvent ourselves. For us to survive in the \\"global\\" world of today, we need to be a proactive member of the global community. Saudi Arabia will need to develop a strategy based on a vision that will ultimatly benefit the people not a vision that suits only a few members of society - We Need Leadership. We are no longer able to maintain the current pace of change, time is no longer on our side....Change is not only important it is essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly captivating book","review":"I needed something to read on a recent airplane trip, and picked this up randomly. Within 30 minutes, I was hooked. This was a well written and suspenseful book that I thought really pulls the reader into the story. The author does a fantastic job letting you in the minds of the characters so that you know not just what they're doing but why they're doing it. The only reason that this received four stars rather than five is that the ending is somewhat lacking. It was very rushed and abrupt, which was a dramatic difference from the rest of the book, which was well paced and captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive!","review":"As an Enigma enthusiast (and Enigma-E builder/owner), I would love to read this book - I have seven or eight other books on cryptography, with four of those being specifically about the Enigma. But - this title is just too expensive for my (currently salary-less) budget. What on earth makes a book cost over a hundred dollars?It's been on my Amazon shopping list for probably two years but the price only seems to go up - nnnnk wrong direction folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A FAKE!","review":"This is a FAKE cheap jersey. I dont know why this user can sell this on AMAZON. This product isnt a LECOK SPORTIF original product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Not having attempted Faulkner since high school, I decided to try this one, seeing the reviews that it was light-hearted and comedic. I have to say, I was not disappointed! It took a little while to get back into understanding the writing style, but once I did, I appreciated it that much more. His style does give you the feeling of being inside someone's head while they are telling a story. Parts of this book really did make me laugh out loud! Parts, especially when Lucius learns Miss Corrie's profession, and what it means, made me tear up a bit. To be that innocent again! All in all, this was a great story. I think it was a great reintroduction to Faulkner, and I will have to try some of his other works now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Faulkner's Finest","review":"Another marvelously wordy Faulkner novel, though this time the story is unfettered by stream-of-consciousness. This showcases precisely what there is to love about Faulkner: Believable characters still fanciful enough in their predilections to keep a person awake; sound and multilayered plotline; fascinating locales and locals. The only complaint could arise when one considers that more than three hundred pages of dense prose is funneling out of an old man to whom his own life at eleven could hardly be that clear. Of course ,this is a novel, with disbelief suspended shortly after you pick up the book. Truly remarkable; great for the casual reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"the product received is unusable","review":"1. It was received on time.2. The box said 3 cassettes, but there are 4 inside.3. Ever cassettes has portions with 2 voices,4. 2 of the cassettes had tapes run out of the cassettes, can't play at all, and can't get the tapes back to the cassettes.So the product is unusable, I'm asking a refund or exchange to a usable one.Please contact me for the exchange or refund.ThanksJenny"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to finish it","review":"This book is very hard to read. Excruciatingly painful in dull plot as well as the overly wordy text. I am going to finish it as an exercise in tenacity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I Ever Read: A Reminiscence","review":"This is the worst book I ever read. I had to read it for my english class and it was horrible. Every paragraph Faulkner says something stupid about non-virtue or uses parentheses. It had about one part I liked in the whole book. All Iknow is that I will never read a book by him again or have anything to do with them [....] You can read it if you want but I would't if you do decide to read trust me, you probably will not like it. Thanks fo listening to me tell you how bad the book is!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Faulkner","review":"I find it interesting so many people found this book incomprehensible. This easily the *most* comprehensible of any of Faulkner's writings. It's also the most likable, the most charming, and the only one of his books I can say I honestly enjoyed all the way through. It's not as self-conscious, artsy, or convoluted as most of his other works, and because of that very thing, I'd say it offers more depth than even his \\"deep\\" books. Here, we actually find a cast of primarily likable characters whose adventures are all the more engaging and funny for the fact that their very ridiculousness makes them seem possible. I'm glad I stuck with Faulkner long enough to read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of humor","review":"First book by Faulkner. Loved his style. Loved the charactors. Plan to read more of his work. Will be interesting to hear what the book club has to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disclaimer:I didn't finish","review":"I'm not sure I should leave a review considering I didn't finish this book, but that, to me, is the reason I'm leaving a review. This is the first and only book (out of over 100) that I just cannot make myself read. It goes on forever like an old man telling a story with no reason. I'm sure this is a great book and I've read Faulkner before, but every time I'd pick this up to get back to it, I felt like it was a chore. Reading is a hobby and not something I want to feel is an obligation. This made it feel that way, so I had to stop. Maybe I'll return to it and finish it. When/if I do I'll amend this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reivers","review":"Nice, old copy of the book.

It's an excellent cartoon series for kids, just like any other cartoon series. Plus the drawing also deviates significantly from the original. I personally feel that this series should not be mentioned in association with the classic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"more Beethoven meets Stokowski","review":"These Decca recordings of Leopold Stokowski's interpretations of Beethovens 5th and 7th symphonies hold up quite well and at this price very good value for money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great... for the price","review":"I have only had this USB a few days, so I cannot comment on its longevity, but for now it has been working fine.

So I had really high hopes for this. I thought maybe it was a love story / adventure, mystery about a mercenary and a jungle doctor. Well, it is, but only in name. What it is, is just page after page, chapter after chapter of really bad porn. I think a lot the dialogue may have been taken straight off porn videos. I can't repeat it here because it is just full of 'F' bombs and such. What a disappointment. If it's just porn, just say it is and don't give it a description as if there is some sort of story here.

No, not a visionary and intellectually challenging exploration of social possibilities (geez, if that's what you want, go back and read LeGuin or Cherryh) but a dam' fine read that accomplishes all to which it aspires. The reviews that have compared it to O'Bryan's Aubrey - Maturin novels and (to a lesser extent) to Weber's Honor Harrington series, are dead on. Good company imho, though in this tale Drake is less technical than Weber and less encyclopaedically erudite than O'Bryan. For what it's worth and in case the word hasn't gotten around, Drake has a sequel coming out titled \\"Lt. Leary Commanding\\" due out from Baen Books this coming July.

Leary series (or the RCN series), this is an admirable book as a stand-alone as well as the opening chapter in a grand series of books. I am currently reading the fourth book as I write this review. The Hornblower/Master&Commander comparisons aside, With the Lightnings give breath to a whole society full of political intrigue as well as a military-style of writing that seems to be popular these days. Admirable also is the lack of romance and genuine friendship between the male and female leads. While known as the Lt. Leary Series in some places, Adele Mundy is as important a character as the flawed but human, Lt. David Leary. An almost perfect book that is exciting and out right funny in places because the author understands the absurdity of the human condition as well as the heroic nature of some. It will leave you wanting more and lucky for you there are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow but gets it on.","review":"If I had not read David Drake before, I would have quit about 40 pages into this story.

The Captain or his first Lt.I felt like the captain had a bad case of multiple personality disorder and would not listen to common sense and then waited for his first Lt. to bail him out of situations he created. I am not used to this type of writing. I'm used to the captain having an understanding of sailing and the sailors who work for him and the ship and I can't figure out how this yahoo ever got a commission in the first place.The captain character was either blowing hot or cold through out the book and this was very annoying.

This pack has plenty of nooks and crannies that are great for stashing and finding things quickly and easily. My point and shoot digital camera fits perfectly into the pocket that is located on the strap which is great for keeping my hands free while hiking in rough terrain and I can still have my camera safe and within reach.

I'll stop my review of the film here as it doesn't even merit the thought I've given thus far.If you're searching for a title with more substance and information, look a generation back to Donald Sutherland's performance as Paul in WOLF AT THE DOOR.

I thought it was an awesome recording but have since matured with my blues, especially when I got more of Otis's recordings and found the real Otis. This is so different than any other of his recordings it is hard to reconcile. The production should have been better considering the work that went into this recording but sadly it suffers. The songs are great some a little dire, unlike one reviewer who did'nt like \\"My Old Lady\\", I beg to differ, it was a regular in my set list of songs we played and Jerold Jemmot was inspiring and was fun to play. Otis did stuff like Rainy Night in Georgia so he could step out.

In other words, a life of self-sacrafice, love, nonviolence, tolerance and selflessness are qualities all sinners must work on.I would highly recommend this book to any Christian who strives to improve their life and life for everyone on this planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"An important point wrapped in questionable theology","review":"Boyd makes a very important point in confronting an American church that has become far too cozy with the political institutions of the day, for this I applaud him. But it becomes clear very early on in the book that the author is working from within the context of so-called \\"open theism\\" and post-millenialism. The introduction and first chapter are sufficient to make the point that the title of the book proposes to advance. After that, Boyd tries to back up his thesis using his questionable theology. This is unfortunate as a conservative understanding of the scriptures can provide sufficient support to back up the same thesis. Overall, I respect the idea that the author is advancing and I recommend that every Christian think carefully about his challenging idea, but I cannot recommend this particular work on the subject as it is couched in Boyd's questionable theological framework."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted to disagree with this book, but I couldn't.","review":"I have always wanted to believe that America was founded to be a Christian nation. Boyd took me to task. Christ emphasised how the greatest must be a servant to all and Boyd shows how the U.S.A has been anything but. I would want to live in no other place and am greatful for the freedoms we enjoy but I agreed with Boyd that the Christians home is with Christ who showed no interest in worldly \\"power over\\" tactics. Well written with plenty of scripture to support his thesis. My one problem was the feeling from time to time that the author has an axe to grind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiritually challenging; historically inaccurate...","review":"This book challenges the lack of love observed in the \\"Christian\\" community... oops there has never been a Christian community?

For years this merging of faith and politics has been gnawing at my Christianity.

This book gives a cogent scriptural argument for the separation of church and state . . . not for the sake of politics, but for the sake of the purity of the church.

I was able to disassemble it the first couple of times easily, but the locking mechanism on the blade broke the third time, and I was unable to get the blade off.

Up till a few months ago, I would have given this thing 4 stars and strongly recommended buying it to anyone that asked.Then during one short use, it got very warm quickly and started screeching like an alley cat. Thinking something got lodged, I took it apart and examined and cleaned it thoroughly. Upon putting it back together, the motor simply started humming, and it simply quit. The motor had simply fried.I've known one other person who had the same issue and I've seen it here as well. Admittedly, this was not an expensive appliance, but neither is it used even weekly.

The material in \\"Beet Fields\\" is not at all appropriate for this age group and parents of youth need to be made aware of the contents of this book.

I immediately bought it(though it was hard to find..no local bookstore carried it, so I had to buy it on-line). Anyway, enthusiastically as I approached it, I found it very slow going. The author seems to take a lot of liberties with the original story (though, in her defense, she also seems to try to explain away these inconsistancies at the end of her book). I really struggled to make it through the whole thing. I did, and it was not without its rewards, but the parts were definitely better than the whole. Still, I will definitely read the author's next book. She's very insightful and serious and an excellent stylist."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"I have to admit that I'm not a huge Scarlet Letter fan. I've only read it once so that might have colored my opinion a little. But I mostly found this book tedious. It meanders through plot and character. The conflict seems elusive: is it with Pearl's mother? father? friend? husband? herself? The story seemed to be a muddled effort to tell a tale and a historical novel.The one saving grace-the author has a most mysterious way with words. She crafts some very beautiful prose so then when reading you suddenly find yourself 50 pages down the line. The reading can be very easy and smooth like that for a while. But not for the entire story. Her eloquence is fleeting and you find yourself trying to get through confusing dialogue and half explained situations.*I recieved this book as an ARC and did not pay for it, though that did not influence my opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"Anyone who has been tired and stressed out for any length of time should read this book.

But you could probably find that online.THEN, to add insult to injury, near the back 1/3 of the book he provides two \\"sure fire\\" tests to tell you if you have adrenal fatique. Well, duh? Why not put those in the beginning so you know if you are even on the right track. And of course, my results from the tests were negative. I'd be surprised to hear of anyone who had a positive result on these tests which would give the test some credibility.Except for those two tests, I could have written this book myself from my own reading over the years and from watching Oprah.Save your money.

Buy stuff from my website to be cured!I decided against the second star for the tidbits of good info because I fear the rest of the book may be actively harmful to some people who take it seriously.Please note: I have nothing against herbal or alternative treatments which have been shown to be effective.

As I do not fancy spending the rest of my life on synthetic hormones, I was looking for something with more of a natural approach. This book was not it.Instead, it is a hodge podge of information easily obtained from other self help books, so as stress relieve exercises and basing a diet on the glycemic index. Dr. Wilson maintains a web site devoted to adrenal fatigue, but he does not put the self diagnostic \\"test\\" on it, forcing one to buy his book.

If you go to your doctor and you get a scrip. for Xanax or SSRI drugs, read this first. Your doctor may not even believe in \\"Adrenal Fatigue\\", but you will after reading this book.

As a kid growing up in the '70s, I spent every last quarter collecting the old Wacky Packages stickers. It's great to have all the old and new series collected in one book.

I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"good info, horrible design","review":"While the book is very informative and the images of the products themselves are excellent, the graphic design and typograhy are absolutely horrible and amateurish. Hideous, gaudy, psychedelic backgrounds on the pages completely detract from the images of the Wacky Packages. The typeography is awful with small type running across the full width if the page, into the center binding, with no columns to make for easier reading. They seem to use about 50 different fonts. The pages are crammed and cluttered. It's a shame. I plan on returning mine before it has a chance to fall apart. A much cleaner layout would really help this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is fun","review":"My husband and kids (Wacky Package collectors) love this book!

As a long term fan of the thriller/horror genre it was great finding a film that I can watch again, and had what I found to be a unique and interesting story-line and cast.

However, this movie by far is not Jason Behr's best work. I much preferred him on Roswell. In any case, the premise of a cursed tattoo instrument is, to say the least, lame. The script was not lukewarm and undeserving of the JB's talents. The sign of a great movie is that you would watch it again sometime in the future. That's not going to happen here.

When I looked at the description of this book on amazon.com, it mentioned nothing about it just being a smut novel.

You could boil the story line down to about 3 pages, at about the same level as a junior-high writing assignment. Too bad, really, because the overall premise isn't without creativity. If you cut out the boringly detailed erotic encounters, develop an actual plot and give the characters some - dare I say it - fleshing out, this could be interesting alternate universe.

So I was intrigued with the idea of a parallel Earth/Mageverse Universe. But I was also expecting a paranormal romance story. Unfortunately, the repetitive use of locker-room descriptions of everything sexual killed any idea of romance, and also killed any possibility of enjoyment of this story for me. I have read sensual and romantic, but I didn't find any of that here.Unlike the reviewer who stopped after 50 pages, I persevered to the end, in spite of my distaste for the coarse and vulgar language that accompanied every sexual encounter. Then I did something I thought I would never, ever do - I threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many creatures/characters - Not Romance!","review":"This book had too many characters (witches, vampires, unicorns, tinkerbell, demons, etc) - it was hard to keep track of who was who and who was what and the \\"power\\" that they had.

Being a lefty it took a little getting used to, and if you're using fluorocarbon line it tends to pop off of the spool real easy and can quickly get out of control so have some tape handy. Having gone through it a few times now I'm getting the hang of it. Haven't tried the line puller thingy yet, it takes C sized batteries which I haven't gotten around to getting.

Halim Barakat, a lebbonese christian offers us an amazing fictional look at the Six Days War that not only crystilizes non-Israeli sentiment on the issue, but created a form of Arabic revolutionary literature when first published. Barakat's work is persuasive, fiery prose, intercutting several characters but mainly concerning itself with Ramzy (or \\"symbol\\") his autobiographical main character. This book is one of the more powerful 180 pages I've read, and the introduction by Edward Said is really great.

Absolutely terribly quality, cheap, crummy bongos.I bought these for my son's birthday in September - it wasn't until I actually \\"opened\\" the gift at his birthday party that I realized that I had spent money on something akin to what was sitting in our recylcing bin.I don't know what sticks are being talked about, my order didn't come with any. Another review said these were made from cardboard about as thin as a cereal box - that's about right if not a little generous. The construction is lousy, and easily pulled apart. See those little white supports in the picture? Those pull right out. How safe.True, if you beat it with something harder than your hand you get a better sound, but again, like another review said, it's comparable to a wooden spoon on tupperware. You can get much better toy bongos/drums for this price. Do NOT buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"1. These are made of cardboard about the thickness of a cereal box and do not appear very durable.2. They do not sound like drums. They dont sound like much at all and are less entertaining than tupperware and a wooden spoon.3. There are no drumsticks in my package but I didn't expect any as they are bongos. You can get somewhat of a drum sound using something harder than your hand. I might make some mini sticks and see if my son likes these any better.4. The box states 3 and over and the item description states 1 and older.All in all I think these were a waste of money and would send them back but dont want to waste the gas. They were already shipped all the way from Israel. Surely we can make as bad a product here at home.I recommend buying something else or have fun making your own as they would be at least as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - my son tore them the first day","review":"I was shocked to find that the body of the drums are made of cardboard that is formed into a circle and loosely secured with tabs that fit into slots.

Four of these can be found on the Captain and me cd, however. The Doobies were my favorite band in their hayday. I think a great job was done in selecting the best songs from each album.

This apparently converts him and he returns to New York to take up with Scott, a whining, unappealing stereotype of the nelly queen. Grey also has a brief, undeveloped fling with his boss, Bob, and then is driven back to Elba where for half of the book nothing happens between him and Paolo. There is much potential here but it is not delivered. The dialogue is also stretched, with Italians inexplicably saying \\"ya\\" with the same frequency as the Tennesseans in the story. On top of all of this, the book is frequently just weird. Chapter 25 is totally unexplainable. Some, but not all, chapters begin with cartoonish sketches of floorplans or maps. Drew Banks, the author, may want to say Able Was I but this effort doesn't support it."},{"rating":"1","title":"TacTrap is dangerous for birds","review":"Within less than one hour of installing our new Skeetervac the only thing we had caught was a poor songbird!

The CD producers have succeeded in presenting KING KONG as an \\"old radio show\\" by condensing the dialog,music and sound effects to 50 min. The sound is surprisingly good. The dialog, sound effects and score are remarkably clear. But this does not surpass actully viewing the movie which is readily available to home video.The real highlight of this album is the 25 min suite of original soundtrack music recordings of Max Stiener's landmark score.

The player is ok, but I wouldn't invest this kind of money again for such a short-lived product. I have ordered a battery online and am going to try to change it myself.

I do alot of traveling and always listen to music, and this sound is great for traveling. When you travel from NY to North Carolina, California, Florida, etc., the drive and or flight can become tedious. This device gives you great sound and it feels like the music is being sung right next to you. As far as muffled sound, that is perposterous and if you don't like the sound there is a number or preset equalizers as well as a custom equializer. The device is very easy to navigate and transfer songs to as well. The display is sharp and vivid, and I wish my television had the same picture.

I dont care who you are, thats COMPLETELY unreasonable. FM tuner and voice recorder are nice if you need to use them, can record about 2.5 hours non-stop. About 5300 files can be put in one folder, anything more than that wont get read. I use it every day, but in under a year the battery life has gone from about 13-14 hours to half that; not even a full day at work. :( Why couldnt the other companies learn from the originals, RIO. the UI on the iRiver is poor. If you have alot of artists on the player, you have to scroll through them all... slowly... Also cannot create playlists, they have to be made and imported from your computer. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Owned for almost 3 years, and love it","review":"Yes, the battery has definitely quit on me, but for it to last this long is quite a feat. This is a product of great quality. I've dropped it too many times to count, but the mp3 player still works perfectly. And as a few people have mentioned here, the sound quality is just GORGEOUS.Yes, it's bulky, but this was definitely the best buy when I first purchased it. The only other mp3 player comparable to this was the 40gb iPod, which did not have any color, method of storing pictures, voice recording, radio, and limited audio file types that it could play.

Lyrics are decent but unimaginative. I don't know what's gotten into the Wu since Wu-Tang Forever but someone needs to tell them what the big league coaches tell the rookies; \\"Just keep doing what got you here\\".

Fishscale, like most other Ghostface albums, maintains the same level of quality and consistancy that we come to expect from rap's Ironman. It seems beatmakers adjust their production style to fit his persona and not the other way around. Check out cuts like Shakey Dog, Kilo featuring Raekwon, Beauty Jackson and Whip You With A Strap. You'll hear how Ghost seldom wavers from his cryptic rhymeflow over organic, looped soul samples.Fishscale lost me on two songs that seek to take an uninspired ill fated shot at the pop charts (Back Like That featuring Ne-Yo and Momma featuring Megan Rochell).

The best album of 2006 by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuinely Morbid","review":"This is a remarkable first novel. Especially because for the first time in my life I was able to be genuinely disturbed. There is fear and there is disturbance. Fear can be a pleasant emotion to encounter when reading a horror novel. It's only a story. Disturbance is different because it causes the reader to question what he or she believes. I found Drawn to the Grave disturbing and frightening. And I'm someone who has read a great many horror novels. The theme of decay and a living death are very present. And all that is within a prosaic, normal setting. If you read this book, and I recommend it to you, be prepared to be genuinely disturbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I bought this book based on reviews, and the promise of an unusual premise. Many first novels are wonderful, but this is not one of them. The characters seem one-note personalities, without development (unless you count rot as movement), and thus hard to care about. While the idea of the story is compelling, the plot is manipulated to the point that I stopped looking for logic, reason, or even the power to suspend disbelief. The book is horror-fantasy, to be sure, but if I can't believe a word of it, then it doesn't work for me. The prose seems wooden, and I was finally so frustrated with it that I threw it on the floor. I don't often have a book tantrum, but unfortunately, this novel brought one on. I hate to discourage first time writers, but I hope Ms. Mitchell gets better editing on her next effort, because her work this time out really doesn't seem ready to be presented as a finished, polished book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read (and I am a bibliophile if ever there was one!).The plot is ridiculous, the characters are not well-developed at all, and the entire time I was reading, I kept asking myself... \\"Is this for real?

It is very thorough and investigates ALL of the solutions for dogs with arthritis and other diseases, such as Canine Hip Dysplasia. It talks about maintaining the dog's quality of health by holostic means, rather than the ever popular NSAIDS such as Rimadyl/Estogesic, which have been known to have a lot of side effects. But it also investigates the NSAIDS. The book is not one-sided, but gives open information about all possible routes that can be taken to maintain a dog with arthritis. I have read a lot of books about this topic, but this is one of my top picks. It delivers a lot of information in a clear manner, then lets the reader decide for her/his self what are the best solutions for their individual dog.

It has less functionality than the model that succeeded it (the DVD520), yet is more expensive. The essential difference is that one can not record directly to DVD disc on the 720 (or 725), only to the hard disc, and it is not possible to record to the hard disc from a DVD disc. The latter makes it impossible to make a copies of the DVD discs you have made by going via the hard disc. The 520 model has both functions, but I found it so noisy on playback of R & RW discs (and crash prone) that I returned the one I bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, bad results","review":"I have to agree with what some of the others have written. I just returned my unit after 6 months ($200 at Costco) because I was tired of all the \\"resets\\" and the unit just not recording programs that I verified were set the evening before it should have recorded. I am very, very technical minded and can only imagine how frustrating it must be for those that are less technically inclined. After 6 months, I still couldn't figure out how to program the remote to work with the TV I own (mention of it in manuals points to section that has no instructions on remote setup).I really do miss the ability of being able to record onto the hard disk (not constantly going to DVD), and loved the idea of not having to pay ongoing fees for something like a TIVO (or high $ for a one time charge - for nothing more than a programming guide). I just couldn't take missing my favorite shows anymore so now I search for a reasonably priced replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Reliable","review":"Like most of the others reviewing this unit, my HDRW720 is also just resetting at random times. I was actually at home reading the paper when it happened once. The unit just turns on randomly, all of the lights come on, it resets and then poof, all of your timers and preferences are gone. I have called Philips support to ask about it and while they are helpful, they say that nobody else has reported this and it's probably specific to memory in the unit. It happens at least once every 30 days and you end up starting from scratch each time. Coming home to find the unit back at factory defaults and all of your timers gone makes this unit pretty useless. I have upgraded to the latest firmware (3.2) but the problems continue.

And it happened again, and again, sometimes throwing other misbehavior into the mix (individual channels dropping out of the programming guide, which admittedly may not be its fault; not stopping a recording when it's supposed to). And it can silently not record programs for a week, if you don't notice that something has gone wrong. It's simply not a reliable way to record a program; it works most of the time, but that's not the standard that I want my equipment to reach.And now it can't read DVD's, either.

My 5-year-old loves to sing along with the songs and dance to them, but she turns up her nose at the \\"kid's versions\\" because she has the real thing, which simply cannot be beat.The only reason I gave this CD two stars instead of 1 is that the Raffi version of Octopus' Garden is awful cute. If your kid is a Raffi fan, buy the song by itself in mp3 format. Otherwise, skip the schlock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles CD for Kids","review":"This is one awesome CD. If you love the Beatles (and even if you don't) you're sure to love this one. My daughter gets surprised when she actually hears the original Beatles music on the radio - because she knows the song from \\"her\\" CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go For the \\"Real\\" Beatles Albums.","review":"We received this as a very kind gift when our girl was born last year. We set it aside until she was ready to sway and jump to the rhythm. As it turns out, she likes the actual Beatles albums far better. Let's face it. There are few more exquisitely crafted and danceable pop records than the Beatles early works. Hard to imagine the well-intentioned efforts of Mr Berine Steinberg and Eric Bibb topping the work of Misters Lennon and McCartney. This is a \\"cute\\" CD -- but why buy a pale imitation when the real thing is right on the shelf, and is in fact less expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money-- just get them the originals","review":"What a disappointment! I think the producers just recorded their kids (many of the performers names were the same last name as the producers). Production values were below what I expected. My kids (2-7 year olds) couldn't even sit through one listening of the CD. That's the more telling review. We haven't listened to it since that first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Kids and Parents together","review":"\\"Beatles Songs for Kids\\" is an excellent way to close up the generation gap between parents and their children. The only thing that keeps me from giving this a perfect rating of 5 is the noticable absence of such hits as \\"Why Don't We Do it in the Road\\", \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\", and \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor song selections","review":"I was more than disappointed in this album. Not only were some of the songs drawn out too long and done in such a dreary style (Dear Prudence and Birthday) that it was too tedious and tiresome to listen to. I was also annoyed and felt it extremely inappropriate to include a song with lyrics which said, \\"can I take my friend to bed?\\" Really, what were they thinking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"All You Need is Tolerance","review":"Perhaps if you are used to listening to Barney crooning \\"I love you, you love me..\\", this might be a welcoming change. Unfortunately, for us, my daughter (she is three) has been a fan of the Broadway Kids for some time now, and she won't listen to the ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE... I have tried to persuade her into listening to it again since the first playing to no avail. Maybe this is a CD that requires a few plays to \\"get used to\\", however, I'm not sure it's going to happen in this home. Thanks anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Buyers beware. This is not the Beatles singing. I didn't do my homework and just assumed that 'Beatles Songs for Kids' would be a selection of Beatles songs appealing to children performed by the Beatles. I'm very disappointed!

Hows 'bout hearin' little \\"Timmy\\" singin' Lennons \\"My Mommy's Dead\\"? Hows 'bout Lennons \\"Women is the Ni**er of the World\\"? C'mon all you self involved, self important snot-nose wiping soccer moms! 20 years from now your grandchildren will be listening to \\"Marilyn Manson for Babies\\".

I am a huge Beatles fan, but I bought this CD for my kids. It is not fair to compare it to the original Beatles releases. The singers are all children. It isn't something I would sit and listen to myself but it beats the 233rd version of 'The Farmer in the Dell\\" and \\"On Top of Old Smokey\\".... My kids adore it! My daughter sings \\"Yellow Submarine\\" in the bathtub; she knows all the words! If you have kids, I very highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Annoying and Commercial","review":"I have over a dozen Beatles CD's, and we enjoy their music in our home from time to time. I suggest that if you want to expose your children to the Beatles, then play music actually made by the Beatles.In contrast, this CD is commercial trash. We can't stand it! The version are very lame, and I can't see any benefit to children. It's not children's music. It's an opportunity to cash in on the Beatles.Get something by Raffi if you are looking for really fun, beneficial children's music. And expose your children to the real Beatles when they get a little older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Beatles instead","review":"I thought I had a pretty high threshold for kids music but this is really just bad. I even passed it around my office and solicited comments about which song was, in fact, the worst. I ended up mixing my own Beatles versions of these songs for my son. I'd recommend picking up the Beatles albums and skipping this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids SHLOULD listen to this stuff!","review":"If kids are going to be exposed to music, it shoud be the beatles, and if they can get hooked on the beatles sound with little voices, that is GREAT! we play this CD at the kids museum i work at, and i decided i HAD to buy it just for \\"Dear Prudence\\" which is one of the greatest tunes. i'm 22, and i listen to the Beatles, but this CD is very refreshing to listen to as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not the real thing?","review":"The Beatles have proven to be trans generation artists - I prefer playing my real Beatles albums to my 4 and 2 year old. They dance, sing, tap, and hum to it as much as I do - and I can be sure that one day they won't say, \\"Hey - who are these guys covering those great kids tunes from my childhood?\\" when they do hear the Beatles.I can understand wanting to have all \\"kid friendly\\" tunes together, but that is what your cd-burner is for! Sure I used to skip over Rocky Raccoon, but then I realised that my daughter was more focused on the possibility of a Raccoon named Rocky than the fact that some jealous guy was just [destroyed] in a bar!So I say go full strength with this stuff and get a couple of the original Beatles albums instead of this diluted version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchered the Beatles","review":"This CD is just plain disturbing. They've ruined the original songs. I would never let my kids listen to this horrifying interpretation of the Beatles hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for a 2 yr. old...","review":"My 4 and 6 yr. old daughters love the REAL Beatles. I'm a major Beatles fan so my daughters have been lucky enugh to hear their music. What I do like is hearing kids sing Beatles songs. What I don't like is hearing kids PERFORM Beatles songs under adult direction. Unless you have really young children that have no comprehension as to who the real Beatles are -buy the original albums instead. Just make sure that you play the tamer songs - adult supervision is always the key. I felt that I couldn't honestly rate this album - at 31 yrs. old I found it be poorly put together and in bad taste- but my 1 yr.old niece tries to sing along and laughs at the children's voices- so in that respect, it can't be too bad for babies. True, it may satisfy the under 4 crowd, but older children should have the chance to hear the real thing - they'll appreciate it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't torture your kids with this.....","review":"I love The Beatles, grew up with them and want the same for my children. Luckily I sampled this online before buying it...glad did not waste the money. Just let your kids listen the their original music. And if you want something a little different, try the I am Sam soundtrack-my daughter loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this if you're picky about being on key","review":"It is always cute to hear kids sing, especially favorites like these, and you expect them to be a little out of tune. But some of this songs are sung so badly off key I can't even stand to listen! So make sure that doesn't bother you before you buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"KIDS SING THE BEATLES SONGS IS SPLENDID!","review":"All You Need Is Love (Beatles Songs For Kids)/Music For Little People is one of the hippest collectionsBeatles songs available on both CD &Cassette.; Why is this so enjoyable? The vocals are performed by mostlylil'people, children! They are a couple of big people (adults) vocals, but it is the kids that steal the show! Musicallythe songs stick very close to the original Beatles versions, with a lil' added touch here & there.Children's artistRaffi handles the lead vocal on \\"Octopus Garden\\" & contempary blues artist Eric Bibb turns in a snazzy rootsy\\"Here Comes TheSun\\". This release is a must for any parent who grew up with the Beatles and has lil' onesroaming about. Hey, all you Beatles collectors you should have this CD too! A+!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandpa Alert!","review":"For all of you who grew up in the 60s & 70s listening to the Beatles--this is the CD to get for your grandchildren!

As another reviewer noted, it ain't great, but I, too will take this over that darn \\"Farmer in the Dell\\" and that equally tired \\"On Top of Old Smokey\\" and others of that ilk.It's best to introduce young listeners to the REAL Beatles. The Beatles are the world's greatest band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatles","review":"Not a great CD. I had high hopes for this one but their choice of songs was not great. Really boring for a 2 year old to listen to"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so pleasant","review":"Not very pleasant to listen to, kind of grates on your ears. Especially when it's the kids singing! Maybe would be more fun with older children."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just a ploy to make money.","review":"Kids all seem to go through a \\"Beatles phase.\\" Every crop of children to come along since the '60s seems to learn Beatles songs in grade school. A lot of Beatles songs have BECOME kids' songs, as Ringo Starr makes clear when he says of \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" \\"even embryos know this song.\\" In other words, if you want your kids to learn Beatles songs, why not let the Beatles sing them? Rather than listen to these cutesy-fied, limp, corny versions. This is just another ploy to make money off the Beatles with a \\"tribute.\\" Why buy an imitation, when you can have the real thing? Nobody did these songs better than. . .The Beatles. This album should be titled after the Rutles satire album, \\"All You Need is Cash.\\" Don't fall for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it's better than a Yoko Ono song. . . .","review":"I picked this up from the Library, not looking very closely at the cover. Much to my shock and horror, not John's magical voice but some cheap badly out of tune knock off studio singer came wafting out of my speakers. As the waves of pain washed over me, I was astounded how horrific the first song was. Wiser people would have just hit stop and returned the disc, but I wanted to see how bad things got, or if that was a one-off. Nope, every track I sampled was Deep Hurting like you wouldnt believe.Why would someone do this to such amazing, timeless songs? Seriously, it's not like the Red or Blue albums are that hard to get your hands on. Forsake this crap and get the real thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, children sing off key, slow, not catchey, boring,","review":"Don't waste your money. My six year old hates it. The background music doesn't sound like Beatles music. You can hardly recognize the songs. The singing is by children who do their best but it's off key. The songs are slow and interminable. The tunes aren't catchy. The title was misleading to me because I thought it was a compendium of Beatles songs sung by the Beatles. Only the words remind me of Beatles songs, nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"BABIES DESTROY THE BEATLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Ok, let me just ask what were they thinking when they made this CD? If you want to play the beatles for your child, then play the Beatles, not these high-pitched little rodents. What would Paul McCartney say if he found out that Blackbird was being covered by some little kid who didn't even know what that song really meant. Go buy Rubber Soul or something. If you dont want your kid to hear a certin song, there's this great little button that lets you skip from song to song. Maybe you should try it some time. If someday when your son/ daughter is older and you are driving them somewhere and Here Comes The Sun comes on the radio, Do you really want them to say \\"Hey, who are these guys with the funny accents singing, they're not the Beatles?'' *breathes* Ok, I'm through. Peace and Love"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids would enjoy the real fab four better","review":"overall, I was disappointed in this CD. I had read a positive review. The original songs are short enough and clear enough that versions especially for kids are not necessary. However, some of the songs sung by kids (e.g. Dear Prudence) are poignant and nicely done. Raffi does a fine version of Octopus' Garden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just buy a real Beatles cd","review":"I bought this cd for my two-year-old daugther since her dad and I are both big Beatles fans in hopes of exposing her to them at an early age. Don't bother! Just play a real Beatles cd for your kids. It wouldn't be so bad if the kids just sang, but they're trying to sound like professional singers instead of just kids having a good time. Excruciating to listen to. The only song I can sit through is Raffi's rendition of Octopus' Garden. My daughter doesn't like to listen to it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a very mixed bag. It has some awful singing, some OK singing and two completely unheard of and dull 'special guest stars'. Plus the music is badly played, losing a lot of the life of the original. I didn't like it, my wife said it's OK and our kid isn't old enough to state an opinion.I'd look elsewhere for kid friendly music. We've found some great kids music in the classical stuff Amazon sells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this CD like the plague","review":"Almost anybody could have gotten karaoke tracks of various beatles songs,recorded their kids singing to them, and put it out as a CD -- and it would be as good or better than this thing.There is nothing about the arrangements or renditions that make these Beatles songs any more fun for kids than hearing the originals -- unless they enjoy hearing little tykes sing off key.It's truly amazing what people try to get away with these days.One final thought: I wouldn't be surprised if many of the positive reviews were written by friends of the producers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles for kids","review":"We listen to this cd at bedtime.

Some of the incorrect details are common knowledge, regarding famous cases and are verifiable in countless ways, such as court transcripts, other writings, and valid research.Very sloppy, don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate","review":"This book is not accurate in a lot of the 'facts' it states. There are many errors in spelling as well. If you read the book and don't already know about these cases you have no idea if what you are reading is fact or fiction. One example of spelling error: tyre is not how you spell tire (on a car). One 'fact' that every American knows is not true: O.J. Simpson did not play football for the L.A. Lakers! This book is loaded with errors and leaves out very important information, making you want to scratch your head to figure out what happened to a person in a story. You should check your facts before writing a book and hire someone to edit it who knows how to spell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some rare cuts on this CD unavailable elsewhere","review":"EEE-O Eleven will not be found on any other album. There are some excellent selections on this album from Sammy's best years as a rat-packer. This album does not contain any of the schlock he recorded in the 70's...it's all 60's stuff from when he was at the top of his game and before he got to be something of a parody. This is all before his \\"love child\\" phase. Here he's a true swinger. Under Frank's critical eye, Sam seemed to stick to material that would meet his approval. This was probably a good thing considering some of his recordings after Frank began ignoring him when he got into the drug scene. Several tunes like \\"Bang Bang\\" \\"Eee-O-Eleven\\" \\"Salt-n-pepper\\" are directly from Rat Pack movies. I haven't been able to find them anywhere else. If you dig Sammy already, buy this CD. If you don't, buy this CD and be converted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke.","review":"Less than 18 months old. Very lightly used. And it broke. \\"Mechanical failure\\" according to the tech guy.

As a busy mom who is always carting her kids from Tae Kwon Do to other after school activites, it's hard to be home in time to prepare a meal (not to mention the fact that I'm usually too tired come that witching hour). I love how I can prepare the meals around lunchtime when I'm at my peak and can then have the aroma fill the house in just a few hours. The ingredients are simple and economical and everyone in my house will eat them!! That's a miracle in itself!! Buy this book...you will be happy you did.

There are many other excellent crockpot cookbooks out there, that use real food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy, but not that impressive","review":"I am glad I purchased this used for a cheap price. The recipes are surprisingly bland, especially the ones with Campbells condensed soups. If you are looking for easy, this is the one for you as long as you are willing to compromise on taste. A couple of the desserts were just a disaster (Pumpkin Custard, and a fruit cobbler)- texture and taste were awful! This book came recommended by a friend and now I am wondering if her taste buds are damaged. I would never recommend to a friend that I liked, I would be embarrassed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Idea","review":"I really enjoyed this modern take on the slasher genre. Incorporating the story of Cupid was a really fresh idea and it's always fun to see Ashley Laurence in a horror film. Don't get me wrong, I like Zach Galligan as well, however Ashley Laurence is such a powerhouse that Galligan's wooden like, stilted acting becomes even more obvious and off-putting here. I still really liked the film, though, and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for something a little different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basement style Jazz","review":"Love this album it just brings back that old basement style jazz to vibe wit, when I was growing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention Singer's!","review":"I highly recommend this book for any light lyric soprano or any singer for that matter. There is a whole series dedicated to each SPECIFIC voice type, but it might take some digging to find your voice type.

As a pilot myself, I have taken many airborne photos during trips around the U.S., but Ron Lowery's perspective from Cloud Chaser, and his use of the perfect photo conditions, have really exceeded anything I have ever taken.

A colored string is loaded into the punch needle and then pushed into a hole on the board. The inset foam holds the string in place as the needle is moved to a new hole. As the string is connected from hole to hole, a picture is created. Holding the 'needle' is a great way to reinforce the correct way to hold a pencil, while doing a fun and engaging activity. While the basic kit can be used by children as young as three, the pattern cards provide extra visual perceptual challenge for older children. The String-Along kit is fun, quiet, and portable, making it a great travel activity. The board stands up well to being used multiple times. Designs are removed quickly and easily just by pulling one end of the string."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for preschoolers, no patterns necessary....","review":"I found this product at Artsy in Lewiston, NY a few years ago.

Jumping from one story to the next may work in print, especially with a month between issues, but it makes for horrible plot structure for a movie.

I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every one of them including the recent Batman Under the Red Hood and Superman Batman Apocalypse but this movie is just plain terrible. It feels horribly rushed and disjointed and the plot is incoherent. The plot lines with Samson and Atlus, the krypton astronauts and that talking red star were ridiculous. These story arcs amounted to nothing and came out of thin air. They tried to cram all of the story arcs from the All star comic series run but it leaves it feeling contrived. There is not much more to say except skip this mess. Its kind of a shame since the works of Bruce Timm and the DCAU line are usually exemplary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are the 2 DVD SE even worth it???","review":"I would recomend not picking up this Special Edition since Technically it is only one Featurette and a pairof Eps of Superman.Not even the commentary track is on this just the one little handout of an extra... two disks for this?just get the single version or upgrade to BR for the extras... these guys are wasting our money withthese DVD S.E. just cram one disk with what you can its a 75 min movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time Super fan","review":"I have been a fan of Superman most my life and this movie was pretty awesome compared to past Superman animated films.My husband had been reading All Star Superman comic and really wanted to watch this movie so we bought it.

The story made no sense. It is a mangle of unrelated plotlines that was very disappointing. Characters would show up, do something silly, and disappear all in the course of a few minutes. Atlas? Kryptonian scientists? Star eaters? It was a confusing mess (coming from a person who typically enjoys DC animations)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy & Patchy - Avoid Like Kryptonite!","review":"My first full length Superman animated feature has been incredibly unfulfilling. Have read bits of All Star Superman but it's never made an impression. The problem: trying to squeeze X # of characters and scenarios doesn't make this fly. It just creates an unfocussed, disjointed story. Luthor is about the only constant here (and I enjoyed him). But despite some credible Superman moments...the rest of this is disappointing. Spoiler: Superman dies at the end, but it's all pretty anti-climactic.Makes me yearn for the days of Christopher Reeves' Superman days, when storytelling was so much tighter and less contrived. Think I'll stick with Marvel animation and films!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Super of a story.","review":"With out spoiling the story there are several short stories to make up this film but at least 3 of the stories have no affect on the main plot.

Lex Luthor was very well done, and Perry White actually wasn't bad, but everyone else sounded like they had the \\"let me read this script in a microphone and get a check\\" attitude. Very little chemistry.The scenes with Clark Kent weren't too bad and probably the saving grace of the movie. They kind of eluded to the reason that Clark acts so clumsy is to allow for distractions while he covertly uses his powers.I'm not a fan of the \\"old school\\" Superman, which is portrayed in this film. He's the \\"all powerful, unlimited strength, unlimited intellect\\" version. It makes him a fairly boring action character, so you have to rely on emotional challenges. Since the acting is played with very little emotion, you end up with a dull mess of a story.Disappointed. Glad I only rented it from Amazon :("},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"i really never liked quitelys art, and the animation is pretty close to his style. the movie seems to be a mash up of a bunch of stories, especially the way the \\"mysterious couple\\" comes in and out of the movie so quick. didnt care for the voice work, lois has more than a few moments where you just think 'yuck'. a few good action scenes, but nothing really exciting. and the ending is pretty dumb.overall i dont think this can compare to the excellent work dc animation has put out lately. glad i watched my friends copy before i bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak entry in the DC film library","review":"I never read the comic books this is based on but as entertainment thisis pretty weak.It's incoherent,disjointed and in many sections just plain silly.It has some mature scenes and others that look like they were written for 8 yr olds.Much of it didn't make any sense.I suspected it could end up like this because Superman isn't the deepest character out there.Can't recommend this at all.This is 2 duds in a row for DC as the Shazam/Superman one was lame as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG This movie Suck","review":"All i can really say Any real Supre Man fan will hate this moviehere we have the man of steel there so much you can do with himto make a good movie BUT what do they alway do turn it in to love storyor Do what this movie did Fine a dumb way to kill him off... This is almost asBad when They kill the Hulk By having Him fell from a Helicopter"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful Writing","review":"Just awful. Grant Morrison was, is and always will be a juvenile hack. So glad he's DC exclusive and not subjecting any character in the Marvel Universe to his infantile writing. The only time in the last quarter century that I stopped reading X-Men was when he and Chuck Austen were butchering the characters. I normally buy all DC animated projects but I'll be passing on this terd."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heart of Superman","review":"This movie hit the very core of Superman's character. It has many strong moments for all the characters and for Lex Luthor in particular. My true score for this movie would be 4.5, given an oddly stiff voice performance for Lois and one awkward storyline transition. Other than that, the movie was perfect and definitely the best animated Superman movie to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now that's a Superman Story!","review":"This is a story true to the essence of Superman. Although the plot device is his powers, this story shows off the basic decency that defines the Man of Steel. I didn't want it to end, was hoping for more. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the voice acting wasn't great. Anyone who enjoys Superman for what he is, a symbol of hope and decency, will love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superman: The greatest of all time!","review":"I am a huge fan of the Superman comicbook titles as well as the Superman All Star limited series. This movie will remind everyone why Superman is the greatest superhero of all time. Superman may have \\"old fashion\\" values (yes, I know that im talking about him as though he actually exist :) but I think these are values that we need in today's world. Even though its 2011, Truth, Justice and the American way still mean something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good story.","review":"Saw this and loved it. It's a bit of a weird and quirky superman story but it feels genuine enough. The art is more realistic than normal but what ties this movie together is the development of scenes between Lex and Clark Kent. the story seems to flow quickly from one event to the next and not everything is explained. I think the story speaks for itself it's much better than the apocalypse story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"I knew very little about this & the previews didn't look that interesting to me so I just \\"rented\\" it off comcast same day as DVD.Very different than anything I've seen before & very interesting story. I only take off one star because I don't know how much \\"replay\\" value it has & only like to give 5 stars if it's great 1st time & time again as well.I say it's a must see. Not necessarily a must own but it wouldn't hurt to buy it & have it on hand.Edit: One thing I liked about this movie is that you get to see more of the intellectual side of Superman. He doesn't solve everything by just being stronger here. You get to see his lifestyle as Superman (not just Kent) as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid?","review":"Big fan of DC not much of Superman but still a fan.....except this movie! He is being portrayed as a complete weakling that is so clueless about everything, maybe this script would have worked in the 50's but not now. Stories jump from one spectrum to the other without reason, voices are not up to par with the characters and the score is unemotional and weak the artwork is great however too bad it was wasted on this story.Sorry guys I am dissapointed on this film, Superman was better portrayed on Public Enemies and other movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as previous movies.","review":"Don't get me wrong. Definately interesting. It has it's good points but at times it gets really random. I suggest renting as opposed to purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst plot ever","review":"This must be the worst Superman movie from DC. The plot is just plain dumb.The movie is slow and pretty much action-less. The story is lame and introduces new characters without developing them. It also introduces old characters that unless you read the comics over the years, they will make no sense at all.The plot is so bad, I would not even recommend wasting the time watching it on free regular OTA TV.Wish I could get my money back ....BTW: I bet that most if not all the people who gave a 5 star to this crap have not seen the movie yet. There is no way anybody would thing that this movie was in any way good."},{"rating":"1","title":"All*Star Spazman","review":"This movie suffered from waaay too many plot devices to push the story forward. The best part is Luthor on the Supes serum and all the different ways he would use things that Superman has, like super-strength and hyper intelligence. Unfortunately, it doesn't last very long and it is only in the very end of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly boring","review":"This was one of DC's worst animated movies to date. It's good if you need help getting to sleep though. The storyline is incredibly stupid and the voice acting is monotone. I can't even tell you what the movie is about. So many stupid things going on at once. I didn't care about any of it. I hated this movie.One of DC's best animated movies was Wonder Woman. They wont give that a sequel and yet Superman gets one dull movie after another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatcheable","review":"I am just amazed that this thing has gotten any positive reviews.It features pitiful voice casting, awful animation (bring back Bruce Timm), an absolutely silly \\"plot\\" and scenes/characters that are clearly shoehorned into the movie to fill up space.I have seen every single animated release pretty much ever (including all 50 odd Disney theatricals) and this is so far down near the bottom it's not even funny. There literally isn't anything to recommend it.Unless, of course, you are a fan of monotone voice acting, actionless superhero movies and a plot that features the worst ending in animation history."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it hurt.","review":"That was dreadful. There is a kind of plot-like notion that meanders around just being silly. Some of the dialog was so bad it sounded like the meanderings of some homeless guy. Seriously some of the lines seemed like the text was chosen by a random word generator. There was very little faithfulness to the established Superman saga. Someone from DC Comics should be severely beaten for allowing this putrid abomination to exist. This movie made me want to kick a puppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay, with a few minor disappointments.","review":"I didn't like Superman's costume in this movie. I mean, what's with the short cape?? And Clark was just wayyyy too clumsy in my opinion. And yes his voice as Superman just wasn't that strong; it didn't have that superhero tone to it. Oh and Lois! She seemed cold, like a woman scorned. And I really didn't feel any chemistry between her and Superman. I know this is an animated film, but I'm sorry, it just felt fake to me. I loved the Lex Luthor in this one though. The voice, his plot to kill Superman... all great!After being a fan of the Batman series and the Justice League series, I wish it could've been better coz I expected alot from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story & not much cohesion based on the comic","review":"I've read the All Star Superman comic series and loved all of the DC Movies featuring Superman/Batman.However, this particular movie is a real Disappointment.It had no real cohesion to the comic's story and the unresolved ending was terrible.I agree with other reviewers who think that DC should focus on other characters especiallyif they are going to put out drivel like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Like It","review":"They frankenstein a bunch of un-related stories into one movie. The stories don't make any sense to me either. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait until this goes on clearance","review":"I usually buy these DC releases w/ no reservations, but this one didn't hold my interest.The casting was off to me, the storyline was all over the road and if you make it through you'll feel cheated.This was a very long 76 minutes. I really can't recommend this.On the plus side, this is the first straight to DVD release that wasn't PG13 and didn't have any 4 letter words in it, except S.O.B., so my smaller guys will be able to watch this a little more often than some of the others.Again, I really wanted to like this. I just can't.I'll be back for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible from the word go","review":"I'm a fan of animated superhero cartoons. This was one of the most dissapointing offerings I have had the misfortune of watching. The only passable aspect of this DVD is the animation, everything else (voice acting, plot, use of established characters) will have you wondering how this \\"animated movie\\" was ever made. There are a lot better animated superheo titles out there. Skip this one and try X-Men the series, Wolverine and the X-Men series, Spiderman the Animated Series, Justice League, the Batman 90's cartoon series or the Spectacular Spiderman series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is kryptonite to the Superman franchise","review":"There's been a real uptick in the number of comic book superhero movies in recent years, and for the most part they've been pretty good to excellent. This movie puts an end to that trend.This is a rambling, non-sensical mishmash of ideas thrown together, at times seeming like they made it up as they went along. It's almost as though they took parts from three or four different scripts and just stapled the pages together in no particular order. That might have worked, if only the original scripts had been good. They're awful.It's a good time to be a fan of comic book heroes. The first two X-men movies, the first two Spiderman movies, the reboot of the Batman franchise - Hollywood is finally getting it right (notwithstanding Superman Returns and the two Hulk movies). Even the animated movies, such as Batman:Under the Red Hood, are just good films. Save your money on this travesty, and spend it on one of the others listed here."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL- STAR SUPER CRAP","review":"Ive been a fan of superman since I was a child and admire the numerous cartoons that came out throughout the years but this \\"ALL STAR SUPERMAN \\" story line is garbage and the plot was amazingly stupid and the writer should be shot... don't waste your time watching this garbage SUPERMAN fans, this movie doesn't do any justice for SUPERMAN!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb","review":"Really dumb. Just because the story's source is a comic, does not give it an excuse for so so so many dumb, ridiculous moments. That's two terrible animated DC movies in a row. Cross your fingers for Emerald Knight."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Much for one movie","review":"This movie had way to much going on. It lacked the focus of the comics, graphic novel or other movies. This is by far one of the worst DC movies made. It may be that they tried to sum up a story in 74mins. But this movie is at best a rental via Amazon. Animation was great I didn't like all the character designs but Lex in Green Superman in red blue and yellow was fine. The writer Dwayne McDuffie and director Sam Liu did what no villain could ever have done killed Superman."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this movie","review":"supers costum was dumb and the art work stinked and the ending of this movie sucked i can't beleave that dc would let some one do this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Disconnected Storyline","review":"I am an avid fan of the DC animated series, but the plot of \\"all star\\" totally lacked any kind of cohesion. New characters just randomly appear, too much crammed into one DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I thought this pretty good for a cartoon movie. I didn't read the comic but mostly liked the movie. I have seen enough of Lex Luther in cartoons and movies for a life time, though. Sure, he's the main Superman villain, but not very interesting and never portrayed in an interesting way, though this is one of his better incarnations. Lois with brown hair rather than blue black is disappointing but overall she's good in this movie. There are some very nice sequences and touches, and some nice action sequences. So I am giving it four out of five stars. Definitely worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"A better-than-average comic adaptation","review":"*Includes Minor Spoilers*All-Star Superman on Blu-Ray looks fantastic! The score is pretty good, the voice acting is really good, and the animation is just plain incredible. The problem with the film is that it does not live up to its premise. Early in the film it is stated that prior to his death, Superman will perform his most incredible feats yet. While the feats were remarkable, he has done much better in his decades of existence. However, the biggest problem with the movie is its pacing. It is simply a roller coaster that should have been re-designed before coming into service. The fun parts do not last long enough and the needless parts/exposition last far too long. There are simply too many battles without any proper build-up for us to even care.Despite these complaints, the pros vastly outweigh the cons. While this may not be Superman's greatest adventure, it is definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed","review":"Every ten minutes the narrative takes an unexpected turn -- not in a good way. Deus ex machina would be one thing, but here the viewer encounters a whole pantheon of contrivances.

The author's principle theme is an explanation of the causes for the near extinction of the largest North American mammal in the largest North American biome. Isenberg provides an extensive description of how the reintroduction of horses to North America uprooted many Native American peoples of the plains and exaggerated their dependence on the bison. This increased dependence on bison was further fueled by the fur/hide trade of the early 19th century. The near death note to the American bison was provided by the east's increased need of leather component's for it's expanding industry and desire by the Euro-American populace to displace bison dependent Native Americans. If you are interested in complex cause/effect senarios in American history this book is a must. The book has been extensively researched and provides an awesome reference list."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Picture","review":"So often, we tend to think of the near-extinction of the Bison as having been solely caused by overhunting by the fur trade. This book shows the intensely interwoven cause and effect relationships that led to massive changes, not only for the Bison, but for the Native Americans as well. The scope of this book is so much larger than just the destruction of the Bison - it addresses the full range of effects that Westward Expansion had on the plains. To gain a better understanding of the ecological dynamics at play between the Bison, the indigenous tribes, the settlers and the environment - this book is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!!","review":"This condensed milk is absolutely wonderful.

The DVD video quality is very poor, even when playing on a BlueRay player that does a great job of upconverting the image. The games look like those 1970 football games they show on the NFL Network. Very poor video quality when they show the long distance shots, like poor VHS quality. Close up images are not too bad. I am keeping it because they have all four wins showing the compelete game (with no commercials and no intermissions) and I want it until the package comes out on BlueRay HD format. Guess having teh wins in poor quality is better than not having them at all but if I would have know they were this poor of quality before I bought it, I would definitely NOT have bought it. Save your money until the HD version comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"No extra anything","review":"Don't get me wrong...all the games are there. It was obvious to me, however, they put next to no effort into the production of this set. There is no extra footage included, no pre-game analysis or interviews, the editing seems to favor saving time to the extreme...it cuts out most replays and shows the face off immediately following a play stopping whistle. I understand this may be what some people are looking for so they don't have to skip forward past the stuff they don't want to see, however I would like to at least have the option to see some of the stanley cup hype that brings me back to this awesome season.

Being so cheap, I thought the case would be junk but the disc is easy to pop out and snaps back just as easily. About the film itself...It covers every playoff game that involved the Hawks leading up to the Stanley cup and then (obviously)all six games against Philly to take the cup. The reason I gave this a four out of five is because although the film does a good job of capturing the hardships and triumphs of the playoffs, it isn't very in depth. Just kinda skims the surface of all that went on during the playoffs, but i would have liked for more background on the organization and interviews with more than just a couple players.

Her band is tight as usual and the songs are great, you couldn't ask for a more perfect rockabilly cd, by a modern female singer, who is a throwback to the 1950's pinups, and singers... the only thing that could have made this cd more perfect is if Kim were laying on the hood of a 54 Chevy, on the cover of the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get much better then this it's FREAKIN' AWESOME","review":"Dang freakin' straight this cd is FREAKIN' AWESOME.

Granted it's not extreme, but occurs often enough to have made the series of three distasteful to me. Add in the main character's complicated 'divorced but still in lust with each other relationship' with her ex-husband, and her concurrent fascination with another character who 'happens' to be married... and I'm sure you get the picture.

But not so with this book. It is a wonderfully crafted story, in which the author follows a book of psalms through several lives that it touches, weaving their stories together and showing how lives may touch each other without even knowing, and how God's word speaks to the needs in all kinds of different situations. Mrs. Yates is also realistic in that not every life is changed as a result of the book coming into the person's hands. Some of the stories are heartbreaking, some are humorous, but the book as a whole is very uplifting and hopeful and reminds us that God is always working in our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just alright!","review":"I thought it was alright.

I couldn't wait to read each chapter, and I look forward to the other books in the series. This is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Interesting...","review":"You would think that with a title like Murder on a Girls' Night Out: A Southern Sisters Mystery, this story would be more interesting. Unfortunately, it's not. It starts fairly quickly with the actual murder occurring within the first few pages of the book. The problem is that it feels like finding the murderer was an afterthought. A slew of inconsequential characters were introduced into the story that didn't seem to have any bearing on the story, except to distract you from the real murderer. This could have been an effective technique if the climax and resolution of the book weren't literally shoved into the last few chapters. Without giving away the book, I thought the lead up to finding the killer was really weak. The dialogue was trite and phony and my entire book club gave it a big thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder on a Girls' Night Out","review":"If I had to describe this book with one word it would be UNLIKELY! I found the two to be unlikely sisters, both in appearance and personality - though I do understand that even twins can be markedly different and that it's hard, if not impossible to escape our childhood roles and be able to interact as mature adults - but the fact that the inherently impulsive Mary Alice dominates the much smarter Patricia Anne was hard to swallow. I wanted to scream at Mouse to GET A BACKBONE! The plot itself was also unlikely - the complex interrelationships were so far removed from reality that I had to wonder about Anne George's disfunctional background.....Surely life in Birmingham, Alabama is not this far-fetched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"I was looking for a new \\"series\\" of books to be interested in when I ordered 2 of the Southern Sisters mysteries. I should have known better than to order just on reviews; I should have checked at the library first. I only read this one, and have donated both to the local seniors group. I am an insatiable reader, and devour a wide variety. My favorite authors of fiction are James Clavell, Tim Clancy, Nora Roberts, Laurell K Hamilton, Anne Rice, James Patterson and Janet Evanovich.

We're not talking about characters with only names, we're talking about \\"girlfriends\\" who happen to be sisters (and opposites at that!). It's just like real life in the South. We're not dealing with only people here, we're dealing with Southern culture, weather, and environment. Finally, a book that makes you wait until the end before you know for sure \\"who done it\\" and, for me, that was a treat.I'm going to order the rest of this great series and I think that you may just do the same!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent story ruined by an awful ending","review":"Patricia Ann and Mary Alice are sisters and complete opposites. But when the man who sold Mary Alice a C&W; bar is killed there the next night, the sisters find themselves trying to prove the murderer is not one of Patricia Ann's former students.Surprisingly interesting, since Mary Alice is an overbearing know-it-all and Patricia Ann lets her dictate large chunks of her life. But it kept me reading up to the awful deus-ex-machina ending and explanation that mostly relied on information that had NOT been given to the reader, which bitterly disappointed me and is the reason for the low rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love those southern gals......","review":"Patricia Anne and Mary Alice are delightful ole southern gals. I'm just so sorry there won't be any more novels by Anne George now that she is gone. There was so much more to find out about the family: did they buy a condo in Destin (I'd sure like one!), Haley's baby, Mary Alice's marriage, Fred's company's merger, did Vulcan ever get his buns covered.

Her humor comes in many levels, from subtle to slapstick, but she never fails to entertain. This is a must read for all Anne George fans, and if you haven't been introduced to her writing, get ready for some fun. But don't make the mistake I made. This was my first Anne George novel that I read, I thought it was going to be a serious murder mystery, where the idea was to figure out \\"Whodunnit\\". Okay, I admit that's part of it, but the real joy comes from seeing the world through the eyes of such a creative mind; the humor that springs forth from the ordinary that most of us miss, but Anne catches it and shows it to us and makes us laugh.My advise is to read all her books. It is time well spent. Sadly, the world has lost a great fiction writer, but her wonderful work lives on."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a good book for options.","review":"People who want to learn about trading options using a computer will do well not to buy this book.In part one this book glosses over options essentials with some of the strategies like straddles explained in just 4 lines.Part Two is filled with one on one interviews with traders which is ok if you are the type who invests after watching interviews on CNBC.Parts Three and four gives a very brief summary of some of the technical analysis methods out there and mentions a few trading psychology theories.It tells you about trendlines but leaves you befuddled about how to apply it.I ended up not learning anything about options but a little about history.I suggest Trade options online by George Fontanills that is an excellent book that is well written and actually gives you websites which is a foreign concept in Mr Abell's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very shallow","review":"First part explains option trading platforms and order routing, and is very confusing.

You can imagine my surprised when the quality was terrible!! The blue part seperated from the white with no effort at all making it easy for my 13 month old to send everything flying.

While the artists included represent some of the very best examples of avante-garde practices spanning three decades, including several to whom I had would not have otherwise been exposed, the write ups read like publicity for their shows rather than critical analysis of the work. Most disappointing was the structure. Each artist is pigeon-holed into the demographic category they fall within, e.g. Felix Gonzales-Torres: A Latin, Homosexual Man. While I respect the effort to include a diverse range of artists, the demographics appear to be placed above the significance of their body of work. A difficult issue to address, and this book does so poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXCELLENT EDUCATIONAL TOOL","review":"\\"Art on the Edge and Over is an excellent educational tool for people who need an introduction to the latest trends and developments in the visual arts.\\"Robert C.

If you don't believe me, count the number of times she uses Mesa-Bains and then the number of times she uses Mesa-Baines.Aside from that, the writing style is simply awful, although I guess with this kind of subject matter, it's hard to do much better. This book, along with my Studio Art class, has helped me to develop a strong disliking for most of the contemporary art that is gaining attention. It is thoroughly disturbing and pointless.

These are for the most part sweet R&B songs with some hip-hop elements thrown in for good measure from various corners of the globe. The song by Tasha, \\"Beyond the Ocean\\" is an especially sweet love song done in Korean with some English thrown in. \\"Mon Peau\\" is also quite lovely too, and the bonus is that this collection features English transaltions in the liner notes for th monolingual. Some of the foreign tunes that are heavily hip hop oriented may not be to everyone's taste,but as a whole, this is a worhtwhile purchase for the adventurous."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Groove","review":"I was at the Field Museum gift shop in Chicago and after grooving to the music they were playing for the 20 minutes I was in the store I stopped and asked what it was.

Bottom line - they are junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space bar becomes a problem","review":"I've had this keyboard for at least 6 months,maybe more. Everything was working fine for about 3 months, when something happened with the space bar - it started making a clicking noise and it doesn't space unless you put your thumb to the left of center. One day when I was at Fry's I popped a space bar off the similar model there to see what it was like underneath. There is a metal bar that spans the space bar underneath and it fits fits inside some plastic that holds it. I came home and snapped my space bar off and I thought I fixed it. But, it didn't stay that way. Really a pain to type! Now, my mouse is also having difficulties. It tracks okay, but it doesn't always 'click'. I definitely wouldn't buy this again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good keyboard and mouse","review":"I have had several previous versions of this keyboard and mouse and like them very much. The reviews on this one said there are performance problems with it, but I decided to try it anyway as I had seen similar reports on the previous versions. Well, this time I was wrong and there are serious problems with delays on both the keyboard and mouse. I would return the set, but the set is at a vacation house and I will not be going back there in time to return the keyboard. I know it is the hardware as the version of software drivers is the same for this one as for the previous versions. I am betting that when I take an older keyboard (3000) and swap it out with the new one the performance problems will go away, but I won't know for sure until I am able to do so. I join the crowd that says don't buy this keyboard and mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ergonomics, poor build quality","review":"Typically a keyboard lasts me for years. My first desktop 6000 had to be retired after one year because several keys of the left side of the keyboard stopped working reliably. I never spilled anything on it, tried moving channels in case it was interference, etc., but the conclusion was simply: bad hardware. I love the ergonomics of the product, the touch of the keys, and the battery life beats my brother's Logitech by a mile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look For A Different One","review":"I have been using the combination keyboard and mouse for about a year now. The keyboard works fine, but the mouse has recently started losing it's \\"left click\\" ability, and I get random errors warning of a low-battery, even after replacing both batteries. I'm moving on to another brand/model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"I had this keyboard for about 8 months and then the space bar started to become less responsive. The only way it would work was to hit it right in the middle of the key. Shortly later the metal clip became lose and come off. I tried to reinstall it however it is really difficult and when reinstalled does not work close to the same. It is basicly unuseable now. this keyboard is WAY over priced for such a lousy quality. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Design But Very Poor Reliability","review":"When it works, you'll love this keyboard. It just doesn't work very often. sometimes the response from the keyboard is so bad, only every 4th or 5th keystroke will register. The mouse will just stop working or only pick up one click out of 10. It's a constant cycle of changing the channel to refresh the connection or rebooting the PC to re-load the software. I've tried moving the receiver all over the place but with no effect. In the exact same office setup and configuration I tried a Creative Labs and a Logitech wireless keyboard / mouse and had NO problems. The bottom line is that Microsoft has put out yet another unreliable product. The time it takes to make the product work makes this a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT KEYBOARD & MOUSE","review":"It is such an improvement over old keyboard & mouse.

She is 15."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VISUAL TREAT","review":"As always in the Bible, when we return to the story of David and Goliath we are struck not just by its power but by its brevity and concision. This is a combination of factors that makes it an ideal teaching tool and well-suited to being a short film for kids. Moreover, Veggie Tales has prepared the way for somewhat cock-eyed religious lessons, Davey and Goliath has us psyched for some stop-action nostalgia, and Wallace & Gromit has demonstrated the potential of Claymation. So I was ready to love this disc. Instead, I only ended up liking it.If you are going to gussie up the core story you really need to adding value, as Bob and Larry and the gang do. The additions here didn't do much for me. However, there is one thing that's very impressive about the film and easily redeems any shortcomings. The art design is based on the href=\\"http://www.jameschristensen.com/\\">work of illustrator of James C. Christensen and it's fanciful and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful chance to talk with my kids","review":"My children (4 & 6) really enjoyed this. The claymation is extremely creative and offer lots of funny images. While some adults may find the rhyme a bit tiresome, my kids got really into it and laughed a lot. It was also a wonderful chance to discuss with my kids notions of confidence, responsibility, and faith. I should also note that for those who are wondering if this is suited only for Christians, as a Jew I can assure you there were no issues. My only caveat (and I hate to spoil this for anyone)--SPOILER ALERT--instead of David killing the giant, getting hit in the head makes him turn into a nice person. I thought this a bit of a copout, but not so much as to make me dislike this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, intriguing adaptation","review":"This adaptation of David and Goliath is both fun and educational. \\"Davie & Golimyr\\" sticks close to premise of the small faithful hero overtaking a big giant. However, it adds its own twist to the biblical tale, without losing the moral lesson that faith is more important than size when facing large obstacles. The visual style is a mix of claymation and digital animation. Upon seeing it, I was not sure my son (my co-critic) would like it, but he really LOVED it. Upon concluding our viewing, he said that was really good.Notable characteristics of the movie are a comedic styling and poetic, rhyming dialogue.I was pleased with this adaptation and loved the visuals. It's one I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grandsons Say...","review":"I got this video for my two grandsons, ages 3 and 8, so I think that I'll just pass on to you what they said about the movie.My 8 year old grandson said that he like the movie, especially because \\"it was weird.\\" He said the animation was different and that the characters \\"spoke in poetry.\\"My 3 year old grandson simply loved it. The movie kept him entertained the entire time and he occasionally voiced his approval by laughing or yelling at the screen. He like the movie so much that literally as soon as the video ended he was begging to watch it again.It's a good story, suitable for kids of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Thought it was going to be a full length movie, but it was just four short stories.

The Return of Black Adam","review":"After seeing the commercials for this movie, I thought it would have been a full length feature film of Superman teaming up with Shazam to take down Black Adam. Or at least giving an in depth look at how Shazam got his powers. Now granted the writers and animators did in fact add all of this information into the movie, but it felt lacking since it was only an 18 minute long scene. I felt cheated since they packed all of that information into a cartoon that could have been done on tv. The entire dvd was a let down since all it truly is is a bunch of 20 minute long cartoons of different characters of the Justice Leauge. I would rather see a full on hour long movie of Superman fighting Black Adam with Shazam then the barely 20 minute scene. NOT WORTH OWNING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing Rip Off of Fan Base","review":"Like it was said before over and over again, only one new short.

But if your like me you owe these already.I watched Superman/Shazam on Youtube, may still be posted there.I would only buy this for 2.99 if I ever saw this for sale at that price, simply because I am a completist.

Wouldn't have been half bad if I had not already seen some of the other shorts in other collections I already own. Animation and story on the main title were as expected for a Superman video but I really only want to buy this sort of thing when it contains a feature length movie. Would not recommend on Blu-Ray (because of the price) and certainly not worth $25. Pick it up if you haven't seen any of the shorts before and you can get it for less than $15.I would have liked it much better if it was an hour long feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short and simple for a full DVD","review":"I thought that the art and animation was very good but the story was much too short.

The feature short is great by itself, maybe it could've been longer. But to package it with shorts that's already been released is not cool. I have every dvd that DC put out and this is the one that I'm most disappointed with. I have these shorts already and I feel ripped off. Also the portable video player of choice is the ipod/iphone. If you're advertising digital downloads, please warn us ahead of time that you're only making digital downloads for the Zune player only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The short itself is pretty good if only 24 minutes long. I bought this thinking it's 63 minutes and not 63 minutes with all of the shorts combined. As for the quality of the blu ray, it's just ok as it's not the greatest transfer I've seen. Noticed several macroblocking and colorbanding so I was a little disappointed considering this is supposed to be blu ray and not DVD. I did like the short for the Spectre which I didn't have. Should have listened to all of the negative reviews as I just couldn't see them releasing basically a tv episode and selling it. Anyway, save your money and either buy used or just rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading!","review":"I was like others very upset to learn this was a collection of shorts which was not stated or made obvious in the description. Even by reading the total time of 63 minutes it doesn't tell you that is is not one full length feature.VERY misleading, VERY disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"***Please stay away****","review":"This DVD was very disappointing, why is it that in the comics to DVD movies Superman is a punk that gets his ass kick more offend than most. His name should be changed in these movies to the Super-hero that can take a punch. Also why does the origin stories change in these DVD's, Superman wasn't Shazam's mentor and to my knowledge didn't know of one of another when Bill gain his powers, and it wasn't in a subway station. I don't know why this story couldn't have been told like this, Black Adam arrives to earth looking to kick-ass and Shazam stands up to him but wait they are equal. Superman arrives and tips the balance of power to Shazam side, and makes a mention about the justice league.Also the short stories of the other Super-hero all suck, as shorts and are in other DVD's. I would rent this DVD if you must see it but wouldn't buy. One Star is too good for this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of $3.99","review":"(1) it's 4 short films in one. Superman/Shazam, Spectr, Green Arrow and Jonah Hex. All of which SUCKED. The story lines, characters, and animation all sucked. (2) And TOTALLY not for kids 14 and under. It was graphic and stupid. Basically a bunch of Marvel illustrators/directors had nothing better to do, so decided to make this on a $50 budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story, Not worth the dollars","review":"This is a group of 4 shot cartoons.

If I haven't stopped you thus far, you might as well just RENT it and experience it for yourself. Notice I said RENT, in capitals.

Too bad they never released the trailer but trust me it is worth it in a sense if you are a Superman fan or Captain Marvel fan. Not only watch the extras Green Arrow, The Spectre and Jonah Hex but also included the episodes which feature these heroes Justice League Unlimited \\"Clash\\"with Captain Marvel, Batman the Animated series with Jonah Hex, Justice League Unlimited \\"Initiation\\" with Green Arrow and Batman: The brave and the bold \\"Chill of the night\\" with The Spectre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it","review":"I viewed as a rental through Amazon's video on demand (unbox)As others mentioned the title is misleading, it is actually 5 15 minute shorts focusing on minor DC characters.In all cases I thought the stories were good, the animation good, and it was a great value for the money. For those that felt the stories should have ran longer, I believe the writers did a good job of capturing the essence of the story and showcasing the characters in the time aloted (not to say I wouldn't love to see longer features, but I think the stories worked withing their running time, focusing on the action with just enough information for the viewer to fill in the blanks, without wasting a second of screen time).This also got high marks from me for presting more adult-focused material. Maybe a PG-13 rating would be more appropriate (definatley not R material though). But it was refreshing to see something a bit more dramatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"The animation was good. The plots were fine considering they were each short stories.

I was wrong on all accounts. I am not that big a fan of Superman or Shazam but loved the three shorts and thought expanded editions meant longer versions which would have made this disc worth the purchase price even without the main feature.

It's not. Their episode is 20 minutes of cool action, then it ends, making way for a few more vignettes, including one for Jonah Hex.While I enjoyed most of the minisodes, I'm glad I didn't pay for it per se. I saw it on Netflix and alternated between bored and interested after the first show. Don't be fooled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah....so not buying this...","review":"I'm all about supporting DC animated films. But yeahhhhhhhhhh. This is a rip off. I'll definitely be watching this a different way.I own all the shorts, so theres no point for me to buy another Blu Ray with them in it,just have a 22 min movie.I must say, this is a stupid move on DC's part. They are spending money on manufacturing the Blu Ray/ DVD's for this, but I highly doubt they'll be selling much, especially with the face that its so easily downloadable nowadays.Sorry DC, but I won't be buying this one. I'll definitely will be buying Superman/Batman: Apocalypse though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids at all IGNORE RATING","review":"Not for kids at all it should be rated Pg 13 or R for some of the movies.

And if it is a remake - why not do something different?Likewise the Green Arrow episode is described by one reviewer as \\"Initiation,\\" but that was the first episode of Justice League Unlimited. So does this disc have the JLU episode, or something new?Another review said the Spectre tale has him with Batman and the Phantom Stranger - so is this a new piece, or the \\"Batman - The Brave and the Bold\\" episode which aired not long ago.In any event, I have no idea what's on this disc beyond the names of the featured characters - and, like most of the recent DC DVDs, I'm losing interest fast.Guess I'll just have to pull out my old discs of Batman, Superman and the Justice League."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excited about movie, disappointed with preview","review":"Why, why, why?

Now, the scanner failure message comes on shortly after it's powered on (even if I haven't used the machine at all). I really can't take incoming faxes, because not matter what the scanner failure message is on and that prevents a fax from coming in (or going into memory). IF I try to power it off quickly, hoping to have it powered back on before the incoming fax is disconnected, then it automatically consideres this a power failure and ends the whole process. In essence, I can only fax out and I have to repower my offiject 10+ times per day. It is a complete nightmare. HP REALLY needs to recall this or send out new software/hardware.

The customer support (CS) services has been out sourced so you go through the usual merry go round just to speak with someone. The print heads have consistently failed, the color ink is to expensive and I have had consistent paper jams. Now I have found out through (CS) that the printer needs additional parts that cost almost as much as what I paid for the machine. I am really displeased with the 7130 and with HP I will not buy another HP product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROKEN!","review":"Similar to the complaint by others, my 2 year old (almost to the day) 7130 had an IDS failure, and from reading other reviews, I suspect it cannot be fixed. I will look to other manufacturers for a multi-function machine. By the way, the new HP computer I had went back after it reformatted my XD picture card and rendered it useless. After much effort, HP finally admitted they knew the software was setup to automatically reformat the card and were unable to tell me how to correct that nor were they willing to replace the XD card.

Is not consistently recognized. Scans only if you are lucky. Copies OK, so long as you don't mind paying a fortune for ink. Most creative failure is the blinking light show and error message you get after sending each fax. All faxes take at least two phone calls.

Read the rest of the reviews for more horror stories on this monster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fax function constantly fails","review":"Overall, this all-in-one is a disapontment. Besides the overall cheap feel of the machine, the fax function almost never works; errors in sending and recieveing happen at least 80% of the time.

I bought three of them at the same time since; one machine was for me, the other to my brother and the third one to my dad. Since my brother doesn't use this machine to send faxes, the only thing he complains is that the black copy and printing (taking into consideration the different levels of quality) of this machine is actually slower than the previous machine he had earlier (HP 950c). However, my dad and I are pretty disappointed with the HP 7130. Every time we send a fax, there are error messages and it fails to send it. It takes forever to send a fax that actually reaches the desired location. We probably have operated in the past about 12 different fax machines, and I can tell you without doubts, HP 7130 IS THE WORSE FAX MACHINE I have ever encountered"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"My husband purchased this hoodie as a gift for a friend.

The book that *will* help you more than you can imagine is STOP WALKING ON EGGSHELLS by Randi Kreger and Paul Mason.

The reader is then inundated with page after page after page (at several points in the book) of technical ballistics evidence which I believe should have been kept at a minimum in order not to induce boredom. I have read over 750 true crime books in my life, but this is absolutely the first one that I did not finish reading.

The history of college football is the history of the Ivy League schools, and it is a riveting and fascinating history. Too bad that this book is so poorly written that it hard to find. It has its moments when you get lost in the history you're reading, but then you're awoken sharply by a mistake - no, not a factual mistake (although it has some of those) but simply a gramatical mistake, or a spelling mistake, or a word where it shouldn't be, or a word missing.

These chapters have no information (or very very little) relating to the medical field. In chapter 21, she finally says \\"Let's Get Technical\\".

The recording and the orchestra are excellent and the performance is quite good, if a bit plain and under interpreted. Should Decca reissue this at mid-price or lower it would be quite competitive. Those considering Karajan or Abbado's readings would be well advised to seek this out, as it is - to these ears - a far better alternative.In the long run, it is not as distinctive as Wand or (if you prefer the early-music approach) Mackerras, but it does sound fantastic and is easy to live with. Walter is an acceptable alternative, but one must put up with a poor orchestra and a recording that's not very good.

The 1600 mAh NiMH batteries I bought before these are still going strong. I won't ever buy another Lenmar battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine batteries, fine value","review":"These are fine batteries that deliver great bang for the buck, which is true of all high-quality NiMH batteries I've tried. The problem a previous reviewer reports with low capacity is indeed with his charger, not the batteries themselves. The charger he mentions delivers a fixed amount of current per hour for fifteen hours and shuts off. It has no \\"intelligence\\" about the capacity of the battery in it, about its current charge state, or anything else. Using these batteries in a good, intelligent charger, such as a Maha MH-C401FS or the smart Lenmar charger he mentions, yields great results, as the charger recognizes the capacity of the battery and doesn't stop charging until it reaches it.Use these batteries with a good charger and they'll please you over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic KX A276","review":"This is the second battery I have bought for my phone in 10 years.

The housing surrounding the pull cord is made of extremely cheap plastic that will break after a few pulls, and cause the cord to tangle. It is nothing but a headache.

As of now, this generator has been running non stop for 4 days. With a full tank, ran a fridge, tv/dvd, lights and coffee maker for 10 plus hours with no problem. Not big enough for much more than that, but for around $200, it's a fantastic deal. Noise output was much less than surrounding generators in neighborhood. Oil is not included, and would be great to have a goose neck style funnel to add oil prior to starting. Small enough to easily transport, but strong enough to keep you going during an outage. Highly recommend this generator.

Today (Sunday, storm hits tomorrow) I got the generator out and filled it with oil and gas and tried to start it. It would not start. I check the fuel line, the on\\\\off switch, and nothing works. I inspect the engine and find that the spark plug wire is broken. the part that attaches to the plug is in pieces and there is no way of attaching it.

The truth is, you should purchase a bigger, name brand generator such as B&S; or Toro since most local repair shops can get parts for them.Basically, I bought the cheapest 4-stroke generator I could find, and I got a cheap generator which I will use only as a loaner, never for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I purchased this generator like a lot of people would, it seemed to be the biggest bang for your buck.

I've constantly had carburetor problems. I have to run it with the choke more than half on or it lopes badly, so badly it often dies. Went to use it yesterday and it ran okay. Tonight no start.

Poor directions. After about 50 pulls the first time it finally started. Then it ran just fine, lasted a good 5-6 hours running a tv and dvd player. However, once it ran out of gas it took about 20-30 pulls again to start. I thought it might be just that it was empty and needed to be primed, but there's no primer. So after it ran for another 2 hours I turned it off to try and restart it. Same problem, 20-30 pulls later it started again.

The version of \\"Greetings to the New Brunette\\" is a bit of a curiosity, and it doesn't top the version on Taxman in my opinion, but I like the Smiths cover and its good to hear stuff like \\"Days Like These\\" and \\"Raglan Road\\".

In summary, we found the book to be historically and culturally inaccurate (there are no torillas in Cuba*!). The characters are one-dimensional and unsympathetic and the storyline slow and plodding. It did nothing to inform and educate its readers about the Cuban War of Independence. If I hadn't been reading it for my book club I would have given up after Chapter One.*In Cuba the term \\"tortilla\\" refers to egg omelettes not the typical tortilla eaten in Mexico and Centeral America. The author clearly makes references to the Mexican type of tortillas in the first chapter of the book. She should have done her homework! This reference caused me to question the rest of the research done for the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars more accurately","review":"I too am a Cuban-American and I loved this book! I couldn't put it down once I got started. After reading this book I felt compelled to do more research on Evangelina to see if the story was indeed based on history, & it is!This book is beautifully written. I could feel the warmth of the island and envision the tropical landscape. I felt I was there. I don't know what book that other Cuban-American was reading, but it couldn't have been this one. This book was NOT boring!I would have given it five stars but I didn't like the way this story ended. I didn't feel this was a romance story and liked the way the author had written the majority of the book not as one. But on the very last couple of pages, she changed the tone of the relationship of the two main characters and it didn't feel necessary or right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adaptation!","review":"Modernizes Christopher Marlowe's play beautifully~ Tilda Swinton is awesome in this!

This is definitely NOT the movie I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of details, few insights","review":"This book has been originally writtem 20 years ago and today is reproposed in a new package. Being brief the problems with this book are essentially two:1) the author has a tendency to get lost in details many of them insignificants for the story, and some of them plain wrong (and the author could have corrected them).2) the book is in the stream of war histories watched only by one side. It is interesting to note that the author never mentions the unusefulness of the battle of El Alamein: it is in fact well known that the Torch landings will have forced the Axis army to withdrawn anyway and therefore the British could have attacked the Axis much more easily. But this it would not have been a British-only victory, but an Anglo-American victory.Therefore it seems a little pretentious to call this book the \\"definitive\\" history of the western desert war. Given the boredom caused by the plethora of details, it is more likely the \\"bed-time\\" history of desert war."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rip Off","review":"By the time I received it, this was \\"no longer available\\" on Amazon and I'm not surprised.

I search for Octopus every few years and today was the day I finally found this album online for purchase.

I guess that's just what happens after you've been playing for eight years. The Fundamental Elements is by no means POD's first album. I know of at least three others. So it kinda bothers me when people make the ignorant assumption that POD ripped off KoRn, Limp, or any of those other rapcore bands.

Tracks such as \\"Outkast\\", \\"Tribal\\" and especially \\"Southtown\\" are so well crafted, it is scary.

This album won't dissapoint. Later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost there","review":"I'm a HUGE POD fan. There is nothing quite like seeing them in concert, which has always been better than their CDs. Maybe it's because I've known about them for a while that I am slightly disappointed in this album. Don't get me wrong, the production is far better than \\"Snuff the Punk\\" and \\"Brown\\" but it just seems to lack that certain SOMETHING that their previous releases had. Maybe it was OVER-produced. But I think that because they had a larger audience to relate to that they may have been playing it slightly safe. POD is an awesome band, \\"Fundamental...\\" is a good CD. The only other band that I can compare with them is Rage. Not in sound (because they are really different) but in talent, intelligence and emotion. I'm looking forward to their next release already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty weak stuff","review":"I thought I would give these guys a chance, and I did. The result for me was just a lame mess. I realize that a lot of bands are entering the genre, and these guys are'nt really new, but they have three things going against them. First, they have no musical talent whatsoever. Second, the lyrics are downright corny. Third, the hard image they portray is a joke.

I get so bored listening to it. And why is it so over-produced? I think that a pod album deserves a bit of roughness. But you guys got all kinds of stupid effects on this thing.

They love God, our personal Savior, with all of their heart, with all of their soul, with all their mind, and with all their strength(Mark 12:30-31).

Unfortunately, hearing the album made me realize why I didn't like \\"southtown\\" in the first place. It's not the worst thing I've heard, but I give it a low rating because I don't find much originality in their sound.

Third, all I hear is the vocalist whining, moaning, and yelling (like Korn again), only it's all about religious mumbo-jumbo. God this and God that, gets annoying really quick. I don't listen to music to be told how to live my life.Essentially, what we have here are a bunch of musical evangelists - the Stryper for the '90s. And that band was a joke.

Their first Cd was great, but it never got the publicity needed to break through. It is different for this album. Their music video for \\"Rock the Party\\" broke into MTV's TRL and soared to the top of the countdown. \\"Rock the Party\\" is a sweet song and if you like hard alternative type music you would love it. They change the tempo a little in \\"Set your eyes to Zion\\", but they keep it cool and that is my second favorite track. It is a must buy for all alternative fans like me. The only reason that it didn't get a five is because the Cd does not seem complete. It is still worth buying, though, and I would recommend it to any alternative lover who does not own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome cd","review":"P.O.D. are probably the best hiphop/metal band of the current time. Of course i listen to bands like Machine Head, Fear Factory, to Earth Crisis, Hatebreed, Snapcase, Indecision, etc. P.O.D. is a band who released one of many of there cd's, and the new cd is incredible. THe cd rips right through from the 2nd track through the last. There are some little (not really songs) in the middle, but it doesn't bother me. THe song SouthTown is one of the sickest rapmetal songs and heaviest songs ive heard in a while. Then songs like Lie Down, Outkast, and Follow Me have the faster metal rap grooves to it while remaining very heavy, however the best track is Freestyle, if you like melody, then this song you'll love. It starts out a with some singing/rapping, and the chorus is filled with melodic singing and guitars, with some heavy parts as well, you must buy this cd, it rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mix of heavy rock and then great rap.","review":"This band seems new and I think has a lot of potential.

I've gone to two of their concerts in Fort Wayne, In and Cornerstone and have never experienced anything like it. With the lyrics so on point with God makes this CD have a purpose and not just talking about sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.

P.O.D. actually have something to sing about other than \\"nookie\\" or \\"breaking stuff\\". They sing about relishing life and having a good time. So they're christians, at least they don't force this fact down the listeners throat.

GO GET IT NOW!!!!","review":"THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST CD EVER MADE, I NORMALLY LISTEN TO KORN AND LIMP BIZKIT BUT WHEN MY COUSIN WAS LISTENING TO THE FUNDEMENTAL ELEMENTS OF SOUTHTOWN I THOUGHT WOW MY \\"CHRISTIAN\\" COUSIN IS LISTENING TO THIS. BUT TO MY SUPRISE THIS WAS THE BEST CD , SERIOUSLY I MEAN THIS IS SO GOOD I RECOMMEND IT TO ANY KID OUT THERE THAT WANTS TO HEAR SOME EAR TANTILIZING MUSIC. IT TOTALLY ROCKS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Rockin' Versatility. This album is IT!!!","review":"I've been thinkin about gettin this album for a while now, since I saw a reference to them on the reviews of several other pages (i.e. Limp Bizkit, Korn). Heeding the warning of the man's review below mine, I listened to this album before I bought it; and man, I was BLOWN away. I ain't no christian, but this album is heavy! P.O.D. don't preach, they tell it like it is. Their lyrics are real, not superficial. And man, the U2 cover of \\"Bullet\\" was DOPE! Pick this one up! It won't let you down. Listen with an open mind. Korn who?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Turn For P.O.D.!","review":"I have to say I think this CD is very well put together. I enjoyed their older CD's like Brown and The Warriors EP, they sounded more raw which I like. This CD though it doesn't sound that raw is still worth the listen. I find myself singing the songs every where I go. I enjoy all of the tracks even their softer \\"Set Your Eyes On Zion.\\" They still preach the word of GOD, though they are on a securlar label, and have their same basic sound. My favorite track was \\"Southtown,\\"I also like the demo version of Southtown on \\"The Warriors EP.\\" Their words really inspire me to live for GOD. Christians and Non-christinas alike should give this CD a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jah people ride on!","review":"P.O.D. is a lot like Limp Biskit or KoRn, only their lyrics are Christian. On some songs, like Southtown and Bullet the blue sky, tell the story of San Diego, where they were born and raised. Plus they show off their roots with some hip-hop in between songs. If you need pumped up, this is a really tight cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it","review":"I saw P.O.D. a few days ago at the WBCN zmas rave, a concert in boston. i didnt know who they were but when i heard them i bought the new cd. it is sooooooo awesome. its like a mix between rage against the machine and limp bizkit and some incubus. they are awesome! get the cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's no doubt, p.o.d. has the greatest sound i've ever heard","review":"Take Korn and Limp Bizkit, mix the two in a blender, take out all the bad lyrics and what do you have? P.O.D. I saw them perform at the Whiskey three weeks ago and man...it was the best concert i have ever attended. Sonny works the crowd and was even kinda enough to give us his water knowing that we were all dying in the pit. This c.d. has it all. My personal favorite songs are southtown, tribal, and outcast baby!!! Buy It"},{"rating":"2","title":"POD-welcome to southtown","review":"this is an awesome cd,even though i only like.........2 songs,but their awesome!southtown is my favorite,and then rock the party (off the hook).satellite is way better though,you should get that too.but the 2 good songs on this cd are worth the money!i love them!BUY THIS FRIGGIN' CD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!!","review":"I used to be into secular rock(limp,etc.)but after listening to P.O.D. I'll never listen to that again.P.O.D. blows all of those groups away in sound and lyrics.I can't think of a group I like more.I like heavy metal and P.O.D.:Fundamental Elements of Southtown is the best example of Christian rock I've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best P.O.D album","review":"Okay, first off I'm actually 17 I just have a phobia of passwords.Anyway, I would advise you to get this album if you are considering P.O.D. This album is better than the others because it seems to be the most honest. Their albums before this one have been kinda crap and the albums after are much more poppy or \\" major record label friendly \\". The sound of this album is very original and their hybrid of reggae and metal is definitely the most credible on this cd.This album really shows off who these guys from Southtown really are and if your'e looking for something a little bit heavier than Satellite or Alive look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah...brings back good memories","review":"For many people, this was their first taste of P.O.D. Before this they had several albums that never really generated that much buzz mostly because they weren't really that great. Some people may disagree but in my opinion this is where P.O.D. pretty much started their career with making awesome music. My only complaint is that some of the songs are a little boring thus the 4 star rating. However, the other songs on here are great and feature intelligent lyrics from a Christian perspective. I have also had the priveledge of seeing them live several times since they are fellow San Diegans. Anyways if you like their newer stuff, be sure to check back on this cd to see what really started their career. Its too bad their newer stuff hasn't been as good and has caused them to drop out of the headlines a bit, but hopefully their next release will help them return to their roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"P.O.D. --- The tightest new band on the market right now!","review":"Can I hear a round of applause for these guys! P.O.D. have taken everything they have learned in the past seven years and completely perfected their sound, lyrics, and ability to Rock anyones socks off. They are not Rage, Limp Bizkit, or Kid Rock. Never have sounded like those guys and never will. This is a mix of funk, soul and hip-hop that can't be beat! Tight production and fat beats. This is the best album I have heard in the past two years from any band! Buy it Buy it Buy it!!!! Congratulations to a wonderful band who are obviously following God! \\"Set Your Eyes To Zion\\" all you Jah Warriors!!!! And to everyone reading this, if you don't own it. Buy this record!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely awesome.","review":"That about sums it up \\"absolutely awesome.\\" I was looking through all the reviews of the CD Brown by P.O.D. also, and everyone compares their sound on that CD to that of Limp Bizkit and Korn(and I have to agree with them...POD is great on Brown), but after hearing this CD I would say for sure they have surpassed Korn and Bizkit....easily. And with a great message that actually means something instead of just talking about the worldly garbage bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit talk about. Awesome Christian message with the best music I've heard. Go buy this CD...you won't be dissapointed in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT NOW!","review":"OK! HERE IS THE SCOOP!

(nothing hidden shall not be revealed)","review":"This book is PERFECT in the sense it presents the Truth about the force at work against Life and God; i.e. the \\"money changers\\" of the world. What is Perfect is that it goes to the Heart of what Lincoln wanted, the Gov't to print/coin its own money and keep us Free as a Nation economically.The Story later on of how Lincoln was martyred due to this is illustrated accurately. It is the powerful story told by \\"a stranger.\\"The Wise have always known that \\"everything hidden shall be revealed.\\" This Books reveals this in economic terms for our country U.S.A as well as the world; and it gives the Solution which will one day be ever-present to one and all Countries.There is a force agains the Light that has all to do with the one world government, the war beast, the tax beast and the money beast. It is not of God or of Light. It will not be sustained and this book points it out in terms of how it acts/operates and the solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I returned these almost immediately they arrived. The plastic they are made from is much cheaper than it looks in the picture, and was dirty from where the tins had rubbed against other things. The stand kept falling sideways, and the magnets were glued on very poorly, with strings of glue all over the back on the tins, and the magnets off center. Some of the lids stuck, others didn't fit tightly enough. Overall, not worth the money. I bought a set of metal ones instead, and am much happier with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not charge EP096FL","review":"This unit will not charge my EP096FL RCA battery.

His lyrics compare with the best of James Taylor and Chuck Pyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything by Kris Kristofferson is a favorite of mine","review":"Have listened to and loved Kris and his songs for at least 20 years. Am only sorry that he has given up writung and touring, I used to see him every chance I had. Wish he would go back to writing his songs again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very spirit of country music","review":"Maybe it's easier for me to judge this album, because I haven't heard original versions of Kristofferson's songs. For me \\"The Austin Sessions\\" represent the very spirit of country music. The arrangements, the lyrics, the tunes - everything is perfect. Country music isn't very popular in Russia, but I'm sure, after listening to this album, people would understand, why there are so many fans of all over the world. You don't need to be a Caruso to sing country songs - Kris prooves it with every track. You need to have something inside you - a spirit of old good times, when everything seemed so simple and plain..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kris Has Done It Again","review":"Kris is a true legend in his own time. His music is so natural it just blends right in with his rough, honest voice. Listening to this CD is just like goin' home. He's brought back his old songs with some great harmony with Vince Gill, Stevey Earle, Allison Krause and others. No one can write music like Kris. So honest, so basic - without all the drama, polish, the glitZ, he just plain tells it like it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"I gave the bad review below","review":"It is not as bad as I said below. I just had to get used to it. Although a copy of the original recording of these songs would be better, this is pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kris sounds tired","review":"I am disappointed...Kristopherson talks his way through. I think his lack of enthusiasm comes through in the music. Kris blew a good opportunity to introduce a new generation to these great songs. \\"But then again..That's just my opinion and I could be wrong.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Kris has lost it","review":"Kris never had a good voice, but he sang with feeling. Listening to him was like listening to a down and outer that happened to be a great poet. You could tell he believed every song he sang. I am happy for him that he is in recovery and has stopped drinking. He has been married for 14 years and is a grandfather.That is great. However, he has lost his emotion. He is no longer singing this as a down and outer but more as someone saying here are my hits. Even \\"Sunday Morning Coming Down\\" sounded up beat. If you want to hear the old Kris buy \\"The Silver-Tongued Devil and I\\". That was a great CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I deducted three stars for the mixing on this album.","review":"I adore Kristofferson's voice and lyrics, but this record reminded me of Natalie Cole's attempt to add her voice to her father's recordings. The guest artists seemed pasted over the top of, rather than blended into, the music, as though they weren't necessarily in the studio at the same time Kris was."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Silver-Pilgrim-Bobby Mc Sunday Morning Devil","review":"How can anyone not give Kris BIG KUDOS for revisting some of his signature songs. You know he's that Silver-Pilgrim-Bobby McSunday Morning-Devil! Well HELL! He's more than that. He's even Willie's good buddy and he's Johnny Cash's favorite songwriter.

For example, the back cover of the paperback states that Mr. Alexander was the \\"second highest decorated helicopter pilot of the Vietnam era.\\" That would come as a big surprise to the nine helicopter pilots who were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. If you like lightweight, highly fictionalized accounts of the Vietnam War, then read this book. However, it makes a mockery of the sacrifices made by members of A Troop, 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry and Company H, 75th Rangers. How do I know? I flew with Alexander throughout his entire tour and I have firsthand knowledge of the missions he describes so poorly and inaccurately.

In fact the book belongs in the FICTION Catagory. There were so many discrepancies in the book I don't know where to begin. But I will say this, I NEVER had any doubt in my mind when I was being shot at. And I didn't have to hear a \\"ping\\" to know it. The sound of a close 7.62 will get your attention and a 12.7 mm will scare the s**t out of you.

I like to use it on a wet face because it emusifies better on wet skin, so the cleanser and the poppy seeds spread better. There aren't a lot of poppy seeds in it, so it exfoliates gently and isn't too harsh. It's got the consistency of whipped butter, and repels water just like butter when you try to wash it off. I need a washcloth to completely remove it, but when I do, my skin feels very soft and looks glowing. This cleanser might not be right for everyone, but it makes my combination/sensitive/acneic skin look and feel better. In warm weather I don't need to use a moisturizer after it.

The illustrations were not up to his usual standard. The only accurate portrayals were of Juliette Binoche and Capucine. The Leslie Caron, Catherine Deneuve and Isabelle Adjani dolls bore no resemblance to the actresses whatsoever, and the others weren't that great either.It was also strange that one of the greatest stars of French cinema, Arletty, was not included while a relative newcomer like Audrey Tautou was.There was also an odd note in the text saying that Capucine and Audrey Hepburn became friends before they were famous, when both had been house models for Givenchy. Audrey Hepburn met Givenchy when she approached him to design costumes for \\"Sabrina\\". She was never his house model. It makes me wonder how accurate the notes about the other actresses were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Testament The Painless Way!","review":"As we have used this guide through the past year I would say that it is fairly simple & straight forward in style.

This one, however, was a real disappointment. Very few of the songs are good for singing along, and the lyrics of several of the songs are unintelligle. The producers have used a lot of filler (e.g., three tracks of \\"Be kind to your web-footed friends,\\" none of them good), and some obvious classics are missing. Overall very disappointing!

An open mind might be the only requirement I could say is needed to get the most out of this book.

His chapters can be entertaining, but ultimately they lead nowhere, and cast no light into the dark corners of the universe. For a scientist and self-proclaimed skeptic, he seems a bit enamoured with new age mysticism. In one chapter, he talked about writing down and trying to achieve 100 goals in life. If one of his goals was to write a pointless, self-promoting book, he can check that goal off his list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pickover Book","review":"This is an interesting work by a scientist who is interested in exotic psychedelics, Proust, Einstein, Surrealism and other singularly offbeat subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix of thought-provoking, mind-expanding, and extremely interesting material","review":"It is hard to describe the content of this book as it is all over the place.

The sound quality is horrible, as if someone burned off an ancient casette.As for the songs, an Internet search revealed to me that the songs that don't sound like Freddie are actually by someone named Peter Straker, an original cast member of \\"Hair,\\" and who possibly lived with Freddie in the early '70s. (?) The songs were produced by Freddie and Roy Thomas Baker, and come from a 1978 LP called \\"This One's On Me,\\" with Freddie supposedly on backing vocals.

The Smile and Larry Lurex material is available elsewhere in much higher quality. However ... Stephen Rider's Queen bio \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\" mentions that during the \\"Night at the Opera\\" sessions, Brian May and Freddie Mercury assisted a soul outfit named Trax and that this material has never been discovered. Is it possible that the six tracks on \\"Pre Ordained\\" which are not from Smile or Larry Lurex are, in fact, these lost Queen-assisted tracks from \\"Trax\\"? The quality is terrible, but the material is at least interesting, and I believe I do hear a certain Brian-ness in the guitar parts, a certain Freddie-ness in the piano parts, and a certain Queen-ness in the arrangements and background vocals.

Also check out \\"In Nuce,\\" which isn't much better, but at least the sound on that one is a bit superior to this. Also, Brian May fans need not get their hopes up when looking at the track list and seeing pre-Queen song titles.

When will Car mfgs catchup and have a jack in the front of the radio player? On my 20 mile compute, none of the four stations are empty. On the most unoccupied channel, I get a lot of static and drop outs. Requires frequent battery changes once the batteries start drop off the static increases. The chip used by the device actual allows for 14 channels; half of those are near 107MHz but the device is not tuned for up there (I tried by jumpering one of the pins). Haven't tried to get it to use one of other three low channels yet. I'm kind of annoyed that I bought this POS only to find a TranmitterII released two weeks later. I feel robbed.

Your ipod hooks to a dummy cassette with a wire and somehow transmitts everything to your car stereo. This is a big deal for us because our then 2 year old killed off our cd player by sticking coins into it. The dealor tells us it will take 2-300 just to crack open the dash to see if it works again.

If you have something other than factory (mine's an Alpine) check first to see if you can plug your ipod into the back of the head unit. With Alpine, you can buy an adapter that goes from ai-net to rca (check out KCA-121B on crutchfield.com, it plugs in where a cd changer would go) and then get the rca cord for the ipod, and you're all set.

I have a laptop I stream music/video with using WinAmp 5.

Since I live in rural florida, I have gotten it to where it's crystal clear up to -28 db but, after that it begins to hiss but, the hiss can't be heard over the music so, it's good.Overall, this is good idea if you need a cheap way of doing something like I did and live in rural area."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little dissappointing","review":"I bought this so that I could listen to my MPIO MP3 player in my car through my car stereo. I live in a fairly urban area and I had a lot of trouble finding good reception on one of the four frequencies I could use. The best one worked OK until I tried to put the Tunecast down, then it went all wonky. I had to keep holding it to hear the music at all. As you can probably imagine, this is not really the best situation while driving. Even while I was holding on to it, the sound quality wasn't very good.

I was pleasantly surprised. The unit gives you four frequencies to choose from, and luckily, one of them was clear in my area (DC metro). The signal came through loud and clear on my car stereo. It's not CD quality sound, but it sounds as good what my old cassette adapter provided. It works fine with my home stereo, too, but a direct line-in connection sounds better. It's worth a shot if you want an easy connection for your car stereo and have open frequencies in the 88.1-88.7 range.

However if you are in a major metro area where you have the 88.X range is loaded with high powered broadcast stations-- forget it. This cute little postage stamp transmitter can't pump enough wattage out to get a decent signal across a bathroom, let alone broadcast a decent signal to other FM Recievers/Radios around your home.For my money I'm going back to CCrane and pick up the CCrane FM Transmitter, that can be set to any open FM frequency and can be run off AC or batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"I intensely dislike this thing.","review":"If I had truly hated it, I'd have given it 1 star. Anyway, you plug this into the headset jack of the iPod and then, after inserting 2 AAA batteries, set a slide switch on it to one of 4 available frequencies (all on the low end of the FM band), set your FM radio to the matching frequency, and push the big button on the TuneCast to get it to transmit. By the way, of you forget to press the big button again before you exit the car, count on the 2 AAAs being dead when you return.There is more static, popping and crackling than there is music. I'm sure you get the picture. No matter how I positioned it, it wasn't very clear. I even tried to use it in a car with its radio antenna mounted on the front fender, but it wasn't much better (the TuneCast transmits to your radio's antenna, not to your radio's faceplate).I got the Griffin iTunes, and this was somewhat better to be sure, but still not good enough to make me give up the headphones or the cassette tape converter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you're a fan of static","review":"I was excited to try this out, but disappointed when it played loud static along with the music.

However, there are only 4 stations that you can transmit to and those stations, depending on where you live might already have a strong signal going out on it. Where I live, in Chicago, it does an average job. However, there are more than noticeable spots of interference in the frequency. It's extremely annoying to have this thing in the car and get good sound for about 5 minutes and then all of a sudden start hearing interference. It's definitely better if you use it in the house next to a stereo system. For the car, plain and simple, it stinks. For home, it does a much better job. The Griffin made Itrip is worse than this, even though it can transmit to any frequency. So if I had to chose between the two, I probably would pick this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad stations...","review":"This product has serious issues.

The spring in each handle is very strong, so it pretty much takes the average strength of a young man to latch and unlatch them. Each handle has an adjustment bolt in the end of the handle, but if you loosen it to where your wife and kids might operate it, it probably won't hold the cover down tightly enough. It seems like they could design something like a toolbox latch with some leverage to fasten the rear portion of the panel. Maybe there's a trick I'm missing with the spring clamps.

So I was really looking forward to this. All I can say is that it was a terrible disappointment.First off, it has narration, which I never like on a recording to begin with, but this guy sounds like he should be narrating one of those Disney animal flicks. Second, Porgy and Bess requires strong black voices and choruses. Until this recording I had never heard a weak rendition of Summer Time. And how anyone ever thought of having Mel Torme impersonate a black singer is beyond me. My husband walked into the room and asked why I was listening to a lounge singer.So now I am still looking for a good rendition of Porgy and Bess on CD. If anyone has found one, please let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Keeper","review":"This was highly recommended by a jazz fan and I was ready for a \\"jazz\\" interpretation of the piece. However, most of the arrangements are too light and Las Vegas lounge-like for the original music. Really the only good parts are when the arrangers and singers stick fairly closely to the original music, only slightly varying the folk/operatic style the composer intended. Mel is OK, although his arrangements are poor. The Bess just butchers her pieces. At best, I find this a novelty item just worth having heard once and then dismissing. Stick to the Todd Duncan version, which is still the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choice, bad value","review":"I like Mel, and some (not all) of the vocalists interpretations on this CD, and the arrangements are very good. Based on this, I would say that it is worth owning this as perhaps a part of a collection of Porgy & Bess recordings, although certainly not the first or only...However, the narration is so pervasive and so silly, I would say just forget it. I am not sure, but I think this narator is the same guy who used to narate high school education/public service films in the 50's(e.g. \\"What should Marry do on her first date\\" or the duck and cover films).This CD isn't worth more than 5 bucks as a novelty item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frances Faye brings this whole session down...","review":"Frances Faye couldn't sing if her life depended on it, she was a talentless hack.

Unfortionately you have to hear Faye's screechy out of key belting vocals through-out the entire recording. Thank God Mel Torme and Betty Roche are on this.

In his first two books, Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls, Michael Newton exposes the reader to a nonlinear superconscious reality in which we can experience the essence of who we are and why we incarnate as we do. Life Between Lives takes this a step further by guiding practitioners through the detailed process of spiritual regression. This is a \\"must read\\" for ALL hypnotherapists doing regression work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destiny of Souls","review":"This book makes as much and more sense than just about anything else I have read on life issues.

I do a great deal of spiritual work and have read Dr. Newton's other books; Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls. This one gives much more direct instruction of his specific methods and protocols to be able for a therapist to guide a client through this type adventure. It is \\"out on the edge\\" and not something you will find associated with conventional churches or religions, because it does not contain a pitch to get you join something, and it is a \\"first hand\\" account of what happened; not a 2000 year old story, translated hundreds of times, from someone who was not even present at the time it happened. It is the simple truth of his experiences in the 20th and 21st centuries. I can independently validate the information in the book by personal, present day experiences. Very Good Work !"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lumbering, Joyless Tome","review":"As a Clinical Hypnotherapist for over 22 years, I found this book very disappointing. It's dry, devoid of joy or enthusiasm, and I really found quite a few of the techniques described in this book, to be questionable.I bought this book based entirely on the reviews. After reading this book, I find the other reviews surprising.I am a regular Amazon book reviewer and most of my reviews are positive. I'm not someone who slams authors; I have great respect for the dedication it takes to get a book to print. Writing a review that wasn't positive didn't feel very good to me and I considered not writing one at all. But that's not really right either.So, here's my opinion of this book. If you're looking for a high energy, spiritually-uplifting book with a lot of usable technique as I was, I think you'll find this book disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really basic","review":"This book is really not worth the money.

This is HIGHLY recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"This movie had been recommended to me for its interesting twist ending. Well, if it's there, I don't get it.I have an inkling about what the branching off of plot line may stem from. But if it's what I think it is, there are a lot of lapses in logic that would make the new path unlikely, or actually impossible.Furthermore, the production values for this film are rather cheesy.

Badly researched and full of errors. Examples: The Sea Peoples were the first known people to wear horned helmets, not the Celts. Second, it was Varus' legions who were ambushed in 9A.D., not Valens.

Other than the origami (which is lovely, but you could buy a number of excellent origami books for the cost of this atrocity), the projects seem intended for young children -- and inept ones at that. There are many excellent craft books, magazines, and videos available, and cable television produces some outstanding shows (e.g., the Carol Duvall reruns, and I've heard great things about DIY, although we don't get that in my area).

They brought their passion for blues crashing into the mainstream, with Brett Michaels showing signs of real maturity and ethusiasm on almost every track.Highlights include, first and foremost, the experimental \\"Unskinny Bop\\", where CC Deville's guitar work and Riki Rocket's drumming both show a ten-fold increase in quality over previous albums, and \\"Valley of Lost Souls\\", where the whole band's energy is palpable. They take risks with these tracks, and find enormous success. And, both sound incredible on this remastered release! Other highlights include \\"Ball and Chain\\", \\"Flesh and Blood\\", \\"Poor Boy Blues\\" and \\"Something to Believe In\\". The band takes time to craft intelligence and moments of special interest into both ballads and rock tracks. As a whole, the third album is fun and energetic, but also deeply reflective.Unfortunately, not long after this record, Poison's popularity and creativity began to deteriorate."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE CDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Great CD but the remaster (at least the one I have) has an incomplete Poor Boy Blues.

There was even a girl at her school her age that just had a baby. Please buy it! Teach your children. I am buying a second copy to have here with me.

That could very well be thought of as bordering on child abuse or molestation.I am an open minded, loving mother. I am no prude - and found the book very frank and to the point.

I LOVE this book, I think it is written very well for a teen-age audience and is a great read for all those inquiring minds within this age group. I wanted to give a copy to my niece for her next birthday. The reason I only gave it 2 stars was b/c I ordered the \\"New\\" version from Amazon and the copy that was sent to me was anything but New: Part of the front cover was torn, the spine was completely broken down, the pages were turned up at the corners and were obviously old and worn. I did however speak with a very helpful Customer Service Representative who is sending me a \\"NEW\\", New version, so it all ends well.

This book should only be purchased by adults and should be removed from adolescent access. \\"Deal With It\\" is nothing short of a sex manual. There are ways to present such information without be vulgar. The book contains excerpts, graphics and slang that are unnecessary, as well as inappropriate. This publication gives teenagers disgusting ideas and potentially harmful thoughts/actions.I am very honest and open-minded when discussing such topics with my daughter of 12 years. I don't want her walking around saying the things that are printed in this book. What happened to discretion?

I suggest Excalibur Serving Wax for anyone serious about using crossbows."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is serving Wax","review":"It is serving wax so there is not much to screw up.

Nothing false about this as it only proclaims itself to be \\"String and deck wax\\". So I got out just a cheap old table candle I had and I used that to rub on the deck and string. Candle wax is a little hard but so is this \\"excaliber\\". At around $7.00 a tub, I think I would use the Barnett stuff which is more expensive but softer and easier to apply. Years ago I used Bees wax on my recurve bows. I think I am going to try that again as it is much cheaper. Using an old candle was very easy as far as application.......these Excaliber tubs are hard and I am not sure how to remove from the tub and apply to your bow? Bees Wax here I come.

The problem is that there is gap between the inner edges of the bar knobs and the ends of the cone-shaped parts of the posts; this gap reveals the unsightly gray plastic that covers the ends of the posts, with a slightly wider gap on the left that makes it look as though you can't place the end far enough back toward the wall. It's ugly and totally ruins the aesthetics. We were able to remove the plastic on the left post, but on the right, the plastic cannot be completely removed, so we had to trim the plastic so it wouldn't show. There is still a gap, but at least now it's metal that shows instead of plastic. I'm sure this holder would function with the plastic bits left in place, but it needs a little surgery to make it decent-looking as well as functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"This helped","review":"This book won't mean anything to you if your kids are perfect, but for the rest of us, the wisdom and compassion help tremendously.

Pediatrician and scientist Christakis and Zimmerman give us ways to decide by presenting reasoned opinion backed up by studies in a very accessible way. The concepts are mostly intuitive but not easy for many of us to act upon to benefit our children. Much of what kids watch on TV isn't good for them, nor for society.

I was just a young Australian schoolboy when Geno went around the moon with Apollo 10 and yet I remember that flight, and especially the one that followed, as if it was yesterday. Like others, I love the book's personal touch. Gone is the techno fuzz typical of so many books on the space age. Geno tells it like it was: pride, glory, pain, sadness, fun, love, tragedy. The only disappointment - and a small one - is that I wanted to know more. More about him, more about his family, more about 1972-1998, a period that passes in the book like a stolen second. Americans should feel proud of what Geno and his colleagues did. The moon landing (along with the U.S.'s involvement in World War II) was perhaps America's greatest hour.

And it makes you wonder why we didn't go back yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"major disappointment","review":"In the small portion of the book that actually talks about the Apollo 17 mission, Cernan spends an inordinate amount of time on mean-spirited personal attacks on his fellow crewmate Harrison Schmitt. The only reason I read the book was that I was hoping it would cover the Apollo 17 mission in detail. This book is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find out nothing about being on the moon.","review":"This book is all about Cernan and nothing about whatit was like to go to the moon. The man is almostcompletely inarticulate, but what he lacks there,he makes up for in ego. You will learn nothing aboutthe wonder of space flight from this book. I'm goingto follow the reviews of others and read the Collinsand Bean books."},{"rating":"1","title":"His favorite word seems to be \\"damned.\\"","review":"It is sad to me that a man of Mr. Cernan's age seems not to have matured to the point where he doesn't feel the need to use a swear word in every other sentence to sound macho. It really ruined the reading experience, and despite his going to the moon, I came away feeling he was diminished by his own book. The guy seems too immature for \\"hero\\" status."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Launch","review":"\\"Last Man on The Moon\\" by Eugene Cernan is the cloest and accurate portrayal of the last mission to the moon, Apollo 17. It brings you so close you feel as if you are in the cockpit sitting atop the Saturn V rocket. I would defenately recommend this book to read, it provides knowledgeable insight into NASA and the Apollo program.

I walk away with two major impressions: one, wow, what an achievement the Apollo program was and two, double wow, what an ego these astronauts had. I found their achievements to be inspiring, but their human persona left a lot to be desired. But I appreciate the honesty, the author could have easily glossed over that."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a ride!","review":"Eugene Cernan's conversational account of his participation in the Space Program takes the reader on one hell of a ride! His descriptions of blastoff, spacewalks, moonwalks, training, emotional highs and lows places one right in the middle of the action. I found it to be extremely entertaining, and not so techno as to bore the average reader. A definite A+."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"The Last Man on the Moon is just a wonderful book about an unparalleled adventure. Yet as inspirational as it was I also found it sad. 30 years ago telephones had dials, records were made of vinyl, a color TV was considered high tech and men walked on the moon. What has happened to us? Have we lost our nerve?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cernan's story is finally told","review":"As one who devours every book on space, I always wondered why Gene Cernan, one of the most verbal of the early astronauts, had never written a book. Finally, he has. And although it didn't delve into the personalities of those he worked with as much as I had hoped, I was still fascinated by his story. He is candid about his successes and failures, and I learned a few new things about those Apollo days. But I think the best part is the significance he gives the the ordeal of the astronaut wives. They were expected to be the picture of pride and polish, but suffered through an unimaginable hell as their husbands chased the stars. I don't think even Cernan realized the depths of his wife, Barbara's despair until after they split and until he wrote this book. Gene Cernan has always been one of my favorite astronauts because of his gregariousness and the easy way he has worn the \\"hero\\" mantle. His book is an easy and pleasurable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad read","review":"A surprisingly bad read.I thought I was going to get a detailed, engaging and POSITIVE story about the Apollo program and Apollo 17 in particular. What I did get was a trip in egocentrism, bad-mouthing and disturbingly irrational reasoning. I won't go into detail, but here is a short example of this:in a peer vote Mr. Cernan voted Rusty Schweickart, Walt Cunninghamand Buzz Aldrin as the worst---because Schweickart was an \\"irreverant intellectual\\",Aldrin liked talking about rendezvous and Cunningham because he drove a Porsche instead of a Corvette.Huh...I won't even go into the rest, it is just more of the same bashing.Unless you are a huge fan of his or just like grandomaniacs don't waste your money on this.I've read several books on NASA and Apollo in particular--By Andrew Chaikin, Colin Burgess,Tom Wolfe, Michael Collins, Deke Slayton and Frank Borman, to name just a few.This is on the bottom of my list--- not worth getting it even as a present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall, but several flaws too","review":"Michael Collins' \\"Carrying the Fire\\" is still thebest astronaut book I've read. However, I did enjoy this. The goodpoints are: 1. Much of the material is new. For example, His coverage of his Gemini mission is particularly interesting. 2. He is candid. Issues such as crew selection and skill are discussed openly. 3. Overall, the story moves quickly. The bad points: 1. Oddly, the section on his moon flight is among the shortest. 2. I think his ego gets in the way sometimes. 3. He spends time talking about celebrity friends and parties etc, which I had no interest in. 4. They needed a proof-reader. There are many grammar errors. I was annoyed by his overuse, mixing, and repetition of hyperboles and metaphors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! You'll finish this in a day or two","review":"This book is so exciting and interesting to read that you'll finish this in a heartbeat. Once finished you wish there was more to read. The style of this book is really nice and draws you in like no other book. If you enjoy the Apollo era then this book must be on your list to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner. . .","review":"I'm an admitted fan of the space program, and was looking for a book to read while on vacation. I picked this one up three times, and put it back twice before finally deciding to buy it because I could find nothing else. I didn't put it down again. Gene Cernan's story is a riveting behind the scenes look at the NASA space race through Apollo, through his eyes. A wonderful journey, and you feel like you're going with him. I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, inside story about just how dangerous","review":"I found the book very enlightening. The excite and the terror associated with each mission.

This best book I've ever read about the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recalling the \\"angry alligator\\"","review":"Gene Cernan's book is one of those which you begin to read when going to bed and ... cannot sleep until the \\"The End\\"! Calmly and steadily, the right words describing the important aspects of life and career of one of the few astronauts who went twice to the Moon. In the description of the EVA on Gemini 9 mission, we are almost out of breath while reading about the problems Cernan had. And we can recall the \\"angry alligator\\" and the complete history of Apollo XVII."},{"rating":"2","title":"The golden time and a man that lived in it","review":"The book shows a lot of the time between 1960 and 1972 what's going on in the Nasa. It shows the technics and the humans that lived for only one point the fly to the moon. There were many that lost their lives there were others that lost like the crew of Apollo 1 this dream like Don Engle which was orgin for Apollo 17 nominatet but flown first with STS 1 in the year 1981 into Space. The Book shows the Astronaut Cernan, it shows the Man with family cernan it shows the soldier Cernan and finally it shows the human cernan. If you want to know more about the golden Times of nasa the apollo aera and the time of the running to the moon between the russians and the americans, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Congress, what have you done?","review":"Gene's book is a fine read, and being a voracious reader of all things space, even I was shocked to read of the danger encountered by the early astros on their Gemini EVAs. It's too bad that he doesn't get very personal with his thoughts -- what was it like to stand on the moon and look back? Maybe it's too difficult to convey in words.But what makes me extremely angry is the way in which Congress and the administrations of LBJ to the present have put manned space exploration on the back burner. The '60's were heady days, we just didn't know it at the time. We now need a leader who can get us back into real exploration. Enough of this orbit-around-the-earth-in-the-boring-shuttle stuff. What a yawner!

With the exception of the stunning \\"1917,\\" these songs did not convey the same emotional power and beauty that I associate with her work. If you are new to Emmylou, get her recent, live Spyboy album instead -- it is a great sampling of her oeuvre with great arrangements and the utterly appealing presence of Buddy Miller on guitar (get his discs too!). And if you want to hear the definitive version of Western Wall, then you must get Roseanne Cash's lovely disc, 10-Song Demo. All of these alternatives are much more worthy of your hard-earned dollars than this uneven collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I don't get it yet.","review":"I really like Harris and Ronstadt (including the first Trio album more than the second), but after dashing out to buy this album it seems lame and uninspired.

Gee, I shoulda waited for some reviews! I have loved Linda and Emmylou forever, and tho I think Emmylou's voice is not quite as good as it once was, the SOUND of them on CD is not the problem, it's the choice of material. To my ear there is almost nothing on this compilation that really, really stands out. I like \\"1917\\" the best, and \\"This Is To Mother You\\" next. After that it just about all runs together for me. I don't choose music, it actually chooses me-when I get goosebumps listening to a song, or when the combination of lyrics, voice and melody make my heart sing, or my heart hurt (broken hearted melodies, etc.) I KNOW I have spent my money well and will also spend my listening time well. Sadly, that is not the case with this endeaver. Please try again Linda and Emmylou."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just doesn't work","review":"I had such high hopes for this CD, plus I'd had to wait ages for its delivery, so when it finally arrived I was well and truely ready to listend to this music. Well what a disappointment it was. Both these women are superb singers, but put them together and their voices just don't blend with each other the way you'd think they should. I've heard Emmylou sing with artists like Patty Griffin and the result was glorious, but her voice just doesn't work with Linda's. I listend to the CD several times in the hope that it might grow on me but unfortunately it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"wanted to like it more","review":"I've loved EH's recent albums, and tend to enjoy a variety of music styles, but I have to agree with those who say this album left them cold. Seeing Linda & Emmylou in concert in SF last week kind of explained it all; Emmylou is magnificent, while Linda is rigid, neurotic and wishing she were elsewhere. I ended up suspecting that Emmylou brought Linda in on this project to cheer her up from whatever major depression she seems to be experiencing, and the result is less than staggering. GO SEE EMMYLOU LIVE, though, if ever you get the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"An powerful collection of songs of emotion and beauty","review":"I nearly cried listening to \\"1917\\".

This album did this for me. Though I've never been a real country fan, or had much knowledge of Emmy Lou Harris, I've been a consistent Ronstadt fan and I find her music always out-of-the ordinary and inspiring. There is such a wide variety of styles and themes that there is certainly something for everyone. The music generally induces toe-tapping and singing along even if you didn't intend to. Some of the music hits so close to home its stunning, others less so and one, 51917, is so depressing that I skip through it. I suppose it speaks to somebody, though. All in all its a beautiful work full of harmony and feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"BitterSweet","review":"The lyrics are edgy but not quite blasphemous; the voices and instruments are great. One wonders to what extent the artists identify with the lyrics, and to what extent they would be receptive to having (or already have) a direct eternal relationship with God. Linda has the better trained voice but Emmylou comes through clear as a bell with great tone quality (but has some slight difficulty here and there), seemingly with absolutely no \\"enhancements\\", and her guitar work is supurb - and they work impressively well together. The other instruments are also a definite plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have left this on the shelf.","review":"I was expecting great things from the two artists. I am a fan of both.

Both of them have such talent and such keen musical intuition that I thought this album was certain to be wonderful. Wrong. What a disappointment. The covers add nothing to the songs; Jackson Browne's \\"For a Dancer\\" especially seems stripped of meaning.The songs are, for the most part, way over-produced, as I feel Emmylou Harris's most recent two or three albums have been. Too bad this one follows in that vein. This is a very unfortunate album.Linda Ronstadt's hairstyle was the most interesting thing about the CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor, certainly not western, not melodic.","review":"What a disappointment by 2 of my favorite singers.

I absolutely ADORE Linda Ronstadt, who was my initial reason for buying this cd. IT STINKS!

In top of it all it is overproduced. A waste of money, listen to their early cd's and forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring songs with one great singer!","review":"Linda disappointed me. Most of the songs on this cd are forgettable. She has the best voice in the business, but has been releasing mediocre songs with lousy record producers. Linda has said that she is retired, but before she does, she should give us a powerful album with multiple producers: Nile Rodgers, Jerry Wexler, Barry Beckett, Richard Perry, Brian Ahearn, Tom Catalano, Ron Nevison, and Peter Asher. What an album that would be! Linda, please don't let this be your last pop record. There are still good songs out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the album we've been waiting for years","review":"Finally they made it! and thanks to Emmylou to have made Linda more accessible and open (even to have a new picture!). Here the sound on the most emotional songs (Western Walls...) derives from Emmylou's last influences, but Linda contributes at her best with her incredible voice. The song list of writers is impressive. Emmylou is beautiful and stronger than ever, and some record company should bet on her and try the \\"Bonnie Raitt miracle\\" of some years ago. She's credible, respectable, cool and hip enough to sing every genre of music old and new. Linda is Linda: she has experimented enough in her career to deserve attention and respect. Her voice is a trademark, and in a moment of great new discoveries of the 70's and 80's she should deserve more space."},{"rating":"1","title":"By-pass this mediocre effort","review":"I anxiously awaited this c.d. Emmylou's albums of the 90's have all been great. This album is a major disappointment. There are only two or three cuts that would compare to even the worst songs on Emmylou's last four or five releases. The songs aren't bad - they just don't grab you. If you are considering buying this, don't do it unless you have all of Emmylou's albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great!","review":"A beautiful album with the whine of the open road, the lonliness of the western sky, and the wail of a broken heart.

It is simply that well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A High Point in 2 Careers","review":"This CD marks a high point in the brilliant careers of both Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt, two of the finest singers of their generation.

Though it features almost all cover songs, it is like a blast of fresh air in a popular music scene dominated by teeny-boppers and tatooed miscreants. Neither Linda or Emmylou have ever been in finer voice and the production work by rock veteran Glyn Johns (The Who) is outstanding. Of particular note are covers of Bruce Springsteen \\"Across the Border\\" and his wife Patti Scialfa \\"Valerie\\" as well as a Jackson Browne tune \\"For a Dancer\\" that is better than the original version.

In the opening track, Linda Ronstadt is singing along and all of the sudden we are blasted with some heavy-handed, hi volume harmonies. A similar misstep occurs in For a Dancer, but fortunately, doesn't ruin an otherwise great arrangement. The song Sweet Spot (co-written by Emmylou) is just one bad cliche after another.

I've been a fan since she backed up Gram Parsons in the '70s. What has always attracted me to her music is the simplicity of her arrangements (e.g. \\"Satan's Jewel Crown\\"with only guitar, dobro, and John Starling's backup vocal). As a rule, she lets the song speak for itself. Her gorgeous voice is the perfect vehicle for songs like \\"Ballad of a Runaway Horse\\", \\"Icy Blue Heart\\", and \\"Easy From Now On.\\" Sometimes, though, production values tend to weight her music down, as in the album \\"Bluebird\\". After two terrific \\"Trio\\" disks, I was eager to hear \\"Western Wall.\\" I was disappointed to hear a disconnected and ponderously-arranged collection that lacked Emmylou's usual soulfulness and sincerity. Emmylou and Linda Ronstadt were both in excellent voice on the disk, but the selection of songs and the wooden arrangements keep it at two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lazy recording job.","review":"This is a CD of essentially good songs.

But after the first paragraph I was hooked; I just had to find out what all happened to his dog Yukon in the three years they were together.Lawrence had a great attention to detail without ever mentioning anything trivial. His focus was on Yukon, not himself. And the way the story unfolded, dealing with other animal encounters and the weather (as is inevitable in the Canadian wilderness) there is not a page of this book that falls into the mundane. Every animal, every person, every event in this story comes to life.I could see my own dog in this story. I've often felt my dog Sammy was part something wild, be it Grey wolf or coyote, as Sammy shows so many similiar traits to Yukon.Although I \\"recycle\\" my books at book swaps, this is one book I'm holding on to. If you love dogs, the wilderness, Canada or the outdoors and the environment, this book is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The North Runner","review":"This is one of the most heart-warming books I've ever read.

I am definitely going to get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juicy Good & Good For You","review":"This fine bit of citrus delight is the work of one Colleen Fitzpatrick, a twentysomething former New York University student from Old Bridge, N.J., who sings in an accent that at times sounds more East End London than South Central Jersey.And that's no knock since she seems to have gleaned the trill, and the myriad bouncy hooks on this album, from years of immersion in the Brit pop exports of the '70s and '80s.A former dancer and actor -- as well as front girl of the early '90s New York City new-wave band Eve's Plum -- Ms. C puts her acute pop sensibilities on display throughout a reggae- and dance-kissed disc that features a cover of the Split Enz classic \\"I Got You'' and eight of her own nicely turned tunes. Highlights include the summer radio hit \\"Smile,'' \\"Turn Me On'' and \\"Girls Against Boys,'' in which the lady C's good humor outshines her polemics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This CD has been good, but some songs were kind of a dissapointment. The reason I bought the CD was Me, Myself, and I, and I'm still loving it! : ) Smile's got a good beat, and Unhappy Anniversary is a great slow song. I really enjoyed Graduation (Friends Forever), and being a strings player I appreciated the background music and solos. But then it started to get overplayed. You know how it is. About Last Night is another great song, and it always puts me in a good mood. But Fear of Flying was kind of weird, and I always skip over it. And Not that Kind of Girl is a little to heavy for my tastes. But all in all, it was a great CD, and I've yet to tire of it. That is, except for Graduation, but hey, that's just me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone needs some Vitamin C","review":"This is the perfect CD for when you're trying to get pepped up about something. All of the songs are so peppy that you can't help but feel happy. My favorite song is the first track, Smile, because that's what it makes me do. (corny, I know...) All of the songs are good though. There are some that aren't as good, but in general they're worth spending the money on. My favorites are: Smile, Turn Me On, I Got You, Money, and Graduation. Buy this CD!

Her interpretation of these songs are unqie and the production of this albumn is very good. I really like her voice. It's sweet but not oversweetened, firm but not rigid. It's very pleasant to the ear.The overal quality of this albumn is high, with each song contributing similar tone to the albumn. However, it does seem that the last song \\"graduation\\" is forcibly put on this albumn just to add some pop flavor to it. It was obvious because this song was one of the hit singles from the albumn, and the theme of this song just didn't go well with the entire albumnI'd say that if there wasn't this useless effort of adding a hit song at the end, I'd definitely rate this albumn 5 stars. Unfortunately I have to give it 4 stars. I believe that this albumn would sell as well as it did if it didn't have that graduation song.Purple_Garden"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasmagorical!!","review":"Vitamin C's quirky style and no-hold's-barred attitude have me captivated completely!!

The only songs that I liked were \\"Smile\\" and \\"Graduation (Friends Forever)\\". \\"Money\\" was okay, too, but the lyrics state that money is everything (\\"No hundred dollar bills - no fun for you\\"), which is not true. Whatever happened to love, friendship, and caring? At least near the end there's \\"I wish it was love..\\" Some lyrics are true, too (\\"Those with the dollar are those with the power\\"). \\"Girls Against Boys\\" is, to put it politely, weird. The lyrics are unintelligible, and it's hard (for me, at least) to put up with the music. \\"Fear of Flying\\" is disappointing. Half of the song isn't sung, just narrated. \\"I Got You\\" is decent -- I like the cello (Susie Katayama).

The polychoral sounds of the Venician late renaissance composers is always a joy to hear and these performers do a good job.The Miserere, purported to be composed by Pergolesi, is a beautiful piece, but I'm not convinced that it is Pergolesi. Pergolesi's tendency to use recurring themes in his music as in the famous \\"Stabat Mater\\" seems absent in the Miserere. Perhaps I need to go back to school and become a musicologist, but I found the styles I've listened to in Pergolesi's other religious works to be somewhat different than what I heard in the Miserere.Even so, it is beautiful music from the transition period between the high baroque and the stil galant. Even with my doubts about Pergolesi's authorship of the Miserere, I recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad battery","review":"Bought the BP-511 for my Canon 10D and took about 500 pictures and battery went dead.Charged battery and got another 20 pics.

I saw you listed under LeAnn Rimes reviews too."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF THIS IS WHAT FALLING IN LOVE DID TO BRYAN....","review":"A reviewer below posted that change is good and the change was Bryan falling in love with Erika Page which is reflected on this CD. But if this is what falling in love did to Bryan White....then there must have been trouble in paradise. The CD comes nowhere near the quality of his first three CDs. There was an ethereal, vulnerability to Bryan White's music in those first ones. This one contains some good lyrics but is hampered by terrible production values. The melodies of the songs (the thing that attracts me most to a song)are really terrible. It is such a shame because he lost his recording contract after this debacle was released and he seems to have dropped out of the picture. What a waste because Bryan White is a good hearted, talented young man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bryan Can Do MUCH Better!","review":"I've been a die-hard fan of Bryan's for about four years,but \\"How Lucky I Am\\" is the first (and only,hopefully) album that has not lived up to the high expectations that I have of Bryan's music. I thought that the majority of the songs were pretty lame and lacked depth and soul.With the exception of \\"Two In A Million\\" and \\"Everywhere I Turn\\",I can easily let my copy collect dust. Bryan can do better and he knows it! Bryan needs to go back to playing COUNTRY music...not that sell-out, country-flavored pop thats run so rampant on country radio nowadays!Will the REAL Bryan please come back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My poor bleeding ears!","review":"What the hell is this world coming to? At first listen I couldn't tell if he was male or female. I'm still not sure. I would compare this to Michael Bolton, but someone already did, so maybe Barbara Streisand?

He sure the hell aint no Robbie Fulks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"At first listen, I thought that this was Celine Dion. I kept waiting to hear Bryan start singing in French. I'm sure that this sounds great to all those heinous little creatures that enjoy Shania, Kenny Chesney, or the Backstreet Boys. I won't even get into how this isn't country. This is barely even music. I have to spit to get the bad taste out of my mouth.

I don't know what went wrong here but obviously something did; he lost his record contract after this release and fizzled out. It is such a shame because he is really a nice boy with talent that was amazing on his first three CDs. The material here is absolutely vapid and dull. \\"How Lucky I Am\\" was, unfortunately, NOT a good luck charm for White. Nothing on this CD could top \\"Someone Else's Star, Rebecca Lynn, That's Another Song, I'm Not Supposed to Love You Anymore, So Much for Pretending, Look at Me Now, The Right Place, or any of the cuts from his previous work. I just keep wondering what went wrong?? Bryan White is certainly capable of better offerings than this.

I just keep asking myself, \\"what happened, Bryan\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Total disagreement with other reviews...","review":"I have to say, I totally disagree with the reviews I have read on this CD... I had purchased Bryan's first three CD's and loved them, but I just thought that he had outdone himself on \\"How Lucky I Am\\"! I think it's a shame that country radio didn't embrace this one - it had several potential hits!\\"Everywhere I Turn\\" is similar to the formula he had used on his first three releases and has radio hit written all over it! Same goes for \\"The Stayin'\\", \\"That Good\\", \\"God Gave Me You\\" and \\"Love Me Like You Mean It\\" - all could have been contenders for the Country Top 40 properly marketed.All in all, I think this collection is totally overlooked and underappreciated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have CD","review":"This is a great Album and Bryan White shows his amazing singing ability with it!

But, you have to read all of them to get some closure. The main problem with Ms Stabenow's books are the inconsistencies with the characters across books. Their ages, appearance, history,etc. seem to be whatever Ms Stabenow thinks up at the time. I can't believe she couldn't find someone to review the books before published.Even with these inconsistencies, these are one of the few series set in Alaska. And it's interesting to read about living in Alaska."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"Could not get into this book and I tried twice. Sorry I found this not very interesting including the author notes"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Murder Mystery","review":"Fire and Ice by Dana Stabenow takes off fast and holds the pace pretty much throughout the story. Other than the isolation there's not much said about Alaska, but you get the feel of its vastness, the almost terrible beauty of the place, from the way the power of the landscape shapes everyday life. Trooper Campbell steps off the plane at his new assignment and into a murder. The story is littered with unusual characters that are the usual for small villages and their individual life styles are as important to the story as the murders and love stories they're involved in. Abundance and scarcity dominate everything. Life here is physically demanding and most of the work dangerous, when it's not boring. Add guns, knives, alcohol, money, love and racial ethnocentricities and you have all the right ingredients for a great murder mystery. A fast, fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable series","review":"I've read all the books in the Liam Campbell series and have enjoyed them all. Liam is a likable guy as well as his love interest, bush pilot, Wy and the romance in here is well done along with a solid mystery. Most of the negativity directed at the series has to do with the romance in the series and if you don't mind that aspect of it then I don't see why this series would disappoint. The series is left undone though but it isn't that bad. If you enjoy Julia Spencer-Fleming's work then you would (I think) enjoy this series as well. I like Dana Stabenow's sense of humor and her characters are well fleshed out. Give her a try and plus, this first book is free.

I love Kate Shugak but Liam Campbell is not to bright and a bit of a slime-bag. I base this on how he treated his wife and his mistress. I bought this because I am about to read the latest Kate story and Liam is included in that. I thought that it would be nice to know something about him but unless he improves over the course of his series (and I'll never know because I'm not going to read any more of them) then he isn't worth knowing. Stabenow should include the Shaman character in more books, he was very interesting and worth getting to know better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fire and Ice","review":"I really enjoy this author.

It hooked me to follow each of her publications.I recently reread FIRE AND ICE and it will remain on my shelves to be reread for a third time. It has all the elements of a good mystery, a tight plot, plenty of suspects, a talented but flawed protagonist and the writing power to transport the reader to another world.Liam Campbell is a state trooper who is running from guilt, tragedy, and a lost love. Wyanet Choinard is the lost love, who when Liam finds her is knee-deep in murder and other questionable activities.A marvelous place to begin the adventure in the Alaskan wilderness.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS, which are available in Kindel editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alaska chaos","review":"Liam found himself in a mess the second he got off the plane and it just kept getting worse.

Boy, was I mistaken! Kate's rough edge has been replaced by humorous eccentricity from the people Liam meets, but the same fast-paced plot and love of Alaska make this book a wonderful read in its own right. I laughed out loud in spots, and I hated to finish it--it was that good. There's no need to debate \\"better then\\" or \\"less than\\" Stanbanow's other series. This is a very good read, and I can hardly wait for the next one in this new series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Paler Copy of the Shugak Novels......... Reviewer: Thriller Lover, N.Y.C.","review":"I've read most of Stabenow's Kate Shugak novels, but never had any desire to read any of her other series, at least not until I got to know Jim Chopin. I like him, so I thought maybe I would like Liam Campbell as well. The big problem - Liam is basically Kate, in drag. He thinks like her, he speaks like her, and he solves his mystery the same way she would have. He even has the same way with people that she has, and the same relationship problems in his personal life. I would have liked this novel if I had never read any of Stabenow's books before, but Liam doesn't stack up next to Kate. I had the uneasy feeling as I was reading that all of this was faintly familiar, only a little skewed. Since Stabenow hasn't written a Liam novel after ' Better To Rest' in 2002, I'm assuming she came to the same conclusion. I'll stick to Kate from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Bleh\\" sums it up","review":"I read the other negative reviews before starting this book and found that many bemoaned the \\"romance-novel\\" bent of this particular book by Stabenow. Well, I love mysteries and enjoy a good romance, so I thought this book would be perfect. WRONG! A good romance novelist knows that what is left to the reader's imagination creates the truly juicy moments. Not Stabenow. She jumps right in with a woman \\"grabbing his c--k.\\" She succeeds in wringing out any romance and leaving only the paltry, crass coupling of an affair. In addition to this scene (which is truly difficult to get over), Liam is hardly a likable character. A married man cheating on his wife who is in a coma is hardly a sympathetic character. To be fair, as the novel progresses, details come to light that make him more likable. However, I never bought in and spent the book trying just to finish it instead of enjoying it. Stick to Stabenow's other series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"When I buy a mystery book, that's what I want. I don't mind a hint of romance but the best mystery writers only give you a hint. You can't get very far in this book before you realize that everyone is more concerned about their libido than anything else, and the author is very graphic. Either write a mystery novel or a romance novel; those of us who truly enjoy mystery novels would greatly appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a trashy Romance novel","review":"Did not care for this book, page 48 and already a pornographic sex descripition.

There are deaths that could be accidental or murder and being in a small town in rural Alaska, solving them by a demoted State Trooper, Liam Campbell, was not the easiest task. Characters abound and the setting of a close-knit fishing village, give you a real sense of what living in a community occupied by whites and local natives is really like. They are a tight lipped group and getting information that leads to finding the perpatrators and their motivation, is like pulling teeth. There are surprises, villans, love and romance, violence, blood and guts and of course, murder. All this makes for a high flying adventure that is hard to put down.

Bowie's best work was, in my and many peoples opinion, were the years he had Ronson as his guitarist. This cd along with honky dory, Ziggy, Pin-ups and Aladdin Sane were his best. After that, no more Ronson and nothing was ever as good. Bowie still had a lot of great stuff but something was always missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Bowie-The Man Who Sold the World","review":"Easily my favorite David Bowie album. Much like the band High Tide,\\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" combined dark and heavy music and lyrical imagery with a high degree of technical skill which would become prominent in progressive metal bands later on. Definitely not a conventional album for its time, but more a transition towards the sound that Bowie achieved success with on the excellent Ziggy Stardust album a few years later.

The bizarre subject matter and Bowie at his most affected were just too strange for me in my adolescence and time has not improved my opinion. I will admit to a certain fascination with the psychotic narrator of \\"Running Gun Blues\\" the quirky little interruption of \\"Black Country Rock\\" and the title cut and \\"The Width of a Circle\\" still have an exotic majesty, but the overall effect is an odd mixture of apocalyptic science fiction and pointlessness. Musically there are a lot of interesting choices but by the time Bowie gets done with his various methods of doing in humanity, I found myself bored by the repetitiveness of these themes. While I'm sure this Bowie incarnation has its defenders, I'm really glad he outgrew this stage rather quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tending to title track","review":"2 1/2Another overblown release in my ears.

I think he just made this album just to make an album. As a matter of fact, the album is so bad, when I bought it I threw it away after hearing every song. \\"After All\\" was stupid, and \\"The Width of a Circle\\" reeked. I hate long songs.

I've found several instances where formulas are incorrect. For example, calculating Cp is done using the formula (USL-LSL)/6s. The book makes a minor omission, leaving out the parentheses. There are misspellings. There is one incidence where the typesetter transposed a \\".\\" with a \\"/\\", making a fraction out of a decimal.These errors would not affect a certified, experienced practitioner aside from perhaps making him or her snort coffee onto a keyboard; however, if the person reading the book is not experienced or mathematically savvy (read most managers), the errors could affect outcome of a project adversely. I bought the book as a potential text for teaching managers about six-sigma concepts and basics. It may still work for that purpose; however, a book on a quality improvement method should not have this many, this magnitude of errors.I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Sigma Book","review":"I read all the bad reviews but since the book was published by McGraw-Hill, which bills itself as America's Leading Educational Publisher, I decided to try it anyway.

I just don't agree with that. After several such passages, I decided this book just isn't for me.

Around age 2, he was diagnosed with autism. Now, in no way am I implying that the book's suggestions somehow led to the diagnosis, but it was exactly the opposite of what I should have been doing with him during that crucial year, meaning engaging him as much as possible. After having a \\"neurotypical\\" child the second time around, I realized that most babies and toddlers WANT you to play with them constantly.

My work in New York and the former Soviet republics is focused on helping local populations participate more directly in their own well-being. TREES, in its own way, does the same thing, not just for parents, but for their babies. It says that we can participate in our lives, fully and with great fun and feeling, even as newborns, that brand-new babies aren't scary, and aren't incapacitated, either.

This is not the usual story of a famous player, but rather the journey of countless Midwest boys hoping for the coveted \\"starting five\\" honor before a loud standing-room only gymnasium crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of my youth","review":"Dr. Norman Jones has recreated the middle of the 20th century in Indiana with great accuracy. His memory is incredible. I had forgotten all of the high school and college basketball hysteria of those long ago days. He also reviews all of the big news stories of the day and the shame of our treatment of African-Americans. That nonsense is finally resolving in the 21st century. Even if you not a Hoosier, this book is a good read which is hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Belt for a 1999 Ram 1500 5.9l gas.","review":"Had purchased this belt to replace a old sqeeling belt.

The first one I got would not let \\"any\\" gas past regardless of the setting. I send it back, got another one (and this time a gauge) and it was off in its pressure setting about +3 PSI. So...I got one at a local store which was cheaper than shipping this one back, it works good (withing .5 PSI) and sofar after a year I have not had any issues.Guess 3 times the charm. My 2 cents, buy this locally, it may cost a few more bucks, but if you have to return it, its alot easier. And you car is not down while waiting for the new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a completed product","review":"I have a broke ankle with a short leg cast (from my toes to just below my knee). The cast cuts into my leg when walking which makes this unusable. It's not stable and it's heavy. They used a cheaper metal on this product to save money but it's about 10lbs. I'm very disappointed with the design. This was like a first shot attempt at a product. It should have been improved and redesigned to work with everyone. Probably great for sprained ankles but horrible with a cast. I'm 6' 180 and this is junk. I'd expect this to cost around $70 not $400. Takes 40 seconds to take on or off. I could see something similar being very effective. My advice.. Stick to crutches or fall and break your wrists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is made for a tall fat man","review":"I had designed a similar product, and was in the process of making it. Locomotion was such a problem with my broken tibia and fibula, I thought it would be faster to order the iwalkfree device. To my dismay, it is heavy and bulky, and very difficult to maneuver if you're a small (5'3\\") woman. The leg straps are impossible to cinch tight, because the padded strap base is pre-formed into a very large circular shape which makes it impossible to tighten over a thin (not even skinny) thigh. Therefore, the tip (foot) slid laterally back and forth, which caused me to topple sideways onto my hip, thank goodness with no further injury. The top rubber cap kept coming off, so I ordered a replacement. I approved the $5.00 quote for handling and on my credit card they, instead, charged $6.07. The interaction with the product/company wasn't a good experience for me while I was in a position of need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"This so called \\"hands free\\" crutch is a joke! I rented one online from a company called Goodbye Crutches.com. They had all these videos claiming it was stable, relatively easy to master and pain free. After trying it around the house I was glad it was 'hands free' because you'll need those to break your fall! It was incredibly unstable with no side to side support. The strapping belts need to be so tight it feels like they will cut off circulation. You could probably do just as well by taking a broomstick handle, a piece of flat pine, nails or duct tape(your choice) and a couple of old belts and get better results. I hate crutches but if this is the only alternative I say stick with them. With your leg sticking out behind you it's only a matter of time before you knock over Aunt Martha's prized Ming vase and get written out of her will. Total waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glorious Soundtrack","review":"Glory is perhaps the best soundtrack of all time. It is James Horner's best work that is for sure. It also stands as one of the best if not best sountrack of all time. From the great Call to Arms track all the way to the Closing Credits track this music is beautiful, stirring, and awesome. It has a lot of emotion, but it never drowns out the movie. Some of the best tracks are: Call to Arms, The Whipping, Burning the Town of Darien, The Year of Jubilee, Preparations for Battle, Charging Fort Wagner, and Closing Credits. And The Boys Choir of Harlem did some great work on this music as well. If you don't have this soundtrack I suggest you get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie... Disappointing sound track","review":"If you enjoy sound tracks with american history themes ( Legend of the Fall; Patriot; Last of the Mohicans; Dances with Wolves; etc) this one will be a real disappointment.While the movie was inspiring, the sound track is like listening to a never ending dirge. Little variance in theme or tempo, each cut is predictable... it sounds exactly like the one prior to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't belive it!","review":"How can everybody give this CD 5 stars? This can't be true! I bought It because this ridiculous reviews! After 2 listening I got a nightmare one night! I couldn't stop playing this music in my dreams ! It was horrible! This is not Horner's best. Horner's best is Breavehart (Thank you James for that!) - But not this - this music is annoying big time! - like Terminator 2 -"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Listen","review":"James Horner's score to Glory is one that ensured him a place in filmscoring for a very long time to come. His beautiful main theme captures all the emotion and pain of the Civil War Era. His use of the Boys Choir of Harlem is especailly good. A definate buy for soundtrack collectors"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotions from the Civil War","review":"Who can forget the single tear falling on Denzel's cheek, or the brave men of the 54th marching to their death? You can't if you listen to the soundtract. James Horner knows just when to use the violin during the heart wrenching beating of a runaway enlisted man who just wanted some shoes and in the same score when to use the power of the \\"kettle\\" drums and brass to musically illustrate determination, fear and bravery all at the same time while charging the enemy's bunker. The power of music can both highlight the actions in a movie while watching it and bring back every scene to memory when just listening to the soundtrack. I am so glad that the talent of James Horner has found its way to the movie screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Soundtrack","review":"This is one of James Horner's elegiac soundtracks underlying the ironies, tragedies, and ultimate heroism in the film about the first all-black regiment of Union soldiers during the American Civil War. There's a very haunting main motif! One can certainly hear shades of Horner's music for other films; most notably Field of Dreams and A Beautiful Mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what music was meant to do...","review":"What is the task of a composer? It is to evoke emotion in the listener. Never have I discovered a score that haunts and inspires me more than this CD. The Harlem Boys' Choir floats through the room and you begin to feel again. If you haven't heard this soundtrack or seen the movie in which it was conceived, you are depriving yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars doesn't do it justice.","review":"I am a huge fan of movie soundtracks. I've listened to them my entire life, before any other form of music. This score stands out from all the others I have ever heard in my life. James Horner deserved the Oscar he got, but not for Titanic. Don't get me wrong, Titanic was good, but you have to admit that the Oscar was for the popularity of My Heart Will Go On. I see his Oscar as one for Glory, just delayed by 9 years. I am a huge fan of John Williams, but this one score by Horner is equal to any of Williams' Oscar winning performaces. Horner's use of drums and the fifes are just as powerful as Williams' violin solos by the legendary Itzak Perlman in Schindler's List. If you want to be emotionally moved by a piece of music, you won't find a better cd than the Glory soundtrack by James Horner. Other suggestions: Appollo 13 by Horner, Hook and Nixon by Williams, Star Trek First Contact by Jerry Goldsmith."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Horner's best movie soundtrack","review":"This CD is filled with beautiful music.It is very moving.

If you own the soundracks to Braveheart, The Last of the Mohicans and Empire of the Sun, then this is a CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST!","review":"This is an excellent soundtrack, one which surpasses even Titanic in greatness. Along with \\"The Land Before Time\\", and \\"The Rocketeer\\", it is part of a his trifecta of brilliance that he composed back before he was as well known and recognized. There are so many reasons why this is so good, but they have all been touched on already in reviews. But let me say this: it is a truly glorious soundtrack indeed, full of beautiful music. It is well worth whatever you pay for it, especially if you've already shelled out the dough for the good, but not as good, Titanic."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest scores of all-time!","review":"To say that this album is excellent does not do it enough justice in my opinion.

I was enthralled with the music from the start. I was always a big fan of soundtracks, having several in my collection already, so I was very excited when I bought the CD. I have had that same CD for years and to this day, it is one of the most beautiful, compelling, heart-wrenching pieces of music I have ever heard. Granted, TITANIC was extremely well done, but GLORY is James Horner's \\"glory.\\" He outdoes himself with the use of choral pieces from the Harlem Boys Choir and incorporating those voices with brass horns. He takes us back in time to the Civil War with seamless effort. This soundtrack stands on its own as a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a very colorful piece","review":"It is a great piece of music. Better than Gettysburg. Beautifully arranged.

It enhances the movie well, and is a great listen on its own. Two of its tracks are frequently used in movie previews, so you'll probably recognize \\"Charging Fort Wagner\\" and \\"Closing Credits.\\" If you've been looking for that preview music that haunts you, this is it!

The album was released by Deram in 1970 and the band pretty much called it quits after that.As for the music, it's good but not great; they play a mixture of blues, country, folk, rock and even some jazz. A lot have likened their sound to the Band and Traffic, and they do have elements of these bands, but not to the extent that fans of these bands would hope for. Lead singer Johny Duhan has a good but raw voice and Gary Moore, who was only 17, doesn't quite have his blues-guitar hero chops yet, but he does play a very servicable lead. It's good late-sixties, \\"homespun\\" Rock, that while not necessarily essential to your collection, is still a good pick up.Some of the highlights are \\"Maybe,\\" \\"Susan of the Country\\" and \\"Fourthskin Blues.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Just perfect","review":"I love dried fruit, and these apricots are some of the best I have ever had.

Well my initial feeling was correct (although I made myself sit through the whole thing) To begin with the audio is terribly glitchy which in it self makes the movie almost unwatchable. If that doesn't get you the acting and script will, I use acting very liberally because it seems like the actors are uncomfortable reading lines off cue cards. The script is for lack of a better word, bad. I understand it is not a documentary and should not expect many views of the trail it's self but throw a dog at least one bone. All in all, I would say avoid this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for","review":"Its just what it is a story about a young girl wanting to get out and discover herself.

A few lofty stories in this massive anthology rise above the others, Hornblower in a curious and dangerous adventure with stranded French sailors, Drinkwater coming to the rescue and with an introduction by the grand master himself, Alexander Kent.

For almost $70, I expected a high quality product even if it was sterling silver and CZs.Still, I wore the ring out and got quite a few compliments on it so would have been inclined to give a more positive rating if one of the smaller fake sapphires didn't fall out THE FIRST DAY I wore the ring.

Continuing the foray into blues that he began with '94's \\"Dodgin' the Dirt\\", the (no longer) Fat Man rips out some standard blues, some new blues, and his trademark riffs and tremolos in this tight, well-produced offering. Old fans will appreciate West's new versions of two signature songs: \\"Stormy Monday\\" (a blues-rock live jam staple from his Mountain days) done in a more traditional-blues, gravelly-voiced style, and Otis Redding's \\"Respect\\" which was one of West's first singles with The Vagrants in the 60's.

The three men share a house and a tangled web of lies and manipulations, brutality and tenderness--in unlikely communion with each other.

It seems as if the source of these DVDs were really bad VHS tapes. And to add insult to injury, Passport has this bad habit of putting text in the lower right hand corner throughout their DVD films. In these, \\"Boys of the Bowery - The East Side Kids\\" appears in light lettering throughout the film, which is very distracting.

It's a shame because thses guys are very talented, with good voices, but it's all lost in a bunch of nothing and just when you are ready to throw the CD away, here comes \\"The Road To Damascus\\".

And his face is quirky. This is a perfectly calibrated movie so it's not to be missed and I didn't want this chewy movie to end. Laraine Day gets progressively more attractive as the movie goes along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read...for cat people only","review":"If there were a Bible for cats, this book would be included. Cat lovers basically know everything that's in this book, before reading the first page. But can too much be said about man's noblest companion? The dust jacket states this is about those \\"with obsessive devotion to their pets,\\" i.e., cats. The jacket designer may be good at his/her craft, but it strikes me as looking down at the reader. During my many years with the defense community, in and out of uniform, rarely have I experienced friction with fellow cat lovers. Fortunately I've worked mostly with the cream of the profession. Those I don't get along with, well, no self-respecting cat would associate with them, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are there no editors?","review":"While this short book is a pleasant enough companion for a long soak in the tub, it would have been greatly improved by some decent editing. Grammatical errors, repetition of anecdotes, and constant references to the authors' wealth abound. Since Michael Korda is editor-in-chief at Simon & Schuster, such lapses are appalling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The confusing, enchanting, love affair between cats and people.","review":"For me, this book caught me by the cover art, showing a couple together with their cats on the sofa watching the tv. It usually doesn't take much for me to get sucked in by things that involve cats, and I was pretty much prepared for a so-so read. Instead, I got a love story, of a couple and their ongoing houseful of cats, talking about how they acquired them, their tales and foibles, and the very unique personalities. It's charming, well-written and I was left with the impression that I had been sitting and listening to the Korda's talk about their feline companions. On a personal note, the setting of these stories -- the Dutchess County region of New York, also made the story come alive as I know quite a few of the places that are mentioned. The drawings scattered throughout the book are utterly charming, and will bring a smile to your face. Perfect stocking stuffer for the cat lover that you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaker is excellent","review":"Nice sounding speakers. You cannot tell the difference between the expensive brands and this one. I am using them as real speakers in my surround system and the sound is incredible. It has a deep pure bass and crisp highs. Thanks Amazon for carrying such an excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, Easy, Great Sound","review":"These speakers are fantastic, especially for the $$. They are extremely easy to install, whether you are installing in new construction or existing walls, the simply pop right in. Spring-loaded clamp-style pins make attaching the speaker cable quick and easy, and also provide the best possible connection. The sound that these speakers produce is well balanced, not too much high or low, and the speaker heads swivel (a couple degrees in each direction) so that they can be pointed to the focus of the room. All-in-all a worthwhile investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Party time","review":"Awesome, installed these outside in the roof of my patio. Best pool sound system ever.

Her faith is strong, clear, and down-to-earth, and her mesmerizing images will sustain you long after you read them. This is one holy, healthy woman, and she draws the reader into her sacred space with humor, grace, and intelligence.

It is fairly short, 100 pages, in fact it is more of a glorified pamphlet than a book but still a great read.I'm finding that I am moving through it very slowly because I stop and think and pray and re-read so many parts of this book.

I'm accustomed to books giving you the answers as you lazily read along. This one is completely different. This is a guided workbook into your soul. It tackles your childhood, where you got your expectations from, who you have been at different times and in different circumstances of your life, what you want, what you think you want, why you think you want what you think you want... This book has some reading, but it's mainly guided exercises. I would highly recommend having a specific notebook for \\"20 Something\\" and all the activities. The results are amazing and far reaching and requires complete honesty and unveiling. It clarifies who you are and what you want for all aspects of your life: career, family and personal relationships.

You don't need to make the same error. This game takes five hours to beat, is senseless, and has a ridiculous amount of bugs. Don't support games of this poor calibre, even if you see them in bargain bins.

Just goes to show you that you shouldn't doubt yourself. This game has good graphics, but the level design and overall flow of the game is very amateurish at best. When you get to the end of a level the screen freezes, turns purple then you get a loading screen. Needless to say its a very abrupt transition.Wait for this game to get to the bargan bin before shelling out the money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ready For Primetime","review":"Game as released was quirky--and then I noticed that there was a 40mb patch that you had to go to GameSpy Fileplanet to download where you had to wait over an hour just for your turn at the download area to be able to download that monster patch--that is unless you want to subscribe to Fileplanet for $6.95 per month to be able to access a high speed download area (hmmm, that seems curious)So after spending four hours getting the patch....The graphics are fair, but certainly not the best that's out there. Don't buy this one for children. The language used in the game has been written specifically for adults and lends nothing to the storyline. It seems that XICAT rushed to get this one out by Christmas 2002, because this didn't look like what was orginally promised.

And that impression was not a personal sensation. It was shared at least for fifty persons, who were present that unforgettable evening.I would like to emphasize all the recordings of Vegh are pure gold. Because his musicality was supported by an inner commitment that seemed to emerge from the deepest from his spirit and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"Dead Until Dark isn't your average vampire book. It's pure fun!Sookie Stackhouse finds herself drawn into a world of vampires because of her \\"curse,\\" telepathy. Harris writes Sookie skillfully as a smalltown girl with a talent for getting into trouble. I found myself laughing so hard at times that I had to put the book down, but it still contained the perfect amount of action to keep the reader involved. The characters are fun and believable, the storyline is fun and fast-paced, the setting is fun... the pattern should be obvious here. Anyone who likes horror, mystery, or fantasy novels will love Dead Until Dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!!!!","review":"When I first checked it out Dead Until Dark at the library, for some reason, I couldn't get into it. But I gave it another chance and I'm glad I did. It has a mix of romance and suspense. Sookie Stackhouse is a great gal and Bill her vampire lover is the best. The story and characters were very interesting and it all takes place in a small town. Usually lots of vampire stories take place in big urban cities, but not Dead Until Dark. Bon Temps, Louisiana is as small as you can get. lol! I read this book in one day, and am currently rereading it. I just ordered my own copy here off of amazon, so that I can return the copy that I'm reading to the library, before I ruin it. lol! I love vampire fiction, especially contemporary/modern day ones. Read this book and you'll love it. Charlaine Harris is a wonderful writer. I can't wait till April for Living Dead in Dallas--another Sookie story. I hope Bill is in this one. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sookie Who?","review":"Yes, I somehow managed to make it through the last five years without running into Sookie. But, having noticed that literally everyone I know has read the books, I decided it was time to join the club.I was generally pleased. Is it great literature? No. But, when it comes down to it, I generally don't like great literature. I like good stories with compelling characters, snappy dialogue, and lots of action. Dead Until Dark delivered on all three.Could the story have been tighter? Sure.Am I less than impressed with the immediate love of Bill and Sookie? Yes, but unlike the case of a certain emo, teen, dark-haired vampire lover, I at least get why Sookie loves Bill. I'm a tad fuzzy on why Bill loves Sookie, beyond the fact that the story requires it, and for this level of story, I think that's fine.Book two is on my library queue, and I am awaiting it eagerly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to Read","review":"If you can stand to not take yourself seriously and you enjoy a good romp through a book, then the Southern Vampire Mysteries are for you. I've explained it to friends as a trashy romance novel thats fun to read. AND, if you are a True Blood fan, its even more fun to get backstory about details that are left out on-screen. Its a fast and easy read so even if its not for you, it goes quickly. As for me, I plan on reading every one in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Series for my Kindle","review":"I read this 1st book really fast and handed it down to the rest of the family who also enjoyed it very much. This was purchased before I got my Kindle but now when I finish the next in the series, I just click to purchase the next book. Love this since it is the kind of book you cannot put down easily and having the next book available immediately is a joy. Sookie is charming and I love her gift. Bubba is sooo strange a vampire and you will be amazed when you find out who he really is. Book 3 is probably the best in the series and I loved the ending. As you can see I am being very vague kuz I do not want to give anything away but this is not a stupid bloody vampire book and it really holds your interest with Sookie reading minds, werewolves, ancient gods, shapeshifters who change to dogs, bats and other things and very funny in parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a vampire novel that's not x-rated.","review":"Charlaine Harris does a wonderful job of creating a new present day world full of supernatural beings including one of my favorites, vampires. Sookie's charasmatic and sarcastic attitude make for a wonderful light heartedness to the storyline. If you're looking for this to be a similiar representation of the highly acclaimed \\"TrueBlood\\", well you might be dissappointed. The wonderfully twisted TV show is loosely based on the actual facts but is a great depiction of the overall plot.

None of the characters were well developed and the sex scenes were strange and uninteresting. There were never any clues as to \\"whodunit\\" - the ending was unremarkable and set the stage for a sequel (which I will not be reading).

OK, vampires aren't \\"real\\" but I happen to dislike books in the fantasy/horror genre that don't at least provide a believable explanation for what I'm asked to accept. Ms. Harris has done that and more. I also like the fact that her vampires are not unusually glamorous or larger than life - if average people become vampires why can't they be average vampires? Anyway, I highly recommend this book and look forward to more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This book was a huge disappointment for me. Maybe it was because of the fact that I had seen TV series first. I was really hopping that book would be better than TV version. But all I got was one fooolish, illogical and getting-on-my-nerves main character Sookie. Sometimes I truly hated her stupid behaviour and it ruined the whole book for me.Moreover, since I watched TV version before, I knew from the begging who the villain was. And this was a huge turn-off for me. So I would REALLY recommend everyone to read the book first before you watch TV series. You will avoid the disappointment and bitterness which I felt when reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped!!!","review":"I really didn't see what the hype was about this book. It was recomended to me by a friend, and so when I was at a used book store, I decided to buy it. I really wish I hadn't and instead had bought another book worth reading. I thought the storyline was boring and almost like she tried to fit too many events in just one book! I don't know how Harris has written eight more books in the series. To make matters worse, I thought the characters were really underdeveloped, and I didn't feel like any of them even made an impression on me. Bill was just...cold throughout the whole book, and Sookie was just, well, stupid! I thought this whole book was just pointless, and too bad for me I bought the second one. It was just the typical \\"girl falls in love with a vampire\\" story, but with way too much sex. I mean Sookie even refers to him as \\"my vampire\\" and \\"my vampire boyfriend\\". I honestly would not read this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I was very much into the author's take on vampires.

I was wrong. I have read the first 4 books of the Sookie Stackhouse novels and I can say it doesn't get better. Sookie is a cry baby who makes out with every guy she meets, and if she isn't making out with them, she is getting physically assaulted. Her and Bella Swan would be great friends. All of the characters are one dimensional and the storylines aren't really thrilling at all. I feel that the show took the concept from the books and really improved upon it. These books are not fleshed out and make Charlaine Harris look like an amateur."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"I have to say the relationship between bill and sookie was not developed at all. I had a hard time buying their \\"love.\\" Page one they meet, page two they fall in \\"love\\" and page three they are hooking up; it was just WAY too fast.

Wrong. No. I honestly don't understand the positive reviews this book is getting because I thought it read like a cheesy romance novel. The first couple chapters were okay, but as Sookie became more and more reliant on her vampire lover, any shred of independence and quick thinking present in her character were demolished.If you're into romance novels, read this. If, like me, you'd rather read about star-crossed lovers that don't make you want to barf, pick up pride and prejudice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super market romance book, with vampires","review":"Don't buy the collection without trying the first one out. I LOVE the hbo show true blood. And a friend told me these books were great. So I wisely only bought the first to test it out. Boy was that a great call. This is possibly some of the worst writing I have ever read. Every sentence starts with I, She goes on an on describing hair, shoes, and cloths. It honestly reads like a goth high school girl, with a poor education wrote this. The only thing I got out of this book was a new found respect for the creators of the hbo show. They must really be talented to turn this crappy book into such television gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was given this book by a friend. She said to read it because now that I had finished reading the Twilight books, it was another vampire series I would enjoy. I put it on a shelf because at the time I was busy reading other books. Then recently my book club picked this book to read. The girl who choose it spoke so highly of it. The reviews online seemed so positive, and hey, it was used to create a television show. So it must be good?This weekend I dusted it off and began. The story is somewhat compelling at points, but the author has you all over the place and leaves some plot lines dangling. It borders the \\"Trashy Romance\\" type novel and doesn't seem to have much depth. This is not a series I will continue reading. The story did nothing to compel me to continue reading it. In fact, if it weren't for the book club, I would have put this book down after the first sexual vampire account. This book is all hype and I was extremely disappointed in reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I'm more than 3/4 through with the book and I can barely bring myself to finish it. It's not funny. It's not exciting. It hasn't drawn me in. I don't care about the characters (could be that with the True Blood trailers plastered all over TV, I keep picturing the gap-toothed heroine, who I don't particularly care for).I'm fighting to finish the book. I doubt I'll continue the series.What was with Sookie doubling over with laughter after she found her grandmother dead...would you have even noticed Bill's shirt if you found your grandmother murdered? What's with Sookie thinking she'll read Sam sometime, when she catches him off guard...then telling Bill she's not able to read him? What's with all the slutty trailer trash in that town? Sorry to those of you that are fans, but I'm just not getting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent idea, terrible writing","review":"Boy, do I despise getting my hopes up. There was so much hype and talk about this series that I was absolutely sure I'd like it. So, what did my dumb-ass self do? Bought the first NINE books. *bashes face into keyboard*Aside from the obviously novice prose, there were so many things that were absolutely awful and wrong with this book that I don't even know where to start.Brace yourself, this is going to be long. If you liked this book, you should probably stop reading now.So, I guess I'll tackle Sookie herself first. I couldn't stand her....To see the rest of this review and other book reviews by me, see my blog at geobobspinelli[dot]blogspot[dot]com"},{"rating":"2","title":"highly addictive!","review":"A friend of mine bought mebthe entire series because she liked them so much, Harris is amazing at keeping you dying to read the next page! After you read this book you'll want to read the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my usual genre and to my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed it!","review":"I don't usually read novels that involve the supernatural or sci-fi, but tried this one because 'Dead Until Dark' was recommended to me, and I was looking for some new authors to read. (This was a Kindle edition with ~no~ spelling errors.) I was leery of the vampire theme and element, but plowed on into it. Much to my delight, I was able to suspend disbelief and thoroughly enjoy this book. It is well written and held my interest on every page. There is an subtle element of humor to it on the part of the main character, at times, with her narrative which was most enjoyable. I will be buying the second book (Kindle edition) in the series, and hope it delivers as well as this one did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always nice to discover a new series","review":"In a frequent recreational reader life, she frequently finishes an enjoyable series of novels only to have to a) wait until the author writes another (c'mon, Sue Grafton!) or, since the author has departed our midst (Dorothy Sayers, Tony Hillerman) sigh and wish for what can never be. How nice to stumble across a series that is fun and exciting to read. Sookie Stackhouse novels fill the bill admirably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light reading","review":"I enjoyed reading Charlaine Harris's \\"Dead Until Dark\\", although it is not my favorite book. Easy to read, perfect for airplane or waiting in line type of reading. I am thinking about getting the second book, and see how it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Funny and Funny","review":"Just a great read. I actually laughed out loud. I loved the authors ability to describe characters and scenes.

Before I knew it I was finished. I would highly recommend this book. All the town's people are interesting and entertaining. An Sookie is a very fun character to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Until Dark Review","review":"Wow, What can I say I truly enjoy this seris and can't wait to read the whole Sookie Stackhouse Novels. Well written can really see the story within your head.I just wished I would have found these books sooner. Fantastic mix of romance, horror, humourous and playfulness. Would recommend anyone to read these Seris of books.Nicole Eglinger"},{"rating":"2","title":"dead until dark the southern vampire mysteries","review":"Wow what a book!!!! Didn't want to put it down. Was turned on to the books by HBO and their new series \\"True Blood\\". The series is awesome and the book was the same. I recommend it as a must read for any vampire enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEAD UNTIL DARK","review":"I've never seen the show on HBO, but after reading this first book in the series I immediately went out and bought the rest of the Sookie Stackhouse series. I've become a fan and can't wait for the DVD of the first season to come out. I loved all the books, they are easy reads that you can pick up and put down as needed, however, you don't want to put them down. When your through with the story it's like missing a group of friends until the next book comes along. I highly recommend this series. P.S. Harris writes a hot love scene without being embarassing. I loved loved loved this whole series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A light, fast, fun read.","review":"I bought this book after falling in love with True Blood.The book is written in narrative from Sookie's point of view. Its a good read if you are a fan of the show, and there are enough differences to keep you going. The story telling isn't as rich in the book, these books might not do it for you if you are looking for something that compares to Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. But Dead Until Dark is plenty of fun.The book is good enough that as soon as I put down the first book and ordered the box set!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain Ole Fun!","review":"Quirky, small-town characters collide with the world of the vampire. Sookie is a charming, fallible, and extraordinary likable heroine. Bill, Eric, and Pam radiate all that we've ever found sexy about the \\"pulseless.\\" Add a cast of rich minor characters and you've got a winner of a series. I'm hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Start To A Series","review":"This is a good start to a series. Charlaine Harris does an excellent job of setting up her world and giving you the backgrounds of all the characters. She gives you enough to get you totally interested and wanting to learn more. There's pretty good interplay and interaction between the main characters to get you to care. I enjoyed how Ms. Harris introduced politics and how society views vampires into her story. I bet it plays a bigger part later in the series. I enjoyed how the twists and turns of the story made sense and furthered the progress of the storyline. Too many first books in the series use twists to shock the reader but don't make sense for the future books. I haven't seen the series on HBO, Tru Blood but have heard that it closely follows the books. So far I recommend this book to anyone looking for a paranormal book with a slightly different outlook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disabled Text to Speech? Really?","review":"I guess I am not hip to the new thing that authors are doing by disabling the text to speech feature...I drive many hours in my car and the only way I can get through most books is with that feature. I will probably never read this book after spending 9.99 on it because I have no intentions now of buying the rest of the series.Shame on you Charlaine Harris for taking that away from people who really enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll stick with Anita...","review":"After listening to and enjoying Charlaine Harris's Grave Sights on audiotape, I headed to my library to check out her other books. I'd read good reviews here of the Sookie Stackhouse Southern Vampire series, so I began with Dead Until Dark. I must say that I found this book's prose stilted and the dialogue and plot somewhat juvenile. I found Sookie and her vampire boyfriend, Bill to be shallow characters and the plot vapid compared to those of Harper Connelly and her brother, Tolliver in Grave Sights. In the future, if I want to read about vampires I'll stick with Laurell Hamilton's edgy and well written Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much suspense","review":"I dont have much time to read so a book really has to suck me in or i get bored. I tried this series because it had lots of great reviews. It was one of those boring romance books that didnt have much of a suspense plot to keep me entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im hooked","review":"This book is just great! Its suspenseful keeps you on the edge of your seat trying to think of what the heck is gonna happen next!FYI Im pretty sure you dont want a young young girl to read the book it does have alot of sexual things in it. Not like a porno or anything but its graphic enough to matter if your kids like probably under 16 would be my guess but kids are sexually active alot younger these days.. I know i know people think \\"oh not my baby\\" but be realistic!! This book was great i just love authors individual interpretations of supernatural things like vampires and such.. I will be reading the whole series for sure"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The characters are not developed well and it's hard to enjoy the character Sookie when she is so one dimensional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Convincing Characters","review":"The concept of the novel had potential however; I just didn't find the characters to be very credible. For example, the reader learns immediately that Sookie (the main character) has a \\"disability\\"; she is able to \\"hear\\" the thoughts of others. She has had this disablilty her whole life and, over time, has learned to block some of the \\"noise\\" out. We also find out that Sookie had a very sad childhood. She lost both of her parents when she was young and she was molested by a family member.Nonetheless, Sookie comes accross as a naive, trusting, and optimistic person. I just think that someone with her life experience would be more cynical and disillusioned. In my opinion, the story would have been more believable if the main character had a darker outlook on the world. She was just too darn nice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor read","review":"Sorry to all the Charlaine Harris fans out there, but this book is horrible. I read the book after True Blood started airing so that I could get some good background before delving into the series, but this book has turned me off of both. The main character, Sookie, is silly and vapid. She does not react in a believable way to anything, and I found it extremely hard to believe that every guy she meets is in love with her at first sight. Bill, her main love interest, is bland and uninteresting, and the love scenes between the two that litter the book seemed redundant and cheap. I certainly wasn't expecting a bad romance novel when I picked this up. But the worst part is the horrendous writing with zero character development, unless you count describing hair styles and changes of clothes. I highly doubt this book would have been published if vampires weren't the current rage, and I get the distinct feeling that Ms. Harris wishes she were Sookie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead until Dark is great","review":"Charlaine Harris has moved her considerable skill with mystery novels into the fantasy genre with total success. I have now read four of the novels in the Sookie Stackhouse series and loved them all. These novels are the take off point for the HBO series \\"True Blood\\". I think the original novels are much better than the TV series (which I am now watching anyway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lame ending; overall a nice read","review":"Although the ending was pretty lame, overall the reading was good for the most part. I learnt a lot about vampires and enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know how to rate this book.","review":"Good grief...I'm not sure how to rate this book. I found Ms. Harris prose very annoying...who using ( ) to clarify the main character's thoughts??? I'm convinced now that even I could write a book!! But I found the characters likable and the concept of the story was interesting even if her way of telling it got on my nerves. By the end of the book I became use to her writing style...even though I still didn't particularly like it. Of course now I find myself wondering what happens to Sookie next...so yes I broke down and bought the next book! YIKES! So I give it 2 stars...maybe the next book will be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a tad too messy.","review":"I started reading this with a completly open mind to a new writer and a new style, but I really just could not get into this book. It felt rushed, dry and a little messy.The plot was moving along so fast I could not keep up with it. The characters weren't introduced well and I didn't really feel anything for them. The romance did not seem real to me and the sex scenes were about as dry as the characters themselves. The story bounced around so much I really just could not get myself sucked into it.Overall I certainly did not care for this book, but in no way am I saying this to disrespect the writer. I have only the utmost respect for any author, no matter what I think about the book. And this in no way turns me off from reading one of her other books if one catches my eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only So-So","review":"As several others have pointed out this book is very derivative of Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake series. While Charlaine Harris has enough of her own \\"voice\\" here 75% of the book could have been Anita Blake. And do all Vampire girlfriends have to be short & busty?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"No build up to climax...what was the climax? Characters were not interesting...lack of development.

After reading this book I couldn't wait to get my hands on the second one. I read the whole series in a week. My favorite characters are Sookie and Eric. I look forward to seeing how these characters develop. If you are looking to escape reality for a little while this is a great series to get hooked on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely have to read!","review":"Absolutely have to read!This book is the one you absolutely have to read! I am not a reader, and I am re-reading this book second time right now. I started to watch \\"True Blood\\" on HBO, and couldn't wait for next episode for whole week, so I decided that I'll read. I was afraid that that will be difficult for me, because the English is the third language for me, but this book is written easy to read have a lot of action, mystery and love in very realistic form. After I finish reading first book, I started next until I finished all 8 books and now can't wait to the 9-th book, which will be publishing in May 2009. I hope one day that book will be translated to other languages as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original & Compelling Romance","review":"The first novel in the series is very promising. The protagonist is an eccentric psychic with a complicated family history (which I hope we learn more about in the later novels.) The plot is set in a small town in Louisiana with an array of interesting minor characters. The sense of place adds richness to the novel. The romance is hot. It's a cliche, but I just could not put this novel down. The author's forceful writing and plotting kept it flying. The males attracted to Sookie offer her quite a variety to choose from. The novel has quite the body count & I wouldn't read it right before bed, but other than that, I can't think of any downside. I think romance fans who wouldn't consider novels about vampires or other supernatural elements should give it a try. Very well written!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book/Great HBO series","review":"Save yourself some time and rent the \\"True Blood\\" DVDs. The HBO series, while based loosely on the novel, is so much better, so much more fun, so much more in-depth, and so much more creative than the book. This could truly be one of the worst novels I have ever read; the writing was sophomoric, boring and pathetic. The storyline in the book regarding vampire Bubba's true identity is easily the most ridiculous storyline I have ever read in any novel. It's not a surprise that Mr. Ball decided to omit that storyline in the HBO series. I won't waste my time reading any other books by this author - ugh! *** Update, my friend had the second book, and i read it out of desperation because there were no other books to read at his lake house . . . it was worse than the first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I lost IQ points after reading this book.","review":"Like other reviewers I had high hopes and really wanted to enjoy this series. However it is so poorly written that was impossible. The characters are underdeveloped to the extreme, we never know what's going on in their heads which made me so confused as to what was going on the majority of the time. It is essentially a poorly written smut novel so if that is your thing then have fun but otherwise don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I was ready to love this book. I bought it off the recommendations read on Amazon and began reading it with great anticipation. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed and actually ended up throwing the novel away when done. (I at least finished it--hoping it would be improve or have a fantastic ending) My main problem? It's definitely an \\"ADULT\\" novel--NC-17 rating at best if it was made into a movie due to the crude sexual and S&M scenes (plus violence, language, etc.) Not a book I would recommend to a friend, especially those under age. I wasn't expecting it to be \\"erotic\\" and felt it cheapened the characters and novel. The storyline was decent but with all \\"adult\\" crud mixed in, it ruined it for me. I don't have time in my life to read trashy novels. I was looking for a great story line, interesting characters, etc. I wish I had been warned on Amazon in the reviews. Fine if other folks want to read it but I would never had purchased it if I have know it was an \\"adult\\" novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mix Harlequin romances with Twilight...","review":"And you get this novel. Some reviews called this book funny, but the only amusing part was laughing at the author, not with her. The dialogue is strained at best and the plot line is very transparent. I wouldn't even recommend this as a popcorn book, I'm afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"This series drew me in from page one. The multiple layers in the writing and the multitude of personalities seen in the array of characters is thoroughly entertaining. Once you pick up the first book, you will want to read the entire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Have Found a New Addiciton - Sookie Stackhouse","review":"What a delight!!! This was one of the books offered as something I may like to read. I kept coming back to the description and after I read some of the reviews I purchased the book. From the beginning I was pulled in to this story. Written with wit and fun, a great story line, and imbued with enough of the \\"unknown\\" to lure the reader in--and I was hooked. Very entertaining and a wonderful approach to the life of Sookie Stackhouse and the world in which she lives. Each chapter unfolds like a gift. If the description of this book intrigues you, get it! It is always exciting finding an author you like--I usually end up getting every book by a newly discovered author -- I plan to read all the books about Sookie Stackhouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best book ever","review":"Dead Until Dark is one of the best books i have ever read. once i started reading it i could not put it down.I love the sookie character in the book it almost makes me wish that i were sookie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampires from a original point of view","review":"Vampire story under a original point of view... quick to read. I enjoy reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"It might have been a mistake to read this book after reading the Anita Blake series. I bought all three Charlaine Harris books and read them all in a row. I was more than a little disappointed. Some people may have found the books amusing....I didn't. I enjoy a good vampire book and found these books silly and well.........boring. Pretty much a waste of time. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's no Twilight or Interview...","review":"While this book is written on about a 7th grade level, the subject matter is mature. The writing was dull, the characters shallow and at times I found myself thinking \\"Why am I still reading this?\\" Because I try to always finish a book when I start it, I pushed myself through hoping it would get better, but alas, it only got worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring as watching paint dry but deserves a pass","review":"I could care less if this book was based of the greatest TV show known to man. Dead Until Dark is probably the most boring book I've ever read. I don't know if its because I knew what would happen because of True Blood but one thing that can't be excused was the awkward writing. VERY awkward. That and the filler scenes are what pretty much turned me off on the book. I strongly believe that if a scene does not or will not contribute to the novel, then or later, it should be nixed. This is the same problem I had with Stephanie Meyer's Twilight, except I gave her's a four because the writing was really good.This is just my really biased opinion, but I do recommend you give this book a big pass because as you read on they get MUCH better and much MUCH more exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead until Dark","review":"Excellent book! Great condition! I didn't really think it was my type...but now I want to read the rest in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Bad","review":"Having seen a few episodes of HBO's \\"True Blood,\\" I was curious to read the books that inspired the series. I was extremely disappointed in this book, though. Harris' dialogue is painfully awful, and her writing is very amateurish. Her tendency to describe every little thing Sookie does/thinks is unnecessary and one of the biggest no-no's in fiction writing.I like the idea of the plot and the characters, but Harris' writing style is simply too bad for me to continue reading the series. I'm glad the writers of the show have taken their liberties with the dialogue, otherwise I'm sure the show would have been cancelled by now."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Blood Addict!","review":"I love HBO for introducing me to the world of Sookie Stackhouse. I find the book series very entertaining with the same dark humor. The HBO series has done great staying with the original story line & its portrayal of the characters, and although the book series in only from Sookie's point of view, I'm finding that I enjoy the books much better than the show (and I'm a huge fan of the show!).If you are considering getting \\"sucked\\" into the book series after becoming addicted to the HBO series, I recommended it, you won't be let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected...","review":"After watching True Blood on HBO I decided to purchase the Sookie Stackhouse novels to read. This is the first book in the series and I was very disappointed. The author is a very immature writer with poor characterizations and stereotypes galore. Most of her characters are not fleshed out and those who are well developed are unpleasant to say the least. I did not like Sookie in True Blood but I downright hated her in this book. She uses her telepathy to make excuses as to why her life sucks and she is, at times, horribly nasty to the people who care about her. She blames her vampire lover Bill for things he has no control over and she runs hot and cold about their relationship. I got the distinct impression that this book was written by a ten year old and I have no idea how it got published and I will never understand how it got so popular. I will continue watching True Blood but I am done reading any books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected.","review":"I picked up these books on recommendation from this site and people who had read books by Laurell K. Hamilton. After finishing the first book, I found myself disappointed.I feel that the storyline jumped around a lot with no good reason. Many times it felt like Sookie was making decisions based on the fact that the writer had to keep the story going instead of what Sookie might actually do. Additionally, perhaps that is what Sookie would do and the character development in the book was the thing that was lacking.The writing style was difficult to read at times, especially during the dialogue.Overall the book was ok: the story was ok, the writing was ok and the characters were ok. Unfortunately I was expecting something better than ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Series","review":"Definitely not the same as the show but I don't feel like it was any less entertaining.

I looked forward to the next book in the series to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope It Picks Up","review":"I have read a lot of vampire novels. As a matter of fact I make a point to read everything that comes out. I found the characters to be flat in particular the main character Sookie Stackhouse (who is suppose to have the ability to read people's minds). All of the characters have no real life. I could care less who lived or died and there was no draw to keep reading. The sex in the book was okay - but not fantastic. The main premise of the book is that vampires are out in the open; this made the story a bit far fetched for me. And also made it less mysterious. I've heard that if you watch the show the books get better. I'll try this before reading book two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual and Entertaining","review":"I was very surprised by the content of this book. There is no supernatural story like it anywhere. It is funny, smart and has just the right amount of murder mystery and romance to make it an outstanding and entertaining read.

I prefer traditional romance novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it - just too boring","review":"I bought this book because of all the 5 star reviews. Those people must have read a different book. If there are those out there who thought this book was that good they'd be blown away by a good author's vampire stories...like J.R. Ward for example.I kept thinking it was going to pick up but it never did. The vampire was the most boring of all the characters. Everything was so....flat.I honestly do not understand how something like this can get published. I finally gave up on it before half way."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way can compare with Tanya Huff or Laurell K. Hamilton","review":"I picked up this book mainly because of the reviews and because she was compared favorably with Tanya Huff's vampire series and Laurell K. Hamilton. No Way! Tanya Huff's was my favorite and I enjoyed Laurell Hamilton's up to the last three books. This book did not have anything in it that caught at my attention enough to keep reading. If you are looking for a good vampire book try the above two authors or Barbara Hambly's two vampire books, or a book called the Vampire and the Cowboy. This book I would rate as boring and just plain dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE BILL COMPTON","review":"I love Bill and I hope that her last book is a Sookie and Bill love story once again.

Ms. Harris has made me laugh out loud and I must say that I am a Sookie Stackhouse fan (and Vampire Bill is my Southern Gentleman hero). The twist and turn of the plot kept me guessing - I am off to read book 2 (Living Dead in Dallas)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoping the series gets better","review":"I've read various contemporary vampire series and figured I'd give this a try. I suppose I could call it kind of cute at times. But that doesn't seem right for a vampire book. But that's it. I think the cover really says it all. The vampire, Bill, has no personality whatsoever. I know he's a vampire, but he could have a little more depth. He's kind of boring. And Sookie... well, I can think of several words to describe her, none of which are very flattering. But, she reminds me of a bad actress. Know how when you see a movie with a character that just clearly can't act? And you want to like her but it's just bad...? That's what Sookie reminds me of. And she spends half the novel crying. I don't know. It was different, so I will probably give the second one a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, no.","review":"After the reviews that people wrote about how great this novel was, naturally, I was compelled to read it. I read the Twilight series, so I'm all in for vampire novels. However, this was a disappointment. Like you probably will, I ignored all of the \\"bad\\" reviews, wanting to give the book a chance. I was wrong. This book is terrible. You can predict everything that will happen pages, even chapters before it does. If there's ever a moment in the book where there's danger, or a \\"life-threatening\\" event (which in my opinion was extremely unengaging and uninteresting) everything is fine in the end. This book has some sex scenes but the author has a strange way of writing them which confuses you and gives little interest to the reader. I wouldn't waste my time if I were you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down!!","review":"I read this book in a day and a half. I love the show on HBO but the book is better.

This series is definitely for mature audiences because the plot is dark and contained some erotic scenes. I loved the first book after my husband begged me to read it to try and curb me from my Twilight obsession. The first chapter was a bit slow but it did give you a nice picture of Bon Temps and the characters. About 3 chapters in I couldn't put it down. I immediately fell in love with Sookie & Bill and their adventure in this first installment.Afterwards I watched season 1 of True Blood and while the plot followed the book, there are more character lines in the HBO series (ie Tara)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Biased Review","review":"I read this book after watching season 1 of the show True Blood. I felt myself comparing the 2 throughout the book. I prefer the show to the book.The story is well written. But I couldn't connect with Sookie the character in the book and thought she acted foolishly, sometimes stupidly. I felt the book was a more of a murder mystery than anything else. The show focuses more on her relationship with Bill. I have also grown to like the other characters in the show and felt the book was amazingly one-dimensional. I won't be continuing the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulls you in","review":"I love the show so much I had to get the books! The only \\"problem\\" with the first book is I already knew most of what was to happen! While Sookie falls in love with Bill, I found myself falling for the elusive Eric, though I'm sure the actor who played him had something to do with that as well! Eric is definitely my favorite character, Lafayette a close second. The only bummer is that while you get swept away with the characters, some of the characters get swept away all too soon! Just shows the making of a great writer to make you care that much about losing characters you just met, though! A great series, I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I heard about this series from a friend and decided to pick it up. Honestly I am not a big reader, I stick to my comic books and television for entertainment. However I have to say this book was surprisingly easy to read, and a hell of an action packed ride too. I love how Charlaine Harris writes in a way that really puts you into the main character's thought process. I also enjoyed that for the majority of the book there was action and purpose. I have to say once I picked this book up, I could not put it down. Great read if you love the supernatural, mystery, adventure and a little smut all mixed together."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the vampire book I'd been waiting for","review":"I'm a lover of all things vampire and paranormal. I've read all the major YA series' that are out there. I had been looking for a vampire series geared towards adults, and I randomly came across this book online. I figured I'd give it a try, I was not let down. I read through it in one night, it was that good. In fact, I think I've read it probably five times, I love it that much. I love Sookie, and I love, love, love Eric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I gave it a two only because it did hold my interest enough to finish, but it really was not a great book. The writing was OK, I never felt like I cared about the characters, and the plot seemed quite random. I won't say the ending but it was weird. I like this type of story so I thought I would like this book and was really hoping to get into it, but it fell pretty short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"How can you not like this? This has become one of my favs! I am going to devour this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I'm yet to read this promising book. I've watched the TV series True Blood and that was absolutely fantastic. I can't wait to get stuck into the book!It arrived in perfect condition and before the expected date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...same as show","review":"This book was very similar to the True Blood series on HBO. The difference is that you get a little more info. A few things are different (like the same thing that happened on the show only done by a different character). Also, there is no Tara to speak of....she isn't in the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"What a disappointment. I heard so much hype about this book. I found it boring and I had to make myself continue reading because I was sure it would eventually get better (after hearing so much great stuff about the series). I'm glad I didn't buy the boxed set, and only spent my money on the first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm on the fence with this one","review":"I didn't like this book but also I didn't really not like it. I can't think of anything in it that I really enjoyed other then the kind of hinted at love triangle. I think I am going to read book two just to see if they get better. Can't really explain why I am intrigued with them. They aren't my usual style. I thought it was a little raunchy not really romantic at all. I think I kind of like Sookies character and I want to know what happens with her. To see how this whole Bill Sam thing works out. I would only suggest this book to certain good humored friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampires in Lousiana","review":"I thought it was a really cute book, but it got a little slow in places. A good read, especially for someone looking for a lighter vampire read. Also, vampire books without all the angst can be fun! I would pick it up, if I were you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for","review":"Considering the rave review I was given of Harris' work, I was greatly disappointed. The characters are dull and stereotypical, and the plot is flat and underdeveloped. It's \\"charm\\" seems to be its Southern setting, and I guess I'm just not southern enough to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never grabbed my attention","review":"I liked Harris' style of writing. She moves the story well and tries to keep the reader engaged. Unfortunately, the story itself fell flat. Sookie, the main character, is described as being intelligent, but naive. Unfortunately, her small town experience is taken to the extreme that she comes across as anything but intelligent.The mystery portion of the novel is well done, but as is often the case when one is done well the other, the relationships in this case, are stiff and poorly developed. I didn't like Bill and wondered why Sookie would allow herself to be used by him, however much he professed to love her.Much more interesting to me was the shape shifter whom she almost completely ignores.Overall it was a quick read, but one that never did quite pull me into the story and make me care about the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Poorly written, plot and characters stick-like and unbelievable, Bill was as boring as a sack of hammers, plot was tedious and had no direction, love scenes were ridiculous. Totally turned off of this writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. One reviewer called the story \\"derivative,\\" but then most vampire stories are. Laurell Hamilton comparisons are to be expected. However, this story has a much lighter touch. Good plot turns and surprises!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Fried Fun","review":"This is one terrific romp of a book. Vivid characterizations and setting make this a really fun read. This book is a rare find indeed- a convincing vampire tale with a sweet and touching romance as its center. Try it- you'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"4 & 5 Stars for this book? What?","review":"I'm going to give the books time to grow on me only because the show on HBO has me hooked and I can't wait to see what happens. People keep telling me to stick with it because the later books are better reads , and I'm going to try my best, but good gosh the books are not that great. Conversations and actions are choppy, and the story just doesn't flow right. When I'm done reading the entire series, and if I change my mind I will also change my review, but as of right now this series gets a 2 Star from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"I had not read any of the series, but started watching True Blood on HBO and got hooked on the show and looked forward to each new episode, so I decided to try the books.Long story short is that if you like the show you will really love the book. All the things that are started in the show are developed more here and we get to know more about the charactors. Sookie is the centerpiece, the naive (but not really that naive) person who can read people's minds, which is something that can be quite a task in her small town and the various people that live there.This is a perfect belnd of storytelling, humor, vampires and the occult all coming together to somehow also having a sense of normalacy among all of this.Looking forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I have never really enjoyed reading. I think because it always took me so long to read a book, so I would get discouraged and quit. I read this book in less than a week. I would read for 2 hours at a time. I cant wait to get this next one. The show is great too. Its a little different then book but I love them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Until Dark","review":"My friend recommended these books to me when I told her I loved the television series \\"True Blood\\" that the show was based on. This book was very intriguing to me especially the chemistry with Sookie and Bill. I found the characters and the situations around them very enjoyable to read about. These books are probably being compared to the Twilight Series. Lets just say Edward and Bella(4th book) and, Sookie and Bill(1st book). Can not wait for the 2nd book."},{"rating":"1","title":"you should read","review":"when i first started reading it i thought it was just like twilight but i read the series and i loved them. i recamend people reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry but it was not for me !","review":"Ok I LOVE THE TWILIGHT SERIES ! But this book was just to unclean for me and I am a 25 year old married female and I hate it when people say this book is for adults and Twilight is for teenagers which IS WRONG because I related more to the TWilight series than this one ! The show is awful and distasteful also ! Well that's just my opinion !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough Sookie","review":"If you love TrueBlood, its an easy read. This book is basically the first season in text (I watched the shows first obviously). I was turned on to the books by a great friend who is obsessed with this series. I am currently reading Living Dead in Dallas, which has a slightly different story line than the HBO series, which is making it an even more excititng read! Super fun, and Super sexy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too violent for me","review":"Characters are interesting, story is good, but I'm a complete wimp about violence in movies and books, so this book was too much for me. The \\"villain\\" in this book is really disturbing, psychotic, and violent toward women. Because Sookie can read minds she can see his gross thoughts. Turned me off of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long Awaited Treat","review":"I've had this book in my possession for some time and had been anxious to read it because my coworkers had been raving about it. Unfortunately, I had already watched the first season of True Blood so I had to wait.There are some differences between the tv series and the book, which is great, but it doesn't change the fact that it sucks to already know 'who'd done it' at the end of the story when the killer is revealed.Still, I rate this book 4 stars because although I already knew most of the story, it didn't fail to keep me entertained and maintain my interest. I had been looking for a gripping story to read and was pleasantly surprised to find it here.It's funny, quirky, serious and sexual. I recommend everyone to grab a sample read - the way it's written is light and entertaining, but I caution some readers due to its sexual content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Show first, now the books?","review":"Don't be apprehensive if you've already watched the show. As the books progress, you'll see that there are some variations to the storyline. Initially, as a big fan of the show, I was leary that it might somehow take from my enjoyment of the program.On the contrary, it enhanced my experience by getting in deeper, so-to-speack. The books are tightly intermixing plots and give greater details into the inner-workings of Sookie's mind. Even more so than the show.I recommend this to a program fan, if not for any other reason - the books last longer than an hour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the HBO Series","review":"I decided to read this book because I enjoyed season one of HBO True Blood. So I bought the book. I really liked it and now I'm reading the other books of the series. I am NOT a vampire fan, never read Twilight (and don't plan to), so I was not the audience for this novel. However, I found the novel is very entertaining, has a good pace and has some cool original twists. It is an easy reading, something that I save for vacation days or days that I don't want to challenge myself with something a bit more serious. Also, I now enjoy the books in the series better than the HBO show. I haven't finished the entire book series yet, but this far I am enjoying every book, and this one I definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Editor (at least for the Kindle version).","review":"This review is exclusively for the editor (at least to my knowledge) of the Kindle version of this book. I really like this story so far and it has really grabbed my interest. The problem however is that whoever edited these books did the poorest job I have seen so far. As an avid reader as well as an English Major I am absolutely appalled by the grammar in these books. There are dozens upon dozens of grammatical errors in both Dead Until Dark, as well as Living Dead in Dallas. There are so many grammatical errors that I am not sure if I can stand to finish reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More entertaining that I thought!","review":"Sookie Stackhouse is a waitress at the local bar of a small town in Louisiana. People in her town think she's a little nuts, but that's because Sookie has a little secret of her own. She can read minds. However, she doesn't like to, so she keeps a barrier up in her own head to block out the boring voices that is the minds of other people. One night, a mysterious stranger appears at her bar. She is instantly fascinated by his 'glow' and instantly classes him as a vampire. However, others in her small town notice that too and they are up to no good. After saving the vampire (Bill) from a near 'draining', Sookie finds herself caught up in a life she never imagined she would have and discovers things below the surface of her normal-looking town. Involving (of course) vampires, other supernatural, mystery, suspense, thrill, romance, and humour, Charlaine Harris creates a new, and intriguing story that I found hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun dark read!","review":"This vampire series is a great counterpoint to the Anita Blake stories. Much as I love Laurell Hamilton's dark and vivid imagination, I prefer Charlaine Harris' lighter touch. But make no mistake, there is violence and horror present in these pages.Sookie Stackhouse is no kick-butt herione but rather more down home kind of gal, funny and sweet not quite girl-next-door burdened with an unusual telepathic ability. All the supporting characters are interesting and Bill the vampire is mysterious, strong and vulnerable. I bought the first two volumes and look forward to future installments!Recommend for 16 and up for language, sex & violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovedit!!!","review":"I recently read Dead Until Dark and Living Dead in Dallas. What a fun trip. It is light hearted reading, that is impossible to take seriously. I almost fell out of my chair laughing when I encountered \\"Elvis\\" the vampire. Read it! They are good suspense that will keep you entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but to short!!!!!!!","review":"Charlaine Harris is my new favortie author! Sookie Stackhouse waitress and so much more is a great character and the bad boy of all time Eric....yum..yum. Not to confuse new readers, Bill is the vampire Sookie finds herself in love with and he is sweet and all that but Eric, well there is just something about his character that you cannot resist. If you like L.K.H (Anita Blake) I think you will enjoy these stories, they are light and fun but the need to be longer! Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart pounding action","review":"The action grips you so you can't put these books down. My one concern is over the fact that I read these as recommended for ages 14 and up. I would never give these to my 14 year old and am not ready to hand them over to my 16 year old. However I highly recommend them as long as you know of their sexual content. Sookie is a wonderful main character and I will continue with this series as long as they are written. I have never read this type of book before and took opportunities to find a quiet place in which to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wit, romance, mystery & supernatural, What more do you want?","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I love it when people can take an old theme and add a whole new twist. Plus loads of turns. It is especially nice when they top it off with a sense of humor. The book transports you to a place of enjoyment, the only drawback is that once the book is over it's back to reality until you pick up her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"Caught \\"True Blood\\" on TV and so decided to read the books on which the series is based. I wished now that I had read the books first because I can't help but picture the actors when their written counterparts are first mentioned.Found this first one very entertaining. The true test will be if I tire of the characters as the series progresses.UPDATE: I've now made it through the entire series and while some volumes are better than others, overall, it's a fun, wryly written, lighthearted little series. Not Pulitzer Prize-winning literature, but not much is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great addition to the series!","review":"Charlaine does it again! I can hardly contain myself while I wait for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading with Tequila","review":"I think Dead Until Dark had the possibility of being a 5 shot book, but I watch True Blood. I spent the majority of the novel wondering where Tara was, comparing the actors to the characters in the book and wishing they had used Bubba in the show. Had I not watched the show first, I really believe this book would have been amazing. The book is still very good and I picture Sookie more Jessica Simpson than Anna Paquin now. It was fast, easy, fun and has the potential of being very exciting for someone who hasn't seen the show yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun vampire fiction","review":"I was afraid that this was going to be totally cheesy, like Twilight was. I'm so glad I was wrong! Dead Until Dark is a fun book...a mystery and a romance all rolled together with a generous helping of vampires.I like the fact that Harris didn't go crazy with her vampires and make them so utterly ridiculous that they distracted from, rather than helped, the story along. (Stephenie Meyer, I'm talking to YOU!) While I did find Sookie (wtf kind of name is that?) a bit on the hokey side, she was a character you could relate to.I'm looking forward to reading other books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, terribly written","review":"While I am a fan of \\"True Blood\\", I was not a fan of Harris' written work, which is quite rare, becasue I usually go the opposite way when it comes to books and their film forms. This is perhaps the first book I can say I actually like the series better than the book. But I digress.I think Harris' concept is fantastic. She has a dynamic cast of characters, all with their own quirks and issues. Each character is colorful and paints a vivid picture. Towards the middle and end of the book, however, I lose my connection with the characters. I feel as though too much is going on at once and it loses the reader's interest and muddles the time line of events. I'm not a particular fan of her style of writing - but that's just a personal opinion.While the story line is an intriguing one, I feel Harris loses her grip on her characters halfway through the story and leaves the reader confused and unhappy at the end.The Last Saint"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like the show, don't read the books","review":"I've recently started watching the show on HBO, and I really enjoy it. So, while waiting for the second season to be released on DVD I thought I'd give the books a go. I was sorely disapointed. The polt and character development in the show was miles above what it was in the book. I only got about halfway through the book before I just gave up. I won't be reading anymore of this series, but I'll definately be watching the show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun read!","review":"Just found Harris, after all these years. Am so glad I did. After reading other paranormal novels for a few months, this was a true delight. Can't wait to read more.Sookie Stackhoouse is feisty, sassy, and likable. And though I can't for the life of me undertand what the fascination is with Vampire boyfriends --- all that talk about cool skin, pasty white complexions, glowing in the dark stuff --- well . . . I guess Tolkien was right when he said we have to suspend disbelief and just go with the flow. In this case - a really nice flow! Fun. Light. Did I say fun?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy, just like southern pecan pie","review":"Charlaine Harris has captured the small town atmosphere perfectly with her cast of characters. Everyone knows everyone else's business and if it's too brutal or out of the ordinary, you do the polite thing and ignore it. This is a marvelous fun read with romance, mystery and danger popping up on every page. Some of the ideas in the book are predictable but the character studies and relationships are what really carry the book. The introspection of the main character with her 'disability' of being psychic and her growing confidence throughout the book in her abilities and herself as she gains her first boyfriend and then realizes that he's not the only man that is interested in her is a fine psychological study of what a lot of people go through. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in this series to see what other adventures and discoveries await Sookie and her town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, now this is bad","review":"I made it through the first few pages of this book, and had to check to make sure I hadn't accidentally picked up a high school term paper. The writing here is so pedestrian, so lacking in originality or innovation, it makes me assume that adapting this piece of garbage into an absorbing television show must have been one hell of a challenge. The good news for me is that I won't have to suffer through any more of Charlaine Harris' excruciating prose; not when I have \\"True Blood.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"No details in this book","review":"I had high high hopes for this book, and the series in general. BUT. To be honest, this book was just terrible. I felt that character detailed severely lacked, details of locations and events are hardly there at all. Overall, a very disappointing read. I tried getting into the second book of the series, but I just really do not like Harris' story writing. I prefer precision in my books with vivid detail so that I can map the characters and places in my mind. I found that I'd open the book, read a few pages, and put it down. There just wasn't anything to hold my attention. My personal opinion is that season one of True Blood did a much better job with Harris' story than Harris managed to do herself. I'll give it 2 stars because the story basics are good, but overall, the execution, in my mind, was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Written","review":"I bought this book after watching True Blood on HBO. My recommendation is watch HBO or buy the DVD but don't waste money on the book. The plot is choppy, transition is bad. Half the time I don't even understand why Sookie is mad at Bill. She seems to be having PMS 365 days. Poor writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible book","review":"In the beginning it started out with what seemed like wit and humor... and slowly went further and further downhill. I never want to read another book by this author ever again. I only suggest reading this if you want a fluffy book made for lovers of romance novels. This will not appeal to people at all interested in horror books or vampires. It has far too much sex and attempts to have an interesting plot but fails badly. The inclusion of Bubba was the stupidest thing I have ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Twilight readers, this is a disappointment.","review":"From the reviews, it appears there are a lot of Twilight fans (including me) looking for more to read and they have found this book. I have to admit that this is a disappointment on more than one level for me. First, I felt it was rather poorly written. The story seemed to be disorganized and downright cheesy in places. Second, after reading this book, I had to question the originality of the Twilight series. Harris' book was published in 2001. Stephanie Meyer didn't begin writing Twilight until 2003. The similarities between the two are unbelievable. In fact, I was given this book to read because the stories are so much alike, not because this was a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Really Wanted To Like This Book","review":"I'll preface this review by saying that I REALLY like the HBO series, True Blood. I also really wanted to like this book, but I can't say that I did. I just don't like this author's writing style. I found myself rolling my eyes quite frequently because of all of the terrible analogies and the downright corny writing. I had to force myself to finish it. I won't be reading anymore of the books in the series and, like another reviewer, I'll be looking for something a bit more substantial."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am glad this book exists","review":"I am happy this book was written, as I love the HBO show. It's a great story, and one that was perfect to expand into a high quality show like True Blood. However, on its own, the book was only mildly interesting. It has a little humor, it has a variety of characters, it has some exciting parts. But overall, I was not impressed and only read it through to see if I felt differently about book Bill and show Bill. I have read the first three books so far and might skim the fourth, but I don't think I can make it much further than that. They are just a little too... simple. She doesn't take any of the qualities I listed far enough to make it really good reading.However, I am just so thankful to Charlaine Harris for writing the series, and for allowing such freedom to Alan Ball to take her stories to the next level. She deserves her success!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy New Discovery","review":"It is always a delight to discover a wonderful new series, and Charlene Harris' Sookie Stackhouse books definitely fall into this category. She herself is fun to be with, as are those around her. Strange creatures abound, wackiness ensues, and fun is had by all, especially the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Turn-Pager!","review":"I was really unsure on whether or not I would like this book. Atfer reading some of the bad reviews on here, I figured I had to decide if the book was good on my own. I am a HBO True Blood fanatic. I never read the books before the tv series, so I figured why not see how different the two are. This book was really good. I recommend that everyone that has seen the show, reads this book. I finished it in one day. I could not put it down. Although some parts are different from the show, it is difinitely worth the time to read. I regret not buying the box set in the first place. Now that I'm done, I'm waiting on the box set. I really can't wait. I have nothing to read now. I hope the rest of the books are as good as the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the book if you liked the HBO Series","review":"I picked this book up after watching the HBO series, True Blood, based on this book. I figured as with so many books made into television, the book would be so much better, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The book was very poorly written & differed so much from the series that I just couldn't get into it. One of the main characters in the HBO series, Sookies best friend Tara, isn't even in the books! The dialogue was horrible, Sookie was portrayed as rather uneducated in the book & seemed very shallow (after all she seemed more upset by the demise of her cat than her grandmother). I've heard that the rest of the series of books does improve, however, I'm not wasting any more money on this series. If you do decide to try this book out, do yourself a favor & borrow it from a friend or the library. DO NOT waste money on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Good","review":"I was hoping for an interesting, exciting book somewhere along the lines of Laurell K Hamilton's Anita Blake series. However, I got Dead Until Dark instead. It is not only boring, but I guess I just don't like the whole southern girly-girl \\"I need a big, strong, possibly undead boyfriend to take care of me\\" thing. This book really was very boring, and I didn't even finish it. I don't recommend the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR EXCUSE FOR A VAMP.

A talented writer Charlaine Harris is not. Her style is boring, bland, and repetitious. And her \\"heroine,\\" Sookie, is laughably trite, even for a telepath. Is there even a reason she has these powers? Do I care? Why does anyone, when the plot moves at a dirigible's pace? Just, no. Save yourself a few bucks and pick up a Kim Harrison novel or an older Laurell K. Hamilton. Even Karen Chance.

The book was actually very good. Of course it's different from the show in many aspects. Some key characters are missing that were in the show. But then characters in the book weren't even addressed in the show. I am very thankful that the narrator was sookie. I'm also thankful that sex wasn't as detailed or evident in the book as much as it was in the show. I can't wait to read the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the television series","review":"I picked this book up after watching the first season of True Blood (which I loved) on HBO. I couldn't believe how weak the book was. Harris does develop interesting characters and has a vivid imagination. She just doesn't follow through with the storyline and plot development. For example, in the series when Sookie realizes who the killer is, she is in her house with him and reads his mind. She runs outside to try and escape. In the book, she is in the house, by herself, realizes that the killer is outside in the woods, and decides....to run out of the house into the woods to escape. I'm like \\"what!\\" It made no sense and completely destroyed the drama of the confrontation because you are still thinking \\"why did she leave the house?\\"Obviously the television series has much better writers when it comes to plot development and dramatic writing. I've decided not to read any more of her books. But True Blood still rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Humerous Page Turner","review":"I bought this book because I enjoyed Harris' Aurora Teagarden mystery series, not because it had a vampire theme. Once I'd got started with \\"Dead Until Dark\\" I found it difficult to put down. It combined great story telling with interesting, quirky characters, humor, and elements of fantasy. I hope there will be more books featuring Sookie Stackhouse and Vampire Bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Time","review":"One of the worst-written books I have ever read. Though Harris' plot ideas have great potential, the superficial character development and illogical plot twists leave the reader completely disappointed. At times, the unbearably moronic dialogue and Harris' awkward word choice will literally have you cringing. I love a good guilty-pleasure novel as much as the next reader, but there is just too much well-written fiction out there to waste your time on this drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read...","review":"Whether you hate this book or love it, you can't deny that it is an easy read that entices the reader to turn the page, even when they need to sleep or need to stop :) I personally liked it even though it was a little too descriptive. Overall, it passes the time in a fairly enjoyable way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newest Fan of Charlaine Harris","review":"I have to confess, I am a bit late starting this series, but now that I have just finished reading this book I am HOOKED!! I have never seen True Blood on HBO, in fact my mother gave me this author's name and I bought the first book in this series out of pure curiousity. As someone who has tried and failed to get hooked by the Twilight saga, I was skeptical at first. I had actually forgotten I had bought this book for about a month after I had downloaded it to my Kindle. I am not certain when I actually started reading this book, but I don't believe it has taken me that long, probably an hour a day for about ten days.

You would think this would be the most thrilling book on the shelf, but noooope. The writing style is bland and very amateurish. In fact, I've read unedited/self published vampire novels that are a much higher caliber of writing. I didn't have high expectations (try not to anymore, since I'm hopelessly addicted to fantasy and paranormal fiction ... and there is a LOT of bad stuff out there), but I was still disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather Off Topic","review":"Amazon offers this book at list price.Amazon no longer offers a price break?Is this a new policy:What's going on here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If she was a lit major, im a brain surgeon!","review":"I guess the story of the book is entertaining enough. Im a pretty big fan of the hbo show True Blood and decided to read the 1st book after watching a good chunk of the season. Although the show is entertaining but definitely has its cheesy parts, the book is just as bad. I think the thing that really gets me is this author really is an extremely horrible writer, even if she is trying to take on the southern style of the narrator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Until Dark","review":"This is a very good book, an interesting world where Vampires have made their existance known and are living almost side by side with humans. Sookie Stackhouse has been waiting to meet one since they came out. I believe the old saying is true, be careful what you wish for. There are so many interesting characters living in this world. Bill the Vampire, along with Eric and Pam. Sookie's boss and co-workers also her family members. If you want a good read this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"What can I say other than I love this book! I have read the whole series ans they are all amazing, I'm hooked on the storylines and I love the characters. I think it is so much more fun than Twilight, although I love that too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infinitely richer than HBO's True Blood. Really.","review":"I'm talking to those of you who have seen HBO's series and might want to experience a richer, deeper, darker, smarter and sexier take on the Southern Vampire Mysteries.Author Harris has created an addictive series in which Sookie is the center of always strange, sometimes wonderful, and often terrifying events. Sookie is truly the heroic figure you saw in the first few episodes and not the crankypants whiner the producers turned her into.What's better about the books? Harris writes clean prose and tells her story in a linear style without messy side trips. And here's some good news: skanky Jason is a fairly minor character while vampires Bill and Eric are very major. Tara doesn't bear any resemblance to her namesake in the books and I just don't know what to say about that.Treat yourself to the fun to be had in reading this wonderful series. Richer. Deeper. Darker. Smarter. Sexier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I Didn't Pay Full Price","review":"I had little hope for this book after reading 50 pages and still not getting lost in the story. Charlaine Harris has a good idea, but she does very little with it. I got the feeling that after she wrote x number of pages she gave up and just ended the story. Unfortunately, I read her third book (Club Dead) and it's ending was more abrupt than Dead Until Dark. I wouldn't recommend any of the Sookie books to anyone who truly enjoys reading. There are much better vampire stories out there. Read one of those instead. If you just can't resist reading this series go to the library and save your money for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"The More I Read, the Less I Wanted To","review":"I could not muster up the energy to finish this white trash romance between bar waitress Sookie Stackhouse and the new vampire in town, Bill Compton. I like to support local authors, but the characters were two-dimensional and the plot virtually non-existent. Perhaps the television series based on these books is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky, Sexy, Mystery and Horror - LOVE IT","review":"Charlaine Harris has a great eye for light yet engaging mysteries/sci-fi. Sookie is so great! The characters are interesting, funny, serious. Makes a twenty-something wish her life were as interesting and animated as hers! Love the storyline between Sookie and Bill the vampire set against the backdrop of ordinary life in Louisiana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redneck Vampires??","review":"This was one of the cheesiest books I have ever read.

Guess I'll go back to my clean books by Lilian Jackson Braun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apology to fans","review":"I want to apologize to Harris's fans for being so blunt. This book, with deep respect for Anne Rice, could have been titled \\"Intercourse with the Vampire\\".Way too much talking about sex acts with the vampire that didn't need to be in a mystery.The book has potential, but, it is just not for me.After reading just over 3/4 of the book, it made Twilight look good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much like other series...","review":"This book/series probably could have been good, but its just too much like every other vampire series out there. It doesn't really have anything that sets it apart or makes me want to keep reading.A cute vampire, a strong and independent woman with a talent that sets her apart, murders... its all been done before. I got to around page 60 and lost complete interest. Especially when out of the blue for no apparent reason the heroine decides to go investivate murders. Where in the world did that urge come from? She didn't even like the women that were killed!I started this series because it was high on the Amazon sci-fi/fantasy best seller list, but I won't be going any further. Maybe I'll give it another try when the vampire/romance market becomes less saturated.If you want a good vampire series, I suggest Anita Blake Vampire Hunter."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this series!","review":"I found this whole series to be well written and fun to read. I actually couldn't get enough and read all 8 books in about 2.5 weeks. You can obviously read more about the book online so I'm not going to summarize it. I just thought I would give the whole series an enthusiastic thumbs up so that others may check it out like I did.I can't wait for the next installment!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, creative sci-fi romantic mystery series!","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book to me. When I started reading Dead Until Dark, I was hooked right from the get go. It creatively combines Sci-Fi, comedy, Romance and mystery and makes for a interesting and entertaining read. I am almost finished reading Dead to the World and I can't wait to find out what happens next. I'm very much looking forward to the HBO spin-off to see if what the characters I envisioned from the book turn out like on TV. I love the author's creativity down to the little details! It's a must read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am a huge fan of the HBO series (True Blood)that was inspired by this series of books. I was expecting, well, so much more. I'm not a fan of books written in first person perspective anyway as characters other than the primary seem so one dimensional to me. Found the first book so disappointing that I'm sure I won't read another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not much of a reader, but I loved this book!","review":"I'll be the first to admit that I don't read very much, but my sister turned me on to these books and I just love them. They're funny, sexy and all around fun. I'm glad I was able to read before watching the Tv show, because the stories aren't exactly the same.I love how the characters are all damaged in their own way. And the conversations are witty.

Its just 2 pieces of a pen with a magnet between them. For 3$ I was expecting real magic, like the kind I saw on Harry Potter the other day.

If it at least would shoot lasers it would be cool. Life is hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"Wasn't very easy to use and there were a lot of pieces to keep track of.

It was okay, but not as good as this one. There are many versions of this gadget but they are not all created equal. This trick has a stronger magnet, a longer front separating section which adds to the illusion, and it comes with instructions. I decided to re-purchase this version since it works better and gives a cleaner presentation. A magician is more than his apparatus but for the few extra dollars I would go with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy and plodding","review":"This was my first time reading Hagberg and I found his style plodding. There were a few interesting twists, but overall a big snore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill Zone kills thrills","review":"The perfect example of a formula author ready to retire! As a past Hagberg fan I picked up this book expecting a lot more out of him. What I got was a lot of disappointment. The only suspense in this book was, when the main character, and you as the reader expected something to happen...nothing did!As a reader, I'm going to thing thrice before buying another Hagberg book. My advice...skip this one, and go onto other, newer authors, that are trying to make a name for themselves.His last really good book in this series was Critical Mass, which he has been rewriting for the past ten years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Start Good Ending","review":"I have enjoyed lots of stories by David Hagberg (Sean Flannery).This one is about in the middle of the pack.But, still better than the works of many authors. It was slow getting into but definitely picked up good steam about half way thru. All in all..good..not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"A boring and uneventful book. The outcome of the book was easy to predict, and the once mighty Kirk McGarvey, is reduced to nothing but a scared and confused administrator. The only time that McGarvey touches a gun in this book is to place it in the holster \\"in the small of his back\\". Just like Clancy, Hagberg took his main character to a point where he should be mothballed, and there just isn't anything left. It's too bad really, because after \\"Countdown\\", \\"Crossfire\\", and \\"Critical Mass\\", McGarvey has just withered away to what he has become in this book....A hero whose time has come and gone. Time for a new hero, Dave...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innocence CD","review":"LOVE this CD. Thank you for your speedy delivery !

I came home last night and there was a small envelope leaning against my front door. I didn't remember ordering anything except the book. Well, I opened the package, and was taken aback. This book seems like an advertisement for products in a store. None of these items are in DC, and the spells, or requests from people to (supposedly) Marie Laveau aren't laid out in a comprehensive way. You have to read to tell who is speaking to whom. I wouldn't waste my money on this one. I will donate this one to the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you expect, it's an Anna Riva book.....!","review":"As is the style of all the Anna Riva books, the quality, size, language usage, and spelling leave a lot to be desired. This book appears to be a compilation of all the other esoteric and useless stuff that couldn't be smooshed into any of the other Anna Riva books. Too bad we can't give negative star ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Tar and White mush!","review":"I have read and skimmed many magick books in my time, and this one is the worst I've ever came across. Sure, Laveau is the \\"voodoo\\" queen of Orleans, but Riva, the compiler of Laveau's spells, rituals, slop, whatever you want to call them, are not at all what I expected. But then again, what can you really expect for a 64 page book for only 6 something in price! Do Not get this book. There are soooo many more better ones out there. If I were a first time reader of magick books, and I purchased this, it would literally turn me off from magick, thinking it was too complicated, difficult to understand, whatever... Of course everyone just must do what they please in today's society, so if you want the book, get it. I wouldn't suggest it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book.","review":"You can read this book at your instrument, or not.

Last night I finally got to get back on my piano, and everything I read flooded back, and I had a great practice.I found this book, and then discovered that the author is local here in Seattle. I made it my task to become his student. He is such a great teacher, and his teaching and style is right here in this excellent book. Even my other jazz piano teacher has his own copy. I put this book right up there with the Jazz Piano Book by Mark Levine - something that every aspiring jazz pianist should own and reread frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile","review":"A grave disappointment. I cast myself into the Great Pit of Squaredom, surely, by this judgement, but aside from some isolated good bits, including Southern's notes on working with Kubrick on Strangelove and his interview with Henry Green, this is a poor (unspeakable, indeed!) excuse for a collection--repetitive, full of tiresome hipster tics, willfully and wearyingly perverse, seeking shock for shock's sake, like a child misbehaving to get attention. Do not waste your time or your money on this unfortunate production. Buy a copy of The Magic Christian instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Im very disappointed. For the price I payed for this uniform ($100AU after shipping), it is a total waste of money.

Right away, I started oiling it, and tying it up and playing \\"catch\\" with myself. I figured I'd better get going if my kid going to be able to use it by spring. Here I am in June, and it's still not broken in well. He mostly used his cheap, too small for him glove that I bought 3 years ago. Other complaints: 1 - the \\"Dial-Fit System\\" broke very early on.

I have an impact wrench that will loosen most everything I have attempted to loosen except for the lug nuts on the Dodge truck. I borrowed a friends and his wouldn't loosen the lug nuts. So I began my research for a new one that would do the job. I settled on the Aircat 1000th. The reveiws indicated it would bust nuts. I bought two. It wouldn't budge the nut. I tried it once and was dissatified. Attempted to return the two and was informed that I couldn't return the one I had used even though it was used once. They recommended that I send it to the repair center to have it checked out. I did send the second one back and got credit. But I still have the one that does not bust nuts. I might try it on a pecan.Boudreaux"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this based on the reviews. I was replacing a CP impact wrench and was considering an IR thundergun. Then I found this Aircat 1000 with 1000 ftlbs of reverse torque at about $60 less. My CP has only 450. This does not have much more. I started with my lightweight air hose that i use with nail guns and 90lbs of pressure on my compressor. It wouldn't losen the lug nuts on my one ton pickup...so..I went to a bigger air hose and increased the air pressure to 120lbs psi. Then it seemed to have more torque than my CP version but nothing special and clearly no where near twice as much. I should have sent it back but now it has been used.

It is very quiet and I almost wish it were louder so that I would know for sure it was working hard, but did everything I need it for.Seems to be pretty durable, heavy enough to seem sturdy, and the materials seem to be of high quality.The only thing I wish it came with is a hard plastic case like many electric drills come in for storage, other than that I'd recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I wanted a piece of coal...","review":"I will start off by saying that yes, you do get what you paid for.

Historical accounts abound on the victims of the holocaust and on the madman who perpetrated those events. However, few of us have known of the horror Hitler inflicted on his own people, and in particular, the children of Germany. Mr. Lehmann guides us through this tragedy with accounts of his early indoctrination of Hitler's beliefs, through his training and subsequent service to Germany in the Hitler Youth. The book is a fascinating account of the profound effects on the young minds of Hitler's Germany, their tragic slaughter to serve the madman's impossible bidding, and the realization of the horror of Hitler's cruelty. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overcoming the legacy of the III Reich","review":"This is an interesting book. The author has in mind two points: 1/ The brutalities of Hitler's actions were hidden, at least from those who obeyed, who 'followed' him and thus grew up sheltered inside a totalitarian State. That?s hard for us to believe if we grow up in the Good Ole USA! 2/ As a child, the author was able to conquer fear. He had to become an adult before he could conquer hate. Had he not been taught hate, he wouldn'd have had to conquer it. Hate bends minds and we need to over come this kind of thinking. The German version is basically a shortened version. Much that is self-explanatory to Germans had to be explained to the average American reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique CD","review":"It's unfortuate that there aren't as many sampler's wavs to Marcey's music as there is to other more popular titles.

The music gives an rough idea on what is on 2 of her CD's, with maybe 1 song from 2 other CD's. The music ranges from being really unique and sublime, to being somewhat amatuerish and needing more work. I'd have to say my favorites on this CD or \\"Inward harmony\\" and \\"Leaving the Physical\\". The only dissapointment was \\"Giza Pyramid\\".

It's obviously a one-trick concept: formatted battles with confusing geometrical formations and victory against all odds. The same character emotions over and over. A beauty (or curse?) of e-readers is the ability to search key phrases; in these novels the same sentences are repeated over and over. That's lazy writing.So, good beginning.

Sets up the glimmering of several questions, why did the war start, why can't it be ended, and who are these third party guys?

At the time I gave up the protagonist what fuming that his battered and exhausted crew wasn't interest in sparing the lives aboard a surrendered vessel. There is no prescient sense of motivation in the story, the main character is supposed to be focused on getting the fleet home and spends seemingly dozens of pages dressing down individual captains for not obeying him well enough or failing to live up to his moral standards or whining about not having their acceptance or bemoaning his overwhelming circumstances. When I realized that the author was still writing the series without resolving the current arc, I spared myself any further of his terrible pacing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea poorly executed","review":"I bought this first book in this series on the strength of the idea. I'm always on the lookout for good military SF, but these stories disappoint.The characters are shallow and not very credible and the story reads like a high school students accounting of the cliques in their class.If you're a person who likes military SF and appreciates the work of authors like David Drake stay away from these - they'll drive you nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting 'universe' but disappointing execution","review":"Like many, I'm sure, my interest was peaked by the cover and the brief description on the back. But I found myself finishing the book out of sheer dogged determination. While the universe the author creates is interesting and full of potential I was very disappointed in the execution. To me it felt like the author's first book. The characters never seemed natural to me. Much of the military interaction seemed like something someone would put together if they'd gotten their info second or third hand. I just found myself regularly scowling at dialogue and actions that seemed to make no sense for the characters. Maybe I've just been spoiled by too much David Weber. It may be OK for light reading, but don't expect anything truly engrossing. I couldn't bring myself to go beyond the first book, so it way well have improved in later volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean and Absorbing!","review":"Whenever I try a new series, especially in sci-fi, I am always a little nervous about the content. I love sci-fi, but sometimes the books just aren't what you'd expect. I am pleased to say that this book was clean enough to be read by teenagers but still written in a way that could appeal to adults.This book reminds me a bit of the success of the Law and Order and CSI TV shows that could draw in a viewer but kept some normalcy by admitting that cops, forensic experts, and prosecutors don't normally spend all of his or her free time drinking and sleeping around. The portrayal of a hero who doesn't fit in to his society and sometimes not in with his fleet and the explanation of his real thoughts and insecurities, makes Captain Jack Black Geary seem like a real human hero instead of a James Bond Hollywood fantasy. If you enjoy reading sci-fi that makes you think about how you and people you know would handle things, then I would highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable....","review":"So, this is what I do...I see a group of books by a SF author posted on the Web, so I download them. I then check them out in Amazon to see what other learned bibliophiles have to say about them by reading a selection of five-star to one-star reviews. In the case of the Jack Campbell, the positives outweighed the negatives in my mind, so I decided to load up my e-reader with all six of the original series and give it a shot.I should have focused on the one-star reviews...I could not get beyond page 50.

You mean planets don't you?\\"Save your money and find a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Reason to Read","review":"There is absolutely no reason to read this book. My guess is there's no reason to read the entire series. Why? Because, just like any television show, you know that the hero (in this book it's Black Jack Geary) is going to save the day. There really isn't much tension in the book other than figuring out exactly how Geary is going to save the day.The quality of writing is low, the narrative is unimaginative. Characters are two dimensional, the plot is formulaic.There are too many well-written and entertaining books waiting to be read for me to waste my time on this. I'm out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype","review":"I had trouble getting through the first few pages of this book. Its written more like a B movie script, than a good Sci-Fi series.

They were a mistake the*first* time around! They'd better be built like German BCs, which were designed to be in the LoB. D) If the hyperlink nets were limited to the side that erected them and space holes were forgotten, how did the two sides ever meet in battle?

Oh, and no nukes???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I ordered this book after the good reviews here. Unfortunately I am deeply disappointed. The material in this book qualifies only for a good short story. The author has stretched this good essence with repetitions and dumb dialog. It is like those cheap Sci-Fi channel TV series such as Eureka and Stargate Atlantis.The dialogs are setup to lead to \\"Sci-Fi\\" ideas, but in such an obvious and lengthy way that finally when it comes you have already lost your interest.Sadly this seems to be the trend in most of the recent Sci-Fi books I read. If you have read one of the great classics such as Arthur C. Clarke's Rama, you would know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"One main interesting idea, but not worth the time","review":"This most interesting part of this book is the idea that in widely distributed space battles the limit of light speed makes tactical and strategic planning and direction difficult. You get all that in the first couple of chapters.Once you're done processing that the rest of the book is bad. The characters are predictable and one-dimensional, even given that their behavior is implausible, the 'science' is inconsistent, the tactics explored are uninteresting and implausible, and the larger conflict is also implausible given the actions of the characters in the book.I'd recommend avoiding this book. Instead read some Weber, Pournelle, Ringo, Resnick, Drake, Bujold, some of Heinlein's Mil SF, or even Scalzi. If you've already read all those then take a walk or watch a movie or some such instead of reading this book.The sequel is even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"flat flat flat","review":"Reading this novel is like watching someone play a video game.

A military officer wakes up after 100 years and is put in charge of a fleet that's run by a bunch of whiny, stubborn morons straight out of a Dilbert strip (by the end of the story I started rooting for the other side, since so many of the \\"good guys\\" suck so badly and the bad guys are hardly flushed out at all). The plot is consumed by the hero's angst over frustrating personnel decisions and the overblown legend of his past deeds. Guess what--if the hero is constantly frustrated and annoyed, the reader is going to be constantly frustrated and annoyed.There were no twists to keep me on my toes; everything just got wrapped up with a big space battle that had virtually no tension. The story left me with no desire to pick up the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I couldn't even finish this book.

He has built a future and put some thought into the problems and opportunities of space warfare."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stupid Premise","review":"The whole idea that as a war continues, tactics and strategies devolve makes no sense to me. Our main character is thawed out after being in a rescue pod for 100 years. He is the only one who knows any other tactics beyond a Highland Charge. It might make sense if they were at peace for countless generations and forgot how to fight. However, the rational is that the losses of officers were so high that battle tactics had been forgotten.These folks are building space ships but can't read books on battle tactics. These folks have been fighting a war for a few generations and don't teach their kids how to fight. It simply defies logic.These books do a great job of dealing with the speed of light and how if affects ship to ship combat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable!","review":"Very enjoyable book, and a great start for a series.

I also like how the author makes the \\"hero\\" out to be a real human being who is thrust into the role, and honestly tries to do his best. Probably the only thing I really didn't like about the book was the beginning. I feel that the story started a bit late. I would've prefered the story starting with the fleet finding Geary, and then going into battle. But, that's OK. Very good book otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Characters Have No Character","review":"The story itself is somewhat intriguing. I wanted to read the next book to see what happened. However, I can't bring myself to do it because the characters are all so frustratingly one-dimensional. All but one. The main character is the only believable character in the book. Everyone else is extremely one-dimensional, and most are very simple-minded. Even captains of starships behave as if they have no sense or capability for reasoning. They remind me of Worf on Star Trek: The Next Generation. No matter what the situation, Worf's response was always \\"We should attack!\\" If some of the secondary characters could be developed with the depth that the main character has, the book would be much more interesting to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"deceptive picture and description","review":"This is a completely deceptive photo and description.

They nagged friends of mine who work in two separate local game stores to carry this DVD. As a result, and because my friends value my opinion, I got a chance to sit down and watch this movie for free...and I still want a refund.This movie is like being trapped at while a D&D; player insists on telling you about his character or a game he played in. We all found it dull and uninspiring, and, in the interest of total honesty, we could not get all the way through it.There are better movies about gaming, serious and non. I recommend you seek them out and save your money for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Base","review":"The Assemblage of the Crystal Sphere: A D&D; Story: 1 out of 10: This is a film about five people playing a five-year D&D; campaign. The film seems shot in real time. That is, it consists of people rolling dice and well talking; for an hour and a half. Yup' (Sounds of fingers tapping)Okay let me deconstruct this a little. The filmmakers claim this is a mockumentary, unfortunately the mock part is so subtle as to be, well non-existent. So instead, you have five people you do not know, playing an D&D; game, you aren't a member of. It is worse than those celebrity poker shows'. Much worse.I am really starting to think there is not any flotsam that you can capture with a digital video camera nowadays that you cannot call an 'indie' film. A store security tape might have made a better movie than this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a movie","review":"This is not a movie per se. It's a mockumentary.Has it's moments, but if you're looking for some sort of action movie this is not it.If you enjoy watching films where people talk about what they did whey they played AD&D; then you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"As the previous reviewer stated, this is a mockumentary, but none-the-less, it most ceratinly is a \\"movie\\". Along the lines of Best in Show, Spinal Tap, or A Mighty Wind, The Asseblage of the Crystal Sphere holds its own. The acting is amazing for a small budget film and the writing/material is on a level of its own. It brought back a lot of great memories to see this movie, and anyone who has ever played or known anyone who played D&D will love this movie. Those who have not can laugh at it as well, it's just that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT LITTLE BOOK GREAT STARTER INFO","review":"Gary Monroe does an excellent job in his book THE HIGHWAYMEN.

It is about the FloridaHighwaymen artists. Very good book. Shipping was good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real thing","review":"This is the real thing. This is the original Highwayman art book that first documented the journey of the highwaymen, who they were and how they got here. It is referenced by countless sources as the official list of the original 26 highwaymen. The first half of the book is mostly text with a few example prints interspersed and the second half is all plates of representative Highwaymen art. There now are several highwaymen art books, including 2 more by this author but this book serves as the bible for Highwaymen artist history."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Highwaymen","review":"One of the first if not the very first comprehensive study of Florida's black regional landscape artist known since 1994 as \\"The Highwaymen\\". This book gives a good overview and a wonderful historical look at these \\"outsider artist\\", the times they lived in and painted in along Florida's treasure coast.

( Amazon Instant Video is great!) This was an awful movie in every way. It was dull, shrill, repetitive and certainly not funny. The 1959 black and white episode was delightful by contrast. The writers of today should take a look at how stories and children's comedy was done in the past. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"I have been a fan of Robert Wagner and the various movies and shows he has been in; but this movie was a let down. It appeared to be produced in a choppy and sloppy fashion and did not live up to the standards of movies and shows that he has been a part of. I would not reccommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Robert Wagner, nor would I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of family Christmas movies. I gave it 2 stars as it was a family and Christmas movie and did star Robert Wagner and that can be considered a gift of the Holiday Season soon to be upon us."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This is the first time that I have ordered something from Amazon.com that was inferior. The DVD \\"Dennis the Menace Christmas\\" had stops in it all the way through the movie. It would stop and then start again. Very aggravating to watch, especially with younger children. I did not know where to turn to get another one. I would appreciate help with this. Thank you Donna Heselbarth"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow movie for such a classic pair","review":"I have been a follower of Dennis the Menace for years, and thought that this sounded like a cute movie to watch. I did watch it completely, but half way I knew that I wouldn't be keeping this movie in the collection. Mr. Wilson has always been quite a character with Dennis, but in this movie he was just not what the character was meant to be.This movie is modern day(which is fine), but unfortunately the entire story was so slow that I turned it off several times. It kept jumping from one story to another. Also, Mrs. Wilson has always had a soft spot for Dennis, but in this movie she just didn't show any of this except to show what she wanted.If you have the chance to buy another movie, do so as even though this movie was quite inexpensive it was still too much for what it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"U.S Robotics Giga Ethernet Card","review":"Auwsome card.

Every hour or so, the NSLU2 hangs for a minute. Definitely annoying while creating documents, etc - but completely unusable for streaming MP3s, JPEGs, MPEG Video, ripping audio CDs, etc. I have to periodically copy all of my media to my PCs local HD for streaming out to my media players.-- Only Supports SMB. Linux+Solaris clients must use SMB, ala Samba instead of standard NTFS. This prevents UNIX file system features such as symbolic links from being used. NTFS access was deliberately disabled from the embedded Linux running NSLU2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly killed my drive","review":"Gotta say I was really interested in this device. Too bad I didn't know that it had to reformat my Western Digital drive before it would work.I plugged it in, THEN found out that it needed to reformat the drive. I never got far enough to actually tell the Linksys software to do that. However...Now, my drive no longer works. It used to work very nicely. But I can't use the USB connection anymore, and I only got the firewire connection to work ONCE. So I think that it some how toasted a perfectly working drive. Now I get to spend hours on the support lines with WD. I hope that THEY have tech support that actually speaks English.BTW, I returned this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad implementation","review":"I got this up-and-running in no time, however, it runs at an abominable pace. I calculated a transfer rate of 46k/sec, which is WORSE than a 56k modem for crying out loud.This is a good idea for a product and a lousy way to manifest it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall nice product but slow","review":"I bought this product to enable me to backup key personal data from the various computers in my house to a central location. Since I already had a USB 2.0 external hard drive I though this might alleviate the need to carry the drive between computers, which it does in some instances. It doesn't however in most instances.Because of the collisions and such on a wireless network, copying data to the drive via this device is really slow. It takes hours to copy over My Pictures or My Documents. That being said. If you are looking to use this device on your wireless network for backups, it is just too slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!","review":"I had high hopes to replace my old computer being used as a \\"file server\\" with this device. It is unreliable, clunky to set up and keep up. It needs to be hard booted almost daily to get it to work.When the Linksys Storage Link is working- the speed is great, transferring MP3s, Videos and large files with better speeds then the computer.Overall - the Linksys Storage Link is not wroth buying. Maybe- just maybe they will have a firmware update in the future that will make the re-boots un-needed and the whole device useful. Until then - I am keeping my files on the computer, and this device on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Support Windows Format Drives!?!","review":"Beware: you can't just hook up an external hard drive to this thing and expect it to work.You have to format the drive first using the Linksys utility, which will erase all existing data on the drive and render the drive unreadable by Windows unless it is plugged into the NLSU2.That's right: if your drive already has data, you'll lose it during the format. Once formatted, the drive can't be attached directly to a PC anymore.None of this vital information appears on the box, which is very misleading. I've sent mail to Linksys on this issue and heard nothing back.Misleading marketing.Bad service.Dumb engineering decision to not allow a windows formatted drive.If you have a totally blank hard drive and you don't mind the fact that you'll never be able to use the drive directly on a PC without the linksys box, then go ahead. Otherwise, steer clear.One star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap.,...stay away.","review":"I have many Linksys devices and this is by far the worst one. I love Linksys stuff, which is why eveything that i own involving networking is linksis. But this thing is a piece of crap and now i cant recover the 60 gigs of personal pictures that were on my hardrive because of this things format. Spend a little more money and get a dedicated Network Attached Storage hard drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got exactly what I paid for","review":"Shame no longer supported by Linksys - but the forum has plenty of advice - One word of warning - because this product runs using LINUX, if your external hard drive is not FAT formated you'll have to reformat it before it'll be able to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"It is a great product, I bought it to load the alternative firmwares (openwrt) and make it into a small wireless web cam.

What a flaky and unreliable piece of junk. I have two WD MyBook USB 2.0 drives on it, formatted EXT3. It only works within a few minutes of power cycling. After a while, the web page can't get the drive information, and my configuration settings are lost. Any computer in the house (PC, Mac, Linux) has hit or miss luck in navigating to the device and into any directories there. Sometimes it will list a directory, but clicking on any file there does nothing. Sometimes the file even disappears from the listing. After power cycling, all is well. 15 minutes later, in the weeds. Someone suggested I change the battery. Can't hurt since it's already past the warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I find the storage link to be very unreliable.

They stated that the supplied power adapter had a voltage range of 100V to 250V - utter rubbish. I only bought it to use for 240V in Europe and have had to go well out of my way to find it an alternative power source. Also there is no MacIntosh driver, however it is possible to configure the device through a web browser. They also fail to mention that the hard disc that is to be used with the device ought to be formatted by the device before use; download the latest firmware to get round this problem and it all 'sort of works okay'. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"No advance WARNING before purchase on severe limitations","review":"1) The Linksys Storage link does not allow WINDOWS formatted hard drives to be hooked in. That means you LOSE all data on the hard drive you plan to network. This is not explained anywhere in the sales hype (including at Amazon -- shame on you!)2) The SETUP does not work per their instructions. The hard drive will need formatting, and if not formatted in advance it does not recognize the hard drive. I was on the phone with a tech for 1:40 to sort out how to find the formatting instructions, as the provided information does NOT include any help.3) EXTREMELY poor documentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Require format of attached disks","review":"I bought this in order to two two USB drives into network attached storage. The setup was relatively straight forward until I got to the end. Problem is that this device requires that you format any drives attached to it, and the drives I have are full of pictures, music, and movies. Thus, this seems an odd product to have on the market.

Not as sluggish as some reviewers would suggest -- it is not direct attached storage, so you have to expect performance differences.However, when I tried to use it on VPN connected segments, it didn't work. I made 5 separate calls to Linksys technical support, and they jerked me around for the first 4 calls. Finally, the 5th techie, a senior one, admitted that they had never really gotten the device to work over a VPN tunnel. So much for the other 4, who made it seem that I was doing something wrong. DISHONEST! SHABBY! If you can find any indication on Linksys' web site that this doesn't work on VPN, congratulations. I lost 2 weeks and numerous hours on the phone due to this deception.If you're staying local, it's okay. With VPN = no way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NSLU2","review":"It is a good low priced solution for network storage.

It took awhile, but I figured this out as my router is of a different brand and used different defaults than this linksys device. The user interface is poor, not very intuitive, making it difficult to locate necessary settings. Everything is in it that you'll need, just hard to find. But the one thing I liked the least is you needed to format the USB hard drive specifically for this device, and without the device, Windows would not be able to read the data. The device absolutely would not work with the version of Norton Save & Restore I have. If for some reason you want a way of putting a USB thumb drive on the network - it does work well for this. 2 slots on the device, only one works with thumb drives - which it does not reformat, a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plug and Play NAS storage","review":"I would give it five stars, but having to reformat your storage to get it to work really is a pain. I had to scramble to move the data around a few computers to get it to work, then the time it took to move it all back.I will say once set up that I am extremely happy with the product, I have a 750GB drive and use multiple USB drives to move things around as well.I use this with Apple products, Windows XP, as well as linux, so it's definitely something you should consider. The user administration is a little clunky, but you will catch on quickly.User's can have their private storage areas as well as public storage. The NSLU2 is also extensively customizable from the linux community. I haven't had a lot of time to play with that feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing little thing","review":"I got this to hack the Linux image to run a low powered 24/7 weather station.

The ability to connect one or more drives to the network and be shared by computers on the network is a wonderful thing. The set-up was fairly easy, speed to copy is acceptable and can even be accessed via a Mac.However...When copying more than 10 gb, the connection will drop. You need to start the copy over again and only move 10 files at a time. Tedious to say the least.Tech Support has offered no working solutionSometimes you cannot connect to the drive without changing the device IP address.Crashes the accessing machine when encountering a problem.Nice idea but the engineering is poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost what the doctor ordered","review":"The good side? It worked fine with my Macs and fairly old Belkin wireless router. The bad side? I wasn't expecting blazing fast transfer speeds over ethernet (much less wireless), so that wasn't an issue. That it doesn't say on the box: \\"WARNING: YOU HAVE TO REFORMAT YOUR EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE FIRST!\\" is an issue, though I managed to find enough temporary storage to get away with the format without losing anything crucial.It's also unfortunate that it doesn't come with instructions for installing it on anything but Windows. A quick web search will address that quickly enough.Given that it reformats the hard drive to EXT3 format, I suspect it's running embedded Linux under the hood, which is cool but neither here nor there in the grand scheme of things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performed as advertised","review":"The NSLU2 worked well as a network storage link.

Partly because I don't have time and partly because this is a huge pain to set up. The storage link uses its own format for your hard drive. you must take everything off the hard drive and format it through the Internet. This takes forever, I have attempted it multiple times without success yet. Linksys needs to send a disc that will actually format the drive with the storage link. I am sure this would be a nice device if only I could get my drive to format. As of now, I am still looking into how to format it..
