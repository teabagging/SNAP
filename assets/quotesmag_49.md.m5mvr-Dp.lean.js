I wish that this film would be released in the original format, and not this poor demostration of what the message clearly should be to a general audience. I think everyone who truly loves this film as much as I do, should continue to complain until the film is released on both VHS and DVD in the original format along with any extra bonus features including the director's commentary (if available).

I take it that Ms. Oprah doesn't know how badly this movie is cut-up. I wish we could all get replacement movies. I've NEVER had a movie that was missing so many parts.

She seemed fakr; not what a real person would be like. Esspecailly in the scene where Mattie meets Butch. In the book the events in the scene flow together nicely. It had a lot of details and great descriptions. But in the movie the scene wasn't presented well. The events in the scene didn't flow together well. The two characters also don't look very real. The conversation they have looks rehearsed. Plus the reactions and facail expressions don't seem as real during the scene as they do in the book. The way Mattie was acting looked pretty fake and rehearsed.

I trusted this version to be complete. Why are you cheating people and lying to them. Un-wrapped or not, I am returning this DVD. I am very disappointed too, because I was waiting for this classic to be released in its full complete version for a long time. I have seen the full version twice before )plus read the book).

Still. . . so MUCH is here, regardless of the needlessly deleted material.How marvelous to see the younger Oprah Winfrey of 1988 when this was made, portraying the strong matriarchial character nurturing the six other women whose lives give snapshots of differing approaches to living--approaches that respond to life problems and give rise to both further problems and answers.How marvelous to have this thoughtful, rich portraal of characters and life situations in the African-American community. How marvelous, when they pick up those crow bars at the end and tear down that wall.--Janet Riehl, author, Sightlines: A Poet's Diary"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah Can't Act","review":"I think that the acting in this movie was not very good. Oprah could not capture the essence of Matty. Her facial features did not look realistic. She couldn't give a clear picture the way the book did. The movie, I think, left out alot of important detail. For example the movie does not show Baisil being spoiled. It did not show how he got away with everything. In the book Baisil comes down stairs, after washing, and Mattie was going to send him back and wash again, but Baisil kissed her on the cheek and said \\"I love you mom\\" and she let him stay.

He decided to turn the notes into a concise paperback book. This is a paperback book by Sir John Eccles describing the early neuronal physiology of both sensory & motor neurons, with a mention and discussion of interneurons. There is a discussion of motoneuron loops involving muscle spindles. The writing is largely predicated on Eccles own work and innovations on motor control and physiology. This is the strongest aspect of the book. He discusses the Hodgkin-Huxley Models, the action potential, EPSPs, IPSPs, and other aspects of cellular neurobiology. His writing is dry in this book so the reader must sit down and read sections or blocks of the book at different times to obtain the full benefit. The discussion of ionic fluxes and neural homeostasis is outstanding. This is a very good book for students of neurobiology to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful and portable","review":"It comes packaged like clothing.

It has all of the traditional elements of a seder presented in a way that kids can understand, and also will enable you to get through the seder on a brief enough timeline to get the point across within a child's attention span.

Should be Baby Dalí, not Baby Einstein, lol.Also the names of the characters in the book... some are named for what they are (Frog), a quality they have (Violet, which is a purple mouse) or just a random name they are given. I can't see how this would help a cild trying to learn the words for things; quite the opposite.

My daughter loves the friendly animal graphics that accompany the series. When checking out the book, it seemed to have a great concept, especially since my daughter loves to mimic things. When we received the book today, I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the quality of the \\"mirror\\". There is a \\"mirror\\" on the cover and on each page of the book. The \\"mirror\\" severely distorts any image due to the way it is made and laid out on the page. It in no way presents an image like a true mirror. I do not know how a child would be able to decipher her own image making the suggested faces in the so-called \\"mirror\\". It might frighten her more than anything else.

He really enjoys looking at the colorful illustrations and the mirrors on the opposite page. He now reaches out and turns each page when he is ready. And he also knows to expect me to blow into his hair when the cow page comes...since cow goes \\"puff and blow\\". He even looks at me when he sees the cow and smiles.I have had this book memorized for awhile now, but that isn't such a bad thing....since I can now look at my son while we read and see what he is thinking.

The title was interesting enough, and then I read it and couldn't wait to start my Spirit Singing practice! I've always been very inhibited, but this book shows you how to break through the barriers and open up and you learn how to express yourself and let your true voice come through. I'm interested in singing, and even though this isn't a voice training program, it shows you how to let go and not be afraid to sing. I also am interested in writing, and she does have a chapter on using this practice to write your own music. If you ever read \\"The Artist's Way\\" this is like Morning pages with sound!

Also remarkable is this amazing little book. Bizarre and even frightening at times, this small book chronicles a pain-filled, often incoherent journey. Perhaps one of his greatest gifts is his ability to truly put thoughts down on paper, no matter how strange they may seem. His journey takes us through his vagrancy as a street drunk, drug use, unusual thought processes, strange almost mystical experiences, to contemplation of suicide. These jottings may shock some and impress others. But no matter the effect, everyone should respect this writer for being willing to share such private thoughts and ideas. Bravo! Bravo! Encore!

He sounded like a pompous actor practicing A Shakespearian play, very unconvicing for the head of a spy operation. Lia was annoying, I like women that can take care of themselves but not her.

He was one of 200 RAF Hurricane pilots sent to defend Malta, the key to North Africa for the Germans. Malta never fell. Howard was one of the 6 of the 200 who survived, and he had been shot down three times. He wore the Maltese Cross. It was a real experience to get to know one of the TRUE HEROES who was a real fun person to be around.

Maybe not as good as Cold Comfort Farm but anyone who likes Stella's masterpiece would probably enjoy this one. It basically follows her usual fairy tale format, with just a bit of Jane Austen thrown in and focuses on life in a small village and its upperclass residents (and some of its lower class ones). I won't go into the plot details as there is a fairly lengthy description on Ms. Gibbons' nephew's website.

Using fairy tales and Shakespeare comedies as plot devices (The Tempest, A Mid-Summer's Night's Dream, Cinderella, Snow White and Red Rose....)and set in an Essex Village in 1938, it examines (punctures) the British class system and middle-class snobbery, anti-semitism and the totalitarian family system.

Even though this was written in the first quarter of the 20th century, and, by today's standards, may seem to be a bit plodding and overly detailed, all of the writing is necessary to set the mood, and, interestingly, tobuild up a certain kind of suspense.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys amusing insight into human nature.This is far superior to \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\"; much more discerning and interesting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, gentle fun!","review":"This book was so very satisfying, I smiled all the while I was reading it.

Yes, they perform a few songs in this live performance that are not on the other two (namely \\"Someone\\", \\"Always\\", \\"Unchained Melody\\", and \\"Goodbye\\") which is appreciated and adds some variety. But Russell's singing on this album is often strained and flat. It sounds like he was virtually gasping for air at times! Yes, every performer can have an \\"off\\" night, but this set would have vastly improved if better takes had been chosen from Air Supply's live performances than the selections here.

Still attracted to each other, Con and Susan question each other's motives for acting on their desire. Once Con dreamed of being St. George.

The pictures here on Amazon make it look like a shiny silver watch with a cobalt blue face. In actuality the watch is a dark gray color (with a dull finish) with a darker gray face. Not only do I personally not like that color combination, but I actually think it makes the watch look cheap. To make matters worse, I had assumed that this watch would be the size of comparable men's dive watches or luxury watches (e.g., slightly over sized). This watch is tiny - almost more of a size you would expect in women's watches. The small size makes it look even more like a cheap, $20 watch.

We are biological daughters of the women who gave us life--but we are philosophical daughters of the women who made it possible for us to vote, to have a career, to own a business, to borrow money.Cokie Roberts has ever so gently thrown down the gauntlet to all working women: someone made it easier for each of us--what are each of us doing to make it easier for those who follow us.Read this book and ask yourself what you have done with your woman power."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great record of American Women's Heritage","review":"This book was great! She covers women's contributions through the history of the U.S. without it feeling like a boring history lesson. Better yet she reaffirms the relationships that all women have, with their moms, their friends, their co-workers, and their spouse. I'm buying this one for my friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Must-Read","review":"I was intrigued by this book, and as a fan of Cokie Roberts, I read this book on a recent vacation. While I am all for praising our acccomplished family members, I don't charge to tell the public about them. I was bewildered by all the close relationships that she had, and think many memories have been embellished by time. I couldn't really figure out where she was going for most of the book, and believe many of her stories would have been better saved for delivery as eulogies at the funerals of the various people she panders to in this \\"book.\\" I think this book must have been written in conjunction with a course of therapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful discussions for working mothers","review":"If you like name dropping politics and social commentary and you are a working mother or love one-- then I highly recommend this book. It's full of insight and understanding about the difficulties and triumphs of working mothers.Cokie Roberts was born into a legendary political family and has become an outstanding journalist through hard work and a lot of support from others. She dedicates the book to those who have provided the support.It was a fun and inspiring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought the book was a little shallow and arrogant.","review":"I wanted to know more about Cokie Roberts. She is well connected and has a wonderful family. I never felt she let us into her life. So, the book is as satisfying as the morning paper. The depth of all her stories are like a 2 page newpaper column that leave you wanting to read the book. Where's the beef?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the tool I was looking for!","review":"This is a very nice tool for those of us who can no longer get down on our knees to work our garden. I am in my late 50's with a bad back so I can sit on the seat & all my tools are right at my hand. It really came in handy when it was time to pick my bush beans as I could sit in the middle of the rows & pick. The tools are sturdy & well made; each in it's own little pocket so there is no fumbling around trying to find them. A very nice, well made set."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great gift for the beginning gardner!","review":"I purchased this on a whim, looking for a birthday gift for a friend. She recently bought a house that has a small area for her to garden and I thought that this would be a perfect starter set.Having bought Strathwood items from Amazon before I knew to expect a reasonably good quality set. I took a thorough look at all of the items when I received them, even opening and sitting on the chair. I was very pleased with everything, but I think it would be nice if it came in a more presentable box. The mailing box is the only box you receive. Once it is open, the items are bagged up. I choose to use my own box to repackage and wrap it.My friend was very happy with the gift as she didn't have anything purchased yet and said she was looking forward to getting outside once the weather is more reasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Real Book","review":"Only read Cliff's Notes if your desperate, because the book is absolutly fabulous.

Thanks to the internet I was recently able to enjoy it again. Although I remembered nearly all of the details of the story, the setting, and the tone, I now see how the story provides a valuable commentary and perspective on profound issues from spirituality to consumerism not to mention the incredible power and resiliency of a cognizant and motivated person. Obviously the words on the page haven't changed since I first read it, but the world has profoundly changed - primarily in terms of the fall of communism - and I have obviously changed from age 12 to 30. This is an excellent and valuable book that I am grateful for having found, and then rediscovered - more people should be so lucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor book","review":"This book is poor. It 's not \\"philosophical\\" in any sense because it's not logical and it's not supported by the majority of music scholars today. Reimer contradicts himself at every turn; he doesn't understand what Langer is really saying; and. his absolutist notion of music is completely out of synch with what most scholars argue about music today. Reimer just mouths a lot of fluffy, feel-good nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd Edition, Same old stuff","review":"Reimer wants his readers to think he's done something important by putting his tired, old ideas into new words (here and there) and using a new cover. Only his rabid followers will agree. This is the same old stuff that Reimer has always tried to sell and it fails for the same basic reasons: Reimer does not have -- Reimer never had -- a plausible explanation of the nature and value of music. Reimer is obvioulsy desperate -- he's running very hard -- to save his legacy in this \\"third\\" book (the same book x 3!). But he cannot. He fails, again, because a new generation of music education philosophers -- Bowman, Jorgensen, Elliott, Regelski -- has already exposed Reimer's poor thinking, weak scholarship, and faulty logic in the past. This \\"third\\" edition is full of the same old problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is a gift.","review":"I concur with many of the 1 star reviewers. I do not care for this book or Mr. Reimer's writing style. While there are some decent points, the book is not an easy or interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read For All Music Educators","review":"This text presents an excellent philosophy of music education! It makes clear that the nature and value of music must be found WITHIN it, not outside. We music educators must express to the public that music in itself is good and should not be an excuse or tool for increased standardized test scores, etc. Currently, more and more music educators are forced to link musical attributes to scholastic activity. This deteriorates the nature and value of music. Author Reimer makes it clear that an aesthetic view of music education is a goal for all music educators to strive for."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a good example of bad philosophy.","review":"This book fails to offer a reasonable philosophy of music education because it is based on a notion of music (as a \\"presentational symbol\\") which has been debunked by mainstream philosophers for decades. The \\"absolute expressionist\\" theory of music and music education put forth in this book is so narrow and implausible it's hard to believe that any reasonable person would take it seriously. Because it misrepresents the nature and value of music, this book is invalid as a guide for music curriculum and instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best looking Automatics out there for the price","review":"It's no Rolex, but Fossil is a very well known and trusted name in the watch world, and this one doesn't disappoint. It may be a little oversized, but that style seems to be becoming more popular nowadays. I have a smaller than average wrist size, and this watch does not look awkward on my wrist one bit. And... It's AUTOMATIC! NO BATTERIES! It keeps time as long as you keep moving, so as long is this is your primary watch, you won't have any issues. I'm timing it right now to see how long it last on a fresh winding, I'll report back with my findings.Mine lasted about 26 hours on a fresh winding. Like I said, if it's your primary watch, you won't have a problem losing time, even if you take it off to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Thrilled.......","review":"I bought this for my husband for christmas and I had high hopes for it. It is a very smart looking watch and goes with both his business dress and casual weekend clothes. The only problem with the watch, (which is a big one!) is the fact that it keeps losing time. It is always speeding up or slowing down and he has to adjust the time quite frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lenox Old World Blown Ornaments, Set of 6","review":"THIS ITEM ARRIVED COMPLETELY BROKEN!

Read this book and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcore, in-your-face inner-city reality","review":"Masterfully written yet ultra depressing, this book unleashes a no-holds-barred account of life in the not-so-trendy part of town. It forces us to see what we try so hard to ignore, the ugly truth about New York's Lower East Side: drugs, pimps,prostitutes, dimestore criminals, murder. As painful as it is at times to read, it's impossible to put down. Kudos to Giovinazzo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn off the tv and get a real dose of reality!","review":"Wow.

I found his analogies weak and his allegories uninteresting. More to the point, the issue of grace is pivotal to a growing relationship in Christ. I would hate to cause dismay in a new believer who thought Mr. Lucado's take on the subject was the bottom line. May I suggest the Ragamuffin Gospel by Brennan Manning. Now there's a 10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Grip of Grace","review":"As always, Max Lucado has written an easily read book that gets to the point of how much Christ loves us and how much and how often he shows us Grace. The author has such an interesting way of giving examples that anyone can understand but they are often not the usual kinds of examples one readily thinks of. Max Lucado writes in a fairly simple way but the subjects are complex. Thus, I can easily and quickly grasp his point. I heartily recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREEEEAT!!","review":"This is such an awesome book, one of my favorite Christian books.

He can really get his point across and not force it in. Though he can be redundant at times it's all in his way of drilling in a point that means a lot to him. Great book, I would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fault finding bridge builder","review":"My review is not meant to be a beautiful write up for Max, I am sure he is a great guy, but hey, even his insurance company has problems with him. (I must be a the judgemental type) This book helped me realize that no matter how hard I try or how hard I think I am trying its not good enough. I cant jump to the moon, I cant make it up the river alone, and I cant place a value of a sin and try to \\"repay it with good\\". I am helpless. The book made me feel uncompfortable and small, but compared to God I think thats exactly how we have to feel to even accept his grace let alone understand it.I reccomend this book to anyone who is desperate enough to listen.

I was more tired than disappointed then, though a bit of both, to find that this is a far too breezy compendium of advice better gleaned from any number of more interesting sources. Readers would be better served to turn back to the masters of the genre---writers like Vincent Starrett, Christopher Morley, or John Carter, for the lore and practise of book collecting, and to the Bro-Dart catalogue for the tips on maintaining a collection.

Oh Hey","review":"Basically, this book had everything to do with Diablo, D2, and LOD. Unlike the other reviews I find this book right along the lines of the the Diablo universe. The constant war between Hell and Heaven, and mankind being stuck in between.Most people think Diablo is going to be in these books. If you play the game you know the story behind Diablo's undoing. These books are in the world of Diablo, based on other \\"mortals\\" defeating the forces of evil.Now for the plot, it was strung out, and at the end it left you hanging. But I would recommend it, for \\"hard-core\\" Diablo players.I give it a 4 out of 5. This book makes me want to get the 3rd book in series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has a bit more ambition than most, but it's still not good","review":"This really isn't that good, but I do admire the attempt to distinguish this book from others of its genre. Here the hero is conflicted by years of abuse from his father and has basically fallen apart after the death of his only real friend, and the demon who has returned is using the \\"healing of the sick\\" scam to gain power . Too bad the quality of the writing doesn't match the creative plot. Clumsy dialogue and less than memorable descriptions keep the reader from becoming enmeshed in the story, and after a short while the hero becomes a whiner instead of someone you'll actually care about. I don't expect much from this type of book, but it should at least be enjoyable. This didn't meet that criterion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wine Begginers - Here is your chance","review":"In the tradition of the CIG (Complete Idiots Guide), this book shows you, the wine begginer, what is wine, the different types, advantages, what to pay attention to etc. You'll find tis book a big help for getting started in the world of wine...Have a good time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great teaching tool.","review":"I have used this film for years in my 8th Grade US History class. It teaches about the Underground Railroad and slavery in an enjoyable way the students like. They hate for class to end when we are at an exciting part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching","review":"Until watching this movie, I hadn't given much thought to the fact that whites were very much a part of helping slaves with the Underground Railroad. I liked how the female character had gained favor with her master only to turn around and break camp with her handsome field hand. Both she and the field hand wanted to get married.Then came the suspense! Oh boy! Once the massah found out his little peach pie of a black girl had jumped ship, he sent the hound dogs after them.The ending, while not expected, was quite refreshing and uplifting. I gave it four stars instead of five because it could have been a little longer. Nonetheless, this is a Must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionaly Wonderful!!!!","review":"When I was in 5th grade, I seen this movie. When I heard the title I was determined to see it.

It looks great, so I'll be ordering another for the passenger side. The only problem is the elastic band. It goes around the back of the seat, but there is none for the bottom. As a result, the pad scoots all over the seat when I first try to get on. So I took a black bungee cord and wrapped it around the seat and over where the seat and back pads meet. Now it's on firm and being black, one does not notice it. I wonder how long the elastic back band will last. I wish they put on a stronger band. But overall, I' pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad buy","review":"this item would have been just what we were looking for , and the price was great , but upon the first use the spring broke , and i thunk they should have to replace them at no cost.

This blade is 8\\" vs. the traditional 7\\" USMC fighting knife. It also has a slot near the handle for locking blades. It is also thicker than the traditional USMC knife. The added thickness and length of the blade makes this a superb blade for survival applications. It comes razor sharp out of the box and features a beautiful black finish. The blade has decent heft to it (which I like) and you really know you are holding an excellent knife. The leather / nylon sheath is great and has excellent build quality.

It smells vaguely of polished gun, or gun oil; also of pure testosterone incarnate!The sheath included with it was more than I expected and was more than adequate for the knife.Also, having only viewed this knife on [...], I had not realized just how big this knife is!

I would prefer a kydex sheath, but don't think a factory one is available yet.

But no other artist delivers folk like Steve- he really is a poet/troubador in the old style.

They are made under license by Robinson Home Products.EDITED TO ADD: Our two year-old is now a three-year old, and he's moved up to the big utensils. His little sister is one year old and she's just starting on the toddler set. She adores the toddler fork and stabs food enthusiastically. I just watched her eat an entire helping of dinner with that little fork; it's sharp enough to stick into foods and holds things on the tines w/o slipping off like the plastic ones do.Sometimes our son asks for the Gerber graduates safety (red) spoon instead, but overall he seems happy with this set.Plus it looks good and grownup, which is a welcome change from plastic and primary colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Gift For Baby Shower","review":"This is a nice set for a great price.

It is not only the shared nostalgia most of us have for our early years that gives this book it's poignancy, but the quality of the writing itself. It has been described as a 'prose poem that flashes and winks', and certainly most people I know who've read it have been moved and delighted by the writing. If you liked 'Dandelion Wine' by Ray Bradbury then try this, and see what you've been missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn Back the Clock and Enjoy!","review":"Laurie Lee endeared himself to thousands of British readers whodiscovered this charming book about Lee's boyhood in 1930'sGloucestershire. The rural setting, the borderline poverty of thefamily and hardships endured by a single mother raising her familyof six children with little food but boundless love has become classic in England and in other countries. Simply told in delightful episodes, the title is based on Laurie's early encounterwith the plump and boisterious Rosie who has an endless supply ofpotent cider and lavish kisses for the young teenage boy - nothingshocking, just a sweet encounter. This was a quieter, gentler,more innocent time and even those of us who didn't experience thattime can appreciate the story of a young country boy's coming-of-age.

The low frequency problem seems more enhanced when listening to the radio, something that I now avoid. One thing this unit does better than the old JVC unit it replaced is that it somehow manages to separate the stereo channels far more cleanly. The separation is easily noticeable not only on my familiar MP3 songs, but also with FM broadcasts. If you like wildly enhanced bass output this unit is for you. If you would love making Barbara Streisand sound a lot like Johhny Cash, this unit is for you.

Complaints: short cord (it's like three feet long--what's up with that--I'm used to moving around while talking on the phone), the mic that records your greeting for the answering machine is terrible (it makes you sound like Darth Vader), and the power cord falls out easily, which means if you ever move the phone and it disconnects you have to set up the answering machine again.

When I compare this machine with the durability of my old Panasonic tape machine, which lasted over 15 years, I rate the AT&T product as wholly unacceptable.

Finally the thing could no longer even record the messages at a consistent volume. That was the last straw since I need to record the incoming messages to another device it became a worthless desk ornament. I hope my extended warranty saves me the cost as I now have to go and buy another phone. A desk speaker phone is not rocket science and AT&T used to be a trustworthy name, no longer all their work apparently goes to the lowest bidder. I feel cheated of both time and money.

I LOVE this pan! I highly recommend this specially manufactured, completely earth-friendly and fully recyclable aluminum pan. The cooking website I found out about it at recommended treating it similar to a seasoned iron pan by using a bit of oil for cooking, and NOT wash it with soapy water when done, but wipe it out well with a damp paper towel while still warm. I'm really happy with mine so far! All my other pots & pans are stainless and now with this non-stick aluminum I can do everything I did before on the old \\"Teflon\\" and it's much healthier -- maybe I'll send the old \\"Teflon\\" one back to the manufacturer to recycle?

Stroker Ace needs a sponsor and Ned Beatty, the owner of a fast food chicken franchise, steps in. Stroker becomes known as 'the fastest chicken in the south', which makes him the butt of a lot of jokes at the track. So then he spends the rest of the movie trying to get fired so he doesn't have to do ridiculous things like dress up in chicken suits and cut ribbons at restaurant grand openings.

If a person who really needed help with any of these topics read only this book I can see some real damage being done.

Any sensible person (or decorating magazine reader) already knows everything this author has to say. Actually, he does a far worse job of this than my favorite magazines do, because his tips are so vague and obvious.

I will admit that I was more in the market for a design guide, but this is more of a thought guide -- ways to THINK about your home that will make it a more enjoyable place to live.

The change was both jarring and off-putting for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh wind through the cells of your soul","review":"This book is beautifully illustrated and great value for money. The author explains how he has arrived at this work after a serendipitous path in his youth. After creating his own 'special place' in which the burgeoning youth felt secure enough to externalise the process of growth, the adult has now presented the formula for creating our own 'special place', merely by making us conscious of what makes us feel comfortable. A recent and equally wonderful book by Richard Patton entitled \\"The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years\\" also takes us down the inner path of youth to establish a comfort zone in which the the adult can sally forth into the outer world. Although at face value these books appear poles apart, they are in fact kissing cousins. At their core, both attempt (and succeed) at creating a satisfying meal for the Soul. Depending on how substantial a meal you want - you takes yer choice!

It seems to me that Holly Winter seems sort of like a lazy like character. Whenever someone insults her, she does nothing.She doesn't seem to show any affection or teddy bear love for her two malamutes. She feeds them and makes sure they don't fight, but other than that she does nothing. I don't think that I've ever read a Susan Conant book where Holly sits down, praises her dogs, and tells them that she loves them. She does a lot with the dogs, but shows little or no \\"loving care\\" for her dogs.A dog is not an object that can be dissmissed as Holly does.This book is very slow going."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's no Agatha Christie","review":"After seeking out and buying the entire Holly Winter series, this one -- my first hardcover purchase -- was the one that put me off the series for several years. Agatha Christie originally became famous by breaking one of the cardinal rules of the whodunnit (whoever is the murderer, it's NOT the narrator). In this book Conant breaks a different but even more important rule of the genre, which makes the entire novel pointless. I have not been so unhappy with a novel in this genre since Robert Goldsborough's faux 'Nero Wolfe' novel where the killer commits suicide halfway through the book, and the book continues on anyway. Later volumes in the Holly series recover some of the old magic, but this one is almost a total loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's NOT get to the point","review":"It's kinda funny how I was introduced to Holly.

None of the \\"regular\\" characters had any significant roles. It took me a long time to finish the book, because it just did not keep my attention. I just ordered \\"Evil Breeding\\".

Some of them are no more than soapboxes for the author to expound her beliefs. This one doesn't preach, for which I was thankful. However, the plot is thin, the narator blithers, the murder happens more than halfway through the story, it's obvious whodunnit, and the story (such as it is) just fizzles out without a satisfying conclusion. It's a shaggy dog story!Ms. Conant is capable of writing a darn good mystery.

That's it, plain and simple. Only consider buying if you're a true collector. Seriously, MegaBloks has shown it can be better. (I'm sure you see that I gave the educational value a 4.

There is nothing to build or assemble, the rock pillar cannot be attached to any other set, and the detachable dragon is designed with such a connector piece that he cannot attach to anything other than the rock pillar he comes with.The general idea behind this set is interesting. Magnetic force keeps the dragon's flame levitating above the ice shield, but this gets old pretty quickly. This set has no versatility or room for creativity nor interaction with other sets.

There are also some breaks with crosswords and fill in the blanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"This reader is a delight for the begining student of the Italian language. The Chapters are short and new words introduced are defined. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great place to begin real reading!","review":"Don't let the name fool you: you need some basic Italian before attempting this. My 11-yr-old and I have used Rosetta Stone for 45 min a week for six months, and then we tried this. We are plodding through and are very proud of ourselves! Doing this alongside \\"Essential Grammar\\" and \\"Verb Drills\\" is a complete beginning course in Italian. Great for homeschoolers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful to continue Italian studies","review":"I got this reader to continue my Italian studies, after I finished all my Italian classes. It's very helpful, because it is an interesting little story, and it reviews conversation techniques. I like the little quizzes at the end of each chapter. I haven't finished it yet, but I know it continues with some interesting literature. It defines some words that the reader might not know. There are some words not explained, so I linked it up with an Italian dictionary I bought from Amazon. Whenever I don't understand a word, I place my cursor on it, and the answer comes up. In that way, this book is more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"This is a good book to help you practice your Italian. I don't love it, but it isn't bad at all. It has three different parts, and as you read further into the book, more Italian pops up so that you gradually learn how to read Italian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best I've found","review":"For many years I've been self-teaching myself the Italian language and have tried several 'easy reader' and dual-language books. Most have been helpful but this is the best I've found yet. The book follows a story line based on individual chapters, all in Italian, that gradually progresses in the level of difficulty from what I'd call experienced-beginner level to intermmediate. There's good vocabulary help, and a short quiz at the end of each chapter that helps reinforce what you've just read.I think the book is best suited for someone at the experienced-beginner or low-intermediate level. Very enjoyable book but challenging. I wish there were more on the market just like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really for a beginner","review":"Good book, but not really for a beginner. It is really more of an intermediate level book. But the history of Italy chapters were fun and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A horrifying manor house crime","review":"Well-written fictional treatment of a notorious 19th-century murder, a murder which could have been the forerunner of any of Agatha Christie's \\"manor house\\" murders. The 4-year-old son of a wealthy family is hideously murdered, and although the reader knows who the murderer is, the author is successful in maintaining the suspense of just when, and how, the murderer will be apprehended. A successful view of English rural life and the interaction between the townsfolk and the \\"gentry\\". Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful historical novel","review":"I have read extensively about the Armenian genocide and emigration to this country because my grandfather was Armenian. This novel is both enjoyable and informative. The character development and weaving of present and past together are done well. Another great book on this subject, nonfiction, is Black Dog of Fate by Peter Balakian."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY RIVETING NOVEL","review":"I really enjoyed this well written and emotional story. It is a true story detailing the personal tribulations of an Armenian family during the Armenian Genocide of 1915 and the events thereafter as they assimilated into the American culture.

(I also just discovered Bill Burr, who I now love, but that's a different story).I have watched Power Play four times, and showed it on two separate occasions to my brother, and then to my friends, who also all loved it.I googled for any other comedy shows he's been in, and he's been in a few as a 'one of many' guest.

It is impossible to find in the stores so I ordered online. His style of funny is similar too many comedians out now. He uses jokes pertaining real female problems and everyday relationship problems and makes the problems hilarious. A person who has those problems would find them hilarious.

Carole is surprised and a little annoyed at first (after all, she's happy being a recluse and isn't thrilled at the prospect of being the Mother of the Groom and the wedding duties that she'll inevitably have to be involved in). But once she meets Stephen's lovely girlfriend Gaby and grows closer to Stephen, she finds herself acquiring the maternal instinct she never had before. (Wow, is Carole actually thawing out??)It's that maternal instinct that prompts her - along with trusty sidekick and New Age neighbor Jude - to find out why Gaby seems so distracted and why her family is being elusive and jumpy.The mystery itself is interesting and well planned, and there are a few heart stopping moments towards the end.Overall, this is a great installment in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets of Power Marketing","review":"The unique marketing ideas and concepts shared in this book are real winners!

It is about a crazy woman who is apparently going to a sanitorium-spa after yet-another nervous breakdown. She is traveling through Italy, but there is terrorism everywhere. We get a lot of flashbacks, which confuse more than elucidate. Andy Warhol makes some appearances, and he is just too creepy. Liz screams in that nasal fishwife way of hers. She thinks every man wants to have sex with her. The ending was supposed to be some kind of shocking explanation, but I was hoping it might come 45 minutes earlier than it did. If you are exploring the complete canon of La Liz's opus, save this one for last because you will hate it...and her. The DVD version I got had horribly bleached-out colors and was often unwatchable. Do not waste your time and money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time for a Chain: The Irish Chain Updated","review":"I love this quilt pattern. The end results look like it was difficult to do. This is the first quilt I ever made and it turned out great. I did a king size single chain. The pressing instructions make this go together easy.

The quality could have been much better, but over all it was very good. The drama was excellent, at times I had to pause it just to collect myself.

I found Manfredi's first book -'Alexander: Child of dream' a good and vivid read. It does a lot of background work on all the people, places, ideas that influenced Alexander to do what he did. I ended up liking Philip of Macedon very much. In way, I would like to think that he was the hero of this book, not only because of how he was portrayed, but also because, he laid the foundation of Alexander's dream. Its a good book to read if you are casually interested in Alexander, his land, culture, time and people. Translation as always might have lost the original flavour, but I do not think that it prevents it from being interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommened","review":"This is a good and educational read about the early stages of Alexander's life. I trust Manfredi's version because of his extensive background devoted to Alexander."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story of a great man","review":"Valerio Massimo Manfredi captures Alexander's life masterfully throughout this trilogy.Manfredi is a great writer, capable of maintaining one's interest throughout many many pages. Beside that, you can be sure that he knows his history, mainly the Ancient World, which he teaches at a university in Milan.Whatever he writes about Greeks, Romans, or anything of the like is a sure thing. You'll enjoy it, without any doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"I picked this up hoping for something in the vein of I, Claudius. I suppose I was setting this up for a fall, but I didn't expect it to be so bad. It soon became clear that the author just isn't very good at dialogue. Some of the problem is undoubtably due to the translation, which is almost childish in places. Beyond that, I found it a bit unnecesary to have details about Olympia's cleavage included while important plot points were glossed over.I quickly started reading with only the thought of getting a light historical background to Alexander, and skimmed over the most embarassing parts of the prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read about a great man","review":"Great telling of Alexander the Great's biography. The mythical and mysterious elements about history's greatest general gave me the unsure feeling of whether or not to stop reading and continue later on, or just finish the whole book... I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dry, flat lump of a book","review":"It must take a special talent to write about a character as dynamic as Alexander the Great and render him as interesting as a cold lump of grease floating on dirty dishwater, but that's what Manfredi has done here. This book is wooden, stilted, superficial and unconvincing. But at its worst moments the dry flat prose bestirs itself and waxes turgid and silly, and I literally cringed as I read it. The only character that takes on any sort of life at all is Phillip; the character, motivations and nature of Alexander himself are left blank by this mediocre effort at chronicling his formative years. I can only hope the Italian original was somewhat better. Won't be continuing on to read the others. When will I ever learn that \\"New York Times bestseller\\" is by no means a sign of quality?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as Renault.","review":"Perhaps much was lost in translation, so I shouldn't bash Manfredi too much. However, I simply could not get passed the rabid womanizing of Alexander. I accept that from Philip, after all he did have seven wives, countless romances with women and men, and was killed by an ex-\\"favorite.\\" I just didn't feel Alexander in this book. In Renault's novels you get a sense of a genius trapped in the body of a child. In Manfredi's book, all I got was petulance, vulgarity, and womanizing. Again, it could all have been lost in the translations. I'd read it, but in the end, stick with Renault."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, interesting read","review":"I got this book for a flight abroad and it was perfect. the story is engaging without being too dramatic and historically relevant without being tediously tied to fact. I think this book does a very good job of fleshing out historical figures as people with conflicting emotions and motivations (just like everyone else).

The final section on working from memory and imagination is particularly invigorating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a step-by-step tutorial","review":"A great concise treatment of techniques from the master. But be warned that this is not a step-by-step tutorial. Unfortunately, the 'Look inside' feature does not show a single excerpt.The chapters start of with a little introduction, there is a figure accompanying every technique and a short description of the technique.

In a nutshell, Bruce relates many of the events that happened during the 50's and 60's, tells of the \\"Blue Book\\" organization , the \\"Sign\\" and \\"Grudge\\" groups set up to investigate the UFO reports but after reading the book one thing stands out: The men in charge knew that the UFOs were not from any place on Earth and could only be from Outer Space but the Air Force whose job it was and is to protect us from all aerial forces...would NOT accept this solution.It seems that a \\"think tank\\" advised the United States Government several years ago to never admit that the UFOs were from another world, so that seems to be the way it will be... untill an Alien spacecraft lands on the White House."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Speechless!!!!","review":"If you haven't heard this, YOU MUST!

Other highlights are \\"There Was A Time\\", \\"Cold Sweat\\" and \\"Prisoner of Love\\". This disc is a huge improvement over the initial Apollo recording of 1962 that was a brief and hurried medley of Brown's songs that had a short running time of just over half an hour. The original vinyl albums for this recording had photos and linear notes and was one of Brown's best albums of that time. The CD is a great tribute to James Brown and his legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"One of the main reasons I purchased this CD was because of the song \\"Money Won't Change You.\\" This song is listed as #2 on Disc Two and it is not there!

The cd features many talented musicians surrounding the incredible sound of Dirk on the vibraphone.Some of the songs got decent SJ airplay in the late 90's, but you will find each song worthy in it's own right. They are melodious and genuinely uplifting. Wonderful to drive to, or as perfect background to anything.The album selections transition nicely, and Dirk allows his accompanying musicians, especially his guitarists to shine.If you like smooth jazz, you will not be dissappointed.

The third Diablo book uses the old lost city plot with all the tired, stereotypical elements:a beautiful young woman, and a benevolent king,who are not what they appear to be, a courageous hero, a stalwart companion, and a couple of sorcerers tossed in and you have the basic elements of this story. But what you really have is 339 pages of pointlessness and should be read only when you have nothing left around to read. I include cereal boxes and phone books in that list. Even for pulp fiction this lacks any originality and the only reason it was published is due to its tenuous Diablo connection. At least Book 2 tried for some originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classics keep on coming!","review":"I remember playing Buster Bros. and/or Super Buster Bros. arcade games.

Their 1997 comeback effort in contrast become much more milder and lighter and lack the impact and intensity they used to deliver during 80s.

The only exception, or rather an addition to this writing, will be A.

While this is absolutely true and it can discourage many from making such an effort, one must first question the motives of the publisher... How come that in this age of high tech the publisher didn't make any effort to correct the print?Search and you will find!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Dahl Magic","review":"I'm a Roald Dahl fan but this book doesn't come close to being as good as his other stories. It reads like a rough draft of an idea he had that was never fully developed into a finished story. I'm amazed Disney decided to have it published.The characters are flat. You never really like or dislike the gremlins, even though they are supposedly an enemy of the airforce, but later become friends. And Gus, and airforce pilot, is stupid and dull. Dahl has other stupid and dull characters in other stories but they are usually the villans and are presented with delicious, twisty Dahl humor. In The Gremlins, Gus is supposed to be a hero. The biggest disappointment was the lack of Dahl's signature humor. The story lacks so much of what you normally expect in a Dahl tale I kept asking myself with disbelief, \\"this is a Roald Dahl story?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gremlins","review":"I grew up with this book and have always had a soft spot for it. Roald Dahl has given us some pretty fantastic stories and this, being his first, is very special. The setting of the Second World War and the problems of the RAF fighter pilots is given a unique twist by using these fictional beings. Their antics are both humorous and serious. \\"War is hell\\" but with a twisted smile here. Dahl has kept his \\"twist\\" through out most of his writings so it's fun to see the beginning. The Disney characters are timely and representative of the story, I'm especially fond of the Fifinellas with their curly horns and demure manner. The Widgets are cute too. The book is wonderful for both children and adults. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Seuss's best.","review":"This book is mostly an excuse for Dr. Seuss to list off a variety of wild and fanciful sorts of birds. That aspect is cute, as per Seuss's usual, but there's not much else to the book. Meanwhile, the driving theme--taking eggs from the nests of very rare birds in order to make scrambled eggs with them--seems so blindingly unethical to the modern eye that it becomes difficult to enjoy the inventive imagery. There's a reason this book is not one of Seuss's better-known works."},{"rating":"1","title":"scrambled eggs definitely NOT super","review":"The message in this book is very outdated and a nightmare to anyone interested in preserving the environment. I love Dr. Seuss and ordered many of the books for my son. This one however I have to send back. The little boy, not content with hens' eggs, travels far and wide to snatch the eggs of countless rare and exotic birds. He prys off a mountain top to get at one bird, and cuts down an enormous tree (old-growth dimensions) to get at another. And he collects literally thousands of eggs, just to cook up for himself and perhaps his family. This story may have been funny when it was written almost 50 years ago, but today it describes little more than environmental destruction and selfish waste. This is definitely not the message I want to give my son, and I am sending back this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not among his best","review":"Of all Dr. Seuss' wonderful, inspiring and delightful books, .... this is not one of them.It's very long and rather monotonous. More birds, more eggs, over and over again. There are only 2-3 pages of anything besides that. And unlike some of his other books, this one doesn't seem to have a shred of educational or inspirational element."},{"rating":"2","title":"revealing the real \\"democracy\\" in the USA","review":"For me, the most interesting chapters are about actual US support of totalitarian and dictatorship societies, where we have the very convincing (and for me not-so-shocking) example of Cuba. I also read \\"The New World Order\\" and definately hope that each and every one of us will not blindely swallow all the manipulative information that TV serves us every day. I also hope that people will start wondering \\"what's behind\\" before they decide to judge the political happenings in some other country. Comming from the state whose citizens are being constantly satanized by American media in the past 9 years, and bombed by the US government, I will be more than grateful one day when I see Mr. Epperson's view of how and why the Serbs were used by tne New World Order,and why is US government actually supporting our president in his attempts to tear my country apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"America is a Continent, not a Country!","review":"\\"America\\" is a \\"Continent\\" divided into North, Central and South America and not a Country!United States isUnited States!

Other than that everything elseis a great story about the corruption in this Country. I so wish the day the Lord Comes!

It is the most poorly cited, inaccurate, biased, piece of filth that has left the press in recent memory. Of course, it contains all the mandatory dogma of the religious right; from the ad hom attacks on anyone who isn't a strict Christian (and even they are in trouble if they aren't member of the John Birch Society) to the appalling chapter dealing with evolution. However, Epperson saves most of his scorn for people who dare to have slight doubts about his wacky and poorly constructed theory. Therefore, unless you want to purchase a boring poorly constructed book, just for the sake of buying something, I would recommend that you stay away from this book at costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly written","review":"While I am quite interested in the subject matter, the author's horrible presentation (including poor citations and inadequate attributions, grammatical and punctuation errors, poorly-constructed sentences that must be reread several times to understand the meaning, unnecessary explanations of the obvious [such as explaining who Rose and Joe Kennedy were and what \\"immutable\\" means] and fallacious reasoning make this book a complete and total loser. If you can find a copy of this book (which may not be easy to do since the author is self-published) in the hands of a friend or at your local library, for a good laugh you can read the chapter entitled \\"Science versus Reason\\" -- it's quite entertaining! I never laughed so hard....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumps to completely irrational conclusions","review":"Seriously, breaking down John Lennon's song \\"Imagine\\" and comparing each verse to \\"Marx's teachings\\" is no concrete proof of a new world order conspiracy. All through the book the author takes metaphorical quotes from historical individuals literally to illuminate his claim that every event from the last 300 years (as of 1985) was a conspiracy.

Though his conclusions maybe radical, skeptics will be hard-pressed to deny that his factsare solid. He has collected an expansive amateur study ofwestern history which suggests the influence of \\"unseen\\" forcesin mankind's path to globalism. If only as a method to relearnhistorical events from a different perspective, I recommendthis book to anyone who has suspected that those in power, despitethe rhetoric, have always had self-serving and sinister intentions.In many ways a precursor to Jack Flannel's multi volume historicalrecord, RE's Unseen Hand remians a fine review of western history ina useful and engaging format.

This is a key thesis statement made in this outstanding book. I took economics in college and found it summarized here. When you stop and think about \\"WHAT\\" and \\"WHO\\" influences the world (as it's spelled out in the book) you'll begin to understand the \\"WHY's\\" and \\"HOWS\\". Want to know what's going to happen to Clinton and Why, read this book. If you understand that those elected to power in this and other countries take their orders from other people at higher levels of power, then you'll begin to understand what's beginning to take shape in this and other countries of the world. If you only read one book (other than the Bible) read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I had such high hopes for this book. I was overjoyed when it arrived. Unfortunately, it is poorly written and based on misconceptions about the beliefs and intentions of the founding fathers. This book has STRONG Christian overtones, and the author takes his beliefs about god to a shocking level. It almost feels intrusive. As a person who considers herself a humanist, I was deeply disturbed by the content of this book. The Unseen Hand is completely and absolutely insipid. If you are a rational human being seeking answers, I strongly advise you to look elsewhere.I am so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Unseen Hand- rational people need not apply","review":"I have an open mind and admittedly I was intrigued with the concept of a conspiratorial view of history. However, it didn't take more then a few pages into this book to realize that it was a waste of time, money and space for a variety of reasons. First, it is simply poorly written. Second, it is boring. Third, completely inaccurate (unless you are a member of the John Birch Society then it is right up your alley.) Third, it is poorly cited, I am never as seen many ellipses in an entire book as I saw in the first chapter of Epperson. Finally, is clear Epperson doesn't really believe this drivel; he just wants to make a buck. Please don't encourage him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"Other reviewers have stated the storyline so well that I will not re-hash it here. I loved that Emily is plain and overweight - as she states herself \\"she inherited her mama's mousy brown hair and pudding bag figure.\\" What a wonderful twist to actually make the duke prefer (and eventually come to love) such a plain woman when he had four lovely blond beauties awaiting selection as a bride. A Regency novel just like the TV show \\"The Bachelor!\\"Jarad (the Duke of Montford) truly did have a dilemma - in fact several. And he was getting no where close to solving them. Most Regency's never supply men solid friends outside of drinking and gambling clubs, so I especially enjoyed Jarad's relationship with his cousin/secretary.

This one received excellent performance reviews from various sites I found on the web. String quality and grip material are average, but personally I like the frame material. Its far more durable than graphite. I've strayed away from graphite after having seen so many break during play. This racquet completely enhanced my game from the standard cheapo. I've loved it.I would recommend before purchasing any racquet that you consider the handle size and the racquet weight as well as string tension, etc...

The entirely hand-written book is filled with artistic flair, from stylish emphasis of text to beautiful and fun full-page illustrations of key concepts. The book's consistent informal and friendly tone ensures that the learning process is as painless and enjoyable as possible.My only complaint is that there doesn't seem to be enough detail about how to shape the glass.

They are \\"Inside the Third Reich\\" by Speer and \\"The Price of Glory\\" by Horne.

It is an honor to have the opportunity to review such an excellent work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way history should be written","review":"Alistair Horne's epic about Verdun is one of the best history books I have ever read. He provides detailed information with the style which makes all the facts flow. Not only does he detail the battle itself, but takes time out to describe the adventures of a German Sergeant Kunze who infiltrates Forts Douaumont. What makes this chapter different is the almost minute by minute retelling of the soldier's activities. He actually stops to eat in a fort surrounded by the enemy with prisoners he captured locked in a broom closet!I have previously read How Far From Austerlitz? by Horne and enjoyed it as much as Verdun. This book is the second in a three part trilogy covering the Franco-Prussian War (The Fall of Paris) and World War II (To Lose a Battle France 1940) All definitely worth the time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book though it takes a while to get used to the author's style. But the tale is gripping and he brings many of the principal actors to life, in all of their incompetence in many cases. This book does suffer, however, from one problem, though not as badly as in his book about the Algerian conflict (which I had to give up on); his assumption that the reader is conversant in French and that it is therefore perfectly acceptable to move the narrative along with untranslated quotes in that language. He does the same with German quotations as well. Annoying, but it dies off later in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic of military history","review":"Not much that can be added to the previous reviews submitted to Amazon.com.

It documents 13 months of combat that led the French Army to mutiny and go on strike in the middle of the war. As with any book by Mr. Horne, it is well-documented and written.

However, I found that it is little more than a shameless tear-jerker that doesn't even begin to accomplish that.

They are fantastic products, and for a beginner in the digital photography world, they are simple, yet offer speed and quality you will want to have as you get more and more involved in your hobby. I have bought a 32mb SanDisk Smart Media card, and I love that too. I decided to invest in the 64mb card because I started taking pictures at the higher quality selection on my camera. What I can't figure out is why my camera cannot select the higher quality mode when this memory card is in it. I am REALLY disappointed. Sure, I can take almost 1000 low quality photos with this card; I know that's amazing.

The male drummer and 2nd guitarist are the only backing singers and are absolutely useless at it, completely unable to reach the highs most notably in \\"Give me the night\\" which just sound ridiculous. Bizarrely it looks like someone thought it would be a good idea to have middle aged women dancing in the front, one of whom cringemakingly gets up on stage bumping and grinding while Benson struggles to carry on not knowing what she is going to do next. Benson looks like a fish out of water throughout the whole thing and just plays completely unenthusiastically, looking like he can't wait to finish it.

The audience are fully lit, the orchestra don't understand or feel the music, there is NO atmosphere, in fact it looks like it was shot in a large school hall! Halfway through, middle-aged women get up and start \\"dancing\\" as if they were at a 70's school reunion. I don't normally bother writing reviews but really want to spare other George Benson fans the let down that this disc caused.

Benson handled the situation with class and dignity as one would expect. The music went on without interruption. And yes, these things do happen at live concerts. Some folks need to lighten up a little.Benson is an amazing performer and this DVD shows off his incredible talent and versatility. The set list includes his biggest hit songs, and the audience is enjoying every delicious morsel of it. Who can blame them for wanting to dance? I couldn't sit still while watching it in my living room.If you like George Benson, you will probably enjoy this concert. On the other hand, if you're the type that would toss out the Ferrari because a bug hit the windshield, this concert may not be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was breathless ...","review":"George Benson is an absolute legend. If you don't believe me, see him in this 2000 concert! While not all of his hits are covered, the ones I love are. Nothing can prepare you for his performances of \\"This Masquerade\\" and \\"Breezin'\\". Simply stunning, turn up as loud as you can.DVD SUMMARY: The DVD I have boasts both a DTS soundtrack and a 5.1 mix. Most times I would pick the DTS soundtrack on a music DVD, but on this occassion, the 5.1 mix has a more natural sound to it. If you have a surround sound system, choose this mix over the DTS. An earlier DVD release features a 2.0 mix which is ideal for people with only two speakers.A wonderful DVD that should be in your collection. Its only letdowns are that the playlist is rather short, and the amount of overweight ladies in the crowd (as mentioned in other reviews)."},{"rating":"1","title":"too old to rock\`n roll to...","review":"Disappointing for all who expect GB as a brilliant musician.The dvd sound is bad an the whole concert made me feel like a benefit concert for former great musician.The pictures do the rest.Watching 60 year old irish women,dancing in front of the stage and the disappointing music made me stop the dvd and bring it back to the store.Sad.sad,sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tres pauvre","review":"pas d'ambiance et aucun intéret pour un DVD (avec des images...), autant acheter un bon CD !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heat, what heat?","review":"It is 75 degrees in my house.

While the sound quality on several cuts is less than stellar, the rarity and quality of the performances more than make up for it. The last 16 songs, taken from the Armed Forces Victory Parade of Spotlight Bands broadcasts, are notably entertaining, with Bernie Mackey replacing Charlie Fuqua on guitar. A number of dubs from the Pardon My Sarong film round out the disc. The most intriguing recording is a version of \\"The Lamplighter's Serenade\\", which was apparently taped at a private residence from a radio broadcast in 1943. The liner notes tell the listeners exactly what they're getting and in great detail. While \\"Rare Air\\" isn't a substitute for an Ink Spots \\"hits\\" package, group harmony collectors will certainly be entertained and pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these shoes, have them in 3 colors","review":"This is my second pair of black ones.

The dragon Fafnir isn't fully explained, but at least he/it is in the movie.

Hamilton covers the Siegfried story in her book, but she does a terrible job of it. I've found some other sources, but as wonderful as the tale is, it can be confusing. This film is an excellent aid when teaching the Siegfried story. It is true to the tale to a great degree (it outclasses TROY and BEOWULF in this sense big time) and my students thoroughly enjoy it. It's fun and despite being a \\"TV Movie\\" it doesn't look cheesy. I only gave it four stars because it's set in the 5th century but Gunter lives in a stone castle.

Microplane started out making woodworking tools, until someone noticed that their shaping tools can also be used as truly superior kitchen graters. Cooks have been exulting over them ever since.Try one. You'll never go back. Microplane graters cut rather than rip. When you gently stroke a fine-gauge grater over the surface of an orange or lemon, the zest comes off in perfect little shreds. The citrus oil stays in the grated zest, rather than getting wastefully splashed around the way it does when you use an old-fashioned ripping grater. The coarser gauge grates cheese beautifully, with far less effort; and because you aren't pushing so hard, you don't break your main block of cheese.It's the greatest new kitchen gadget of the decade.

You can also use Mega Man's sister Roll to combine items you find to make special gadgets, such as rocket skates, spring shoes and a protective helmet! You can combine different buster parts that you find to enhance your buster gun too. There is also a pretty good story line to the game too. Unfortunately, the game doesn't quite follow the old Mega Man story, there isn't a Doctor Light or Doctor Wily in this game. If you like action/adventures or Mega Man then this is the game for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These crabs are delicious & their customer service sounds on top of things!","review":"I have ordered from this company several times and they are prompt when returning calls or emails if you have any concerns or questions.

The title of the book is a little deceiving, the author talks a lot about option instead of stocks and half the book is about stock splits.Chapters 1-4 are about general info, such as you must buy and sell to make money, don't hold for a long time. You must research the stock before purchase, EPS must increase every year. I didn't find anything in those chapters that I didn't already know.Chapters 5-10 is all about stock splits and when to purchase the stock as well as when to sell. Once again, the author talks about the obvious; buy when you hear that stock is splitting and sell after the split before the after split dip.Chapter 11 gets into more advanced trading techniques, the bull put spread. This is not something that I use or will use in my trading.Chapter 12 is the concluding chapter"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for your help","review":"I can finally see the \\"picture\\" on the charts and I am doing much better with my trading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another waste of time from a complete idiot","review":"See my review of his other waste of time for more detail.

The key to successful trading is having a set of methods that can work in any market, or at least keep your losses limited during tough times. This book niether provides any insight into profitable strategies that work today or lessons on how to keep losses to a minimum (in fact I KNOW that his guys averages his losing trades...losers average losers, mark).

It emphasizes different strategies for trading stock splits. I have seen many different stock split strategies on various websites and in other books, but this puts them all together. Further, the book is inspirational. While it provides essential trading information, it also inspires the reader to believe in himself--an essential element of successful trading.

Easy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding content that is understandable w/ real examples","review":"I was very impressed with the content of the book and the way the author presents material in an understandable and approachable way. After reading the book I have already started to use the strategy of buying leap options on companies before the split date of the stock. I recently purchased options on Rambus and made over 400% return on a minimal investment. I was able to personally meet Mr. Larson recently at a local seminar and was very impressed with his attitude and enthusiasm for helping traders manage their own portfolios and outperform the market. I would highly recommend this book to traders of all experience levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for serious investors","review":"I found this book to be insightful and inspirational. It was extremely helpful to have all strategies explained with entry and exit points for stock splits in one place! I really liked the inspirational sayings on each page.

I was excited to recieve the book because all the previous reviews were so great. Don't be fooled this book is a piece of junk. After 15 minutes of playing the songs in the book it was appearant that none of the songs sound anything like the originals. I took the book to his guitar instructor and she tried playing the songs and completely agreed that the book stinks. My only guess would be that the previous reviews had to be written by the composers friends.

It's supposed to be bone white, which anyone knows is a browninsh/yellow white. This register is grey. I even took it into my master bath that uses dove grey and it was perfect in there. You need to change the color of to grey instead of bone white."},{"rating":"2","title":"They do the job","review":"These are nice, but I am having a couple of problems with the sliding piece coming off and falling into the floor vent however. Also, be aware that the top profile of the vent is curved, so if you are placing this in a spot where people walk they are likely to trip over it. As for the sliding pieces falling off of them, well, I finally just decided to take them off and let the air blow full force from the vents. So they do the job, and they don't rust like the metal ones. And they are very sturdy. I've stepped on them numerous times and not so much as a hint that they will crack or break. Overall, I'm happy with them. They do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"there is a new edition out (3rd) 2010","review":"I only read the 2000 edition which is a good book for anyone interested in finding out more about Alan Wilson.

When word got out the he was signed to Interscope Records,(home of west coast comrads Jurassic 5), the buzz grew even bigger. On this LP, he must have lost plenty of motivation as well as patience because his work on the album is sub par. The tracks are unimaginative, the beats generic and repetitive, and overall the album seems more like a demo tape than something you would want people to hear. Planet Asia has too much talent to release a CD this unlistenable. Buyers beware, don't get this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tracks but hard to find full recordings","review":"I really like these CDs, especially the tracks by Oxy-gene, Users Atmosphere, and Amphasis. Great to listen to on head phones when giving a vigorous massage to your lady. But, I can't find CDs by the individual artists. I know that the genre is mixed, foreign to the US mostly, but damn, there are some fine tracks. Of course, D&K's mellow tune Homebound is there and available. I think one of their best tunes off of Freaks and Icons. The eerie Heaven or Hell by Walter Moslan is just that. Safon's Strawberries Delight, Kimiri's Churchottement de la Plage, and Minos 8 with Elysian Fields are just pure chill. All in all, a good pair of disks with enough to please without too much other fill. Plenty of smooth and some wierd. What more can you want?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abomination!!!!!","review":"In all the years I've dealt with Amazon, this is the first time I've wanted to throw a CD away after hearing part of one song!

There are too many moments where nothing is happening musically and other moments where the lyrics are too heavy-handed.. The pretentious \\"Suffer Little Children\\" is an example of the group's attempt at covering a serious subject, but the song goes on far too long, wearing the listener down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning","review":"And it was the beginning for them and for me. Finally, after years lurking around, I found songs with lyrics that had to do with my life. Miserable lie is fantastic and any any album that contains the anthem Hand in Glove must be rated 5 stars. Smiths: something else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting beginning","review":"As a Smiths/Morrissey fan, one is almost obligated to rave about this album. I could never really warm up to it. Aside from the excellent songs that became the singles, the other tracks leave me cold. Its shows the promise yet to come, but this one is a little raw for me. It does and will stand as a mile stone of modern alternative music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply unrealistic","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The main character was out of her mind, you do not stay in an abusive relationship, Christian or not! I thought her reactions to Tanner's abuse were unrealistic. I would not want either of my girls to read this book for fear that they would think that the relationship between Stacy and Tanner was acceptable. I thought the plot line wrapped up a bit too neatly in the end, the writing was creative enough to keep my attention. Overall, poor story line and frustrating plot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who brings forth the wind","review":"I love this book it is a great story of struggles and triumphs. Life can be full of both.

I will guantee this book to be enjoyed by all who read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"This was another winner from Lori Wick.

This was a definite showing of that talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book I ordered","review":"I have to say that when I ordered this book I thought I was ordering the same book I've had before, but it wasn't. The picture that i was shown, was the book that i wanted, but the book that i actually received wasn't the same book that was shown to me online. I just wonder how many more people have had the same problem with this site. If I wanted the book that they sent me instead, I could of gotten it without ordering it on this website. I'm kind of disappointed, and won't make this mistake again. Thanks for the high hope, but it won't happen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good songwriter","review":"but an over-rated average guitarist. I just saw him be completely overshadowed, blown away, on the same stage with the Great Mato Nanji of Indigenous on the BB King Tour. It really brought it home how Kenny's playing is pre-thought out, he doesnt take chances, never \\"takes off\\" while Nanji is a rocket-powered roller coaster ride. I like his songs, but they should down-play the \\"guitar great\\" angle - and it's too bad he can't sing - the singer in his band has an annoying stage presence. Kenny prances around too much too. Makes me like this record less (before concert I would have given it three stars)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Formula driven blues by \\"newest sensation\\".","review":"Rock critic Rick Hagedorn says \\"If you do nothing else with your life, buy it on the way home\\".

After your first album, I thought I had discovered another in the many up and coming young white blues guitarists. I don't know whose idea it was, Kenny's or the record company's, to turn him into a rock star instead, but it was a bad idea. What we really don't need is another loud screaming rocker. Let's hope he sees what a mistake this album was"},{"rating":"1","title":"Downgraded for vocals","review":"As a Blues fan, I throughly enjoyed Ledbetter Heights. As fans know, Ledbetter went platinum shortly after its debut. With success like that, it is hard to imagine that lead singer Corey Sterling, now with the Chris Aaron Band, would be dumped for a greasy, load mouth exhibitionous performer like Noah Hunt. My 2 star rating is attributed to the vocals. I for one do not like the change."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"The music wasn't bad, however the vocals are a MAJOR disappointment. I kept expecting something better with each song. Then I realized the problem; there was no raw feelings conveyed, no personality, no life. You can't sing blues songs with a polished pop voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shepherd is a good guitarist, but too derivative","review":"Shepherd knows his instrument well, but he's not the best blues guitarist out there. The Stevie Ray Vaughan influence is so strong sometimes it feels as if I'm hearing SRV himself, albeit a more tepid version. Heck, if I want to hear Vaughan, I'll go out buy his CDs why should I care for any wannabes? That said, this can copy Vaughan to a scary degree. Still if you want to a real modern blues virtuoso, I'd suggest you check out this Chicago virtuoso called Melvin Taylor. That guy is something else altogether. Trust me, I couldn't believe anyone could play like that when I first heard him."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all been done before... But MUCH better!","review":"While the first KWS release showed promise, this sophmore effort serves up nothing more than rehashed texas guitar slinger crap-ola.Wake up people!!!

With the single \\"Blue On Black\\", blues rock had made it back onto rock radio in the late 1990s, which was very refreshing at the time. For sure, tracks like \\"Slow Ride\\", \\"Everything Is Broken\\", and the other big rock radio track \\"Somehow, Somewhere, Someway\\" are all great jams. \\"(Long) Gone\\" and \\"King's Highway\\" are among the other many highlights. There are not really a lot of slow tracks on this (or any KWS) album, but for sure the track \\"I Found Love (When I Found You)\\" is a great slower song.The reasons for comparing KWS to Stevie Ray Vaughan are obvious, and I wouldn't go as far as to say KWS is quite as good. Nonetheless, he is right up there as a blues-rock artist. If he continues to perform and put out new material (it has been awhile now), his status will someday be legendary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD, but Kenny Wayne should stick to the blues","review":"I saw Kenny Wayne Shepherd at the B.B. King Blues Festival in Columbus, OH and was just plain blown away. I had this CD before I saw him, and he is a much better performer live than he is on the CD. He and the singer(Noah Hunt) seem to hold back too much on the CD and don't let go as much as they do live. It is a good CD, but I hope he doesn't stray too far from the blues because this CD is a very rock orientated affair. I feel that he should stick with more traditional blues like he did in his first album. If he does return more to the blues, I think he deserves the title as the next Stevie Ray Vaughan, but if he continues on down the path to plain rock he would be selling out. He needs to play what he wants, but I hope he doesn't forget about the blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"go listen to real blues","review":"basically... kenny wayne is one of the worst excuses for a blues guitarist ive ever seen. i mean sure hes got a little speed but he's pathetic in comparison to pretty much any other guitarist out there! seriously he can't even solo over chord changes! i've heard him compared to the likes over SRV. whoever thinks that is plain deaf. if you want some real hard hittin blues guitar.. go listen to stevie ray, freddie king, albert collins or johnny winter. i feel bad for any music fan who wastes their money on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great blues-rock album","review":"I love this album. I didn't give it 5 stars only because I know once the band grows, it'll be even better. And, besides, I only reserve 5 stars to the greatest bands (Dave Matthews Band, Radiohead). But undoubtably KWSB will get there someday! The songs aren't just catchy, but well done. Noah's voice is great, and Kenny's guitar rocks, as does the rest of the band. Yes, BAND. It's not just Kenny!:-) If you like blues-rock, go for it. If you don't ... go for it! It's a great album for anyone to have. I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"More!","review":"It has been a long time since I've heard a guitarist and singer with chemistry like Shepherd (the guitarist) and Noah Hunt (the lead singer).

The cd's combination of songs shows the range in which these musicians can perform, from gritty blues to rock classics. Thank you for sharing such awesome music."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive blues effort","review":"This is a rarity - a complete album of good, varied songs with a strong common undercurrent of Kenny's guitar and vocals. Covers the major modern blues genres -- fast 12-bar, \\"she left me\\" blues, ballads, Jimi-like vocal/guitar conversations, Vaughn-like 12-bar guitar riffs, etc. Good drumming/bass backup, varied instruments (piano, harmonica, wa-wa guitar, etc). I was hooked from the rockin' first song, and look forward to wearing out this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kenny Wayne Shepherd","review":"This man was definately sitting in the front of the music class. I plan on obtaining more of his cd's. For all that appreciate \\"Blues Rock Style\\" this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is What Modern Blues Should Be","review":"Excellent second offering from this guitar virtuoso. The influence of Stevie Ray Vaughn is hard to miss, but the vocals of Noah Hunt give the KWS Band a distinctive sound. Somehow, Somewhere, Someway and (Long) Gone are the best of the bunch, but Blue on Black was the radio-friendly hit. This is what modern electric blues should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BLUES/ROCK FUSION","review":"Interesting sound. Kind of a cross between Eric Clapton and Southern Rock. Great vocals.

I loved the fact that I could actually tell the influences of BB King, Muddy Waters, and more as I listened to Kenny Wayne Shepherd belt out the blues. An excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"KWS on the money with Trouble Is","review":"Kenny Wayne Shepherd has done it again. He truely has his own unique and refreshing take on Texas-style blues. \\"Trouble Is\\" is an outstanding first-listen and just gets better every time around. There are distinct hints of Stevie Ray Vaughan and B.B. King, yet KWS is completely original. Have we mentioned that he's only 20-years-old? A must for any blues fan looking to expand his/her collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"This CD is a great showcase for Kenny Wayne Shepherd's guitar prowess but isn't a great album. Blue On Black is well worth buying the album however. Slow Ride, King's Highway and Somehow Somewhere Someway are also good songs. This album lacks a solid slow blues song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance","review":"I have not heard of this cellist before, but I am guessing I'll be hearing more of him soon! This is a fantastic cd, and I recommend it highly. The cello playing kind of reminds me of Rostropovitch - very singing, with a rich sound. The recording quality is beautiful, and the repertoire is great. I hope this guy puts out another cd SOON."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"The Baby Bistro Box is very easy to use.

This was about a sculptor turned serial killer. Plenty of excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love ALL Higgins books","review":"I am in the process of reading all Higgins fiction books written, and I have completed about 2/3 of the list. There is no such thing as a \\"bad\\" Higgins book - every one I have read has been a great read! My only complaint is that there are some Higgins books that are not published for Kindle on Amazon. I have been catching those one-by-one at the used book store. I strongly recommend this book as a quick and interesting mystery read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a long term Jack Higgins fan who was sorely disappointed by this book.

A game can have pretty graphics sound great, and have all the bells and whistles in the world and still play like [...]. This game might not be as pretty as the Saturn version, but who wants a Saturn? One of the biggest flops since the future flop of Sony's [...]PS3. A few frames missing and slowdown which I have not experienced personally are by no means reasons to dismiss a game that combines X-men with Streetfighter very well. One more thing to mention about the price. Not to insult anyones intelligence but simply supply and demand. It is discontinued, there are fewer and fewer copies available thus causing those on the open market to raise in value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"This is a Very bad conversion! at the beginning you choose 2 characters, great i thought and whilst you are playing, you CANNOT switch CHARACTERS at will like the arcade version! Isn't that the whole focus of the game? if you cant switch between characters, then why call this a tag team game?you only get to see 1 life bar, there is 2 in the arcade version of this game (and on the saturn)!The loading times takes ages (to be honest, you would have to wait longer than actually completing the game)!to sum it all up this is a very, very, very disappointing game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Capcom thinking?","review":"I actually played the Saturn version with the 4MB RAM cart, and I have to say that the PS1 version SUCKS! Why? Because tag-team was taken out because the PS1 could not handle it. It did not have enough RAM (Random Access Memory) to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 MB of RAM, and the PS1 only has 32 MB. If Capcom did put in tag-team, then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag-team with it, you can tag-team with the same character, but it does not feel the same.I suggest get a Saturn, (it is only $10 bucks or less) get a 4MB RAM cart which you can find at EB.com, or any Video game store, and get the Import version of X-men vs. Street Fighter, trust me you wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchered arcade to home conversion","review":"To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly. What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight. This feature made for great fighting fun, but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities, that feature had to be omitted. It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses, and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature, the graphics are painfully watered down, the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates, and there is loads of slowdown. If you can get past all that, this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan, but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A completly Washed out version","review":"i won't get this game, it's a complete disgrace to the arcade version. no tag team feature. major slowdowns, the graphics are completly washed out as if a ravine's water ran over it. and i don't understand why these sellers are selling their copy for [so much money]. this game should be selling for [far less]. only more reason not to get it. do not buy any Vs game for the Ps one all of them the tag team feature has been taken out."},{"rating":"2","title":"200th review X Men vs Street Fighter for SEGA SATURN","review":"X Men vs Street Fighter was a big hit in the arcades everybody said that game was the s**t. The Saturn was the only home port that gave us tight controls great graphics good animation & still had tag team mode unfortunately thanks to Bernie Stolar we in the US didn't get X Men vs Street Fighter nor the 4 MB RAM cart so those of couldn't get the Saturn version got this s**t on the Playstation which is bad on 2D it didn't have tight controls it didn't have beautiful graphics animations were bad sluggish speed oh NO TAG TEAM MODE! I remember renting this version & thinking it was terrible it's just this game wasn't made for The Playstation. Now the Action Replay that bypasses region coading & uses a 1MB & 4MB RAM function I would also require a Ascii Saturn arcade stick for this game too so any owner of The Sega Saturn should get that version it's a great fighting game that plays like the arcade."},{"rating":"2","title":"this game is the bommmmbbb","review":"this game is really cool and easy to play.I recommended it once you play it.you get hooked!!!! if you like fighting this is it dogzz"},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid Overview of Elizabeth I in the Popular Imagination","review":"This is a wonderfully written and fascinating book about Elizabeth I's iconic appearance in the popular imagination.

Good scholarship, and good general reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"My opinion is that this is a badly researched and written book. There are so many smart things written about Queen Elizabeth these days, that I wouldn't waste my time with this book. I thought it was trash.

It is the best product for that purpose. I tried many other products over the years but I have always returned to this one for the best and consistent results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for saddles","review":"I purchased this product because of Lexol's claim that it wouldn't darken leather. It did darken the leather a bit, but that is not why I gave it one star. I put it on a high quality vintage saddle that I have owned since it was new. I had cleaned the saddle w Lexol cleaner. I tried a test spot of this stuff on the saddle and it just sat ontop of the leather. I knew the saddle needed oiling since I am the sole owner. Just to make absolutely sure the saddle simply didn't need oiling...I put \\"leather new\\" oil on another area and it soaked right in. After leather is cleaned and dried...it should accept oil. This stuff reminds me more of a lacquer.

He's a great comedian, in the tradtion of Frank O'Hara and Ed Field, a storyteller on par with Bukoski, and a quiet visionary who consistently creates amazing down-to-earth poetry out of the importance of day to day living in a way that rivals Frost (though without the rhyme). Without a doubt, this is the best book of poems I'll read this year. From work poems to poems about sex, Mr. Ochester has been showing us the way since the late 1960s. If you like contemporary poetry, from Billy Collins to Denise Duhamel, Tony Hoagland to Sharon Olds, this is book for you. If you're not reading Ed Ochester, you're missing out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy's no Walt Whitman.","review":"Ochester's is a modest talent, and all too often in this retrospective, plain-speaking devolves into the merely plain and into under- or unachievement. There are a few assured and forcible passages, some wisecracks verging on the clever, and long swaths of lazy-man prose. A mixed bag, to be sure, but certain to please the claque."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely updates","review":"The Adirondack Book is an excellent guide to what to do, where to eat, etc., in the Adirondacks. The format is easy to follow, and the comments/recommendations are pretty much dead on.

Even if you own previous editions, I recommend buying the newest available--things change, and yesterday's hot spot may well have fizzled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many weaknesses and out of date","review":"I bought this book in 2003 when it first appeared and when my family and I first started coming to the \\"Dacks\\". I strongly agree with the criticism of the book's organization made by other reviewers: that it is arranged by topic rather than region. Perhaps the author thought of this as a \\"fresh idea,\\" but in fact all it demonstrates is why the traditional approach is best. With this book you do a lot of page flipping, and the indices aren't that helpful. The fifth edition is also now out of date with respect to, e.g.,, restaurant listings in the areas we know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is just OK","review":"Not much info on hiking or camping that I found useful. Book is better for history type info."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible organization, weak on information","review":"If this is the best guide for the region there is a wide opening for competition. The organization by topic rather than area makes this book virtually useless for planning a trip. Even if one focuses on a single topic (fishing, hiking, ..) there is little guidance for someone choosing where to go -- often there are lists of places with no descriptions or completely useless paragraphs that say, essentially, \\"there are many many places you can do X in the Adirondacks.\\" So I agree that this hardly serves as a guide at all. There is some interesting history in the book that could make this worth buying as background reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring this CD back into print!","review":"While Kobialka's original compositions are interesting, the outstanding feature of this album is his half-tempo rendition of Pachelbel's Canon in D. A usually overplayed, over-hyped piece, Mr. Kobialka's version gives it a majestic yet simple beauty. I first heard the piece on NPR's _Music from the Hearts of Space_ radio show, and I found I could not hold a conversation for my desire to hear the piece. Wonderful, lovely piece, and *well* worth the price of the album.GET THIS CD BACK INTO PRINT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't go wrong with the classics","review":"The 12 labors is a fun audio presentation. I think it is a creative and illuminating book that presents Hercule in a good light. It occasionally gives insight into his thinking process, which sounds great, but in practice slows everything down. The reader / listener actually wants to be surprised by his thinking process, and then enjoy it afterwards, not during the actual solving. In all the books I've listened to, this is the only one where that happens, so I still recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"love sarah vowell","review":"I got this book at a steal...actually paid more for shipping than the book. Let me tell you it was so worth it, and so much more. I can't believe this author is so young as her writing seems so mature and insightful. I find her stories on life and family hysterical. So glad I actually found another woman with a love of historical events. This woman should be teaching, she could definately hold an audience of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"High School Teachers, take note!","review":"This is the rarest of all things: a work of non-fiction that I just could not put down. Vowell makes obscure historical figures and the places related to them fascinatingly relevant to the modern reader. Snarky, irreverant, peppered with personal anecdotes that actually add to the narrative instead of detract from it, Assassination Vacation should be required reading for every high school history class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Who doesn't love Sarah Vowell? Her perspective somehow both deflates and exalts the history of our country at the same time. She writes in the same vein as Twain and Richard Armour, and she knows her stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems","review":"If you think you are going to get some new insight into presidential history, you will be in for a rude awakening . What you will get is typical whiny Liberal Bush-bashing coupled with some self-important young woman goofing off with her sister, friends etc . Her \\"historical research\\" consists of something anyone can get spending a couple of hours on the internet . Unless you care about the daily activities of the voice of Violet on the Incredibles and want to learn things like she gets winded hiking up a mountain to see some minor connection to a presidential assasination, don't waste your time.This book is way too chatty and way too preachy. So unless you are a disciple of Michael Moore and Al Franken, in which case you will probably stand up and shout \\"You go sister!\\" while reading it on the train, take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Presidential History Geeks Only","review":"I like Sarah Vowell's personality and normally enjoy reading her books and listening to her on This American Life. Plus she kicked ass in The Incredibles.I found this book really dull reading though. Unless you, like Sarah, are obsessed with the tiny details of President Garfield's presidency (and other subjects equally dry) you may be as bored as I was. She herself keeps saying how the companions she brings along on her research trips are bored to tears by the subject matter.I look forward to her next book and a return to more interesting territory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishing and hoping...","review":"Let's see...someone with such a case of BDS (Bush Derangement Syndrome) that she has trouble actually writing his name...\\"the current president, titter, titter\\", who takes a vaction to revisit the assassinations of 3 Republican presidents.

The opening bit, where she's sitting in a B&B; and nattering on and on as her fellow guests edge toward the door (more or less) sort of wraps it up quite nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"Sadly, Ms. Vowell is unable to write about this very fascinating subject in American history without indulging in her own, biased, liberal obsessions. In doing so, she loses serious credibility. An avid reader and history buff, I tried desperately to continue reading this book. Unfortunately, the book became more of an \\"I hate Bush sooooo much\\" rant rather then a smart read.

This book is just a bunch of presidential assassination trivia, strung together by the contrived narrative device of traveling to assassination sites, museums and collections, and peppered with Sarah Vowell's compulsive and not-very-funny wisecracks. It told me nothing about any of the assassinations that seemed to matter, so I gave up on page 171. Save your money, time, and gray matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"She used the R word. Twice.

Sadly she chose to use the word \\"ret**ded\\" several times and WOW that is so not cool.:("},{"rating":"1","title":"needs a warning label","review":"This book is pretty good. It has excellent writing and interesting subject matter. Ms. Vowell avoids a 5-star rating, however, by annoyingly attempting to relate events of 100+ years ago to current events. Her displeasure of the current Presidential administration (and conservatives in general) sounds as though it were copied directly from moveon.org talking points. Sticking to her subject matter would have been much more interesting and entertaining. Continued jabs at Republicans and Christians make this book insulting and distant for me. If I wanted to hear about the author's political views, I would have searched for this book in the political opinion section. Maybe liberals will enjoy hearing the \\"where are the WMD's\\" song played again, or possibly the \\"Bush didn't win the popular vote\\" song, but I'm tired of hearing it and I wouldn't have paid for it had I known of the book's content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Context 5, narration 0...","review":"Her audio publisher should have advised her to have someone else narrate. She sounds like a thick-tongued, high-pitched school girl. What she has to say is great, I love the writing, but I could hardly endure the voice reading to me.

I absolutely hate this book. At first, I really enjoyed it. It took history and made it kind of interesting with a laid-back author. Then, the author just rambled on about stuff that really has no connection to presidents' assassination. The author irritates me so much. If she left out the unnessacary stuff, the book would be about 75% shorter. I would not reccomend this book. I can't believe that I paid almost $10 for such a horrible book. PLEASE DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I received this book as a gift and when I read the inside cover, I knew I was going to love it.

I can't wait to read more.."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent audiobook for a road trip","review":"I bought this as an audiobook because Sarah's presentation is part of her magic. The content is great - both informative and entertaining. However, Vowell too often careens into commentary on contemporary political matters -- Iraq, President Bush, the prisoners at Guantanemo -- and this is an unnecessary distraction to an otherwise good project. Next time, please stick to the subject and leave the commentary for a separate book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining & Informative, Except for the Political Screed","review":"Ms. Vowell has written a charming, quasi-travel book based on her pilgrimage to the sites where three presidents where assassinated: Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley. The book is both engaging and enlightening, full of historical trivia that will both amuse and fascinate. Its only shortcoming is the author's undisguised disgust for all things Republican. (Her political biases are revealed early on when she fantasizes about knocking off George W.) Her political judgments are, at times, simplistic, one-sided and boorish. Mercifully, they rear their head infrequently in what is otherwise a delightful book, which I heartily recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"quirky history tour","review":"Very informative, hilarious and even moving at times. One other reviewer mentioned Vowell's Bush bashing, but they should read or listen to more than a snippet. The \\"current president\\" only pops up a couple of times and briefly. The rest of the book is for the most part a quirky nonpartisan journey through American political history. Vowell's narration in the audiobook abridgement is broken up with some interesting guest voices. Stephen King as Abraham Lincoln for instance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vowell's Views are Consonantt With My Own","review":"Blessed be Sarah, whose voice, though a Yowl; speaks truth with humor to the myths of Hannitized American history.

While learning many interesting details about assassination history, an image is assembed of the neurotic author as a nut who doesn't drive (a phobia), has allergies, and is some sort of assassination coompletist. Though the book is at no loss for wit, a reader is always aware how insufferable it must be to be in the presence of Sarah Vowell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, unique read","review":"Immensely entertaining and extremely informative take on interesting chapters in American history.

I've done my fair share of spellcasting and reading up on the craft and this book is a wonder resource. I do not reccomend this book for a first reading on the Craft. It has wonderful spells, but is in it's own way complicated. Also some of the Spells in this book could be dangerous. I suggest before reading this book, get a copy of Scott Cunningham's \\"Earth Power\\" and \\"Earth, Air, Fire, Water\\".After reading these books you'll have a better backround in the Craft and be able to Fully understand this Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Not For Everyone","review":"I've seen several complaints about the style this book is written in, especially the lack of explanations and I have to say that is probably very intentional on the author's part. I personally have found the style very refreshing, especially coming from Llewellyn. If you are new to the Craft, this is probably not for you at this time. This is what I would consider, for lack of better terms, for advanced practitioners. If you need every little thing explained to you as to why it is needed or being said, even if you have been practicing for a long time, this would not be the book for you. However, if you like the older style of writing spells, this is probably for you. Everything you need for the spells are in the poems and the part you recite or need to write is in italics.

She also believes in a late-prehistoric world civilisation (based on Churchward's fantasies of 'Mu') involving pre-Polynesian cultures in NZ and massive early diffusion more generally. Like a number of amateur NZ thinkers, Leaf uncritically regards orally transmitted stories and genealogies as very reliable. Her comparative linguistic and cultural methodology (shared with other current NZ diffusionists such as Doutre) is far too imprecise and unsystematic; it reflects pre-scientific ideas. This book will not obtain an academic response because Leaf presents her account as a narrative without any references or notes on archaeological or other evidence; but it is worth reviewing it here so as to discourage acceptance of its message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rarely-shared, heart-felt personal experience.","review":"Eventually, most of us will go through the experience of being with loved ones as they pass on.

This game makes you form strategies that have to be decided upon and changed within a split second. Although it being a slower paced game than other SF, the extra time allots you space to form countermeasures against your foe. Like I said before, this game is more like intense chess than a fighting game. The controls are customizable and intuitive. You don't want a novel to tell you how to play a game and this beats the rest with replayability up the ying yang.

The characters are writers for a TV Sitcom, \\"Life with Lucky\\", and the story is about their bizarre, dysfunctional behavior.

They hit it off, start sleeping together, and actually WRITE together!Bloomberg's writing style is uncluttered and spare, irreverent but effective. The chapter titles are amusing, such as Chapter 32 \\"The earth moved, and now I can't find a thing.\\" The chapters are short and brisk, and the voice alternates between Emmaline and Bud.

Now, all I have to do is peek out my kitchen/dining area window and can easily see how hot or cold it is outside.This is my second one of these - the first lasting over 6 years in this harsh Minnesota climate. These are also very accurate as long as placed in a north facing window. (Placing them where direct sunlight could hit would cause false readings.)

If you don't get the entire chemical into the test device, your results will--of course--be inaccurate.Plus, the testing device is a narrow plastic receptacle likely to fall over (and dump its contents) unless you have found a way to brace it in the vertical position.

The synths obscure her wonderfully musical voice and her exceptional story telling (as well as the fact that she isn't half bad at playing the guitar). Perhaps it was her attempt to be more mainstream and appeal to a larger crowd, but I feel it took away from the individuality that I saw in the live performance. Live, her playing had a child like innocence, even when discussing things that were traumatic... I have never heard a voice that was capable of conveying this level of rawness, remain innocent and still be musical.

It passes those simple tests.The package comes with a tuning guide a song book. Throw them away. The guitar is barely able to be tuned (and doesn't stay in tune) and the fretting isn't close to being intoned properly even when playing simple chords. I didn't EXPECT that it would be playable for a $30 toy, but for anyone looking for a guitar with the intent teaching a child to PLAY GUITAR on, this is not the guitar you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I was looking for","review":"I got this for my 2 year old son since he likes his daddy's guitar.

It is not possible to accurately tune this guitar. If you purchase, realize it is a toy, not a musical instrument.

This is a wonderful idea, and transatlantic studies of this sort make a lot more sense than teaching literature in a vacuum. Of course, every anthology can be criticized based on the texts it includes or leaves out. This work does a generally good job of being balanced, but nonetheless commits one criminal error, which prompts my low score: it omits the 18th century entirely. That's right, this work jumps from the Baroque to the Romantic eras without skipping a beat, omitting great authors like Moratin, Feijoo, Cadalso and others. This is both surprising and also downright illogical for an anthology seeking to be a comprehensive overview."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanish literature","review":"This book makes teaching a breeze. It takes away the boring technicalities of ordinary literature theory and allows the student to enjoy sophisticated literature as if it were a walk in the park. What I mean is that, rather than having to learn difficult terms and literary concepts, it uses the best examples of each period to showcase the culture and the society of Spain during its history.As Introductions to Literature go, this one is quite thorough. It gives you an authoritative overview of the history, the society and mentality of the era, which enables you to understand and justify the presence of certain topics, images and lexicon, that form the characteristics of each period in literature.It is important to accompany this book with the CD.

Her music is fun, spirited, and will make you want to get up and dance. Even the song \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head,\\" that was so overplayed on top 40 radio, sounds fresh and new on this DVD. And even if you don't like all the music, just watching Kylie strut across the stage in those red, high heeled manolos is a treat in itself.

It's a game of contrasts, really - the music is highly dynamic (fast-slow-fast, loud-slow-loud), and the musicians worked on complicated compositions.This album is less \\"prog-rocky\\" than before, but it's more mature, deeper and more demanding. The recording quality is better than Hybris, the playing is tighter, and the special studio effects are masterful.

The problem is that all the shapes in this book come out so of course any child will lose half of them by week two. Secondly when you try and put the shapes back into the book (you tak eit out to see the shape) it is tough for an adult to do it, worse enough a kid. The fit is too tight.

George Weigel's \\"The Courage to Be Catholic\\" is the best assessment of what went wrong in the Church, what led to the scandal and where we should go from here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing blend of fact and fiction","review":"There is little new in this book, except a strained attempt to link unrelated events and suggest the Pope is tolerant of child abuse. That attempt is so strained as to deny logic. The authors quote from their own newspaper articles and a group of men who claim they were abused some 50 years ago -- charges dismissed long ago.If you don't like the Holy Father and think the Church should change its views on morality, especially sexual conduct, you will like this book. If you support the Holy Father and the teachings of the Church, this book will be puzzling at best, disgusting at worst.Read the Gospel, go see The Passion of the Christ but don't waste you time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth and Charity","review":"If you want to learn the truth about Fr.

It is hard to understand the vitriole and calumny directed toward these good men and women but I urge you to at least seek some balance while exploring this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy Research, Bad Fiction","review":"Berry sounds as if he is writing about a medieval secret society. He is quick to place the blame for the sex scandal on the Church herself, rather than where it belongs, on our amoral society, and widespread acceptance of homosexuality. If the priests who committed these horrible deeds were faithful to the teaching of the Church on chastity, this never would have happened. His research is like that of Cornwall in \\"Hitler's Pope\\" where he claims to have done much work, though it does not square with the truth. This book is only of interest to those who have already decided the Catholic Church as a whole is at fault here, and I'm afraid this will only increase the efforts of those who make accusations decades later in order to gain financially."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tale of Two Priests","review":"I wish I had read this book earlier when the clergy abuse scandal was in the headlines. This \\"Tale of Two Cities\\" - that of God and that of man - could really have been entitled \\"A Tale of Two Priests.\\" Jason Berry and Gerald Renner tell the story of two men of the cloth, Thomas Doyle and Marcel Maciel - one a lonely advocate for victims of sexual abuse, the other credibly charged with being a serial sexual abuser - and the surprising fate that the Catholic Church under John Paul II has reserved for them. The courageous pastor to the marginalized is himself marginalized, moved from assignment to assignment, each time farther and farther from centers of influence; the cowardly child molester receives accolade upon accolade and is all but canonized while he's still alive. Fortunately for both - and for all of us - there's a life to come with judgment.This book is well-researched and clearly written.

The insight is unique because although Mendenhall was an officer aboard the USS Sculpin and then the USS Pintado, he was \\"an enlisted man's officer\\" and he tells the story of his patrols aboard these submarines from that perspective. I enjoyed reading this book because at one moment it relates the daily grind of serving on a sub and the next moment, it explodes with action as an enemy ship is spotted and attacked. I recommend this book to anyone who is a WW II submarine junkie because it is an account of real men and real times."},{"rating":"2","title":"submarine diary review","review":"The only criticism I have of this book is it too short.

Without the instant communications we have today and WITH the editorial prejudices prevalent at the time, their view of Lincoln was understandably skewed. An enlightening way to see Lincoln from a different perspective. Highly recommended.

But you won't want to skip a word.Sironia, Texas is a favorite of mine. One reason is its pitch-perfect evocation of time, place, and people (Texas, early 1900s). It is a grand page-turning story based on the author's home-town of Waco, Texas - and many local citizens were not happy with the well-guarded secrets that were exposed when the book was published. It was a best seller in the early 1950s and is still a good read today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but R rated reading material","review":"While this book was very well written, the thematic elements and language are strong.

I got two other chocolate varieties (Mint Chocolate Cookie and Chocolate Turtle), a Fudge Marble and a Caramel Capuccino. So, three chocolates and a fudge, one coffee-flavored (sadly I don't like coffee-flavored anything, other than coffee itself) and a Blue Moon.Overall, two stars for shipping the wrong stuff with little variety.

Unfortunately for me, I had it upside down and instead of pressing on the back of the blade, I pressed my thumb down on the business side. It effortlessly sliced my thumb, until I realized what was happening and it went flying across the room. Since then, it's been in a time-out in my dresser cabinet and I've been carrying an old folding knife of my grandfathers.I assumed I was mature enough in my late 30's to handle any pocket knife.............I was sorely mistaken.Purchase with caution, Respect the blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife","review":"I search the entire web for this Knife.

This is the second and last time this group plays together again with this lineup which I consider to be a perfect fit. Dio's albums have never sounded as good as they did with Vivian on guitar, Vinnie on drums, and Jimmy on bass. The power is here with songs such as We Rock, I Speed At Night, and Breathless. Dio's voice has never been better than on The Last In Line. These guys are on the same page, and unfortunately, Vivian Campbell left after this album to form his own band (Riverdogs which turned out a pretty good album, but lacked any fire power as it was much more acoustical).

Except for the very well known and excellent Last in Line the rest of this album is nothing but \\"standard\\" generic heavy metal. Most of the tunes on this album were heard hundreds of times by lesser artists in the '80s. Mystery was RJD's attempt at creating a \\"pop\\" song and it doesn't work.

The lyrics are no better, he writes about gnomes, trolls, dark elves and evil forests. It's obvious the guy played D & D (Dungeons & Dragons ) in the early 80's and probably has an oujia board in his closet. His voice is excruciatingly annoying, he whines through all the songs and then there are the corny guitar solos that make me want to puke. On one song they are even bold enough to add keyboards like a bunch of other crap 80's metal bands that didn't know where to go music wise.

His voice is dreadful. I'd rather listen to a dog barking all night long then to sit through this dreary dullsfest. Who listens to this anymore anyway, '80s metal just has zero appeal to me and most of my friends, we all used to like this, but something so silly is easy to outgrow. The only '80s metal that still hold up is Slayer, and even when Dio was popular, his best (except for the first \\"Blackmore's Rainbow\\" album) is not as good as Slayer's worst.

For me, this album is every bit as good as one of my other all time favorites, Dusty in Memphis.Evie's soulful renditions of rock-blues songs produced by her long time pals and collaboraters Chip Taylor and Al Gorgoni is one of the top female albums of all time. A highlight is Evie's own song, It's This I Am, the first song she ever recorded that she wrote. Evie went on to give up singing for a while and write songs for top female vocalists but it sure is great to have her back where she belongs, singing her heart out on this classic reissue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great everyday beer glass","review":"I hate having to drink beer out of a big tumbler or water glass...and now I don't have to.

Plenty of volume to pour a nice head without overflowing and also handy with a summer wheat beer when you want to add a lemon and a shot of vodka...although then you'll have to sip a little bit along the pour to make some extra room. But that just keeps the party rolling. And with the $10 price for a set of 4, you really can't help but stocking up.

But to be honest, I like \\"Now This Is Fun\\" and \\"Love In Itself\\" just as much. As I said, this is still a great album, but at this point you may just want \\"Singles 81>85\\", as it's longer and includes much of what's here.

This is overall not a bad album to start with... in fact I've sampled all the songs and I'm beginning to wish I had the album. Although some songs such as \\"Pipeline\\" can be pretty annoying, you can always change the tracks. Although \\"Work Hard\\" is known to be one of the most annoying songs on the album, I kind of liked it... this album makes me laugh and really, the annoyance is the fun in it.

Problem is, nearly all of it can be found on other, better Depeche Mode albums, rendering this an unimportant item in the band's discography. The only songs unavailable on other albums, \\"Now This Is Fun\\" and the peppy, industrial tinged \\"Work Hard,\\" are not strong enough to warrant spending money to buy this album. Additionally, all of the album's best songs (\\"People Are People,\\" \\"Love in Itself,\\" \\"Get the Balance Right,\\" \\"Leave in Silence,\\" and \\"Everything Counts\\") are included on The Singles 81>85."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and unnecessary compilation","review":"\\"People Are People\\" was the \\"album\\" made for the US when the title song broke the band through stateside and served a purpose to get people into the group. However, the best one-disc representation of the group isThe Best of Depeche Mode, Vol. 1, which has a span of the group's 25-year career (by that point). You may not own those, but just get the remastered versions ofA Broken FrameandConstruction Time Again. That being said, most of this can be recommended, but this is irrelevant in 2007.

Packed with details and undaunted research that only a true historian can accomplish, Epperson challenges the reader to turn the page only to reveal another startling revelation. From cover to cover, this is a book that will invoke controversy, debate, and unfortunately, FEAR.

Mr. Epperson does a brilliant job of tying together many loose threads. He clearly did exhaustive research on the topic, and goes to great lengths to provide clear documentation throughout this very scholarly work. Exploring a subject like the esoteric is a vast undertaking, and the subject is one not easily understood. However, Mr. Epperson has done an outstanding job of explaining these tenets to those of us who might be new to the subject. From the ancient to the modern, he ties it all together and provides a clear picture of how we have come to this point in time - the New World Order. Once you read this book, you will never look at anything the same again. A MUST READ for those wanting to understand today's world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it was better..","review":"The writing style is fine, the research is fair to good compared to others in the field, but he does anyone who is interested in real history a great disservice in promoting this work, because of his horribly shoddy jumps in logic.Even on points that I would agree with him on, or that have been explained and researched much better elsewhere, I can not support him on because of his almost purposeful misreadings as quotes, his constant ruling out of alternatives, and dictums that this is 'necessary' or 'obvious', when it is no such thing.Any first year philosophy or debate student could rip him and his case to shreds, which is a shame, since some of the research is on the right track and quite good.So, I'd skip this one.. his presentation style makes it too hard to be able to tell which points are ludicrous and which are valid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"I'm just under half way through this book and so far I am enjoying it.

Quoting Texe Mars as an expert in new Age? Please!People perceive what they already believe and this appears to come from a mindset whichis pretty much closed to anything other than it's own preconceived notions.So who knows whether the material on the Masons is true or not?

The author is obviously poorly educated and his rhetoric makes a mockery of academic practice. He claims to quote a variety of authors in order to support his conclusion, and clearly he succeeds, for the works cited are those of either obvious charlatans, right-wing paranoiacs (Nesta Webster! ), anti-semites and obscure writers. Very poor work from an intellectual standpoint.The conclusions in this book are reached only through wild leaps of logic which manage to make light satanic...If you are a fundamentalist Christian like mr Ep the so-called writer you will probably enjoy this book and start living in fear of satanic freemasons after reading it. However, if you feel that paying for a pile of quotes from a bunch of hysterical fanatics to support views that obelisks are evil, you're better off not getting this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish you had a rating for zero stars","review":"This book was absolute garbage...the 'reader from Australia' captured my sentiments exactly.

I cannot believe that they did that to promote their own sales!!! How sad to do that when this is the best thing around for allergy, chronic sinusitis, hayfever and asthma. Even if you are just prone to the common cold, this helps to end the sinus part of it quickly (and sometimes that ends the cold too, let me tell you). Go ahead, buy one and you'll be as happy with yours as me and my family (and our extended families of sibs and parents) are with ours. :) And if you don't believe me, just look into the lastest medical findings that were published within the past year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Sinus attachments don't work with ALL Waterpik dental jets!","review":"I purchased the Waterpik NA-2 gentle sinuse rinse attachment, expecting it to work with the Waterpik Professional Ultra Dental Water Jet, since that is what was advertised. THEY DON'T FIT IN THIS MODEL, SO DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME PURCHASING BOTH TOGETHER! The sinus attachments are too short, so they can't \\"click\\" into the water pik. The end result: Water leaks out, and there is no pressure through the sinus attachment. I had to return both items since the Amazon rep couldn't find any sinus attachment to work in the Waterpik Ultra model. It's a shame because I love the small footprint of the Waterpik Ultra, and it comes with a lot of cool attachments. Hopefully Waterpik will come up with something in the near future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but doesn't fit all models as advertised.","review":"Would work great, except...this doesn't fit my new WaterPik Ultra (WP-100)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for newer Waterpiks.","review":"I purchased this set of attachments and a \\"Waterpik NEW Professional Ultra Dental Water Jet\\" from Amazon last week. These tips will not work in this Waterpik. The base of the tip, the end inserted into the Waterpik handle, is too small. Both tips in this set are too small.Not really worth sending back to Amazon so I think I'll just use my trusty Dremel tool and some plastic cement to swap the base with one of the tips that came with the Waterpik."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you have sinus problems, this is the stuff!","review":"This is amazing. As opposed to the netti pot, it pushes the clog out of your sinus and helps clear things up. I clean each side leaning forward and afterward bend over moving your head side to side and this will clear out any sinus 'pockets' I found out that because of my allergies, my sinuses have formed their own pockets, which never really clean so my infections were often. I had no idea that was possible. but thank goodness for this cleaning...I haven't had a sinus infection in a long time. Furhtermore, don't worry about not 'sanitizing' the water with baking soda. The issue with purchased saline, is the preservative in it. Make your own...use KOSHER salt or SEA salt. 1 tsp to 500 ml of water. throw unused away.And for the person who said it felt like being hit with a wave...if you are leaning forward it won't go into your throat silly goose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinus Rinse Attachments","review":"this works pretty well but nowhere on the description does it indicate that it only works with WATERPIK devices. yes one might assume that but given the number of other similar waterpik like devices, one might not and the average shopper won't read that far.It does work with some modifications though.Stevie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Stop Selling Items You Don't Have!","review":"My one star rating is for Amazon's service, not the WaterPik attachment, which I never received. Despite the fact that I ordered this on 20 February 2007 and shipping was stated to be 7-9 days (and is still stated to be 7-9 days), TWO weeks later Amazon has contacted me that shipping on this item will not be until 5-9 April 2007. I have canceled the item and ordered from another internet store and should receive this in a few days.In my many years ordering from Amazon, I have found it's best not to order any items with any type of shipping delay, as shipping almost always takes far longer than promised.

His portrait of Dr. Stockwood is one which is enlightening, ecouraging and troubling all at once. The text is an easy and pleasant read and covers in quite good detail the life and ministry of this intensely interesting Bishop. The Socialism of an established figure in the British Church is not nearly as troubling as the revelation of Stockwood's relish of wealth, privilege and royalty. And the fact of his homosexuality is not as surprising as what is said of his inability to relate to anyone of any sex on a profound personal level. The author is perhaps a bit naive and adoring, but gives us a colorful and enlightening look at a man who helped shape British religious thought and practice for several decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Camper TV","review":"Love my Toshiba TV.

First, it swallowed my DVD and refused to give it back. I had to return it to the store for replacement and pay for the lost DVD to Netflix. Now, after about six months, the replacement unit is also broken - it is stuck on channel 5 (Fox, to make matters worse), and refuses to change the channel. I am trying to send it to Toshiba for repair, but their website does not make it easy - the warranty information section sends you to (nonexistent) user manual, and there is no number to call. Don't buy it. Over the years, I owned several TV model - this is the first one to break, twice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER","review":"The resolution of this TV is painful to look at. Spend a few more bucks and it will be money well spent in the end! The great deal I thought I got will now be offset by return shipping and exchange costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice for trailer","review":"This TV came with our trailer. It looks nice enough (fairly plain), operates easily enough and has decent enough sound. Where it is really bad for us is the vertical angle. If you're in a trailer there is a good chance that it's mounted up high, and with this TV you start to lose quality immediately as your viewing angle drops. The manufacturer doesn't specify viewing angles, I'd be interested to see what they consider this to have. But our TV is up with the cabinets and it's totally unwatchable sitting on any of the seats in the trailer. You either stand or you get up on the top bed to view it. My negative rating is based solely on this feature so if that's not a consideration for you then don't worry about it. The horizontal angle is okay, by the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toshiba 19HLV87 19\\" LCD HDTV with Built-In DVD Player-DEFECTIVE PRODUCT RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX","review":"I had the same thing happen to me. After the unit was programmed for channels in my area, it froze up and the TV did not respond to the remote or the actual controls on the TV. Followed the recommended steps of unplugging for ten minutes however this did not help. There is no reset button on the TV. The manual is very poorly written.

The DVD player had a line of dots across the bottom of the screen. It would come and go, but was evident even when a DVD wasn't inserted, i.e., on the splash screen.Also, the component inputs were defective. I tried them with three different component sources and all I could get was a green, grainy screen. The HDMI input worked fine, but I really wanted to be able to use the component, since that's what my cable provider offers. Frankly, I expected better of Toshiba. I've got an ancient Toshiba tube TV which still works fine. This LCD was a disappointment.

Both sets arrived intact (no broken glasses or pitchers), the quality and heft of the glasses and pitchers is just right and the glass is clear and free from defects.The only reason that we didn't give this set five stars is that the design of the pitchers lends itself to cracking down a seam that runs across the front of the pitcher.We broke one pitcher the first time we used the set when it bumped against another dish in the sink. We have used the second pitcher several times since and are careful to keep it away from other dishes or pans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set for the money","review":"I am basically happy with this set, but it has one drawback. One of the reasons I ordered it was for the 16 ounce glasses. It's hard to find goblets this size. My husband poured a 12 ounce can of coke in one and it's basically full.

Within two months, four of the glasses had shattered...while being hand-washed...not touching anything but the sink and a washcloth. Another thing that bothered me about these glasses is the very bottom of the inside of the glass. If you let used glasses set out instead of washing them immediately, the liquid will dry at the bottom of the glass and is very difficult to reach with a sponge or washcloth. The pitcher has been great. I haven't had any problems with it at all. The glasses are such a waste, though.

I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"For 007 Completists","review":"Sean Connery's final outing as James Bond deserved better music than Michel Legrand's erratic compositions for \\"Never Say Never Again\\" (1983). Legrand adds some nice jazz-oriented touches, but the soundtrack is marred by stylistic miscalculations and Lani Hall's horrible theme song.

The producer was leaning toward James Horner. It is -- like the film uneven -- and ultimately, not very satisfying. It isn't just the lack of the Bond theme, it just doesn't have the kind of thematic thread that the Eon Films do. There are some jazzy elements and an awfully insipid title song sung by Herb Alpert's wife Lani Hall. Sticking on the opening action sequence with credits has to be one of the dumbest ideas in the history of dumb ideas. The poetential pre-credits sequence cried out for effective music and you get this lackluster, stupid theme song instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Audio cd,Ever...","review":"I feel bad for anyone who thinks of this movie.IT IS NOT A BOND FILM.Not only does the movie lack all the other characters played by the original acters like moneypenny,M...etc,It's missing a soundtrack by John Barry,though even he could not make it work.There is a feeling however,that the music doesn't match the film itself,if you look at it as a normal film score,as it should be,it is not a bond film,you can enjoy it,while it is in no way equal to John Barrys work,It is just allright,if you put all that aside,it is ...not bad.If you are a bond fan-think twice,it is not a bond film.If you collect bond soundtracks-remember,it is not a bond film,rather misplaced,typical 80's music,which is allright,if your'e into it.This is not for bond fans,and if you think it is an adequete bond film you are not a bond fan,but if you like the 80's and their soundtracks this is for you.Just keep one thing in mind...THIS NOT A BOND FILM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crushed packages","review":"The product took forever to arrive.

He enjoys scaring kids when they come to the house for trick or treating. The sweater looks EXCACTLY like in the movie. It is a real sweater, but thin. He started out wearing a black tee shirt under it but had to change out of it because he became warm. He even had his picture taken which just made his night. The sweater was a adult size and it was a little long in length and long in the sleeves but not too bad. Didnt have to roll the sleeves up. I would highly reccommend anyone to buy this sweater to complete their Freddy outfit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality, Convincing Freddy Sweater","review":"PROS:Quality replica detailed with holes, slashes, tears, and burns throughout.It is an actual sweater.

Most of the poems are dedicated to that subject. From packing a suitcase to visiting a college to decorating a Christmas tree Ms. Thompson allows us to eavesdrop on these personal and painful encounters. She does it beautifully. Her images are vivid, leaving no doubt as to what she wants us to understand. The book also includes selected poems from her two previous books, This Body of Silk and The Wedding Boat. \\"The Compliment\\" and \\"Remembering My Parents' Sex Life\\" are a couple of favorites. Even if you're not \\"into\\" poetry it's easy to appreciate the beauty of Ms. Thompson's words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant yet accessible","review":"Sue Ellen Thompson's poetry is elegant yet accessible. She uses rhyme and fixed stanzaic patterns in a subtle and graceful way, but the real interest of her poems lies in the characters she creates: the teenage daughter, the distant husband, the aging parents, the old loves and lovers.... This poet has a restrained passion that I find very moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best laptop case ever","review":"This is one of the few cases that will accommodate my large-screen laptop. This bag is very sturdy and well padded. The case has ample room for laptop, cords, and accessories. A special pocketed area is fantastic for iPod, digital camera, mouse, cell phone, and a handy clip for keys. There is a convenient port for your iPod ear-bud cord. The bag fits nicely in the overhead compartment on the airplane, and even fit under the seat in front of me on a small commuter flight. It's roomy enough that I actually took it as my ONLY bag for an overnight flight and was able to carry laptop, accessories, a change of clothes, and cosmetics. The only improvement would be to have wheels because fully loaded, this can be quite a weight to tote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book initially but out of date now.","review":"My daughter bought this book to keep track of her Beanie purchases.

The author can't make up his mind whether to write fiction or non-fiction. Apart from that, my main problem with the book is the lack of proof-reading: words are misspelled, left out or superfluous and/or repetitive words left in. Perhaps the worst gaffe was a reference to Jerome and a friend enjoying the aroma of tomatoes, onions and peppers cooking. Folks, Europe didn't know about tomatoes and peppers until after 1492, a millennium after Jerome lived!"},{"rating":"2","title":"water pik replacement tips","review":"I like all the tips in this package .The one I use the least is the tongue cleaner .

In fact, you really need to combine the handbrushing action with the vibrating motion to get a decent clean. I agree with the reviewer who indicates that too much of the vibration goes to your hand. I purchased this toothbrush because I had an older Waterpik brush that was not 'sonic' but did an excellent job of cleaning my teeth. This one is a failure.

The plot goes down paths that are improbable at best. For his next effort I would recommend he seek subject matter experts to help with plot development and give him a reality check.

It is an indictment of the MILITARY INDUSTRIAL complex and its tight knit inter relationship with crony capitalism. In Butler's age this relatinship was only in its infancy and Eisenhower warned the nation in his farewell address that our liberties and the very foundation of our freedom was at stake if this relationship between private industry and the military remained unchecked.Certainly, the authors exceptional military history and service to his country place him in a unique pedestal to serve as a critic whose standing and experience are beyond reproach."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Personal Political Experience.","review":"An American General tells the truth then founds the peace movement.

Butler did not come to this conclusion earlier in his military career, like during the start of WW1, the War to end all Wars, and so begin an anti-war campaign. Maybe the Americans and Germans that died under his orders would still be alive today. But even if he did, his career was first and lives were incidental. The hypocrisy is his after-the-fact repentance, if this is a repentance.

At 28 pages, it's either a pamphlet reprint or it is edited down. It is a very superficial treatment of the subject - a disappointment. I was visiting Butler's house last week, spoke with relatives, and I went looking for his book, prepared to be impressed. I am hoping that he has more substance than what is in this 28 page pamphlet. It is a screed against capitalism, but the Army that bought the millions of dollars worth of equipment that he points out as unnecessary, or leftover, or out of date, gets a free pass. He blames the sellers, but does not inquire about the buyers. The famous quote about being the \\"gangster for capitalism\\" is not in the book. It is from a speech he gave on the same subject.

Mark Phillips and Frank Garcia have done a good job of research and writing here, with few and minor mistakes. The chapter on \\"Battlestar Galactica,\\" which is accurate and contains a good deal of information, much of it from new interviews done especially for this book, is worth the price of admission alone.

It looks like it was shot with a hand held 8MM movie camera. As far as content, the film spends way too much time on sumo wrestling and Dr. Merry spoils every other scene by sticking his wife in the scene. I've seen better travel films taken by my neighbor with his video camera.This is the only review I have ever written but I felt compelled to warn people to avoid this DVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"very dated, bad video quality even on DVD","review":"You are glad when this one is over.Most of the footage seems to have been shot in the middle 1990s (or earlier), and shot badly. There is lots of jitter in the image, and low res footage. Although Dr. Merry's wife supposedly speaks Japanese, she can't get her husband to correctly pronounce many Japanese words - like names of major cities. As other reviewers have pointed out, she appears randomly in scenes, and one wishes she wouldn't.This is a very superficial view of Japan, some of the topics of greatest length are sumo, feeding the deer in Nara park, and the Ainu in Hokkaido who perform for tourists. The films contains many small errors about Japan - for example its not hard or rare to go visit a sumo training stable - some of the stables are open daily.One gets the impression that this film was stitched together from free film the collected from JAL and other travel agencies in Japan - some of it might be from the 70s"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read about life in a small town","review":"The art of the newspaper column, with it's necessities of brevity and wit, are not lost on frequent Amazon reviewer Peter Greene. By turns funny and poignant and touching on subjects unique to small towns (booney riding, local business) and more universal themes (teachers, divorce, and even Barbie dolls) Greene lets those of us who have moved away from the small towns of our birth enjoy a trip home. He is especially effective addressing the current state of U.S. public schooling, not surprising considering his day job as an English teacher. Originally published as columns in his Pennsylvania small-city (pop. 8,000)paper, the collection is a great read--thought-provoking, entertaining, and humorous--regardless of where you grew up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aesthetic glassware set","review":"These are attractive glassware, and they feel good in the hand.

Both look pleasing to the eye and, with their beveled sculpting, can easily be a part of a formal dinner setting. The only negative I would list would be that the price could be lower, as you can find competing sets at discounters like Walmart for less. However, this is still a very reasonable purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"So happy to find these again!","review":"I had this set of glasses 20+ years ago, and well, over the years of moving and mishaps, my set had diminished quite a bit.

I bought the heater from Amazon less than two months ago.Per the manufacturer's instructions, I returned the defective unit (return receipt) four weeks ago and have yet to receive a reply. I have emailed and will call if I get no response.Got a reply to my email a couple of days later stating \\"Your heater was replaced under warranty and the replacement unit is on its way to you. Reimbursement for the heater can only be done by the store you purchased it from. Have a nice day.\\"Not only do I not want a replacement, it cost me $13 to mail the unit back to them. I will never deal with Hydor again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after one year","review":"Have noticed that my aquarium began running with Temps. in the 82-84 degree range. Heater light was never on so I believed that it was not the problem. Decided at one point to change my substrate. When my hand brushed up against the still submerged heater I noticed that it was very HOT and the indicator light was NOT on. Removed the heater immediately and the tank temps are now at 78 Degrees without any heater in the aquarium. Clearly a dysfunctional heater. Could not recommend to any serious fish keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"No photos of any recipes makes this a disappointing book","review":"Although the book seems to have good crab recipes, it is totally lacking in color or black and white photos of any of these recipes.

So happy I read reviews on Amazon site re: Sony Walkman Digital Radio, Model SRF-M35.Have had almost identical experiences as other reviewers... failure of performance, hissing, etc. I have been unsuccessful in getting ANY response from SONY after sending registered letter to Administative Offices. What happened to the great SONY company? Poor quality, poor service etc. Even retailers are reluctant to refund/exchange this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product Fallen On Bad Times","review":"Have ALWAYS had great satisfaction with every SONY product and have always been willing to pay the higher price for products. Have used the Walkman AM/FM radio for years. Finally, needed to buy new one. During 2001, had to buy THREE (3) of these items. Each \\"lost\\" the A M stations, the F M stations became limited and finally, the batteries (2 AAA) needed replacement with 15 hours of use. Returned to retailer. Was told to contact manufacturer. The SONY company has not responded. As I said...great product but... something has gone wrong with latest production quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working","review":"My radio worked great for about year but then I started getting bizarre malfunctions that are similar to what others are reporting. FM reception became worse and it drained batteries much faster than it used to. It would turn off by itself and would not turn back on until the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't listen to the stations I wanted","review":"I returned the SRF-M35 shortly after I bought it. Interference from other stations prevented me from using it: I would get the station I wanted for a few seconds after turning the radio on before another station drowned it out. None of my other radios share that problem, so I concluded that the SRF-M35 was at fault. It may be specific to my locale or my local stations in combination with this unit, or I may simply have gotten a bad unit, so your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"After about 5 months of use this unit failed.

The build quality on this radio is atrocious!!! Since my original review I'm now on radio number three. Number 1 seemed to get hissy after a while. Number 2 sounded great and was pulling in weaker stations better than #1 and then the volume on all FM stations went to 50%!! The third one I've just exchanged seems to be not as sensitive and my Sangean DT110 is doing a slightly better job of pulling in the weak stations. As others have said - keep your receipt!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Receipt!","review":"I regret to say that I've owned several of of these models in the last few years. The quality has been getting progressivley worse. They can not withstand the normal wear and tear from jogging, etc. The last one, purchased 8/02, lasted two days before it stopped working forever. Look to another company for a better product! If you decide to buy one, save your receipt, you will need it when you return the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works good but won't work","review":"I got one for Christmas 2001, good sound quality, light weight. It lasted about 1 1/2 to 2 months then when I jogged it would automatically shut off after 3 mi, then 2mi, then 1mi, it got worse. It was out of warranty so I couldn't get a new one. I liked the sound quality so much I bought another. This one cut out first time after less than a mile. Needless to say I quickly returned it for my money and I won't buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy little radio, just perfect","review":"I got my little sony radio 2 years ago and it's still going strong. I have used it nearly every day for 2 years and I have never had a problem with it. I have dropped it probably a dozen times, had it kicked and stepped on accidentally, had it fall in a lake and sit in the sun for many hours. I wouldn't be surprised if it stopped ticking after all of this abuse but it still has the same wonderful sound quality as it did when I first got it. It's super small and can fit in your pocket very easily which make it a great workout buddy. A lot of people who see it confuse it for a tiny MP3 player but it's just a simple radio. I cannot sing its praises enough... it was well worth the $$ or so I paid for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within a month","review":"Loved the radio, but the poor construction was a real problem. The first time I changed the batteries the internal circuit boar broke. I was able to solder the connections back together, but it was never quite the same and no longer reliable. Next time I'll get a sturdier model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"My experience not in line with other Amazon user reviews. I have used my Walkman daily at my desk for over a year and it still works nicely. No complaints. FM reception quality perfectly adaquate for use while stationary and within 50 feet of a window. I haven't used it much while on the go, but I've been happy with it on those occasions. If reception is a problem, consider the non-walkman, GE Superadio III. The Sony's AM sounds better outdoors than indoors where fluorescent lights cause a buzz, but that's a problem on any AM radio. Battery life, around 30-40 hrs. Sorry to hear some people have had bad luck with this unit, mine has worked fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointed i returned it","review":"reception was very poor (constant hiss on favorite local station) power button placement/design poor for real-world storage - put it in a backpack and you can count on it getting bumped and powered on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date!","review":"I was hoping to use this DVD set for educational purposes but it is so out of date, I could never use it in my classes.

It vibrates up-and-down. It does not spin round-and-round.I have used mine for two years, and only once had a problem. The brush started to wimp out on me, but then I noticed I had unplugged the charger.You can spend a lot more $$ to get a fancier brush that works no better, or you can spend a little less to get a round-and-round brush that is no more effective than the kind that work without a battery and cost only a buck or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable","review":"This was my first electric toothbrush. I bought it on a store close out years ago, more than four years ago and it has proven very reliable. I bought a whole bunch of replacement heads, enough for all these years. I just put on my last one and looks like I wont be able to get a replacement head anymore. I guess it's fine because I am ready for a new one.I have dropped the base a million times. It sits on my bathroom sink but the base is so light any bumping on the cord will make this baby drop! But it has not let me down.One major complaint I have and it seems like a common problem with this kind of device is that the drool and stuff gets into it and gives it a terrible vinegary odor that only comes out with bleach it seems. I heard that hydrogen peroxide may work. I wont find out because once this last head is gone Ill keep it to scrub the rims on my car."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works, says my dental hygienist","review":"Have used this for a couple of years now -- along with a Waterpik Spray -- and my \\"tooth cleaning\\" person is very pleased with how well it gets rid of plaque and keeps my gums healthy -- and I am too.

The writing style is on level with a grade-school reader. The characters are without depth or dimension. The things characters say and do have no fit with their personalities - the personalities are aimless and unfocused. The lead character, who drops out of college, is so simple minded as to appear mentally handicapped. The idea for the novel is good, but the execution is horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"It says come in, but (mercifully) not too far.","review":"A review in the New Yorker made me pick up this book. The insider's view to the secret society of men seeking an elevated life, while still being unavoidably human, was too much to resist.The fact that it reads like individual stories, speaks to the individuality of the stories even though they share a common thread-- much like the men who enter this sort of life.The writing wasn't heavy-handed, which I was thankful for. In fact there was an elusiveness that was more intriguing than if he had saturated every crevice of the stories.I'd be interested to see what Mr.Rougeau does for his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"These band-aids do not stick!","review":"I purchased these band-aids because I frequently get small cuts on the tips of my fingers. I loved that you can buy all fingertips and not have to buy an assortment - some of which I would never use. I have tried them five times now, so I know it is not a fluke that they don't stick. When you fold the \\"wings\\" around your finger, they come unstuck within minutes. I have had to use an extra piece of tape to hold the thing together. I would not recommend these or purchase them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific read -- unusual subject","review":"Never ran across this author before; grabbed this from the \\"new fiction\\" section of the library. I can certainly see where science fiction might have been her area before. I was surprised that a book which started out as a rather dull life story became riveting in such a short time. Risky for an author. Proves that the writing was really good since I didn't cast it down after five pages, although I thought about it. But I gave it a chance and I am very glad that I did. It turned out to be a great find.For anyone who wants all ends neatly tied up as in a Hollywood movie, forget this.The author writes, \\"I knew I spoke nonsense, but I knew also that what I said was right in a fashion that had nothing to do with logic.\\" Hear, hear.The author's research into her subject (considering it's fiction) is impressive. I would welcome more, although this book has probably tapped out the author's resources on this subject. Anyway, a well-told tale can't be repeated. Good show."},{"rating":"1","title":"great premise, slooooow execution.","review":"I tried very hard to like this book, but I simply didn't like the author's plodding writing style. She spells everything out - and I mean everything - and it takes her five paragraphs to say what could be said in one sentence. She makes everything, including magic, sound dull and boring. I ended up skimming most of the book because I did want to find out how the book ended, but it was slow torture getting there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent new work by Ms. Lindskold..","review":"I began reading the \\"Firekeeper\\" books and when I learned that this book would be coming out, I knew I'd have to read it.It is an imaginative and engaging tale of \\"Mira\\", her past, her present, and a house that seems more to own its family than the reverse.There are a couple of dry spots in this book and nearing the end, we have to take a few leaps of faith with Mira, as some things that should've been more descriptive were not. The storyline just leaps forward without the main character truly having quite all the information she'd need to make a critical realization.We aren't left so much with more questions as we are with an incomplete understanding and a lingering supposition that there may be another book or at least more to the story.Still a trailblazing novel and excellent work of art. Kept the pages turning, engaging characters, emotion and mystery.Summing up, the book is a new recommended read, even with the minor flaws it contains.Thanks Ms. Lindskold!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOUCHING, SENSITIVE","review":"This movie is set in a time not that long ago, when a young fallen hero who happened to be black could not be buried in his hometown cemetery.

Well we won't let them. First Amp was ok, I own both, but the only attractive song on here is Fatboy Slim and if you like that song you should already own You've come a long way, Baby, so don't waste your money and buy some real electronic music, moonsine records, or uc music if you like hard house. Let's hope they don't make Amp 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor followup to the orignal AMP--not the same effect.","review":"For all those who loved the first AMP album, you will be greatly disappointed. There are only two good songs on this album: The Rockafeller Skank, and Brown Paper Bag. Otherwise, the entire CD blows. Nowadays, The Rockafeller Skank is on a number of other compilation CD's as well as the Fatboy Slim album, so don't worry not finding this elsewhere. I don't know what MTV was thinking when they decided to put their name on this CD. Were they thinking that electronica fans are just sheep and will listen to anything they put on the followup of Amp1 (which is an outstanding group of unique works)? Save your money on this one. I'm sorry for all those who bought it and don't know what to do with it now. I sure don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this cd","review":"do not support this cd, it is another attempt at turning a youth culture into something marketable. mtv does not care about the music, the culture, or anything else. if you are looking for a dance music compilation, check out something put out by moonshine, sm:)e, or any of the other dozens of small independent labels that actually care about the music and culture, and are not in it simply for the money. if we work together, we can destroy mtv. we've got the power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Remix Comp....sigh","review":"Having already bought Amp 1, I was looking forward to its sequel, even after having read that it would be an album focusing on the hip hop/electronica influence. I hate to admit, but I was pretty disappointed with the album as a whole. I did enjoy the new Fatboy Slim track, but the remainder of the album seemed to lack any real electronica or techno influence, aside from a bit of scratching and sampling. True, there was the Adam F drum n' bass track, but I found it wearying and taxing to have to listen to Method Man and KRS-One. After all, I wanted an electronica album, not just another remix comp..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor follow-up","review":"AMP was a fairly good intro to electronic music for those not in the know. This CD...I don't know what this CD's for. There are two very good tracks here - the first and the last (well, not counting that last \\"hidden\\" track, whatever it is). In between are overlong beats and (occasional) raps with not much to recommend either. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah, blah","review":"After hearing Fatboy Slim's \\"The Rockafeller Skank\\" I was really looking forward to what else would be on Amp 2 and I was disappointed, beyond that, as a huge fan of techno and electronica, i wasn't into the remastered muck and hip hop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a disappointment. save your money.","review":"Unfortunately, Fatboy Slim and Goldie are not surrounded by their equals. This cd is just as boring as amp 1, although the cover art is nice. The attempt to mix old school rythms with electronica is quite depressing. Other than track 1 and 8, this album should be listed in the easy listening section. Astraswerks...please redeem yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% garbage","review":"if you're buying electronica, you deserve low-rate garbage like this. there's so much more available in the world of digital, dance, experymental, and u-ground music. get educated, muster some self-respect, and steer clear of this mtv/chemically/electronic junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the MTV association look at the label: Astrelworks","review":"If you're stuck into one style of music this cd probably isnt for you.

This CD sucks, I want my money back!!!\\" Not only is this CD loaded with talenteless compilations, MTV has the nerve to edit original lyrics out of many songs!!! (which makes them even less original) Even though I dislike these songs, out of respect for the artists, I do believe that a song should stay in it's original composition (hell, would you stand for a great Van Gogh or Warhol masterpiece that has black tape over \\"indecent\\" areas?!?!?!) Who's to say what is appropriate in music?...they sure arent, the artist is. So to sum it all up, this CD sucks, and it's probably the fault of the money-hungry sellout known as MTV, who is trying to form every type of music into one mold that we call \\"Top 40\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good service!","review":"This was a gift, and the recipient needed to exchange this shirt for a larger size.

My only minor complaints are I had a hard time keeping the headphones that came with the player in my ear. I did purchase other headphones and they work great. Any standard headphones work well. Also, it would be nice if a belt clip or an arm strap comes with the player as I use it while exercising.

The control buttons appear to be stuck in the depressed position and no amount of fussing or battery changing will get it to turn on or respond to commands.

I don't think that if this were dropped, it would withstand the impact too well.3) The software interface is needlessly complicated for transferring songs back and forth and could have been simplified quite a bit.Other than that, its a great unit.

They probably never go to parties that aren't girls-only sleepovers where they watch rated G movies and read aloud from their Bibles. I'm three years younger than Christy and Katie, and I have a more exciting social life than them. Second, their goal in life is to convert people to Christianity; and it says that they have VERY few friends who are not Christian. I myself am Jewish, and I'm proud of it, but I don't wish that everyone in the world was Jewish like me. If everyone was the same, can you imagine how BORING that would be? This book is garbage; I can't believe its high ratings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energy suspension","review":"Good quality product, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

They spare people the truth about writing: it pays little, makes little difference, and changes your life for the better far less than it complicates matters. Robert Masello tell the truth. Way under the best-seller list radar is where most writers live and work, whether they write one book or one hundred.If you are planning to be a writer, this is book you MUST read, as Robert Masello bursts all the bubbles, and shows you a realistic view of the world of publishing. All too true is story of two writers fighting over whose book will face out on a shelf.Writer Tells All is probably the most accurate portrayal of the writing and publishing business in America today. Read it and weep. Then sit down an write a novel about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Informative","review":"Writer Tells All is an incredibly charming and helpful book! I kept reading parts of it aloud to my husband and friends. The author's retelling of his appearance on the Today Show (page 210) is so funny that it alone is worth the price of admission. Basically Masello's genius is to take us into his confidance--hey, we're all in this together--and then spill all, from advice to anecdotes. The guy is great company and is both encouraging and realistic about writing. I just wish I could write as well as he can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and Motivational","review":"I would dare say that this is a book that anyone would enjoy, whether you aspire to be the next JK Rowling or not.

When the author recommends going to writer's conferences, because agents often attend them, I tossed the book back on the shelf with a snort of derision. This book presents a superficial overview of various subjects and doesn't have nearly enough concrete examples, like a full book proposal or sample query letters. This is the same old stuff I've seen in every other writing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and startling read","review":"Mr Collison obviously had, and still has, a remarkable insight into East Timor. The recent events in the region are testimony to this. The Australian / US involvement in those times was probably, only just, justified.

It seems that way from what I've read about him on the net. But the writing style of this book is so awful that I'll never know for myself, nor will I be able to talk about characters, plot development and so on.If I'm reading a novel I don't need to know what's going on inside the head of everyone in every scene, plus background material that apparently drops down from the ceiling. There's also something odd about sentence length and rhythms or something that just grates.Maybe the author has spent too many years writing reports. Maybe I'm just not his target audience. Maybe I'm missing something. But whatever it is, I couldn't read much more than a few pages out of this book. I'm especially sorry because it was a gift from someone I like a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"This movie was such a let down. Great cast, great story line, great cinematography, really good soundtrack, but it just missed on so many levels. The story line, men in their early 40's looking back on their life and realizing things didn't turn out as expected... This has been done before, but with this cast, and how they set it up, a week away filled with drugs and alcohol, could have been really good. Instead they spend way too much time on the drugs and alcohol and do nothing to really develop the characters. Each character has an intriguing back story, but they do very little to help you understand who they are and where they are in their lives. I felt they really missed on the dialog, I like all of these actors but felt they wasted their talents. The little bit of deep dialog there is is good, but they could have done so much more. I won't give away the twist, it was a cool twist but again executed poorly because the characters weren't developed enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will think of this film weeks after you watch it","review":"This is the type of movie you will think about for weeks after you watched it. I know I have. It will be especially moving to guys in their 30s, 40s and 50s. The male bounding seems real. The guys in the film are all 44 and they are trying to recreate the feelings that they had when they were in college and there is an unsettleing twist.

Acting is great and the story is memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Melt With You","review":"Early Bret Easton Ellis novels and their subsequent film adaptations were famous for portrayals of disaffected youth doing naughty things and contemplating life. Now, imagine a handful of characters in their forties doing the same thing, and you've got I Melt With You. Rob Lowe, Jeremy Piven, Thomas Jane, and Christian McKay are old college buddies who meet up annually at Big Sur to celebrate a birthday, but with their own families and hidden secrets plaguing them, they embark on a week of drugs and parties until a tragedy forces them to face their past. Steer clear of I Melt With You, the film's laughable script and ludicrous plot points do nothing to help the actors trying so desperately to make something of the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Rob Lowe","review":"Huge Rob Lowe and Jeremy Pivens fan but not in this movie.

The previews for this movie left me unsure what to expect. While watching the first 45 mins-1hr of the movie, I was following along but kept wondering \\"why is this important?\\" And then, of course, the hook catches, everything becomes clear, and the story shoots down a direction I never anticipated. In the end, my heart strings were pulled. I became emotionally attached so subtly that I didn't quite realize it had happened until it all hit home. I recommend the movie, but keep in mind it's kind of a \\"slow starter\\" and you really need to be prepared to endure the whole journey to appreciate it as a whole. Most importantly -- abandon any preconceived notions before you begin watching, because this movie won't be what you expect it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged on","review":"The acting was great but the movie felt like it was dragging on.

This is for the serious student of Korean. It's easy to read and it's got a lot of examples which help with context and sentence structure. It's really a terrific resource.

This album is mainly almost an historic document showing how an old master and his friends are still trying,even if not too successfully.

The personnel on this album are UNREAL: George Benson, the Brecker Brothers, Lionel Hampton, Ray Brown, & many more. There is also a DVD for this album that is worth buying.I do agree with the negative reviews that the title track leaves something to be desired, but whatever... \\"How Do You Keep The Music Playing\\" is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful ballads I've heard him sing.This album is one very worth owning.

I've never had so much gas and intestinal discomfort (for about 8 hours).

It is technically sugar free, but what it uses effects blood glucose. It is in no way 0 net carb. They use maltitol, which has 75% the glucose absorbtion of sugar. This means, it isn't zero net carbs, but that the 9 carbs per serving are absorbed by the body as 6.75 net carbs. If you are doing a low carb diet, 6.75 carbs is a lot.

I have to agree with the other reviewers concerning the taste and texture of this syrup - it's amazing! BUT, for those of us who follow a strict diet and have an understanding of the glycemic index - the maltitol syrup used in this product has a GI of 75 ( table sugar = 100 )- which means that a sharp rise in blood sugar can be noted after consuming even a normal serving size of this syrup. The first time I used it I was very upset by my blood sugar test results 2 hours after eating but attributed the rise to the sugar in the pancake mix. The second time I used it, I had the same result but this time there was no sugar in the french toast....... So if you are only trying to use this product to lose or control your WEIGHT, then I'd say go for it. But diabetics, be cautious, and check your blood sugar levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful the first time you use this product.","review":"This stuff is delicious. That said, there are other considerations. I had this on Eggo waffles for breakfast. It was all I could hope it to be. Then two hours later my stomach began to growl and roll and I developed cramps. I spent the next six hours running to the bathroom. It is sweetened with maltitol, which causes extreme gastric distress for some people. Check it out on Google. I guess I'm one of them. I waited three days and tried it again for lunch, thinking maybe it just didn't like an empty stomach. Same results. So if you are going to be \\"out and about\\" do NOT try this for the first time.

My dad is a diabetic & loves to have pancakes & french toast when the rest of us do, but has always taken only one. Now, with this product (which we think tastes exactly like full carb syrups), he is able to have 2 or 3 and not have to worry about his sugar going too high. Will definitely buy again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Delicious, but unfortunately...","review":"MALTITOL. I had no idea what this meant when I poured it on my waffles about 1.5 hours before sitting an exam...... : | The syrup itself was surprisingly good though. It tastes just like regular maple syrup. I normally can't stand fake maple syrups, so, when I tried it, I really thought I'd lucked out. It's unfortunate that it contains this sugar alcohol though, as it apparently has a laxative effect on some people. So, if you're not sure if you're sensitive to it or not, make sure to only use a tiny bit at first and don't, excitedly thinking, 'So delicious! So few calories!,' dump it all over your breakfast like I did.

The majority of the book is devoted to descriptions of menus, buttons, etc. But it does not tie any of these descriptions into any kind of coherent whole. What's the point of knowing what an individual button does if there is no follow-up on how to incorporate that knowledge into putting together a project. The extremely short tutorials are misleading. The book says it will show you how to do a barn, for example. And then at the end of the uncompleted barn , the tutorial refers you back to the buttons! The book feels like the three authors did separate parts of the book and they did not know what the others were writing.

He loves making them squeak and he loves taking the tops off and putting them back. After he's done, I do make sure I have all the pieces and close the container (knowing he can't get into them on his own) so we make sure to keep everything together. Then he will forget about them for awhile, then he will find them again and want to play with them again--one time, he sat on the couch and played with them for AN HOUR AND A HALF!

I hoped to be able to read this book and be able to use it when talking with many of the Wilson devotees around here.

This is instead of using it as a forum for debating the theological fallacies of Wilson. He does go through Wilson's theology, but he can't drop the tone loathing that evident throughout the book.My word to Dr. Robbins: Get someone else to write another book that just discusses the theology. Something I can hand to people who like Wilson and doesn't put my friendship in jeopardy.Your book, while informative, is useless to me because it will never make it out of my book case.

Amazingly if you are just in search of entertainment which also educates you more than business school can without you even knowing it, this film is perfect for you too.

The film focuses on the life of Dogen, a 13th century monk whose search for authentic zen teachings and practice moves him to bring the practice of sitting meditation to all people. The fundamental elements of zen buddhism teachings....that the essence of enlightenment is accepting what is rather than grasping for what we want or pushing away what we don't want... is beautifully illustrated in this film.

I tried WD-40, lithium grease and a spray lubricant recommended as \\"the best lubricant we have\\" at Lowes, all to no avail.

Her mix of styles range from light pop to deep R&B.; The resulting CD is very good.The title track, \\"A Glamorous Life,\\" is easily the standout track here. I also enjoyed the beautiful \\"Next Time Wipe The Lipstick Off Your Collar.\\" Some of her drum solos on this CD are quite amazing too.Earlier this year, I had the priveledge of seeing Sheila E. perform with Ringo Starr and his All-Starr Band.

I read about half of it and scanned the rest. Author Stephen White is amazing and he deserves at least one bad book. This was it, for me.

There are many things that the LDS would object to because they are told not to read \\"anti\\" literature (even if true). I know; I was there. The LDS people are mostly genuine, but their hidden history and some doctrines are deplorable - no wonder they are warned not to read about them. If Mormons would only realize that those who warn them about \\"enemies of the church\\" may actually have something to hide. Good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN INFORMATIVE PAGE TURNER","review":"Time and place is the pace of this novel. Mormons, Utah (with a little New Mexico thrown in), and a killer is the main thrust of this story with a few women and a handful of men make up the body of what's happening. The highpoint is the description of the church's politics, the topography, and the relationships of the main characters. Finding out who the killer was took a back seat for me. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving and boring...","review":"Wow, I can't believe this was the same author who wrote the previous Alan Gregory novels. I am usually half way through one of Stephen White's books in a day or two. It took me 2 weeks to finish this book. It was nice that Lauren was the main character in this story, but I missed reading about the other characters that are usually present in Alan Gregory's life. I am hoping that the next novel is more like Stephen White's previous efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hatchet job on the Mormon church","review":"Two things struck me about this book. First, that it had a remarkably thin, pointless plot. I had trouble caring about any of the characters. Which convinced me that I am correct about the second point -- that the narrative was nothing more than a container for an attack on the Mormon church. I'm not a Mormon and have a lot of trouble with what the LDS church believes. But if you're going to write a book attacking a religion, why waste everyone's time with a wimpy story line upon which to hang your attacks? In my view, this was nothing more than The Da Vinci Code approach, but unleashed on Mormons."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is vendetta disguised as a boring novel","review":"I've read a number of Stephen White novels before, and have been favorably impressed. That's why I purchased this one without reading any reviews. I'm not a Mormon, and have no real opinion of their religion either way. What I can say is that this novel reminds me of a jilted lover talking about their ex. The plot seems secondary to White's need to tell the reader what I'm sure he considers dirty little Mormon secrets. The first time he mentions them, it's an interesting part of the novel. After repeating the same things over and over again, it's simply boring.As for the plot and the execution of the novel, it's slow-moving, tedious, and he seems to want to rush it to and end after he's been rambling on too long.I bought two more White books when I bought Higher Authority.

Who still doesn't love talking along to Prince's intro to \\"Let's Go Crazy?\\" If you play this song at an 80's high school reunion, the place will go nuts!!

The tracks of Purple Rain tell a story of love, lust, heartbreak, despair, and ultimately, redemption and acceptance. I have seen the movie as well, and it's got that same story, only with some drama and comedy (!!) thrown in for good measure. Basically, if you're a child of the '80s (or even if you can't really remember anything until '85 or '86 'cause you were too young back then) and you like good, heartfelt music, buy this CD and prepare to be blown away."},{"rating":"2","title":"prince and the revolution, purple rain","review":"Been to MANY concerts of different music genres, but none come close to Prince when it comes the mix of talent and performance.

I bought it because it is so highly regarded, and after repeated listening, I still dislike it - a lot. This is Jimi Hendrix meets Michael Jackson, interspersed with new wave, schmoozey jazz, pop... and it is a marriage made in hell as far as I am concerned. Sure, Prince can play a guitar. But that doesn't make it art. The missing ingredient is soul. This album is devoid of it. It is cold, clinical, unmoving, empty. I have not seen the movie and so am not biased by having visuals to add any value that might be lacking in the music. I gave it one star because one can't give less.

I can still remember the moment I dropped the needle on the record (record; not CD - that's how long ago it was) and heard the opening of \\"Let's Go Crazy\\", which is one of the best rock n roll songs you will ever hear. For me, the true sign of a great album is one that brings colors and images to your mind as you listen to it.

Electronic music can be very beautiful but it can also be very scary to a person raised on classic rock. Prince melds uncountable genres - dance, funk, pop are the main ones, though. Not only do I respect him for bringing electronic music to the mainstream but I also respect him for the chances he takes. I respect anybody that takes chances but especially those that risk their reputation and popularity to do so. Sure, \\"Sign O' The Times\\" is probably his most experimental/avant-garde work but this is probably his strongest material. This album makes all of it's listeners feel dirty and great. It's a very fun album with not one second of filler. Sure, I was born over a year after the album was released but the novelty has not worn off in over 16 years since its release.

Only Madonna and Michael Jackson give him competition at all.\\"Purple Rain,\\" \\"Darling Nikki,\\" and \\"When Doves Cry\\" are only a couple of the brilliant songs you can find on this cd.

The rules are clear and not overly long. The scoreboard for each player has handy rules reminders.Basically, you try to plant permanent evidence cards on other players and then change the fact cards in the middle of the table to match the opponent's evidence cards by the end of each of two rounds.Your ability to plant evidence and change facts is affected by the witness cards you have. Both you and your opponents can change your witness cards.Often a strategy requires several steps but you can only play one card per turn....Pants? is very original, unlike any game I've seen before.

The first thing I noticed when I received them was that they were thick and HEAVY. The bottom isn't completely solid, but has space for a small pocket of air when it's sitting on the counter. It's inconsequential though, because the glass in these mugs is as thick as you would want any of your thick glass beer mugs.

They frost up great and give you a little bit of slush in your drink as the mug thaws out. We thought we'd just use them for party type occassions, but now we just keep them in the freezer for when we want our drinks to be really cold. The mug itself is thick glass, giving it a quality feel. They are hefty so they take up room in the freezer, but at our house it's worth it.

The two problems are: 1) Large recesses on the bottom that catch about three tablespoons of water when run through the dishwasher and, 2) A molding seam that runs around the mug and even down the inside of the handle. The seam is large and sharp enough to be painful when holding the mug for an extended time.

This movie is awful - her character is mean spirited and selfish. She is not at all sympathetic so when she loses (as she should) I felt vidicated. The best part of this movie was Cameron Diaz who just let it all hang out there and didn't care how foolish she looked.On to the Wedding Planner. At lease J Lo is somewhat sympathetic, but again, she is not great in these movies. She is a only a sub par actress and I don't quite get her appeal. This movie is lacking in any real chemistry, but it's cute at the very best.For a really good Chick Flick, try Bridget Jones' Diary or An Affair to Remember with Cary Grant.

The majority of the songs remind me of the Lucy Pearl and 3T songs that I DIDN'T like. I was anticipating more cuts like Instant Vintage's \\"Skyy, Can You Feel Me\\" but they were nowhere to be found. Saadiq defintely enjoyed creating the album which I appreciate, but I had difficulty following the theme(s) (something to do with a pimp and the death of that dreaded label \\"Neo Soul\\"). I was searching for music that I could enjoy a good book, conversation, or cup of tea to, but needless to say, these songs just weren't there.

It comes with a cd also. My older daughter loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please.","review":"Sorry to be the skunk at the garden party, but watch this movie with a critical eye and think about the unspoken messages. In this movie (as in all the Barbie movies so far) the Barbie character is always soft-spoken, has perfect manners, never gets truly mad, performs occasional acts of physical derring-do without mussing her hair or dress, obeys her parents and never directly confronts authority even when it's evil. Her big idea of independence is \\"to marry who I please.\\" Whoop-de-doo. In short, this character is so syrupy sweet that just watching this movie could give you cavities. Is this really the role model you want for your daughter in a complicated and dangerous world? It's too late for our house--my 8 year old daughter already has this movie and loves it--but for anyone contemplating this purchase, take my advice: run the other way!--tracy content"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Language for small kids","review":"It can't even be published in writing the bad language that is used in this movie.

There is a limit though, and this monstrosity is light years beyond that limit.The plot is dreadful--not even vaguely related to the Twain story, and the animation is worse. The characters move--sorta, but nothing related to human or animal movement can be discerned.Realistically what can one expect from a Barbie video? I was hoping for something about 1/10 the quality of Disney. This production falls way short of even that modest standard.This isn't a movie, it is a marketing ploy."},{"rating":"2","title":"daughter loves this movie","review":"This is our 2nd copy of this movie.

I don't know if the DVD being sold on Amazon has the bonus audio, so I don't want to disappoint anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different style than the others","review":"This Movie has a slightly different style as it is a musical. It also has a music cd which is great and my daughter likes to dance to it. It has not yet captured her enough to ask to see it again and again like the swan lake movie. I think this one is suitable more for the older barbie fan. It is also possible to buy a toy cat that is interactive with the movie, but we do not have that.( Would like to know what others think of that!) However it is still a great movie and worth adding to your collection. However if you are looking for your first Barbie Movie to buy, I would go with either Swan lake as it is very enchanting, or second choice Rapunzel.On the whole I felt this was a good movie, and would recommend it for all you barbie crazy people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable","review":"My daughter, 4 years old, loves this movie and amazingly enough, I don't mind to watch it either!

THEY ARE CUTE AND THE LAST ONE IS HILARIOUS)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"I bought this to keep a sick child occupied (we have two of the other Barbie movies, and they were worth buying also), but I was blown away by how good this movie is. The story is more complex than you'd expect, and centers around the themes of duty vs. personal dreams, and what freedom means. The songs are quite singable (our version came with a CD of the songs, and it's sure getting used!), although at times they remind me slightly of some of the music from \\"Beauty and the Beast\\". I wasn't going to buy this round of dolls for my girls, but they love this movie and play out scenes constantly, so the dolls will be under the tree Christmas morning. If you're considering buying this one, it's as good as anything Disney's put out recently with the exception of \\"Finding Nemo\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince & Pauper???","review":"Story is very funny.

The songs are immediately memorable and well-written, with clever lyrics and singable melodies. The computer-generated animation is outstanding, and quite beautiful.

We will be watching this one again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie even for an 11 month old!!!","review":"This movie is wonderful, my daughter is 11 months and hates riding in the car, strange I know. Her Nana bought this along with a portable DVD player and she watches it with full attention. I never watched it but after about 3 car rides I found the music intoxicating and decided to take it into the house....I loved it even more!! While we do put on other DVDs for our daughter, this one is call \\"ole faithful\\".

These are the very ROOTS of the band.(..from infancy to grown up babies)Now to prove my point-WEEN is my all-time favorite band, and to this, comparatively, their very first albums (cassettes, actually) kind of suck- or aren't as developed, i should say. Now this is before thePod, i'm talkin like the crucial squeegie lip, etc. Now i love me some ween with every fiber of my being, even the early \\"Axis: Bold as Boognish\\", so that is as painfull for me to say as it is to listen to this album.

The print is large, and so are the white spaces.

After you pinch their lips or try the knee strike to the thigh, get ready for the real attack. All you will have done is irritate the guy. BOHICA!Not one effective strangle in the whole book. Nothing on restraining a hijacker after they have been neutralized. At least show how to use a neck tie or a scarf to secure their hands after they have been rendered unconscious.

It's fun, fast, and charming. As I dug in to the novel, I realized that the writing was much more complex and creative than I had expected. It's one of those novels where you know how it's going to end, but you don't mind sticking it through to find out how you're gonna get there. I read it in a few hours (I'm on bed rest for the last month of my pregnancy and bored out of my mind!) and found it to be a great escapist read with a pleasant ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serendipitous!","review":"I was in a rush at the library, needing to pick up a book to read for an all-night babysitting assignment. I zeroed in on this book because the author's name ends in \\"oux\\" like my maiden name, and because it was her first novel (I'm partial to debut novels because I find the authors giving it all they've got). And the title was intriguing enough for me to grab the book and run with it, and what a blast it was! The heroine is incredibly real, fresh, and honest--I couldn't put the book down, and I laughed and cried with Nicci, whose life I feel privileged to have followed for a couple of days. I used to always leave the room when my kids were watching Jackie Chang movies, but now I may as well rent one next time I'm in the library.

Brooding, sad, frustrated, unhappy, disgruntled - all adjectives which describe the main character, who is going through a shift in her life where she is being forced to finally decide what she wants and needs to be fulfilled.Most readers will see the end coming, and there are no surprises here, other than the fact that I'm surprised I was able to finish this dry novel. Not particularly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't really like it","review":"I thought that the writing style was ok, but the characters just didn't seem very real to me.

As usual with such groups, the leader turns out to be a nut case."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good Author writes great novel","review":"Chris Offutt's \\"The Good Brother\\" tells the story of Virgil Caudhill's inescapable fate after his brother Boyd is murdered. Offutt's beautiful but terrible tale perfectly demonstrates the futility of revenge, and the unintended but inevitable consequences that flow from retribution. This moving novel showcases Offutt's ability for character development and perfect dialogue with a true \\"page-turner\\" plot. While some reviewers are critical of the novel's turn once Virgil reaches Montana, I think they are missing the point. Offutt has done a magnificent job of conveying Virgil's isolation and disconnect with the world once he's removed from his native Kentucky. It is a telling moment when Virgil's happiest time in Montana occurs as he bonds with his would-be assassin, a native Kentuckian. This Southern boy can tell you, that moment was real.Read this book. Offutt is a treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Was this really written by the same person who wrote Kentucky Straight and The Same River Twice? Those books are fantastic.

The book is well-structured and researched, with very good illustrations. It is irritating that the captions repeat much of what is already in the text, but omit to mention where the paintings are held.

In this case EPA stands for Environmental Perfection Agengy and they are not the result of some green fantasy. They look out for the environment by tracking hazardous pollution coming from magic. In fact, the entire society replaces mechanistic techology for magical technology.

Reads like the trashiest British tabloid.Most repellent, in the chapter about the mother who struck back, Clarkson appears to blame the \\"flirtatious\\" nature of a young child for leading to sexual abuse against her.Clumsy, sensationalistic nonsense written for people who couldn't care less about actual fact or good writing and want something semi-pornographic - the murderess as a nymphomaniac lesbian sex-goddess deviant slut etc. Most of the stories lost me halfway through.It gets two stars for being only mildly interesting; it could have been so much more.

My only problem with it is that the bottom is just a little bit open, which can let dust in. In other words, you'll still need to go in and clean your pod occasionally.

The best message was \\"Set your dog up to succeed.\\" There are no dominance techniques used. The methods worked well with my toy breed except the leash training. I would have to be 3 ft tall to constantly feed treats as I walked. I also wish they had covered some fun commands like fetch."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one works.","review":"This video really works. I have two small dogs, a shih-poo and a shih tzu.

I would highly recommend this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"What a waste of $20. There is about a 3 minute explanation of difficult commands such as heel.

I want a trained dog not an obese dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"There was really no continuity to this program. They showed individual commands with one dog at a time. I was really disappointed in the note that \\"These dogs have had not previous training\\"! Rot and Humbug!!!! An untrained dog is not going to focus on the handler like these dogs do. He is going to have his face in the camara lens, sniffing the video guy, or standing behing the owner and barking at the equipment.

They would have benefited from having a script to follow rather than adlibbing it.The actual training information was really confusing. I got the sense that the dogs were doing what they were doing for the treats and not really learning anything.

I found the DVD much too simplistic. Even the DVD from PetSmart was more helpful to us with our new adopted shelter dog. She is a great dog but very willful. This DVD didn't help at all. Plus, even though I know a lot of trainers use food, I think it creates it's own set of problems. I use food, but this DVD, especially in the leash section, completely focuses on food. I have found other methods more successful and beneficial in my relationship with my new dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for new dog owners!","review":"I just bought my yellow labrador, Amber two months ago when she was two 1/2 months old. I didn't have a clue how to teach her to obey me. She was so hyperactive and rowdy, that I almost gave her up to my sister for adoption.I ordered this DVD, and it really helped me a lot! Now my dog knows the following: come, sit, down, stay, wait, and even name recall. The clicker training and tips on behavioural problems helped me a lot too!

I combined this with some of the Cesar Millan stuff, and my puppy was trained in no time flat. At 5 months of age he knows come, sit, lay down, stay, heel, shake, drop, and no. He walks really well on the leash, and surprising well off-leash as well. The only thing I will say is the video makes some things look really easy and like the dog learns what they want them to do in about 4-5 attempts. My experience is that it takes a bit longer. Most of the time it will take multiple sessions. But if you keep at it, and do about 15 minutes 2x a day with your dog, it will work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done...","review":"This video is absolutely professional in its content, production, and post production work.

The guy's voice is supremely annoying. Imagine Maroon 5's singer times two.Forget U2 and Coldplay. If you love garbage like Maroon 5 and other radio-ready forced pop songs then pick this up immediately. If you hate bands like Maroon 5 and prefer songs that don't feel forced to sound \\"epic\\" then run far, far away. This sounds plastic.

We purchased the Snap Circuits FM Radio for his birthday and followed up with one of the larger Snap Circuits kits. He loves them! It gives him some structure for all of his electrical ideas. The parts are durable and look nice. My only complaint about the radio is that the tuner is simply a button that scans through the FM frequencies. It is difficult to know what channel you are on. But, we just wait until we hear the call letters and then leave it on a channel that we like.

I am not saying that this is the worst book I have ever read in my entire life, however, I have read better. If I read this book on my own for, lets say, summer reading, I would have never continued reading after the first entry. The fact that I read it with my class forced me to understand each entry and realize all the examples of symbolism. Perhaps the book was just not my type. Or, on the other hand, maybe the events were just a little unrealistic. I WOULD reccomend this book to anyone who likes to read about real life encounters. This book, like any other, is worth a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful testament of loneliness","review":"What can a person say after reading a book like this? I identified with Marina so much. I keep a diary,don't talk much either(although more than her),used to be an outcast,and have never felt pretty. However,I'm not disfigured as she was. Now I'm grateful to be average-looking. She couldn't talk after a tragedy scarred her for life,so the journal became her only voice. Despite what he did to Marina,her father was the only relative she loved and wanted to see. She opened up a little to roommates and her English teacher. So much of it is touching and packs an emotional punch,especially the end. The only flaw in the whole book occasional vagueness.

Marina and this girl become friends, even without words. Throughout the book, the story of who and where Marina's father is becomes more clear. Also, why she doesn't speak. I thought that this book was great, and I could not stop reading it! John Marsden does a wonderful job of gradually unfolding the mystery of Marina, as he does in some of his previous books. All in all, this book is excellent and I strongly reccomend it to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One disturbing yet fascinating and intriguing novel.","review":"I have so much to tell you about this book. It is an Australian icon, written by one of Australian teenagers most admired writers. John Marsden creates a character who is in the depth of emotional trauma and unable to communicate with the outside world. Marina is a fascinating character, through her diary the reader is able to comprehend her detachment from society and her inability to reveal her feelings. Marina's emotionless facade slowly deteriorates as she returns to the reality of her world. The book preaches a million lessons which any reader will most certainly ponder, but, not in such a way that the book lacks a captivating story line. Marina's ability to forgive her father for distorting her face with acid and her effort to survive in the face of adversity are an inspiration.So Much To Tell You is easy to read, yet, encompasses a story which reveals too many morals to ever fully explore.Hoo Roo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This was such an amazing book.

Medical examiner Mitsuo Ando (Koichi Sato), grief-stricken over the recent death of his son and subsequent loss of his wife, conducts the autopsy on his friend Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada), the psychic who died at the end of the first film. He is drawn into the orbit of the Ring virus by a post-mortem communication from his old friend. Much of this quietly dramatic film is very powerful, but the story becomes increasingly outlandish as it progresses. Sato is outstanding, but he is undone by the screenplay and Joji Iida's direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"\\"Ring\\" was a horror classic - tightly written, interesting, scary without being gross, and well-acted.

Through it all, his sad children are subjected to emotional and physical upheaval as it seems neither parent is at all concerned about sparing them the more grisly details of their dismal marital breakdown. One reads it with squeamish fascination because, dreadful as it is, one needs to know how these piteous people are going to solve their tawdry problems.

It is way to wide to fit into any public restroom or any other door!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improvement...","review":"I bought this stroller about a month ago for my 3 year old and 4 month old. After I put it together, I was so excited since it was so much smaller, lighter and easier to fold than our last tandem, double stroller. I used it once, folded it an put it in the back of our van. When I took it out again, the sunshades were mis-shapen and we were unable to get them back in shape. This made me a little unhappy, but I was still able to use it. The next time we used it, I was pushing it in the mall and the front middle wheel just broke off. It was not \\"fixable\\". I was unhappy at this point and decided to try to return it to the store, since we only used it twice and it was broken. Toys r us graciously accepted the return no questions asked (thank goodness). I do like the idea of a side-by-side over the tandem, since they seem to be much more compact, and plan to look for another brand. I may have purchased a lemon, but I wouldn't recommend this particular stroller based on my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our experience with this double stroller","review":"I have a 4-month old and a 20-month old, and I needed a double stroller that was light weight and compact. This one seemed to fit the bill, but we've constantly had problems with it...The first one we got, the rivet in the back broke after a month, we were in the process of getting our baby out of the stroller when the rivet broke. The baby fell out of it and landed on the ground. A few scratches, but nothing serious ! We took it back to the store and they replaced it with another new one, exactly the same model. Once again, a month in, and while I was trying to unfold the stroller, the kickbar in the back that you need to step on to fold and unfold the stroller bent ! Now, it's almost impossible to fold and unfold the stroller.The design is great. It's well thought out and it's actually a neat little stroller. The problem is that it keeps breaking !"},{"rating":"2","title":"almost perfect","review":"Everything about this stroller is great, the size, weight, portability, ease of use, etc... except for the sun/rain covers, they are flimsy and pretty much useless.

A DVD showing the championship game. It's not.Also, the product description of \\"reliving\\" the moments was very misleading. The best way to relive those moments is to see the game in which it was played. This is a cheesy highlight reel of the 06-07 season.

The Baywatch Mix has a more \\"perfecto-esque\\" trancey-energetic feel. You will be blessed to encounter the Daniel Klein and Basti mix (my fave), which combines a 70s disco-y loop (very subtle and not commercial) with some very deep pads that break in right away.

You will enjoy reading some better known businesses like Terra Chips as well as lesser known ones like Three Dog Bakery who makes gourmet biscuits for dogs. It's amazing a dog biscuit company makes over a million dollars a year, but since this book is about young millionaires, every company profiled in this book makes over this amount."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"After anxiously waiting for this book to arrive, it only took me a couple of hours to read it.

My main criticism is that the genesis of Kolbert's book is a series of New Yorker articles and the book feels in part like a series of articles stitched together. Flannery's book, in my view, holds together better as a book, whereas Kolbert's book sometimes feels like a series of vignettes strong together.

The author quotes two graphs and data that have already been debunked and proven incorrect but she has done no investigation of her own to determine their validity... ergo no science. For readers really interested in learning about climate change and what causes it I would suggest any of the following titles: Unstoppable Global Warming by singer and Avery; The politically incorrect Guide to Global Warming by C.

The book does give evidence for global warming but the evidence that it is manmade is lacking. Surprisingly, the author does not resort to political hysterics til the end.The book is well written. The author writes in a captivating way that kept my attention and sympathies throughout. It is divided into chapters that possess different 'evidences' for the 'inevitable' climate catastrophe. Some of these chapters are interesting.The author does write with an air that the 'science is settled' which I always find disturbing and disingenuous. The truth is, is that climate is a vastly complex phenomenon that we understand very poorly as do our feeble attempts of modeling it.My recommendation is to read it, but also read a book critical of reality of manmade climate change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, Easy-to-Read Exploration into Global Warming","review":"I don't usually read environmental books but I couldn't put this down.

It works great, but then the weak plastic tabs on the side break and the springs that make contact with the batteries force the top and bottom halves apart making it useless.

Even after getting the batteries in place, the frother simply wouldn't work. I tried three different pairs of brand new batteries and none produced even the slightest response. I even tried inserting the batteries the wrong way up, just to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding the directions or that the instructions weren't printed improperly--still no response. I sent back the product for a replacement (thanks to Amazon, it arrived the next day) and had the same problem. Neither of the frothers would work.

The battery compartment also didn't cause too much of a hassle when I first tried to get the frother juiced up on a couple AAs.One gripe I have is that it merely froths milk and doesn't heat it.

This one pales in comparison. A light weight flimsy version for sure and one that needs a battery replacement way too often. Probably because it only calls for one AAA battery and the older version used four at a time. It DOES froth well, so I guess if you are very careful with it and have a drawer full of batteries, you will get by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aching Thumbs Down","review":"I had an IKEA frother for years that was terrific and cost about $6. When it died, I decided to order online since I wasn't heading to IKEA anytime soon. I ordered this frother because of the good reviews and because I liked the idea of the stand. Alas, it was practically unusable for me because it took so much pressure to press down on the power button to make it work, which has to be held down as you use it.I don't have arthritis and have never experienced this kind of difficulty before - very unpleasant. But I was too lazy to return it so used it each morning to froth milk for my coffee.

I'll try a different brand next time"},{"rating":"1","title":"works well but","review":"I bought this item after seeing one at a friends home. I have been using it and really enjoying it but I wish that it was of a more robust construction. For simply frothing milk it's fine but once I got this thing I started wondering \\"what else could one do with it?\\" Surprisingly enough the frother made a single portion of whip cream from heavy cream and sugar, but it really struggled towards the end of the process as the cream got thick. Yesterday I used it to make a BBQ sauce from ketchup, brown sugar vinegar and other spices...but once again the viscus nature of the liquid was a bit of a chore for the frother to command.So as a frother and for blending sugar into a cold solution of tea or coffee it works great.

You just have to follow the simple directions and depress -both- side buttons at the same time; same for closing the case. It is really very easy to do.My homemade latte tasted great and the foam really stayed \\"foamed\\". (Cocoa was good, too).

Very disappointed","review":"I am very disappointed with this model. I bought 3 (2 for gifts) because I liked the look and had other models that worked well. I have had mine for about 2 years.

The froth was just right and it only took seconds to create \\"espresso-like cafe.\\" This morning I took it from its stand to \\"froth\\" another cup of coffee. Alas! The rubber housing had rotted exposing the batteries. When I touched the rubber it crumbled and fell into pieces. I am doubtful if I will buy this brand again. The life is too short for me. Another brand would surely outlive this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"when it works it's great","review":"This was a very frustrating product. It worked great when it worked, but it was hard to keep it working because the two parts were joined by a very minimal plastic thread and it frequently fell apart in my hands when frothing, when bumped against something or on the counter with no apparent reason. I would not buy this product again, even though it did a great job of frothing WHEN IT WORKED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well until the plastic casing breaks","review":"If you don't want to use this frother a lot, then it should suit your purposes.This frother is not very durable. Mine broke at each of the side buttons (which are used to open the battery compartment). I tried to put electric tape around it to hold it together, which worked for quite awhile. Finally, the plastic broke completely off and I had to throw the frother away. I will not be buying this model again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and performance","review":"Received the product timely but it was of poor quality (plastic) and did not perform at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and practical gadget","review":"This gadget is very useful, practical and easy to use. Since we got it, we've enjoyed countless cups of home made capuccinos. Just pour some very cold, non fat milk in a cup and froth it for about 10 secs. That's it. The frother doubles the amount of milk. top it with some cinammon or chocolate powder and your capuccino will be even better than the one in your local coffee shop.Also, I like the fact that it operates on 2 AA batteries that last for a long time.

So much better then all the expensive cappuccino machines we previously had. I am just hoping it will last at least a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than other frothers! Definitely worth the money.","review":"Before purchasing this frother I had a frother from the Dollar Tree and then the bodum frother. The Bodum frother did a decent job but it was a bit flimsy and broke after a few months. The froth that it made also tended to \`melt' into your coffee.This frother is very sturday and makes amazing froth. I have had it for about a year and half now and use it at least 5 times per week. It makes wonderful froth that stands up on its own.To get the best froth, pour a small amount of cold, skim milk into a tall narrow glass. Froth for a few seconds and the milk will double in volume. Place it in the microwave for 30 seconds and it will further increase in volume. It does not disappear in your coffee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak frother, overpriced, get the one from Ikea for $3 instead","review":"I've been looking for a good frother to make my Greek Frappe coffee. I got this for Christmas and I'd have to say it's SLOW. I had bought a different frother from Ikea for $3 and that one spins so much faster and stronger than this one (don't use Ikea batteries). So save your money. Other notes: the stand is so lite that it falls over when removing it, the unit itself looks cool but that's it. I recommend buying one that uses 4 batteries instead or just get the cheap one from Ikea.Update: using good quality batteries helped, but mine has just died after 2 years of casual use.

Warm up some milk, whip it with the frother, and, if you let it stand for a minute, the froth will hold up very well when you add the milk to your espresso or coffee.

Since it couldn't be put back together, I had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 10 months","review":"Did a good job while it worked.

This movie could have been called Anne and the War since so much time was spent on World War I. I feel the war could have been limited to 30 minutes at the most. I believe Kevin Sullivan owes us a better movie....a 4th movie strictly about Gilbert and Anne perhaps called Home Again and depicting their family life.

The original chracters are in it (all except Diana's husband, and we didn't see much of him in the others anyway)and they all did a wonderful job in picking the story back up again. It didn't get boring, the story was always moving. If you enjoyed Anne of Green Gables for the acting, and the story itself and it doesn't matter if this particular story was a L.M. Montogomery book (like the other reviewer), then I definitely recommend it.

It made me want to read all the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought-provoking, captivating and entertaining story","review":"Black Cats grabbed my attention from the start with the story of Violett's rather difficult trip into adulthood. I was instantly intrigued by the world created by Ms. Doll. Most of the story takes place in a small town where decorations on umbrellas denote social cliques and gods have dinner parties. The book quickly gets interesting as Violett's attraction to a mysterious man pulls her into a life that is both exhilarating and devastating. By the end of it I'm not sure if she would have been better off never having known him, but maybe she didn't have that choice.The story is told with a refreshing writing style. It's not blunt, and occasionally somewhat abstract. I just wish it hadn't ended, so I could stay in the world a little longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With--Witty, Charming, Fun For All","review":"Mostly, when you see the phrase \\"fun for all\\" it really means \\"fun for nobody\\", but that does not apply here.The Foglios' illustrations and writing are vivid & joyous, and their sense of humor displays minds born with the belief that \\"the world is mad, so why not enjoy it?\\"Clever riffs on the old Universal Horror classics mix with wild sight gags & a great fondness for the spectacular in their work.There's a plot, too. That's always nice.The Hipster gives it a Big Thumbs UP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic comic and an excellent item to own!","review":"I'm not a huge fan of comics and I certainly don't spend a lot of money buying comics that were originally online. Yet this series is so fantastically awesome that I find the investment in the paperback printings entirely worth it. These volumes are just thick enough to sit comfortably on my bookshelf and thin enough to read while on my back. You should really read these in color to get the full impact of their rich and vivid world.This is definitly a must-have series for anybody who likes Steampunk. The characters are fun, the bad guys are grandiose, the outfits rock and occasionally stuff gets blown up.

Truly a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got the lemon","review":"Not only is the music performed on a keyboard, but my copy had two \\"The Two Towers\\" discs. Even though the first disc read \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" it had duplicate tracks from \\"The Two Towers\\". Luckily I only paid $.99 for it at a music and am now selling it back for $2.95.

However, some songs do include some backup from the City of Prague Symphony Orchestra and the Crouch Festival Chorus. Granted, many songs are only Mask's synthesizer, but for a synth recording, it's really not that bad. Think of Rick Wakeman's recordings or Vangelis or Tangerine Dream. if you're a purist, this is certainly not acceptable, but I rather like it for what it is. I got it at a used record store anyway, didn't cost me much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very poor","review":"When purchasing this cd set, I expected the magnificence that is the movie soundtrack, all song with full orchestra. These cds sound as if all of the music comes utterly from a synth keyboard, which is most likely the complete truth. I wanted the real thing, and mistakenly bought a cheap imitation. If you enjoy synthesized orhcestrations, I'm sure you'll enjoy, butthis is as far from what I wanted as possible. I should have used more caution, and am going to attempt to return the cds.

The giver thought it was cool to get me this all-in-one set (I had asked for all three movie soundtracks) and didn't realize that it wasn't actually the score from the movies. I gave it a listen and was pretty disappointed. I'm not really a synth fan and while there are some songs that sound pretty good, I much prefer the \\"real\\" thing. The biggest disappointments were on the Return of the Kings portion. Into the West is on there twice and is sung by someone who is definitely NOT Annie Lennox. I am a big Annie fan and I really love this song so hearing someone else sing it (not that they were bad) just really set my teeth on edge. And another one of my favorites from Return of the King, Steward of Gondor, when Billy Boyd sings. That of course isn't even on this disk.If you were affected by the music and score of the movies and want to listen to the music on its own, buy the real soundtracks. This version just doesn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a symphony, or an orchestra, but a synthesizer","review":"Another viewer incorrectly stated that this was played by a \\"medicore orchestra\\" this is not an orchestra at all, it is a guy and his synthesizers.

Not exactly.Upon listening to the contents, I noted that the recording sounded distinctly different from the orchestral music of the films. After closer inspection of the package, I see now that it is \\"performed by Mask.\\"I have a feeling that \\"Mask\\" is basically one person armed with a battery of synthesizers. Listening to the CDs, I have this mental image of Yanni, outfitted in chain mail, giving a one-man keyboard concert from the highest level of Minas Tirith....Then again, Howard Shore's music is so strong that the CD's are not an entirely disagreeable listening experience. I find myself actually liking them at times, not for the synthesizer timbre, which is sometimes painful, but because they actually sometimes closely evoke the orchestral score.But really, if you want the LOTR soundtrack, get the orchestral recording, not this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disaster","review":"Howard Shore's original soundtrack recordings for L.O.T.R. are my favourite music releases. This simply doesn't do them justice. The music appears to have been performed on a keyboard and most of the tracks are in the wrong order with several left out. Most tracks that are included just consist of part of the particular song being repeated; Into The West appears twice- presumably to use up space. The music itself is performed poorly- they make lots of mistakes with the tempo, etc. The singing, while bearable, is also pretty bad. I have a feeling they just wanted to take advantage of the popularity of the scores and make some easy money. Please don't be fooled into thinking you are going to get the soundtrack cheaper. I would strongly reccomend that you get the Complete Recordings boxsets if you really want to experience the true magnificence of these scores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompetent","review":"Is William trying to emulate a Syd Barrett solo effort?

It's extremely fun for about the first two months and it's very long so it's not to easy. The best handheld rpg ever but the one con is that after about two months it gets kind of boaring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too easy","review":"I got this game a few months ago, and stopped playing after the first week. It's semi-entertaining in the beginning, when at least you die a few times and enemies are hard to kill. After level ten or so, it's just boring. I could kill pretty much anyone, including bosses, in under three seconds, rarely having to use health potions. Even the final boss wasn't hard. So if you enjoy running around hitting \\"x\\" as much as you can and watching people get mowed down...for 20+ hours of gameplay...buy this game. Otherwise, don't waste your money. The graphics are good, but they're really not that impressive. The storyline is dull, and the quests aren't engaging.

I have to wonder what the developers were thinking when putting together this game. It's basically a PSP version of the PS2 Game Champions of Norrath but strangely without the fun. The 4 classes make little sense, the graphics are very poor (very hard to make things out at times), the story line is absolutely horrible and gameplay is repetitive. In addition it left out one important thing CoN had, multi-player over the internet.I don't know why anyone would rave about this game but definately try it before you buy it if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"Its an okay start on the psp for rpgs but its very boring fast. You constantly do the same thing which is. To go to some underground place and kill the boss. Thats all you do the entire game. This game is like its unfinished. It needs more to it not just constantly killing stupid bosses. The characters you can choose from arent any greater then the rest of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't even fun.....","review":"Honestly, this is the EXACT same thing as Balder's Gate....and Balder's Gate 2....and Diablo.....and Diablo 2....all of which are MUCH better then this game is. For one, only 4 characters types, no choice of gender, unless you pick the character that is the gender you want, and the \\"customization\\"? Nothing more then 2 skin tones and 4 hair styles. Wow.

All in all, This was a good choice for the PSP. If you get this from Gamestop be sure to get the printed manual. It is very important to chose your additional skills as you progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad launch title!","review":"Untold Legends is an RPG brought to us by Sony Online Entertainment, the same people that gave us Everquest, EQ2, and Star Wars Galaxies. While this game is not anywhere near as in depth as those games, it is a fun, light, roleplaying game, and the only one available at the launch of the PSP. It's really not even in the same vein as the afore-mentioned titles, and really owes a debt to Blizzard's Diablo line of games, as it plays nearly identical. Choose between 4 character classes, various modifications to appearance and skills, and off you go. The game offers quests and spells and dungeons to explore and equipment to loot and buy and sell, as well as providing fairly impressive graphics for a handheld game.Untold Legends is a perfect RPG for people like me, with a little time to kill on the train ride home, or late at night in bed when you can't fall asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Game- Read on","review":"At first, I couldnt put this game down. at about level 21, (13 hours or so of gameplay) I am now getting a little bored with the storyline. Go find this, go kill this etc. I still enjoy it on lunch breaks from work or car rides etc. It's similar to Diablo or Baldars Gate. It's nothing new, but it is a great RPG for timekill etc. Fun for at least the first 13 hours or so. The game is also somewhat easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty RPG","review":"Granted I have only owned this game and the PSP for a little over 24 hours now but I can say that this is a decent RPG to sink your teeth into with your brand new PSP system. I like the controls; the joystick action is smooth and has an easy learning curve. The eye candy is nice and the game \\"feels\\" like it will last quite awhile. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is for the fact that I really dislike the dialogue screens when you are talking to NCP's. Your mileage may vary but I really hate this about handheld RPG's. Also I imagine I would give it 3 stars as other RPG's come out for this system but right now it's the only game in town and not too shabby. Oh yeah, I hate how the disks don't have a little protective door like 3.5 floppies have ergo the 3 stars for durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good RPG for the Launch of the PSP","review":"Great game, good graphics, and a ton of variety with character types. The sounds effects are amazing along with the engaging music.If you like Neverwinter Nights, Dungeon Siege, or Diablo 2, you'll enjoy this game.Downside? Load times are bad sometimes . . .1 - 2 mins is a long time but what can you expect from a disk-media type game system.Regardless, the game is great and it's a must for RPG fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"three and a half for a pretty good game","review":"this is probably one of the better psp games you can buy at the moment, it seems as if it could go on forever with so many levels (even though i just go it with my psp 2 days ago). the story line is a bit difficult to follow so if you get games just for the story (why would you anyway) don't get this game, but for those of you who just want to do something for an hour or more this is the game for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hack n' Slash Adventures!","review":"The character enhancement tree is amazing, I love how it varies for each of the character classes. The weapons and armor also vary through the different classes, and can be customized in many ways. The jewelry adds a nice touch for increasing for Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, and Intelligence. Your character can be customized in many ways such as hair stlye, and colour. The skin tone can also be changed. The thing that isn't great is there is no gender change, but covering up the distinguishing male and female marks can be covered up by armor. This game have very many missions which are easy to follow, but challenging to complete.

A word to the wise- don't buy from rock 30 games, you can't be sure they'll send you a working and/or complete product.Since I didn't get to play the game, I'm giving it 1 star for fun.

The dialogue was so unsatisfactory and the characters are set up to be generally hated. The dialogue was delivered like a bad soap opera show left on the cutting room floor. All of the actors should not have been hired.The characters are all one-dimensional caricatures (I know that's the point, it doesn't mean I have to like it though), the rambling, wandering story doesn't go anywhere, and when all is said and done, the movie doesn't even really end so much as it just stops.There is absolutely no redeeming value in The Clown Murders (1976).

This double album is sweet. CD 1 is more of a hardhouse banging type mix with tracks 3,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,16 and 20 being my favourites. CD 2 is a more trance ambient kind of sound which I personally prefer. Pretty much the whole of CD 2 is living large and I like virtually all the tracks on that CD. Basically the whole of the album is fantastic and I am looking forward to the new Ibiza Annual 2000 mixed by Tall Paul and The Judge which is due for a release very soon.

If you are easily put off by low production quality, you will likely feel cheated by this disc; some of the video is of very low quality.

If by remote chance you are installing onto a cabinet and don't want the screws to pierce through to the inside of a very thin cabinet wall, go to Home Depot (or somewhere), and get a packet of #10 (1/2 inch) zinc washers.

The unit was not near any remote controlled items and the alarms were going off at times when no one was using any remotes? They wouldn't explain the reason for this. Nowhere in the instructions is this cure for this problem mentioned. C'mon do we really need to be able to test the unit with a remote? Especially when it causes so many problems. This unit obviously went into production and is being sold to the public before all the bugs were worked out. I don't trust this product and purchased a Kidde unit and so far no problems with it.

It started going off in the night.I called to speak to a manager. Left a message, no call back.

I then replaced the battery and a day later it said the same thing.First Alert replaced the first two with no problem. The third one they told me I had to pay for-what a joke. They also tried telling me to only use Energizer batteries for some reason. I told them that I used Duracell batteries and didn't see why I had to use Energizer brand specifically.These First Alert brand alarms are junk.

When the album finally came out, I listened to it over and over again. There's no doubt that this album was a bleed over from Yazoo to Erasure (I'm sure this was more of Clarke's baby since he was the one who hired Bell). Erasure hadn't quite found their true sound yet 'til \\"The Circus\\". That's why I give the album four stars. All of the songs are great. But they do sound like Yazoo, and although that's not a bad thing, it's not really who or what Erasure really were. If you can find the U.K. version, get that one!

When I heard this album was being remastered I had my hopes up that this annoying glitch would be corrected. No, it wasn't. \\"Push Me, Shove Me\\" is AGAIN not faded out and the song abruptly stops cold.Thankfully after ripping this CD to MP-3, I took \\"Push Me, Shove Me\\" into a sound editing program to properly fade out this song, something that SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE during the remastering process.

My vehicle is garage kept and I don't keep it outside longer than I have to. All the adhesives work for a few months then comes loose; this one didn't make it 1 day, I found my player on the floor a few hours later.

Not only that but no wedge can teach you how to spin, that's something only a PGA professional can show you with adapting your stance, swing, and release. Sure if you want this club to joke around then fine, but it is cheating and it will chew up any ball you try to hit with it.Playing in local and state tournaments is fun and challenging but even if you don't play tournament golf, then you should at least be honest and play by the rules.If you want a club with a replaceable face, then consider the TaylorMade xFT wedge. You can find awesome deals on xFT wedges being sold for $60 with one face.

From the first screen there were lost pixels and glitches. All the rooms look exactly alike except there might be a few more crates in one then the other. Anyways you cant save whenever you want and if you die you lose all your weapons that you picked up so you have to fight hand to whatever weapon your enemy has wich is very unfair.

I got lost very easily, and wasn't at all sure what I was supposed to do. So I ended up just hitting things randomly.Second, the movement of the character around the environment is so ...

Note that it is mislabeled as a 5.1 Dolby Digital transfer, when in fact it is only 5.0. This doesn't seem to be a big deal but that LFE channel is missing. In any case, Ms. Krall as usual gives a great performance. Her quartet opens the jazz fest in June, 2004 and she is a big hit. Here she takes on a few standards, some contemporary works and 5 of her own compositions, co-written by hubby Elvis Costello. All are brilliant. Her closing performance of familiar \\"Departure Bay\\" is tear inducing. The camera work is excellent with some nice fades and overhead shots of Krall's exquisite long fingers doing their job."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"I know I'm in a minority, but though I'm a big fan of Krall, Wilson and Erskine , I found this release disappointing and inferior to the sublime Paris concert. Not because of the material--which is ok- but because of the production and performance. The former is spoilt by silly camera hyperactivity and a less than great sound quality.Regarding the performance, Krall seems to go for technique too often rather than content--and her vocals are sometimes tired sounding with intonation lapses.Wilson has his moments,but I prefer the sound of the older instrument he used in Paris.Hurst has plenty of chops but seems bored for some of the time and frankly the Hurst/Erskine axis doesn't swing as much as the Clayton/Hamilton pairing. (Compare their respective versions of All or Nothing and East of the Sun) Notwithstanding the above, I'll still eagerly await DKs next project..."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak effort by Diana","review":"Diana Krall has a less than classic voice but it works for her. What doesn't work for her are the musical results of anything associated with Elvis Costello. She has recorded many excellent songs, but I am really and objectively angry that she wasted her time with Costello--maybe her love for him trumped her judgment."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"I enjoyed \\"Diana Krall: Live in Paris\\" very much, but the montreal jazz festival is poorly constructed. Peter Erskine and Robert Hurst weren't as good or enthusiastic as Jeff Hamilton and John CLayton. Diana rushes on a few songs, such as \\"East of the Sun\\" and \\"Devil may care\\" Also, the camera couldn't keep still for more than 5 seconds, and it gets very irksome to watch after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Back To the Old Goodies","review":"This CD stinks Diana is at her best doing the old evergreens like on \\"The Look of Love\\" and \\"live in Paris\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana Krall - I'm coming Through","review":"Diana comes through loud and clear on this, another fabulous live recording. I don't know who her recording team are or if they are the same each time, but this ladies live recordings are amazing.

This a quartet not like the huge group in \\"Paris.\\" But what a quartet. Some of the best Jazz I've heard in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I got this DVD after i saw Diana Krall live in Paris. This disc is nothing compared to Live in Paris. The camera switches shots every half second. I even saw a person in the crowd shaking his head!! This concert seems to be low budget. They did not have an orchestra. There was only 4 people. They couldn't even get a chair for the guitar player!!! I think Jeff Hamilton and John Clayton is much better than Peter Erskine and Robert Hurst. Peter Erksine is pretty bad at brushes, and Jeff Hamilton is phenomenal at brushwork. I do not recommend this DVD. Get the live in Paris instead if you have not gotten that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"frantic camerawork throughout the concert","review":"frantic camerawork throughout the concert. There are so many camera angles fading in and out that it gets tiring to watch. I just wished that the camera would sit still for at least 10 seconds.

This is supposed to be a jazz concert, not a rock concert.Also, I don't get these songs, either. Pretentious stuff, it seems to me. The woman can play the piano, but her singing is lacking.I say give Peggy Lee a listen, try Shirley Horn, Billie Holiday, Dione Warwick, Etta James, Dalida, Jeane Manson, Kelly Flint (of Dave's True Story), Nana Mouskouri, Dusty Springfield, Carmen McRae...I could go on."},{"rating":"1","title":"EEEEEHHHH ---","review":"I,too, am a big fan of Diana-- That being said, I thought \\"Freak Out\\" was just that. There is a similar set on the \\"Live in Paris\\" album that is much more coherent. Enough can't be said of the skills of the bassist and the drummer, but I'm sure that Diana could come up with a more creative guitarist. As to Krall/Costello creations, I didn't expect Joni Mitchell. I think that an album on the general line of those compositions would be great. I would rather have more standards/straight ahead jazz at the - after all - jazz concert.

The hero, Rob Finn, another jockey, and the others discuss the event. The suicide victim's wife has a fur coat and is not likely to welcome the commiserations of the other jockeys. They choose not to present themselves to be snubbed. The suicide victim had been obsessively tidy. Finn witnessed the suicide. The suicide victim and a trainer had been in the habit of exchanging acrimonious words.The other offerings in the three novel set are equally fine.

It covers the life of Daisy Fay from age eleven to eighteen, and believe me, nobody else has lived the life this girl lived. Heartwarming, funny, it has made me ready to go on to read all of Ms. Flagg's other books. PLEASE NOTE: This is also published under the title Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man.

It's got that cold 80's technological pop sound that groups like Mister Mister, tears for fears, fixx, bryan adams, etc had back in those mid 80's MTV days. And why is he singing? He sounds like a modern day teen pop \\"boy band\\" singer. With the girly love lyrics, it seems like this is music made for girls. Seems EJ can't make his mind up to either play guitar for the guys, or sing teen love songs for the girlies. You can't have both. As for the guitar playing, it's very one dimensional. He does one thing and does it to death. He still plays he same licks today as he did in the 80's. And many of his songs sound too similar to other songs of his. And his tone, well it's an overly processed effects gimmicky sound, built on a fuzzy type farty overdrive (either tubedriver or fuzzface). Doesn't sound warm or organic or classic like tube amps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Dre did not produce this album and it shows!","review":"Perhaps I am spoiled by The Chronic and Doggystyle but this album just really doesn't sound that good. Dr. Dre did not produce this album and it definitely does not have his G-Funk signature sound. Snoop is obviously a huge talent but without that G-Funk sound to play off of it just doesn't work for me. Snoop can't cary the album on his vocal talents alone. I was very disapointed with this album, in fact I could hardly listen to it and it hasn't grown on me. The tracks and producing are just weak. The bass doesn't sound funky and there is not nearly the depth and complexity to the tracks on on Snoops previous works. As much as I want to like it, it is a very average album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and poorly organized","review":"The content of the book is generally good. However, without some sort of audio examples of the techniques shown in the book, you will be unable to recreate the riffs -- unless you are already familiar with them, in which case why would you buy this book?If you are thinking the included CD will somehow be relevant and match the content of the book, think again. It is an hour of of 16-bar blues continuously looped with Jon Gindick giving words of encouragement over the top of the music.I recommend instead going out and purchasing some Sonny Boy Williamson albums and skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oil filter.

Bones of the Moon took a long time to get started, and even then didn't feel like it was moving. A few major characters seemed to serve no purpose, and though all of them were likable, liking them wasn't enough to justify the amount of time spent developing them. The characters that did matter were involved in a lackluster quest in a dreamworld devoid of interest.

I was between books so I bought it, got it home and started on it right away.Bones of the Moon is familiar territory for any readers who have read other Carroll novels. Carroll deftly blends real life with fantasy to form his unique hybrid. Unlike other books I've read by him, however, Bones of the Moon dragged a little bit. And I'm not sure why. By the time I reached the end, I was emotionally involved and was very pleased overall.This or any other novel by Carroll is worth a read.

This short volume (like the rest of this series this one is also only 120 pages or so long), only contains two stories. It is not necessary to read the earlier novels to appreciate this one, nor even to read these two stories in order.Fans of McCall Smith's other series, such as 44 SCOTLAND STREET, or CORDUROY MANSIONS, will possibly be disappointed in this one. Dr von Igelfeld is not as nearly sympathetic a character as others of McCall Smith's, nor is there an ongoing story being told.

Right off the bat, beware that this series has nothing in common with his beloved detective novels set in modern day Botswana. It is hard to believe that he wrote too such different types of books.The Portuguese Irregular Verb series of which \\"At the Villa Reduced Circumstances\\" is just one book can best be described as a droll send up on the absurdities of academic life. McCall's style can best be described as extremely dry and verging on the absurdist. This type of subtle humor is not for everyone.The books in the series do not need to be read in order.

Without giving away the plot, I will say that the professor gets into a situation that, while humorous, is just too improbable to sustain itself well. Other reviewers have compared this series to the works of P.G. Wodehouse. There is something of that same dreamy quality to the stories, with characters whose feelings of social propriety and personal embarrassment make it difficult for them to avoid or escape awkward situations. Smith does a good job of creating characters who are sympathetic despite their flaws. But there is a feeling of something missing. Here, he never reaches the depth that he achieved in his \\"Ladies Detective Agency\\" series, and he doesn't provide enough humor to compensate for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular graphics and drifting action!!!!","review":"If you're a racing game fanatic.. this one has it all... amazing realistic courses, kewl cars and wicked drifting!!!

After 18 years, an arrest was made and this person was an exact replica of the picture Noreen drew. This person is now in prison for premeditated first degree murder.

I find it implausible that a glamorous person like Amelia Jackson would get involved with such a shady character and then actually allow him to weazle his way into living in her villa! What a lowlife. The East Somarian kidnapping plan was completely ridiculous. But the one saving grace of the story is the wild and funny wedding banquet. Actually, the only interesting character in the story was the filmmaker Elliot Simon, but he wasn't developed enough.Ladyfingers, to me, was a very strange story."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Freedom Calls, You Answer","review":"Ladyfingers is a book about change and opportunity. A sudden windfall of money changes the lives of three American women. Then career and relationship disasters effect the lives of three other American women who all end up living in the South of France. But beware of opportunists and gigolos, no matter how sexy they may be. Ladyfingers is not only funny but it is a cautionary tale as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Americans in Europe","review":"This is the funniest novel about expat life that I have ever read. The Americans are crass and silly, always slipping over their tongues and generally offending everyone they come in contact with despite their mega super dollars and designer clothes. Their foolish highjinks are unforgettable, especially that fiasco wedding banquet at the Negresco. They all leftt a wake of property damage behind. Ladyfingers shows that even complete idiots can have a lot of money in America!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny!","review":"A group of working class American women suddenly come into an incredibly huge sum of money. They all end up going to a lifestyle makeover specialistic so they can all high-tail it out of town before poor-trash relatives can catch up with them to ask for money! In the meantime, some east Somarian brothers are waiting on the French Riviera, ready to kidnap them...only these guys aren't East Somarians at all! In the meantime, in a parallel universe, a famous, African American pop star who lives on the Riviera finds out that her European lover is not who he appears to be, and they begin attempts to try and renegotiate their relationship.Ladyfingers is the most clever and outrageous story of \\"American foreign relations\\" I have ever read. The biggest problem I had with the story is that it left you wondering what happened to the Filmmaker and his bride after the disastrously ridiculous Wedding Banquet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verry humorous, with an erotic touch!","review":"The character Amelia Jackson, the international pop star brings to mind Diana Ross. I am not sure if that was the author's intention, but the idea certainly held me throughout the story.The author created a new type of American expatriate story, taking place in an unexpected place, with an unexpected and riotous cast of characters. Sexy yet mis-matched couples, gallant opportunists, and eccentric artist types parade through this tale of American misadventures abroad. I thorougly enjoyed this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor content","review":"My kids love Helllo Kitty. I bought this video thinking the kids would LOVE it! And I was right! They absolutely loved it. The theme song is catchy to say the least and the clay characters are very captivating to the kids. The only problem I have was the content. They are showing the characters being mean to each other and crying and being grumpy but then never coming to a resolution. The stories end with me wondering what happened next?! The behavior modeled would have been fine if there was a proper response to the bad behavior modeled as well. All in all..fun to watch but low quality content/storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for Laymon","review":"Boring. Thats the only way to discripe this awful novel. Boring. It started alright, with six kids and a teacher contacting the dead with an ouiji board. A quest for treasure, alone in the woods. Sounds creepy, right?Wrong. I have never been so bored with a horror novel. The villans were awful, the dialog second rate, and no suspense. The usual Laymon trademarks were a little shallow.The Travling Vampire Show was creepy and great. Island was a funny blast. In The Dark was chock full of suspense. Pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laymon &#65533; Darkness, Tell Us","review":"Laymon's novels are so much fun - this one is no exception. Darkness, Tell Us is similar in nature to my favorite Laymon effort, Island. Take a group of people stranded in a remote camp site in the mountains, add deranged killer and you end up with a perfect vehicle for Laymon's twisted imagination. Darkness, Tell Us is a quick, entertaining read sure to please Laymon fans old and new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced, not a great ending.","review":"I'm a big Laymon fan, and this book was no disappointment. His books are for fun, and this one delivered. There wasn't too much gore in this one, and it has a couple of nice little love stories thrown in. I gave it a four instead of a five, because the ending isn't that great. But up until then it's a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"long, lame, uninteresting","review":"I am a big fan, but this book is nothing but endless long unimportant conversations and trips in cars and pure boredom. Ive read over 200 pages but i can't finish it, it is a waste of time and thought. Simply, there is nothing in this book that could be considered horror or exciting..Buy \\"The Woods Are Dark\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best video about Cal breaking Gehrig's record","review":"If you were there you know - it was electric.

The story itself is too sophisticated for children, but the animation is also terrible, practically unwatchable! It always breaks my heart to see a project that people obviously worked very hard on turn out to be so bad. But, it has to be truly awful for my five year old to ask to turn it off. He'll watch absolutely anything kid-related (Teletubbies? Scooby Doo dubbed in Spanish? you get the picture. if I didn't limit his television, he'd be Mike TV), but this was so awful he couldn't get through it. I didn't spend much money on this, but I'm sorry I spent anything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So mad that I wasted money on this movie!","review":"I purchased this movie for my 3 year old twins. I put it on and was coming in out while doing laundry. I listened to what they were saying and I was SHOCKED. I casually pulled the plug behind the tv and told my children that the dvd broke and acted dumbfounded. If I had just turned it off they would have been upset. Moral of the story is don't waste your money. This movie goes down in history as one of the worst childrens movies ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young kids!","review":"I rented this movie for my daughter who was 3. It is totally inappropriate for young children. There is violence among the \\"Take-Its\\" (they beat each other up.) They call each other \\"moron\\" and \\"idiot\\". There is a monster who tells one of the bunnies that they must choose someone to die. What an awful Easter movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark. Few good points.","review":"I must echo similar feelings as the other reviewers. Inappropriate for children, too many adult references. Fortunately, I checked it out from the library for free and wasted no money on it. I can say it has a couple of cute points: the love story between the two bunnies is cute and it is set in a nice European style town. Other than that, it is not so good animation, inappropriate content for children. Then there are the inaccuracies: the egg factory makes 7 million eggs in one day and later the takeits steal all the eggs and they all fit in one truck, also, why would chickens steal eggs to eat, and then there is the one evil chicken that has teeth. Really, I know kids stories can take liberties when telling a story, but inaccuracies like these, we don't need to put in our heads. Disney often misses the mark too, but at least they are tasteful. I would pass on this one or watch it without your kids if you are bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"No drivers for XP","review":"This camera is NOT compatible with Windows XP.

Interfaith Fellowship is sadly defunct but Lee Coit is still around. I have a great deal of respect for Lee. In 3 thin books he said all that he had to say and then stopped publishing. There are so many authors that churn out book after book that don't really say anything new. At the time of the seminar, I didn't really understand what Lee was talking about. Over the years, I've gotten better at Listening and recently I went through a sudden shift where I seem to be able to Listen most of the time.

Still a good read","review":"In 1938 13 year old Paul discovers he can \\"fade\\" - or turn invisible. At first it seems a fantastic gift, but it is one that he finds soon enough comes with both an emotional and physical price.This novel is very evocative of the time and places the stories within in it take place. It is in some ways like a linked chain of short stories moving from the 1930's to the 1980's.While aimed at teen readers, this novel would be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys a dash of the fantastic in their stories and well drawn characters. To top it off the fade itself is somewhat creepy and the author makes it clear what a two edged sword such an ability might be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift can be both good and bad","review":"Cormier's Fade is an exciting book to read. There are three stories and three main characters. The author shows how Paul and Ozzie use and misuse this gift. When Paul realizes that this gift can be dangerous, he disappears into his writing, and in his own way tries to make the world a better place to live. Ozzie on the other hand, misuses his gift, and becomes a demented character. The author offers sympathy for all of his characters. In this book when one mystery is solved another pops up. The book is both fun and may be scarey for some to read. I liked the book, and would recommend it highly. There are many themes throughut the book. The author illustrates the importance of family and how a loving family influences Paul. He also shows how a disfunctional family influences Ozzie and how Ozzie grows up hating society. The ending is both surprising and sad. This is a great and wonderful book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT suitable for children!!!!!! Contains spoilers .....","review":"My review contains spoilers so consider yourself warned. Parents, please read this book before you even think about letting your children read it!!!! Totally inappropriate content for impressionable young people..... unless you have no problems letting them read about a thirteen year old boy encouraged to lust after his own Aunt, same boy witnesses a man molesting a young girl and this event is described in great detail, same boy witnesses incest between a brother and sister, same boy commits murder....... do I need to go on ???Why is this book categorized the way it is? For adults, these topics are disturbing and difficult to deal with and to offer it as \\"entertainment\\" for children is just WRONG! It's very depressing and I know it would have the same effect on children."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry.but positivly inapropriete and perverse","review":"i know this is for young adults about thirteen or older but cormier should have considered the age group before writing such things. it was well written to be truthful but after Paul discovers his powers he uses them to dig into others lives.and not to mention his sexual obsession with his aunt! as well as mr. dondier and theresa!!! it was disgusting through and through..after reading the first part i stpped, turned to the back and saw a picture of old robert cormier. i dont know what his brillliat mind lets loose in his writing but the irrelevent sexual content was so wrong that the book was banned from fairfax county!! i searched it up on google and the book was removed from my local library!fade was fine in literature but i still would not recommend This novel to anyone. chocolate wars was good too but with some sexual referance.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, but kind of perverted","review":"I really, really liked the main topic in this book and it was so intriguing. Cormier is a really good author and I love so many of his books. This is one of the best by far. But one letdown that I didn't enjoy was how much perversion there was in it! It was so disturbing sometimes. I almost wanted to stop reading it after a certain point, but I didn't because the story was too good. So, too much nasty stuff, but a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the last Cormier book I read","review":"I've already read The Chocolate War, and it's sequel and I loved them both. So I automaticallly had high expectations for this book (which was assigned for school). It's starts out great but as I read more and more it started to get choppy and lose quality. Infact the whole Ozzie chapter seems to be rushed threw, like he was in a rush to finish the darn thing. My favroite charecters (Susan and Rosanne) don't even have big parts. But just in case your still intrested here's a summary of the book.Paul has the ability to fade away into nothing, become invisable. In every generation of the Moreaux family there is someone born with the fade and this time it's Paul. But the fun of the Fade is soon spoiled when Paul sees things he shouldn't see, and dose things he shouldn't do. How will the next generation deal with the fade?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good teenage read","review":"I though this book would be somewhat different from cormier's other titles. I am the cheese was much more shifty and confusing then this book but i still thought it was a lot of fun to read. Paul is displayed as a normal everyday kid and the way he learns about the fade and how invisibility is a curse, not a gift, is new and inventive. lEave it to Cormier to take a normal everyday fantasy and turn it into a morbid tale of death and destruction of the human self."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have the book, toss it NOW!","review":"This book is awful.

If you are going to mount it to a wall thru the wallboard, you will need to get some propper toggles otherwise it will fall off the wall.Having said this, the quality of the machine, the attacments and its performance par outweighs this small problem.I have used this vac frequently and am very pleased.Three of my neighbors have seen it in action and also have purchased them.I say buy it!!!- Ron"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum","review":"I have owned this for about two years now and except for the crappy on/off switch (which I had to replace with one from Radio Shack) it's been excellent. I use it all the time here in my automotive shop. It's got lots of suction, holds lots of dirt in between emptying, no bags required, and comes with tools and a really long hose. All my customers want one for their garages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover garage vac","review":"This unit comes ready to go. Find a spot on a wall within 5' of an electrical outlet, mount the hanging bracket, hang the vac and start cleaning!! This is what I would call a light duty unit. You can vacuum the car or other vehicle. It will clean up small debris from the floors. It is not intended to vacuum water or other liquids. It has a 1 1/2\\" hose so, big items won't fit. Otherwise, this unit has plenty of vacuum at the end of the 30' hose along with attachments to help guide it. For small to medium messes in the garage or vehicle, this is your vac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Last One Year","review":"I bought this vacum and have been careful to clean it as directed but it is broken and nobody is standing behind it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Bought this for our garage and we really love it. It works well and it is very easy to clean the canister."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a shop vac","review":"Although the description of the product doesn't say it, this vacuum uses a non-standard size hose. Thus, it's too small to fit on any power tools, and can't easily be used with a table saw, for example. I bought one, but returned it immediately when I realized the problem.It might work OK for some people, but if your garage is full of power tools, you probably don't want a GUV."},{"rating":"1","title":"They could have spent more time designing the attachments..","review":"I have had this vacuum for about a month now and I find that for one, the main plastic piece on the end of the hose is not air tight, which of course creates a loss of suction. After putting a piece of duct tape around it the problem seemed to be fixed, the problem now is that I have a brand new vacuum that looks less than classy.Also, some of the attachments that connect to the end plastic piece are angled in ways that make it hard to vacuum without having them spin around when you use pressure on it trying to vacuum out a car. When using certain attachments, I have to hold the the end in multiple places just to get the attachment to stay and not do a 180 spin on me...The vacuum itself is a simple, sturdy and stable design but the attachments are not. You can tell they probably spent no time testing this with the attachments."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Vac Sucks","review":"Nice vac but the hose has a very small diameter. Also I would have put the hose exit off the vac on the side instead of the front. Other than that it sucks great so far and the hose is long enough to reach all over a two car garage. I would recommend this to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap.Cheap Hose","review":"4 stars for vacuum. 2 stars for attachments. 1 star for hose.With all the good things about this vacuum, I can't believe Hoover would cut costs to this extream. The hose was crimped on arrival and even if it was not, I would have sent it back. This would be a great plastic(thin) hose for a toy vacuum, NOT for use in a garage or for vacuuming cars. Hoover really got sold a bill of goods on this. Hoover does not have a better replacement hose. I will look for a better replacement vacuum as soon as I go thru the trouble of returning this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall, okay","review":"I had mine for just inside two years and the just motor burned up! Also, I found it was rather loud, but I would use hearing protection. The length of the hose was nice as were the attachments. I have a Craftsman shop vac that is about 20 years old, costed less and much more powerful; so I will probably use that from here on out."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product for the price","review":"I ordered this not sure what I would get. I found the unit to be easy to install, quieter than expected, and perfect for the garage job intended. while perhaps not as powerful as the very large shop vacs, its long hose and convenience are perfect for the cars, boats, etc in the garage, as well as the garage floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Shop Vac","review":"New Hoover L2310 Guv Pro-Grade Garage Utility Vacuum Lifetime Filter 30 Ft Crush-Proof Hose SteelThis product exceeds what it says it will do, you can bring in the house to clean up a mess as quickly as we use it out in the shop area for doing the floors and table tops from wood crafting to cleaning out the cars. What a wonderful machine, works like a champ. Even with the 30 foot hose, which is a blessing, you have the power you need to handle the job. Recommend it highly, it is a back saving tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, price is right","review":"Suction is good. Price is right. Construction is solid and impressive - nice bumpy metal feel and details. It's acting as a central vacuum for my apartment.Complaint: it's kinda inefficient. Motor is small (2-3 inches wide compared to the 12 inch main housing), suction tube is kinda small for the 30ft length. As you might imagine with hoover, the components appear to be based on conventional vacuums and favor lightness over efficiency. That said, it's no worse than a typical vacuum, just could be heavier and run cooler. A remote power switch would help this a whole lot, like one on a mig welder.Compared to an upright vac, I like this setup. I have a magical suction tube that takes nearly anything away from nearly anywhere. Can't wait to see more mini-central-vac-capable systems like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Husband is so thrilled!!","review":"WOW!! If you want to see your husband in heaven, buy this vacuum.

It has fullfilled all my dreams of what a user friendly vac should do. The 30' hose reaches any where i need to vacume and has plenty of power to do the job. I've owned Craftsman, Ridged and Shopvac over the years and this is the best one yet. Also a plus is, there are no bags or filters to change. It works for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Suction","review":"I had trusted Hoover to understand what it takes to be a garage vacumn. This vacumn has barely enough suction to tidy up car rugs, not nearly enough suction to deal with a garage floor. Cannot vacumn blown in leaves from a cement floor. Very dissatiffied with this purchase, If you want a garage vac buy the standard roll around Shop Vac.It is a shame, the vac has the right packaging, the right concept, the right hose length and accessories, it just needs way more suction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover L2310 GUV 10 Amp 5-Gallon Garage Utility Vacuum","review":"Purchased the product which was highly rated, looks good, mounts easily.All of the high rating gave me nothing but a dissapointment.NOT ENOUGHG POWER, PERIOD.

I was looking for something to clean out our vehicles better, as our shop vac and our house vacuum were not well equipped to reach in smaller spaces that cars/SUVs require. I have been very happy with it so far. I have used it in all our our vehicles (small car, standard SUV, and Suburban). The long hose is wonderful. It was very easy to install on our garage wall and easily reaches across most of our garage. We have used it in the garage as well and the suction is great for what we need. No complaints here! And, since Amazon is so amazing, it came 3 days earlier than expected!"},{"rating":"2","title":"quiet, powerful, easy to empty,","review":"This product outperforms shop vac and look alikes. It is well filtered, does not recycle dust, and is quiet. Yes it is not portable, but the 30' hose allows one to get anywhere in a three car garage. It is easy to dismount from wall and take into another area. If you insist on wheels, then it is easy to find or make a dolly platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have a garage you need this vacuum!","review":"Point it in the direction of what you want to clear and let its tremendous sucking power do the rest.

It cleans like any good shop vac and the long hose is perfect for a 25 X 25 foot space. Plenty of attachments and a nice holder for them. Easy to mount and clean. You can tie on the tool holder and take them with you around the area. I plugged the system into an outlet that had just been wired to code by a professional. It still builds up large static charges on the hose. Touch anything grounded and you get quite a shock.

It will also make your house smell like burnt pet hair when used inside. I've learned tool/garage/shop vac means inferior filter and ability to suck dry sumps (of the latter, there is no mention of wet/dry to this vacuum ((I haven't read the manual, just a user)). I abuse household vacuums now and have luck replacing bag filters and tossing a device with a handle around the shop. I guess this product's hose is long-enough to place the vacuum outside; if not, I'm in for an awkward lift or a wheeling of top-heavy device on a 2x16\\" round platform with tiny coasters IF I can find a path in a busy garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"time saver","review":"As a caring RV dealer, we want to be sure our customers are taking delivery of a clean unit.

But she tells the reader upfront that description doesn't always mean detailing how something LOOKS (her emphasis). She also points out that description is not \\"all that flowery stuff\\" and isn't even embellishment. Nor, she argues, is description optional: it is one third of the story-telling tripod (along with exposition and narration) and, if a story is to live in its readers eyes, description must carry its weight on the tripod, supplying information and/or moving the story forward.The information in each of the ten chapter is very worth reading and pondering. And, if you're a writer, employing. If you read and use this book on description, you won't need another on the same subject. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have recommended this book to all my conference students.","review":"This book is a valuable tool for any writer, and I have been recommending it to all my students here at the Iowa Summer Writing Festival. Teachers, especially those who work with beginning creative writers in a community setting, will find the incredible exercises listed at the end of each chapter invaluable. I find myself asking, why didn't I think of that one? The examples she uses to illustrate her comments on using all five senses are drawn from the classics and from contemporary sources, all chosen for Virginia Woolf's \\"common reader.\\" The language is very readable and approachable; and the charm and enthusiasm of the writer comes through.

It's been enormously helpful in doing the final edit of my novel. Reading it made me feel like I had my own personal editor. The conversational tone of the book is inviting, nurturing, and encouraging. Any discussion of point of view usually makes me groan, but the way Rebecca McClanahan writes about it is exceptionally sane, enthralling even.The author is a master teacher, writer, and reader. Rebecca McClanahan is generous in sharing the secrets of her fine craft.This book would be fabulous for intermediate to advanced writers to read at least once a year to help keep the pencil sharp. The writing exercises are provocative and creative.This book showed me many things I would never have learned on my own.

Well, they fit. This is not a good book. She repeats the most obvious and then repeats them again (where was the editor?). Some facts are just wrong, such as most scholars see simile and metaphor as the same. I am sure those who say they \\"highlighted\\" it or \\"read it over and over\\" must either have been dreaming or reading a different book. It's one long bad Writers Magazine article, one that says, Hey try using \\"carmine\\" instead of \\"red.\\" Try using a metaphor instead of simply saying it was \\"brown.\\" Duh.

Though, there were a few slabs of helpful tidbits, here and there, my attention span has quickly waned. I have lost interest and find I'm wasting my time reading this book.

Well let me tell you this from now. There will be times in this book that you will certainly try.............. only to close the book in boredom because you can't pass a certain section. At times the book is dry. The advice, a few miles short of stimulating.But if you push through and really take in the words and advice given in it, you will become a better writer.

If I hold the cable or bend it a little, the dots go away and the screen is clear. Everything hooked up tightly, no pins are bent, etc. Must be something within the cable itself. I have the cable bent a little right now and have something sitting on the cable to hold the bend and for now no dots...I will keep it this way until a new cord arrives. Live and learn I guess.

On my desktop machine, the cable appears not to work at all (although the 9 ft Amazon hdmi to dvi cable I bought works perfectly).

The work could have included more diversity in the songs and my preference would have been for some slow versions. Why does \\"re-mix\\" always seem to translate to dj's showing off their dance track skills with the heavy backbeats. For such an extraordinarily adventurous band (who, by the way have already proven themselves masters at electronic/dance ala Front Line Assembly) to venture into an arguably formulaic mold is slightly disappointing.Negative aside, this work - for what is - is strong, with flavorful, interestingly arranged grooves and pushing-the-envelope sounds that infinitely please. The choice of female vocalists is expert, as is the interplay of human touch with machine throttled energy.If you want a revved up version of these deleriously delicious dance demons, then this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"IS it really worth it?","review":"Well, if you like dancy versions of the same songs you love..I say YES..buy it!! Now being a DJ and a fan I was dissappointed due to the fact that I purchased all the singles and find out that even the out of print \\"flowers Becomes Screens\\" single is available on this disc. Nothing new for me...just a waste of money. Of course if you don't have these already..then perhaps you can save ALOT of money and not buy the singles and get them all in one fell swoop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delerium That Moves You","review":"I've been a fanatic of Delerium for several years. Their deep trance aural textures are amazing. This collection, however, is different. It is at once danceable, moving, intense, sensual, contemplative, and energetic. It is electronic yet acoustic. With vocal performances by Sarah McLachlan, Leigh Nash, and others, it's riveting. This collection includes 3 remixes of Silence, 2 of Innocente, 2 of Flowers Become Screens, among others - and these happen to be some of my favorite Delirium movements.If you liked Semantic Spaces, Poem, or Karma, this collection is simply a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a Beautiful Adrenaline Journey","review":"I admit that I'm no authority on Trance music. I do know what I like and don't like. This CD I LOVE, but let me tell you why. OK first off, listening to CD1 I wasn't all too impressed, but still entertained. I then popped in CD2 with lowered expectations and WOW was I IMPRESSED!!! To me, this is Trance music at it's best... a beautiful adrenaline journey of high energy mixed with layers of gorgeous, dreamy vocals. I'm no Sarah McLachlan fan and am actually sick of her over-played songs but these mixes work with her vocals wonderfully. If you are a big fan of Sarah M then you will for sure want this CD set. This set is an audible journey I will gladly take over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed","review":"As an avid Delerium fan, especially Karma and Semantic Spaces, I opened this CD with MUCH excitement. Sadly, the remixes are not near enough to the original to make it worthwhile, and are much more energetic than I had hoped. There was a time when \\"Remix\\" did NOT mean \\"techno\\". There are a few gems, however, but only the remixes of Silence I've heard before on other compilation CDs. I'll keep this, but not treasure it as much as the rest of my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste...this album could have been something","review":"This disc is for completists or the casual fan only. I won't waste my money on it as I already have all of the singles. I agree with the other reviewers about having THE SAME SONGS remixed on two discs. It makes no sense.I would have bought this disc anyway, but I didn't see the point. Save your money.As for the music, regrettably, some of the mixes are just jungle house versions which isn't really compatable with Delerium's music. I even like the Airscape version of Silence better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Music from Delerium is typically wonderful to listen to because it is:-- imaginative-- ecclectic-- emotiveHowever, the Remix Collection possesses none of these characteristics. It is basically a \\"cut-and-paste\\" job of Delerium's normally lovely melodies layered with repetitive techno beats. I skipped through most of the songs in the collection and found perhaps one or two that I could really enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"people of the earth....you know, morons.","review":"im not the biggest deleium fan, but i am a big techno fan. These remixes are the best of both worlds. Now, if you are a hardcore delerium fan, and not a big techno fan...of course your not going to like it. Your all morons, and i hope now you realize this. If your not a huge techno fan, then do not review this item. Rather, stick to things you know, like making your eyes cross, or picking your nose."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointment and a rip-off","review":"I will be brief, I love Delerium's Karma and other titles but this double CD set contains just the remixed versions of their biggest hits, and these remixes are mostly techno or house style, whatever you call it. They do not bring much improvement or changes to the original versions. To me it is just a way to get [money] from Delerium fans so what I did is I made mp3s out of the album, just for the rare occassions I want to hear them again, and I sold the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holders","review":"When I first opened the box one of the holders bottom part was broken. Which I can tape together. The holders were not tighten, which caused alot of bouncing around when shipped.For a first time user on this there is no instructions on how to connect the reflectors to the holders. The reflectors.. I can not get back into the zip case after I open them up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible design","review":"The product description states that the holder \\"has a double-ball joint for exact positioning\\", which works quite well at holding the reflector in any position... as long as that position is 'down'. The joint is just strong enough to hold the reflector arm at any angle by itself, but once a reflector is attached it becomes very evident very quickly that the joint is not strong enough to support the arm and reflector in any position except hanging straight down. The build quality is also very cheap, mostly plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Mounting the reflector on this arm is unnecessarily difficult. There are far too many adjustment points for one person to elegantly manage it alone. Worse yet, when mounted on a stand, there are very few positions in which it will not tip over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect clamp for a reflector","review":"This clamp worked perfect for holding a large reflector and also it is very portable. Fits a standard light stand head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine for Small Office","review":"Love the machine. I wanted something simple for my non-technical office. I thought the Cannon would take too much training. The Sharp is great as long as it holds up. (So far, so good!) We have had it 7 weeks and employee response has been great and copies are clear and sharp. Sheet feeder works well and so far only one jam. Very easy to clear jams. Easy to take apart and replace toner and drum.I will note a few down sides, even though at this price I would buy it again. Each paper drawer only holds 250 sheets. The duplex copying only will print one copy of the same page. And lastly, the starter toner cartridge went fast! Before the out of toner light finally came on, I thought the think had broken. I would turn it on and it would click and click and click. Once I replace the toner, no problems. In other words, buy a new toner cartridge with the machine.Very good Price per Value ratio ---"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a printer; it's a paper jammer","review":"From day 1 this printer seemed to LOVE jamming & shredding paper. It almost NEVER printed more than 3 consecutive sheets without a problem. There seem to be at least two distinctly different types of jams (one actually mangles paper; the other just stops with the jam light on after printing a page), and the printer chooses between them at random. It's now sitting in my garage, awaiting the next \\"heavy trash\\" pickup day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Copier, Good Price, Bad Paper Jams","review":"Intially thought this was a great copier/printer and a great price. However, after 6 months of use the original unit I bought had a paper jam that could not be fixed in any manner other than sending it back to Sharp. I have received my replacement unit which after 1 day has had the same problem. To Sharp's credit they will send me a third unit but it is on backorder and they have no idea when they will have a replacement unit. I don't know if this is a chronic problem with this model or if I'm just unlucky enough to get two units with the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - no Windows XP printer driver","review":"I bought a Sharp AL-1551 copier/laser printer well over a year ago. To date, Sharp still does provide a Windows XP driver for this unit. The Windows 98 driver provided requires manual intervention with every system start-up and the driver is very slow and bogs down my system every time I print.Several calls and emails to Sharp have either provided a canned non-response or else have pointed to conflicting \\"alternate\\" drivers -- none of which are satisfactory. These alternates do not work and their installation is totally non-straightforward.I think this proves that Sharp does not care about customer satisfaction and is out of their league in the printer market and it also demonstrates uncaring support for its users.This is what I get for straying away from HP for printers.Maybe others will read this and consider it before buying a Sharp printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to getting this engine to complete my son's NameTrain. The engine we received does not appear to be first quality but rather a seconds. The wood on the front face has a slight tear out along the edge, the wood is rough on the front edge of the smoke stack, the finish on the wheels is drippy, and the magnet is glued on crooked. Not what I was expecting based on the quality of the letters and caboose I had previously purchased elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch.","review":"Sorry to say I found nothing new, nothing that hasn't been said/written a thousand times before. After listening to these CDs I had the distinct feeling the other reviewers had either been trying to put themselves on the same level as the two authors by endorsing them, a bit of 'fame by association' kind of thing, or it was the very first book/tape on writing they had ever read/listened to. Sure, sure, everyone has their own opinion, but unless you have trouble falling asleep at night, save your money. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fallen Angel","review":"For someone who was the most hyped person ever to come out of the U.K., Charlotte Church's performance here had to be one of the worst ever on the small screen. She looked frightened all of the time and looked as if she were reading her lines from a prompter. According to one TV columinst, when she had to be corrected on the screen by Della Reese, that was not in the script but was left there due to time constraints and made to appear to be part of the show. Fortunately, for this episode, they limited Charlotte's screen time to about 1/4 of the show.The episode itself is not too bad and was well written. In any case, this may be the only chance you will ever get to see Charlotte Church on any screen. After failing the screen test for Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movie, she is reported to be limiting her future entertainment activity to singing. For curiosity seekers only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave This Show to the Angels","review":"Charlotte Church may have a voice like an angel, but she certainly doesn't act like one. If fact, she certainly can't act at all. It probably sounded like a clever match, having the girl with \\"The Voice of an Angel\\" play a part on the \\"Touched by an Angel\\" TV show. However, Charlotte Church comes across like someone who just walked in off of the street and is reading lines from a board. I was actually more impressed by the group N'Sync than with Charlotte. This episode is O.K. but certainly not good enough to warrant buying a video of it. Roma Downey does a real good job here. Charlotte Church does sing a bit here, but not enough to make it worth purchasing this video. My recommendation is that they should leave acting to actors and singing to singers. The regular angels do fine in this series, but Charlotte Church was simply not made to act."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Different shows","review":"I am a big fan of Touched by an Angel. However, this episode can be divded up into two separate programs. The first starring Roma Downey was a 5-star episode. Roma's encounter trying to be a singing star along with her experience in jail, make this worth watching. The second was the part with Charlotte Church, who IMHO is the worst excuse for an actress ever to blaze her way on to the boob tube. If you can overlook this young girl's attempt at acting, you may find the entire episode to be enjoyable. I made this review 1-star because the episode is being sold by Amazon as a Charlotte Church Video. However, it may be better left as a Charlotte Church Video than a Touched by an Angel Video. Could have been a TBAA classic without CC."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Suedo Angel","review":"I must agree with the many here who conclude that Charlotte Church cannot act. Her inclusion here seems more a charity case or an accomodation to someone in the industry. However, I will disagree with those who feel her inclusion in this program is justified based on her \\"angelic\\" conduct. Based on my many years of following her, nothing could be further from the truth...Roma Downey saves this show with some brilliant individual acting including being intoxicated. This bit of brilliance will give this episode a saving ** rating, in spite of Charlotte."},{"rating":"1","title":"It isn't a book - it's a pamphlet!","review":"The AIA should be embarrased by their publishing this \\"book\\". At less than forty pages of information it hardly qualifies as a book. Note that the information it does contain is fine but it certainly does not deliver good value for the money. The price is outrageous especially when you add amazon.com's fair shipping and handling costs. I expected more from an professional organization like the AIA. Note in the above description it doesn't identify how many pages the book contains as do most amazon.com descriptions (I get junk-mail thicker than this one). I understand that books like this have a limited audience and that the costs of production and distribution are correspondingly high. That being understood, a price under $5.00 would be more appropriate.

The horror is done well, as an aspect of a more intricate plot as opposed to the focus in and of itself. There is a reason this is the only part of the Samurai Horror Tales that spawned any further episodes. Please, if you are on the fence, don't be.

The author shares his experiences and insights in a very down-to-earth manner.

I would also warn anyone who wants to sign up for his coaching program, PMI/Dean Graziosi Real estate success academy, that it is a scam and they will NOT refund your money. The course is redundant and a waste of money. There are too many great sites online for people interested in real estate investing and it's free! Dean's students only get their money back by misguiding you, beware. Google Dean Graziosi scams, there are thousands of complaints. Buyers Beware! The Attorney General in Utah and Arizona are aware of Dean's Enterprises and the many different names his companies are under. I have been burned out of $12,740 that they refused to refund me after 2 weeks. Turns out, many people have similar stories.

The Blind Leading The Naked, VF's 3rd album, definitely follows in that tradition with songs such as \\"No Killing\\" and the ever-famous \\"Old Mother Reagan\\". I recommend it to all - to dance to, to listen to, to scare your parents with..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The Violent Femmes first album was a startling masterpiece. Gordon Gano seemed to let everything go, giving it an emotional vulnerability that is missing in many pop albums. After HALLOWED GROUND, the Femmes released this, an overproduced collection. Certainly, \\"I Held Her In My Arms\\" and the cover of \\"Children Of the Revolution\\" are great, but many of the other songs are silly and almost self-parodic. For some this will be almost like a parody attempt, but it's not funny. The rest of us who see it as serious will instead laugh at its stupidity and laugh at it for that reason. As for the production thing again, try to stick with your minimalist approach. It works better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cassette has bonus track","review":"The cassette has a bonus track called World without mercy that will hopefully be added to the CD one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"More VF Awesomeness","review":"I love this cd... A lot. It's at the low end of the Femmes discography, but it still feels like an endless experiment in diversity. That's pretty impressive, when some of the best music in the past thirty years is some of the Femmes worst.\\"No Killing\\" is a fist pumping, relentless anthem. Playful songs like \\"Breakin' Hearts\\" and \\"I Held Her In My Arms\\" remind me why the Femmes have had such staying power in the hearts of music lovers throughout the world.It may not be their best, but this album rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for every Dark Shadows fan!","review":"My whole family is a fan of the series \\"Dark Shadows,\\" both old and new. For this holiday season, I decided to buy my mother this book, because when she was young she saw the movies in the theatres and always spoke of how the second (featuring Quentin) was so choppy. When I finally got to watch it, I agreed, but I knew there had to be a reason. I had found out that they cut a lot of the movie, and when I found this book, I knew I had to get it for her! This has complete original scripts and Dan Curtis' notes! It's a great gift, because now she can see just what she was missing! I know in the book it says they lost the cut film, but I've recently heard they found it! Hopefully this book will become not just a \\"fill-in what you missed,\\" but a companion to a complete re-released movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for fans and movie buffs alike!","review":"With a direct facsimile of the original draft scripts, this book is great fun for the fans, who will enjoy squinting to decipher the hastily-penciled revisions, and for anyone interested in the evolution of a script. With some appropriate tributes, and a few pretty photographs, there could be a little more depth, but the ride is so much fun that it would feel wrong to be overly critical of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freddy rules","review":"I liked this glove,yet it is a little flimsy.

It's at times thrilling, at times action packed, at times moving, at times reflective, at times suspenseful. And, this isn't your typical 30 minute Varese Sarabande release - there's almost 50 minutes of score here, and when it's over, you don't find yourself demanding much more.

The knife arrived quite sharp and was easy to hone to very sharp. It is an inconspicuous everyday carry knife resting in the coin pocket, opens one handed, and has many uses like opening Amazon.com packages ;-) and the hard plastic packaging that is used for CDs, DVDs etc. Could be last-ditch personal defense weapon if running is out of the question too. It has just too many uses to be without it that I rarely leave the house without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy two!","review":"My only regret is not buying two of them when they went on sale. Probably my favorite knife. Sure, it is too small for much food prep or to chop down a tree and build a shelter in a hardcore survival situation; however, in terms of my EDC requirements of cutting packaging, boxes, cleaning under my nails, and removing those pesky, prickly, plastic, price tag pieces affixed to clothing (you know what I'm talking about) it is perfect. The blade shape lends itself well to these tasks and excels better than my larger EDC knives. It could also very likely save your life in a tactical deployment. I will be buying several of these mean little buggers."},{"rating":"2","title":"very happy - but could be sharper","review":"for an all round elegant \\"office knife\\" I dont think you can beat this. My only gripes are 1) I really expected to arrive sharper and will attempt to sharpen it myself and 2) the way the clip points, you have to rotate the knife 180 degrees after you pull it out of your pocket in order to open it one handed. No biggy, but I would have designed the clip direction differently. It indeed can pass as a bill fold or just clip it in your breast pocket. Looks very smart.As the 4 stars suggest, Im happy and would purchase again if I lost it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Knife","review":"Thanks, arrived on time! I orderd it in january, found out they were out of stock when the company emailed me.

I chose the Holley pump because it's rebuildable. The pump works fine, but it's the noisiest pump I've ever heard. OK for racing applications, but pretty loud for street use. I can hear it over the exhaust which is pretty throaty. I'm planning to build a housing to hopefully trap the noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor description/combo","review":"Did not specify that this pump would over heat and leave you stranded. The regulator they send you just restricts the flow at 7psi the pump struggles to pump against itself this combo is a poor excuse for a quick sale and quick buck. Holley has good pumps just need to put together a better more streetable combination this pump with the bp style regulator would be more suited for everyday operation without getting stranded and waiting ten 10-15 minutes while it cools down. I would not recommend this pump combo to anyone unless your legs need a workout from pushing your ride around."},{"rating":"1","title":"So few examples","review":"Do not waste your money on this title.

Other than Technique, I rate this as New Order's greatest record. This album was well before it's time, and you can see the influence of this album in late '80s dance artists like 808 State. Surely the most influentual album of the 1980s, an absolute classic record, every song connects brilliantly. It's hard to pick highlights, but personal favorites are 'Age of Consent', 'The Village' and 'Your Silent Face'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheers to New Order; Jeers to Amazon","review":"This is an outstanding record, and this reissue in particular is an excellent remastering/packaging of the original pressing.My complaints are not about the product, but about Amazon's listing of it. At least two details are incorrect: (1) It does NOT include \\"a coupon for MP3 download of the album\\" as outlined in Amazon's editorial review, and (2) it does NOT include the tracks \\"Blue Monday\\" nor \\"The Beach\\" as outlined on Amazon's track listing (as it's a reissue of the original pressing, not the later American CD/cassette releases which included them).These are both very important distinctions to someone considering purchase, and though it might not be intentional, from the perspective of a customer it appears as a bait-and-switch type of deception that Amazon suggest their inclusion.

But once I did I completely fell in love with this album. I found it rather interesting that an earlier reviewing revealed that it the ORIGINAL album didn't have Blue Monday and it's B-side, The Beach. Those were great additions to this album as it was turned into a CD, but even without them I'd say it stands on its own very strongly. Other great tracks, besides the afore mentioned, include Age of Consent, The Village, and my personal favorite, Your Silent Face. I don't get it. Why wasn't THAT song made into a hit! I think it's one of their most outstanding works ever! But still, in a way it's cool that it wasn't a hit because since it wasn't put on any greatest hits compilations, it serves as a special treat for buying this ablum. Power Corruption and Lies is pretty good all the way through. It's not their absolute best, but it's pretty close. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing virtuosity","review":"This album demonstrates the wide band of New Order's musical abilities. From the guitar riffs in 'Age of Consent' to the groundbreaking 'Blue Monday', this album also contains the eerie 'Leave Me Alone.' In 'Leave Me Alone', one finds ample evidence of Peter Hook's enormous talent. In addition, the lyrics make one wonder whether this could have been Ian Curtis' farwell note. A must for any New Order fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic New Order","review":"This was my first New Order album, I got it for Your Silent Face, which was at the time the only New Order song I knew. Power, Corruption & Lies is CLASSIC, a MUST if you're a big fan of the band. The first half appealed much more to me than the second half of the disc, but either way it all fit together very well.BTW I have the 1990 CD version, the one that isn't \\"loaded with errors\\" and has Blue Monday & The Beach tacked on to the end of each side. Personally I don't mind that they threw the 2 tracks in there, they make the album even better! Age of Consent is as I already said, CLASSIC New Order, The Village is a light & happy song, and 586 is my personal favorite, may I even argue that it's New Order's best song ever.

Forever haunted by the superior Joy Division releases, they still managed to produce some great records (and most importantly some great 12\\") early on. \\"Power, Corruption & Lies\\" is easily their best and most consistent effort, with tracks like \\"Age of Consent\\", \\"Your Silent Face\\" and (my personal favourite) \\"Leave Me Alone\\" standing out on an album most noted for its coherency. The production is great and especially Peter Hook's bass work is outstanding.If at all possible, get your hands on a release that *doesn't* contain \\"Blue Monday\\" and \\"The Beach\\". Good tracks in and of themselves, they really break up this album. There is a reason that they were left out in the first place, and it's sad to see that those reasons are disrespected. The album is far superior without them.20 years later and still New Order are releasing decent music, but they never again sounded as good as on \\"P, C & L\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic New Order","review":"When I say classic I mean this is a classic New Order album that isn't a greatest hits collection (which is pretty much all New Order has been putting out for the last 5 years). I love pretty much all of these songs. They have the classic New Order blend of guitars and cynth sounds. The previews offered by Amazon here give you a good taste of whatthe songs are like, if you're into them then give the album a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems Like Old Times","review":"Dateline: January 2012. Ordered Power Corruption Lies from Amazon and received the old (read: error-laden) version. The music itself is worth five stars..."},{"rating":"2","title":"PCL","review":"The original UK release (1983) on CD is really the version to have, as this lacks the disruption of Blue Monday (a great song, but messes up the feel of the album). The cover art, which in my opinion is the best of New Order's albums (and only slightly less impressive than Unknown Pleasures and Closer) is by a late 19th century French painter whose modus operandi was to try to incorporate sound into his painting. This is a great metaphor for this entire album, because the rich sonic textures invariably leave you with breath taking visual ideas. Moreover, taken as a whole, the album offers an incredible roller coaster ride through various human emotions, and creates a larger canvas made up of several strokes. Each song is powerful, but the total effect is more than the sum of the parts. If you define a great album by a combination of songs to make a whole, then this is New Order's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Service Skills Lacking","review":"I placed an order for 4 separate Kringle's to go to 4 separate addresses. One of the orders was never sent by the company. They basically ruined somebody's Christmas gift. A couple days after Christmas, all I got was an apology and they said they would refund the one Kringle purchase. You'd think they'd do something to make up for their mistake, especially considering how many orders I placed. Enjoy the money you got from this years Kringle purchase, because it will be the last time I'll ever place an order there. There are other bakeries that do mail order. You apparently want my money more than you want my business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luguna clear fast","review":"I've written a review before on this product and I'm upset with it.

It's mostly a collection of French music with some other mellow songs thrown in. Some of the tracks I had already as they're pretty common, but the overall feeling is evocative of a pleasant summer evening alone the Seine. Good background music for a French dinner party, or for background music around the house. I gave it to my mother, who loved the film, and she plays it all the time.A surprising track has Jack Nicholson singing La Vie En Rose... and he's pretty good, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the songs everyone is looking for?","review":"Who cares about the songs on this cd?

Most want to know about the first song played, 'Butterfly' and the second most frequent comment is about the Maroon 5 song, 'Sunday Morning'. I love this movie and the most of the songs on the soundtrack. I agree with the reviewers who say all songs should have been included, (that's why I only gave it 4 stars out of 5) it seems like whoever produced the soundtrack went mainly for the older French songs. I truly love Jack's sweet, mellow version of 'La Vie en Rose', it is worth the price of the entire soundtrack to me! To the one reviewer who said they thought Jack was tone deaf, I would say Jack doesn't claim to be a singer!

As she writes, she listens to French music. When I was hunting around recently for some great French song classics, I decided this soundtrack would be perfect. The only fly in the potage was Jack Nicholson actually attempting to sing \\"La Vie en Rose\\" - he is pretty much tone-deaf, despite his attempts to sound like Maurice Chevalier, and I always skip past it... his performance in the movie was priceless and he should have quit while he was ahead and not tried to be a chanteur."},{"rating":"2","title":"It IS \\"Sunday Morning\\"--I'm so glad...","review":"I loved the soundtrack (the French songs were GREAT), however Maroon 5's \\"Sunday Morning\\" (the song playing when Keanu Reeves is eating @ the dinner table with Diane Keaton (Erica) and her sister) and Paul Simon's \\"Learn How To Fall\\" songs were not included--the songs included on there, however, were great! I will be buying the soundtrack to \\"Love Actually\\"--does anybody know if the entire song \\"Sunday Morning\\" is on there? It looks as though it's a medley or a mix...just wondering!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"Just saw the movie recently and loved it. Picked up the CD on a whim as I was checking out of a music store. This will indeed end up being one of my all time favorites ! The selection of the different tracks is simply perfect and the quality of each is outstanding ! Have listened to it over and over since purchasing it (less than 24 hours ago) and want to hear it again and again! It leaves you feeling just plain good !! The varioius French selections are different and intoxicating, and Jack Nicholson's version of \\"La Vie en Rose\\" on the last track is the best !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooo Romantic","review":"This CD is sooo romantic. It contains a number of cuts in French, such as, C'est Si Bon song by the purrrring Eartha Kitt and Je Cherche un Homme, also by Eartha Kitt. La Vie en Rose by Louis Armstrong and others. I enjoyed the romantic melody by Astrud Gilberto and\\" I only have Eyes for You; an old tune by the Flamingos. I would have given this CD 5 stars but it was marred by Jack Nicholson singing his version of La Vie en Rose. Now why did that have to be on this CD? There was a lovely song entitled \\"Julian Comes\\" (I think that was the name of it) that I would have rather have had on this CD instead of Jack's poor voice. So, 4 stars it is. Nevertheless, it is still very enjoyable. I have played this CD over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Response to C.

It doesn't occur on the Chronic 2001 either...I can't speak on the Last Meal cd...But I thought that almost all the beats were supertight, DJ Pooh is an excellent producer and Daz is even better maybe (if he wasn't then, he is now).

Skittle if he was so kind, but to play Snoop Dogg while we played bingo, but have the volume low. He agreed and that day we played bingo and listened to Snoop Dogg, and the talented rapper.

What Mr.Dent may or may not realize is that the \\"New Network Company\\" talked about in chapters 5,6,7,and 8, is not new to many people. The handful of credible direct marketing companies have been structured like this for 40 years! They were way ahead of their time as Dent now confirms, as well as many other network marketing companies that are organized properly.

On nearly every page of the book, the author makes the claim that we are approaching the greatest boom in human history, yet never makes a convincing case as to why. The book is chalk full of empty statements upon which little elaboration is provided. Harry Dent has successfully taken a quite intuitively compelling argument regarding the economic implication of certain demographic trends and rendered it thoroughly unconvincing. The weakness of this book is not the result of a flawed premise (I actually agree with the basic argument), but rather results from poor writing, redundancy, inappropriate use of data, poor examples and excessive hyperbole.

He has taken one very valid insight - that demographic booms, particularly the baby boom, can drive economic growth, and focused on it to the exclusion of all else. He feels the demographics cause all other factors(inflation, entrepreneurship, interest rates, etc.) and believes that a predictable pattern is clear. Well, Harry, what's your portfolio worth now compared to 1/1/00? So much for predictability.

I have yet to read anything that comes close to covering all the bases...and since there are SOOOO many bases to cover with Lupus, start here. More than likely the it's the only book you'll need.

The book includes example anecdotes, useful information on treatments, and VITAL clinical information for each body system involved. Another Amazon.com customer recommended this book, and I am so grateful--we discovered a life-saving diagnostic procedure through this book that my mother's doctors had not intended to run.

I can't recommend this book highly enough--it is quite literally life-preserving information for the chronically ill lupus patient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite technical","review":"The book is very technical in nature that is geared more toward health care professionals rather than general readership.

However I have a very, campassionate Doctor who has been on this journey w/me the entire time and the support of family and friends. But the Lupus Book by Dr. Daniel Wallace is fabulous. I wish I would have had it many, many years ago. Now, we have a friend whose son is really suffering from Lupus. I gave him and his son and their family a copy of the book.

The height is much easier on my back than a kitchen table. Amazing what a few inches in height can do. Hopefully, we'll soon be moving to a place of our own, and I can set this up in a room with no carpeting. I have a feeling the wobbliness and squeaking will disappear then.

The table is light and easy to roll from place to place. One caveat is that the folding legs snap onto very flimsy plastic holders, which were placed wrong. So they had to be repositioned at the cost of damaging the underside of the table. Once the legs were snapped on, the holders did not seem strong enough to easily permit folding and unfolding, so the legs and table have remained permanently open. This is not practical when there isn't a large enough crafting area.

One of the most compelling aspects of the book is its contemplation of machismo and its attraction to women, even lesbians. Issues of violence and battering within straight and lesbian relationships are also powerfully addressed. To write a book with a protagonist who is not particularly sympathetic is quite risky.

The preface, introduction, and the first chapter were great. Huge let down in Chapter 2 when the author switches from \\"God is within you\\" mentality to \\"God is the parent\\" mentality (pictures of Morgan Freeman, George Burns or Father-Time flood my head). He even says in the introduction \\"It is not my intention to impose a specific face on the source of this force I call the flow\\". With phrases like \\"What God knows is possible for you is always far grander than what you think is possible for yourself\\" and \\"As with any loving parent, God keeps your best interest in mind knowing that you may have a limited view of what is actually good for you\\" the author directly contradicts him self.

Being a completely different game there is a tutorial at the beginning which is pretty helpful, but could explain more than just the basic movements in the game. The game may be a turn-based strategy card game but it still focuses on stealth like the old Metal Gear games we all love. U can still knock on walls and the guards still use the alert mode and evasion mode to catch you. I loved the short cut scenes everytime you use a weapon, also the character cards are really awsome, like metal gear ray.

The reason I play the game is to experience an action game. This game has been down graded to a deck of cards. Instead of real time movement of the player you have to use one of a few available cards that control your movements. You lose some of the best aspects of the game. The graphics are first rate.

Especially seeing how many of these reviews are written by people from Rock Springs and Green River, Wyoming. Although I thought the idea for this book was interesting, it was very poorly written.

(Approximately half of the first 60 pages is flashbacks.) As soon as I became interested in the story of Cain I would be thrown into a flashback.Pyatt has an interesting idea of making Cain and Abel twins with the girl being the first born.

My first return to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Days","review":"I love the style of Depeche Mode, never the ordinary always unique. That's why they've been around for so long. My favorite songs are Black Celebration, Flys on the Windscreen, and a Question of Time. When I heard this album it reminded me of a new band called Chambre Noir. They use soundtracks and electronics as the backdrop of their music also. I hope Depeche comes to San Antonio again on their tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"The new millenium of sound started in 1986","review":"Yesterday I went to visit an old friend. So I got in my car (Honda 1986) and looked out for a nice tape to listen to. Among all those hi-tec supersoundblabla-looking ones I found a simply black one. I put it on - and it brought me back the years to 1986. Such a clear and various, deep and dancable sound. The lyrics so overwhealming and true, and the effects just on the right point. great. My old car seemed to feel the same and went a bit slower, so I could listen to the last tones of this wonderful album before I reached my buddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best DM album","review":"Black Celebration is one of the best DM albums because it shows a high degree of maturity of the band. Songs like \\"here is the house\\", \\"But not tonight\\", \\"Stripped\\" and the amazing voice of Martin Gore in most of the songs make Black Celebration an album that deserves being bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop this one in when you're depressed","review":"\\"Black Celebration\\" sticks out as the gothic album of the Depeche Mode catalog. It's dark, melodic, ethereal and even upbeat on its down moods (A Question of Time). Ask any Depeche Mode fan what their favorite top 3 albums from this band are, and I guarantee you this one will be among the the three."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],B={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-f23a66d2"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/49.md","filePath":"quotesmag/49.md"}'),R={name:"quotesmag/49.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
