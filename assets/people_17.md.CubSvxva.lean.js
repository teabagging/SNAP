They're right out of Deliverance - except that movie was entertaining.I just waited for this to end. Thank God it finally did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't subject yourself to this junk","review":"Trashy, exploitative, and pointless film which goes for shock value with no substance. A horrifyingly bad movie unless you like watching degenerate behavior. I am no prude, but this film stinks badly. I'm so glad it bombed at the box office. It deserved to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for people who are scared of reality.","review":"Just like I said. If you are easily shocked and appauled by real life people then this movie is definately not for you. Also if you are one of those viewers who needs a definate plot, a beginning & ending and or someone or thing to relate to, just to get into a film then this is not for you. While this is a rather disturbing film, it is also a very important one. A couple of fat thumbs up to brilliant movie makers like Harmony Korine who go against the grain of \\"normal\\" and \\"accepted\\" films. This movie was shot with a very documentary type of feel. You actually can't even tell who is acting and who isn't. Either watch this movie with an open mind or sing along with Leonard Maltin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmony Korine's White Trash epic!","review":"This movie is a classic! From the first scene to the very last, everything about this film screams masterpiece. Harmony Korine captures the most disturbing human images he can find and constructs a movie around them. Special appearance by skating legend Mark Gonzales as a white trash chair-wrestler! WARNING: Do not view this film with a cat lover. They will leave the room and hate you for watching it. I say...lighten up and have a laugh. It's a comedy after all!...Right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Want my two hours back..","review":"From an entertainment stand point, this is the movie I use to compare all other bad movies (until I watched Tree of Life). Artistically, this has interesting camera angles and perspectives but I'm not a film expert - only a spectator. Thus, I like to be entertained and not put to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mock of everyday life","review":"I see everyone talking about how there is no plot to this movie, but I don't really agree. I really look at this movie as a mock of popular society. The kid with ADD is a poster boy for a warped Nike comercial, if he were Michael Jordan jumping over a net in slow motion, it would win commercial of the year. Women trying to make their nipples bigger (implants), selling cat's for food (old urban legand), kids ripping off charatable foundations (girl scouts), working out with spoons (no steriods here), prostitution your wife (whatever). It's all just a mock of what we as normal american citizens do EVERY DAY! Watch this movie as an a compelling look into your own everyday life and what the media has done to society. It's no Casablanca but it sure is real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Elephant, worse than anything else","review":"3 things:1. To the reviewer who said \\"this movie should be called 'crappo'\\". I disagree...\\"Dummo\\" would be the obvious choice, wouldn't it? :)2. To the reviewer who said \\"This was the worst movie I've seen, and I've seen Pirates of the Carribean\\". Shouldn't you be comparing this to \\"The Haunted Mansion\\" instead? Pirates was mildy entertaining and the long run-time didn't feel like it dragged on forever (in the way that Dummo dragged on after the opening credits for the entire movie)3. The only amusing and memorable parts of this white trash hick-o-rama was the bunny ears and the song at the beginning. After that it went downhill faster than a drunk hick on a malfunctioning Harley. Mind you, I would love to watch a good White Trash movie, like \\"American Movie\\" or \\"Slums of Beverly Hills\\" those were great, but Dummo had as much of a point as the \\"stars\\" of the movie had a clue..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy, is this movie way off!","review":"I'd just like to start off saying this film is the worst I've EVER seen. And I've seen some bad ones in my time, but this takes the cake. First of all, let me mention that these filmmakers have never even set foot in the town of Xenia, Ohio. I've lived in this town all my life. I have never witnessed kids in diapers and rabbit ears walking around the streets aimlessly, nor have I seen kids shooting cats with pellet guns (well, not as a business venture anyway). These filmmakers did all of their filming in TENNESSEE! This film had no plot either. It was like watching someone's film of their dysfunctional family. It was just random weirdness sloppily thrown together. I still can't believe I paid money to rent this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"Guys, don't believe those who says the movie is a waste of time. They're those who's afraid to face the facts: nation ( american first of all) is dying out. Think about this film in a global sense! The movie is not a try to \\"frighten\\" people, it's a try to wake them up and get them out of \\"Titanic\\" dreamland. Korine undertakes a desperate chance to make society look at itself in the country where all such movies are doomed to fail. Hats off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish","review":"Not the shock to the consciousness it strives to be. Instead it comes off as boring and contrived. There were too many instances and attempts to try to make a statement, and that gave a forced feeling to the movie. The film is a victim of strained scheming which does not allow the viewer to be affected by the content of the images, and the movie comes off as being shallow. The acting is poor and amateurish - the actors frequently take glimpses of the camera, appear wooden or just try too hard. I did enjoy the variety of bizare appearing characters who looked like John Waters or Coen brothers rejects. Also, there were a number of voice overs to home movie quality footage which added a subtle sweetness to the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly people doing ugly things","review":"This is total mind-pollution. This movie lacks a plot a seems like a compendium to the Jerry Springer show. I want my 88 minutes back.

Well, I don't think many will be looking forward to the next one. No plot, no story, no redeeming value. The is movie based around the theme of torturing cats and not much else. Not much else to say either."},{"rating":"1","title":"What pure trash.","review":"Having lived in Xenia Ohio for several years now, I can tell you this peice of crap is completely false. Beleive it or not, there are people out there who think this is 'based on a true story' and that Xenia Ohio is really like this. The only thing 'true', is that we have had 2 tornados in the past 25 years, one of which in 1974 destroyed most of the town. Not in the '1990s' like the film potrays. This is not some racist white trash breeding ground, in fact a good portion of our population is of African orgin. I wouldnt care about this waste except that we know have vistors dumb enough to look around for the false landmarks in the movie.Aside from my obvious bias, the movie is a bore. There is no plot, and the film relies on shock value like the usual reality-show world BS that is popular now."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Way to the Egress","review":"All of you who think this movie is Great Art have been bamboozled. This is just pretentious swill. There are those who insist upon catagorizing anyone who dares to criticize this movie as conformists and idiots. To them I say, pretentious swill like Gummo can be just as obnoxious as mindless swill like Armageddon. In fact, the two movies are similar. One uses exploding rocks and loud noises to pummel you into submission, and the other uses freakish and garish imagery to pummel you into submission."},{"rating":"1","title":"god awful","review":"I can't believe they didn't print my last review of this. I probably swore in it. Well, it made me that mad, and I only rented it. IF you're considering buying this, I seriously hope you have rented it. I enjoyed Kids, and could not sit through much of this. Just goes to show, Larry Clark was the force behind kids.Although I have Korine's script, and it's not half bad. I mean, it has a story and the characters are more interesting. However, this movie is only for those who a) want to punish themselves B) want to feel superior because they can force themselves to believe they like garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"time better spent elswhere","review":"Here are some alternative suggestions to watching this movie:1) spend the hour and a half in a forest preserve out house...2) try making your own crystal meth and then doing it3) eat some spoiled chicken, get sick, puke and then role around in it.4) piss in your pants and don't change your clothesDoing one or all of the above is a far better experience than sitting through this piece of vile trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last night......","review":"Last night I watched a movie. This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. This movie was about nothing. This movie wasted my night. I hate that I rented this movie. I can't believe they can legally have this movie in the movie store. Horrible, horrible movie.I could see how some people might enjoy this movie, like if they were sleeping while it was playing.

So is driving onto a lot of back roads in most areas of this country. But it's rivetting, original & perversely funny. It's distressing that so many people ( professional & amateur) reviewing this movie (or natural Born Killers, for that matter) seem to base their judgements on *manners* and *taste* more than anything. To me this movie is a devastating comment on a very real & sick condition which those who wince & hold their noses prefer to ignore. So what else is new?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of Boring","review":"The oddness of what I was seeing held my interest at first but it quickly grew numbing and tiresome. There was no real purpose to what was being shown, other than perhaps the director's attempt to be bizarre and \\"out there, man.\\" A self-indulgent gross-out picture that overstays its welcome, it seemed much longer than its 90 to 100 minute running time. Just scene after scene after scene of pointless weird posturing. If there was some sort of point to it after all, well, who cares?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a sadly true american story","review":"Gummo is disgusting, repulsive, and not for the weak stomache. But Gummo, also is a very true and very accurate tale of the lives of many American children. This type of misery exists in our country, and Harmony brings it all out in this film. It is a great film to watch, and atleast watch it for the rabbit(you'll love the rabbit!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch the movie again negitive ppl","review":"Anyone who wrote a bad review did not understand this picture of small town life. Gummo shows the lives of only the few that were most effected by the tornato that ravished their town.

I think (thank God) it's not meant to have much of a \\"message\\" in the first place. Harmony is an incredible fly on the wall in some pretty desolate, chaotic places, sending you images that mystify, horrify, amuse and move. He feels little need to explain himself which is why I think this movie got such mixed reviews. You're left to decipher and absorb Gummo's haunting images without a Hollywood instruction book. The movie weaves it's way into your subconscious, resurfacing days, months, years afterward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmony","review":"If you can stomach it, get this movie. From the maker of Kids and tons of other crazy stuff, see what the boys of BELLY (Hype Williams) were watching on tv after Hype's opening rob scene.This film seemed well put together. The events were humorous and realistic. What I love about Harmony's work is that it makes you think, it forces a physical reaction and a dialogue after being smacked in the butt or the face, or th... he's always very direct in that way.Inde film makers Must Watch. Notice use of low-budget film work and sound. Looks good and edits uniquely Korine. Notice casting and anywhere-usa locations. The power of disturbing scenes add depth to film, such as Horror, and is uniquely Korine."},{"rating":"1","title":"total crap, ps total crap","review":"This movie made me throw up on myself, and will make you do the same.

Please watch gummo. If you actually think the movie is good though you should kill yourself, immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick and plotless garbage","review":"The young director, Harmony Korine, who made his debut with the controversal movie \\"Kids\\" got even more wierd and sick with Gummo. There's not even a plot, just a loose collage of scenes which is supposedly a documentary about a fictional town in Tennessee that had experienced a tornado. The acting is mostly improvised by unknowns and many of the scenes are grusome. Teenagers kill stray cats and sell them to the local butcher and then go out and sniff glue. A retarded girl is prostituted by her brother. A drunken homosexual pass is made at a dwarf. Two young men have a real fight and beat each other bloody. Cruelty is everywhere and every scene is a shocker. The cinematography is often grainy and blurred and voices are muffled and unclear. I'm the curious type and so I wanted to see this video. I was prepared to be shocked. But I was also bored because the story just didn't go anyplace. I'm surprised it got any kind of distribution at all. For the barf bag crowd only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute unredeemed filth!","review":"This is simply put one of the worst movies I have ever seen. In fact, just putting any words on paper about this film gives it more attention than it deserves. Ignore this movie at all costs; if you decide to watch it anyway, don't say you weren't warned.

What a mistake it was buying this piece of trash. Anyone who found this movie funny is disturbed. This isnt humorous at all and im into dark comedy.

A brother pimps his mentally disabled sister.- Killing and abusing cats. - The rest of the scenes i cannot even say on this site. This isnt a comedy.

This movie has no plot. This question and statment has been asked and made more than enough times. unfortunately a lot of people missed the point of this film, it should be viewed as a FICTIONAL DOCUMENTARY not a movie with a story line or a point. The saddest thing about Gummo is not the film and it's racy scenes itself but, that there are actually people and families that live this way. They may even be your neighbor.Are there disturbing scenes in this film? YES.. Is this a film for Children? NO... I suggest if you do decide to watch this go into it with a complete open mind and I STRESS the words COPLETE OPEN MIND!Overall I gave the film 4 stars because some scenes went on longer than they should have but, other than that it was well done... again I'm looking at it in a FICTIONAL DOCUMENTARY standpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"The easiest way to sound like an amateur film critic.........","review":"is to criticize a film for having \\"no plot.\\" The point of making movies outside the studio system is to NOT have these requirements. On netflix, far more people chose to take the time to write a review of this film versus 'Kids.' In a theoretical way, you can tell how thought-provoking a film is by how many people take the time to share their thoughts and argue about it on the internet. There's no point in even trying to make a value judgement of a film when it's all interpretive anyway. This is one of the rare films that, after seeing, I went straight to my computer because I knew people would be arguing about it on the internet. It makes me ask myself: if I were a filmmaker, would I want the film that everybody likes passingly - or the film that everyone hates lovingly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"gummo.. hmm. well..","review":"this movie was very very strange.. if killing cats, white trash, and a death metal/nursery rhyme sound track interests you.. go for it. otherwise save your hour and 1/2. this movie reinforces my faith in making movies myself... movies are supposted to be like real life.. but this one is just too real and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diabolic antidote for suburban angelmania","review":"Gummo blurs the line between authenticity and madness. The riot of images are an expose of hypocrisy and a paeon to a lost consciousness. Even the most jaded viewers will be shocked.

Watching Gummo is like swimming through the sewers of the New Jerusalem."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, white trash is not a freak show","review":"uh, i used to be white trash, and i lived in a trailer park. that was where i grew up, and unlike this movie might suggest, most of the people TRY to act normal, even people who are white trash.

It made me feel dirty and ill."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Psuedo Documentaries Of all time","review":"First, people who bad mouth this movie have no art sense. This movie is pure Genius. To some it might not have a general plot. Don't look at it as a whole movie, it's more like a pulp fiction type piece it together deal. It is just showing you a different lifestyle, like watching a national geographic about some tribe. Anyone who seen this movie can't say they didn't laugh at the majority of the movie..I mean come on..... that junkyard seen with the rabbit boy and thoses 2 little kids, that was the best part.

Definitely an eye opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie thats not worth the time..","review":"I was told that this movie was going to be sick and twisted, and watched the movie to find out that the movie was stupid. Do not believe the hype, this movie will make you stupider if you watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's rare when pretentiousness & white trash mix, but....","review":"This feat is artfully accomplished in Gummo. While it's laudable that the film doesn't preach easy answers to difficult questions regarding the underbelly of white America, it's a wholly ineffectual romp into the muck, and it seems the only point of the film was to nauseate the audience. In case you think I'm squeamish, I thought that Kids was brilliant, and I'm as willing as anyone to sit through some pretty dark stuff, like Requiem For A Dream, Blue Velvet, Elephant Man, etc. But Gummo is different. This is merely a self-aggrandizing muck fest, and there is not one character that elicits even the smallest amount of sympathy from us. And the Rabbit-Boy addition was mere pretentious weirdness. It's really too bad, because I would have liked to like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiss me Guido is more socially accpetable in today's society","review":"The sheer intellectual, pinnacleness shows the sheer velocity of this movies integrety. The bacon on the wall enphisized the mamality of all the social parasites of everything that thrives today. I liked this movie a lot cause it shows life as it is portrayed in the mixed up society of today.

Just because you've been told that there isn't supposed to be a plot and this is supposed to be emulating a documentary doesn't make it true. Watch any documentary, you'll see some unification, some direction...Gummo feels like Harmony Korine dropped a camcorder in a trailer park and ran away.I gave it two stars because I sense that he saw something here; some of the images are powerful, and he did try to cross boundaries/push envelopes. I just think he fell short.

Personally, I found it interesting. Those who aren't offended by it will watch it a second time just to see if their eyes & ears deceived them the first time! And the third time you watch will be to convince yourself that they certainly must have used 'special effects' for the 'meal-in-the-bathtub' scene at the end !

Just make sure first, that your cats are inside, and the kids are asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a go ....","review":"Gummo is a refreshing change from the often trite and samey world of 'indie' cinema ( usually nothing of the sort ). It is genuinely experimental and embraces the use of video, an essential tool in the weaponary of modern filmmakers who are broke, although I doubt Korine is . So if you have the stomach for it ( some scenes are nauseating and darkly comic ) then I would thoroughly recommend that you give Gummo a go . You'll love it or hate it but you wont forget it . The only problem I see for Korine is that because of it's rather unique style another film like Gummo would appear to be merely covering the same ground . Oh yeah....Leonard Maltin hates it so this is all the more reason to watch . Happy Viewing ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok .....","review":"This movie was a horrible waste of film and time.

I admit that I quit reading 3/4 of the way through, so maybe the excitement finally starts in the last quarter of the book. But I was so bored when I gave up that I didn't care who was murdered, who performed the murders, why the murders happened, or if the murderer was revealed. And I certainly didn't care what happened to the excessively shallow Mrs. Malory, her fellow lame instructors, or her perfectly unbelievable students. There's no one here with whom you can sympathize, nothing to catch you up, and very little to keep the pages turning.

There's no surprises, except at the end where an unexplained murder takes place and it's so confusing and you never find out how on earth it happened. However, the story makes up in part for it's blandness by having the story told in part by the stalker and the victim, and it's interesting to see how the victim is feeling while the stalker is planning to kill her. Recommended if you don't mind there being no surprises. If you like Fear Street, you probably won't like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't say","review":"I never got the item!

Thornton shows an obvious study of Spanish and South American literature and manages to evoke the nature of Magical Realism in a book written in English for an American audience.Read Imagining Argentina. It is a fascinating novel that is impressive in both literary prowess and contemporary political importance."},{"rating":"2","title":"IA Groups/sixth sense : ...","review":"Imagining Argentina is a novel that would be best described as unique, profound and very extordinary. It is focused on the topic of how imagination becomes the key element in survival and strength. It reflects the actions of a young man named Carlos Rueda who comes across a unique ability to percieve the fate and wherabouts of people who have been kidnapped by their corrupt government. Imagination is used as a tool of what appears to be war between the government and the citizens, which proves to show how powerful it really is. The power of imagination is not just something Carlos can do but is something that anyone can do in order to stay strong. The theme of the novel revolves around how imagination is an act of hope. Hope of never giving up. We enjoyed reading this novel very much. Lawrence Thornton writes with great creativity and imagination which makes the novel so intrigueing to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic spin on a horrible historical event","review":"I had never read a Thornton novel before Argentina and I found it absolutely mesmerizing.

I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"So you want to know about Babylon 5, huh?","review":"Andy Lane's unauthorized guide is a book that covers a wide spectrum of interests: plot breakdowns, references to history, mythology, religion; who's who with both characters and the people portraying them; not to mention occasional opinions or behind the scenes tidbits only insiders know about.The book covers not just the TV show but related novels and the comic series as well, intertwining all the information and cross referencing when needed. It has over 400 pages of easy to read information, and even has a 14 page index (very small print). I don't think I have read through a book so quickly that still kept my interest on each page.So whether you are a die-hard Babylon 5 fan, or are just curious as to what the upcoming hoopla is all about, this is a very good choice for reference material.

I notice Lane is a SF writer himself -- maybe he is jealous of the world that JMS created and that he didn't think of something as good.There is a supplemental book that covers the episodes not contained in the first book. I bought both of them at the same time. Wish I had bought and read the first book first, then decided whether to buy the second.

For instance, the vampire co-ed, and her friend, and the vampires henchmen were good-looking and well done. But some parts were just annoyingly bad. For instance: I hated the main hero. He was such a loser. I don't think he changed his t-shirt once during the entire film. He was such an alcoholic I was quite frankly surprised he didn't see vampires ALL the time. And the master vampire looked like a bad extra from Buffy.One of the few things I DID like about the film was the ending...Two stars for a sub-average vampire flick with a few good points.

There is nothing new in this movie, but it's all done with a sence of fun and energy. Lance Hendricksen turns in a very good preformance as the police captain.Nothing ever really gets scary and it all seems to have been made tongue-in-cheek.A fun b-movie romp that does just what a movie should do of this type: entertain"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not so much a review as it is an opinion","review":"I rented this movie and had a hard time sitting through to the end.

The editing in the first disc (\\"Incantations\\") is a little questionable (focusing on people who aren't doing much while someone off-screen is taking a solo, etc.), but the set includes alternate-angle viewing, and the footage of Pierre and Benoit Moerlen charging through the vibraphone solos in Part IV is terrific.

I've had it for a couple of years and it's just been an OK camera. I called it my point, shoot and pray camera because in bright light nothing can be seen on the screen, even when snorkeling. And it hasn't been that great snorkeling either. I have only used the camera snorkling on about 4 or 5 occasions and will admit that I hadn't had the seals replaced yearly as suggested. Didn't think it was necessary with such limited water use. Well last month I was floating in the Dead Sea in Jordan. The camera was dipped in the water a couple of times but throughly washed immediately upon returning to the beach. Guess this was a torture test in 30% salt content water because within two days the camera no longer worked. The memory card was runined and the camera will no longer work even with a new card and battery.

It is difficult to open the doors to down load photos, and there is no way I would submerge it.The photo quality was also mediocre, whether on land or under water. Taking photos while snorkeling was fun, but nearly impossible to capture fish unless it was extremely close to the surface. The water just filtered out too much light.Bottom line, this toy isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera!","review":"Nice size camera!

We have been comparing photos and generally this camera takes poor pictures at best. If you are in bright daylight it's fine, but in even remotely dim lighting the pictures absolutely stink. Also, the focus is twitchy. You have to learn the strange focus attributes of the camera to get a decent shot and even then you have a 50% chance of being out of focus.I haven't taken this camera underwater but after learning the Olympus policy is to require a gasket refit ever year at over $100 per refit, I don't think I'll be doing that.Also the battery life is horrible.It seems like a super safe buy because of all the shock and water proofing, but in the end you will be sorry you bought this, just like my brother and I are."},{"rating":"1","title":"snorkler","review":"The camera is easy enough to use, and it takes outstanding photographs.

In fact, the customer service agent told us they had received many back because of leaks. Now we have a bad camera, memory card, case and skin and nothing but frustration dealing with Olympus. Extremely disappointed in this product and Olympus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful sturdy camera","review":"I bought the Olympus Stylus 720 sw and quickly realized that 10 feet deep is not deep enough! I didn't kill the camera, but as I videoed my swim deeper chasing marine life I started to think, \\"Am I deeper than 10 feet?\\"Well, that was my honeymoon and my camera was stolen on the trip home. I bought the 770 as a replacement, and I'm not worried about going 33 feet down.There's enough settings in this camera to suit any condition you want to take pictures in.This is a wonderful camera, my 5th Olympus digital.I just got this camera back from Olympus after breaking the usb door (it got knocked off my desk when attached to the usb cable and landed on my tile floor) which was replaced with no charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing little camera!!!","review":"I bought this camera for a recent trip to Cancun Mexico. I also have a Nikon D200, but wanted something that I could carry around in my pocket. I ended up going scuba diving - and, this camera took amazingly clear photos at 30 foot depths. I know that it says it will, but I was a little hesitant to jump into the ocean with it and without some kind of waterproof casing. Well, everything worked out even better than expected. I have no complaints...excellent point and shoot camera, great for sporting events, families with kids, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flooded during vacation :-(","review":"I was never a big fan of this camera as it's menu system is not too easy to use when compared to my Canon PowerShots. But it's small size and underwater use made it an addition to our vacation travel kit. Unfortunately, on a recent trip to Brazil, the camera flooded for no particular reason and died underwater. Of course, as soon as it stopped working, I took it out of the water, removed the battery, and dried it out for a few days, but it did not come back to life. I really hope Canon starts making rugged underwater cameras smaller than their recently released PowerShot D10 which is a bit on the large size. I would love a waterproof SD1200-size camera!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not So Tough Little Camera","review":"I bought this camera after a few rain drops ruined my old FugiFilm.PRO:-Water/shock/drunk proof (primarily why I bought the camera).-Decent Macro feature.-Good battery life.-Multiple picture settings.-Pocket size.CONS:-Really S L O W shutter speed.-No eye piece, just LCD screen, which is very difficult to see in bright light.-All pictures turn out a little dark (if I did not know or use Photoshop, it would be a big problem).-Image stabilization does not really work, especially on the Macro setting.-Cannot get the panoramic feature to work.EDIT: I don't know how a \\"shockproof\\" camera LCD spiderwebs after a two foot drop, though it claims to be rated for a five foot drop.

Has been dropped by the kids already and still functions beautifully! Would recommend to anyone..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympus 770SW","review":"I have used the camera for less then a month so far, but in a variety of situations and environments. This is an excellent product, takes good pictures, and has multiple options for various situations, from underwater to extreme close-ups. For the latter, it even provides its own illumination, which is far more desirable than a flash.The most annoying aspect of the camera is the lack of optical viewfinder. Even though it has a bright and large LCD screen, it is still difficult to use in bright sunlight. It is also heavier than most cameras of its size, but that is necessitated by its shockproof construction. A cord, worn around the neck, while kayaking or diving, will keep it from disappearing into the deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied with the results.","review":"I did a lot of search before buying this camera. Opinions were all mixed and had my doubts but decided to purchase it. I bought this camera specifically to use it on water sports and the beach. I took this camera for a seven days cruise on the Caribbean and use it on the river, on the beach, on the air, underwater and for regular pictures. I am very pleased with the results not just on the pictures but for the video too. The picture quality is not like an SLR, but in general are very good especially pictures on sunny days and underwater if the water is as clear as the ones on Grand Cayman Islands. For the price you just can't ask for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this camera!!!! it is the worse camera ever","review":"Do not buy this camera!!!! it is the worse camera ever. We were at the lake and the camera stopped working and you can see some water had entered the camera.

After complaining about the misleading advertisement, the lady actually told me you can go to the web and express your feelings!!!! EVERY YEAR PAY $120 - IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY - AGAIN DO NOT BUY!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from extended salt water exposure","review":"I purchased this camera for use outdoors and in the ocean. For the most part it held up, I dropped it a couple times, had it out in the rain, used it whole snorkeling. However, after using it less than 10 times snorkeling in the ocean (I would soak in fresh water following the instruction after snorkeling) the camera shut down. I realized water had entered the camera because the seals failed. I didn't dive more that 20 feet deep. I also noticed additional corrotion on various parts of the camera. So now I need to return it, but have zero faith the new camera will perform any differently. I may consider purchasing a waterproof cover for the camera when I dive in the ocean, not sure if they make one though. Another complaint is the slow picture speed. Other than that, it is rugged, and would suit someone who wants to throw a camera in the backpack on their next hike.I warn against using this as a diving camera or surf camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Experience!!?!!","review":"I read all the reviews before I chose to buy this camera. Having three kids, a shockproof and waterproof camera sounded unbelievable and perfect for me. At first it was great. The pictures came out great and the camera was very user friendly. I love to take pictures and had the camera in my purse at all times to never miss a golden opportunity of the perfect picture. Then after using it one day with no problems, two days later when I went to use it again and the camera would not stay on. I tried a new battery, but still nothing. So much for this camera, its was supposed to be shockproof and waterproof yet it broke in its case inside of my purse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undependable and No Support","review":"I bought this camera in anticipation of a long planned trip to Hawaii.

SO FAR, THE POINT AND SHOOT OPTIONS AND PICTURES HAVE BEEN LOVELY. ANY PERSON CAN SCREW UP PICTURES WITH ANY CAMERA, BUT THIS CAMERA HAS SO MANY FEATURES TO AVOID THAT.

I've needed this wake-up call to focus on the positives of the teen years instead of the negatives.This is the best homeschool book I've read in years! Cafi manages to give a broad picture, explaning the many different routes homeschoolers take, while giving you baby steps of how to get moving in positive directions, find great curriculum, and money saving tips. She addresses the specifics of the 3R's and the Extras, addresses tailoring your school to your family's needs, keeping records and much more. I loved the fact that she writes with a national perspective. These are not just her ideas, but come from a large pool of home educators across the continent.

I used to have a motivated learner (she still is if you count talking to friends or watching Youtube videos as learning?!) so now that she's getting ready to go into the \\"real world\\" of course I'm getting nervous about whether she's learned \\"it all\\". This book reassured me greatly that she is probably on track. She does do \\"enough\\" homework I just can't read \\"Well-Trained Mind\\"(it's a good start to find curriculum but not to be taken too seriously, especially by perfectionists) too much anymore. I love the online resources and being able to read about how other people school - most of my friends are unschoolers and I always wondered how they really did it.

It was published before online virtual academies were available, before smart phones, before YouTube, etc. Many of the websites suggested are outdated. I hope the author has the time and support to produce an updated edition. It also does not include a section on the numerous companies that offer accredited programs and diplomas (Calvert, K12, Connections, American School, etc.) The book also spends most of the time introducing the reader to the concept of homeschooling and giving very general advice which makes this book not geared towards seasoned homeschoolers.

Zappa had a semi-stable band with Ike Willis for many years. On this album are Ed Mann (who has a very nice solo album if you can find it, Barrow, Caoluita, Mars, Walley and Wolf. A date is not given, but I am guessing it is from a tour just after Joe's Garage part 1 was released.There are two tracks from something called the Rueben and the Jets tour, but features the Flo and Eddie band.The CD title is a good name for it as it features mostly short, silly tracks.The sound quality is OK but not great.

I didn't immediately like \\"Get Fuzzy\\" when I first started reading it. It has grown on me. This strip is BETTER in book form than it is in the newspaper. It reads better in book form. It grows on the reader. I love how the strips are cumulative. I love that Conley tells stories through a series of strips. I love how he returns to themes. I love how something will come up in passing in one strip and then get expanded in another strip much later. I love the consistency of the characters. And I love the way this strip is drawn. I hope it runs for a long, long time & the quality holds up. This collection is one to read and re-read.

This book couldn't be a better purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the next one.","review":"Anyone who does not enjoy Get Fuzzy clearly is missing the point. There is a un unique air of sarcasm in almost every strip, perfectly coupled with Satchel's innocence and Bucky's demeaning, yet unintelligible comments.This is not Garfield and Odie - this is not a kid's strip at all. This is the best comic to come along since Calvin and Hobbes. Connely's artwork is very amusing. From Bucky's snaggle tooth to Satchel's broken watch - its easy enough laugh without even reading the dialog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...great comic","review":"It's amazing what \\"Get Fuzzy\\" does with its few characters and limited setting. It's not like other comic strips that feel they have to add new characters whenever they run out of material. \\"Get Fuzzy\\" always has something new, something to think about. The characterization is great. A lot of people say that Bucky and Satchel remind them of their pets....they remind me of people I know. It's also refreshing to have a comic strip that doesn't feel it has to be laugh-out-loud funny every day. \\"Get Fuzzy\\" touches something inside of you, and that's enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Strip is Bad: The Only Rule!","review":"Before anyone else purchases this garbage be forwarned, it IS NOT Bloom County, The Far Side, Calvin and Hobbes or any other sarcastic comic that rips on pop culture and politics. It is hardly the great comics of the past. Save your money. If you think this is like those strips you will be greatly disappointed.Also Darby, stop trying to make Satchel into Opus, I mean think about it. The scene where you show Satchel complaining about his nakedness in the shower was done about fifteen years earlier In Bloom County. Opus said almost exactly the same thing in almost the exact same context. The people who were not around long enough to remember Bloom County in its hayday have no idea what I am talking about, but there are those who remember Bloom County and can call you on this. That is why people should stear clear of Get Fuzzy, all the material has been done before, and a lot better!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Criminal Intent!","review":"It is so much a crime that Conley has created this disappointing charade of a comic. To sum things up, all one has to say is that it smells so bad of previouse strips, mainly of Bloom County and Garfield, that if one looks long enough he can see Opus in Satchel and Steve Dallas in Rob (but only in drawing style, not in humor). How ironic that his name is Rob, for all Conley did is \\"rob\\" other talented comic writers of their original ideas. Hopefully this strip will disappear before any lawsuits are brought onto Conley, at least for his sake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A promising new comic strip","review":"Funny newer comic strip with cute, engaging characters (although the human, Rob, could use more personality).

It is, by far, one of the funny strips in existence. You *will* laugh out loud.On top of the brilliant, Gen-X style, humor, Conely's art is also fantastic.

Then, upon reading my daily \\"Dilbert\\" I saw that Scott Adams recommended \\"Get Fuzzy\\" for whatever reason, so I decided to give it a try on a daily basis. It was in reading the strips regularly that the personalities of Robbo and his pets really started to flesh out. Now that I have the book, I'm able to see all that I was missing in just reading the Sunday strip.If you've just \\"sort of\\" enjoyed this strip in your paper or online, then this book really pulls it all together. I was extremely pleased to learn the origins of \\"Smacky\\", Bucky's best friend in the whole wide world.

Its a comforting book for those pet owners with their own demented pets - you're not alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bucky and Satchel Rule!!","review":"Get Fuzzy is right up there with Calvin and Hobbes, the Far Side, and Rhymes with Orange. What's so funny isn't always what the characters are saying or doing, it's the WAY that they are depicted. The expressions on their faces. The interactions between the three of them just crack me up.

Definitely a great stress reliever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh, new, and funny","review":"One of the best comic strips going today along with such greats as Foxtrot and Pickles.

A recommended read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Garfield would be if it were funny.","review":"In my opinion the best cartoon strips ever written are or were: The Far Side, Calvin & Hobbes, Dilbert, and Get Fuzzy.

I would say after reading about the recording sessions (which even featured Jimmy Page)realizing the tension between Jagger and Richards, and added the new age music that was taking shape, I've found there to be alot of energy in the album, it's good and bad for the music, the good being the pure soul in Jaggers' voice and emotion in Richards voice. The bad being the poor marketing, and poor overall reviews from the music critics that wanted the Stones to die off. I would recommend this album to collectors and fans, average stones listeners will not find any top hits here...it's just a growing pain (what got them where they are today) This Album was pivotal!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keith Richards shows up","review":"This is an underrated record; however, it shows the first appearence of Keith Richards as a viable solo act. I found his hand all over this record and I found out how luscious a voice the guy has on the best song on the record, takes a little while to get into, 'Sleep Tonight'. This disc jumps right into Keith's solo material of 1988, and 1992. Excellent record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better with age","review":"I've been relistening to all the Stone's recordings since the HBO special, and I've got to say that Dirty Work really surprised me.

That's about the only songs on this CD worth mentioning. I still listen to the other songs, but Mick does sound weary on this CD. But even at their worst, Stones are still better than half the sh!t out there now. And I did pick up this CD at a bargain, so I ain't complaining much.

When the best part of an album is a thirty-second snippet of a piano solo not even credited on the album sleeve, you know you're in trouble. Seriously, this is so drenched in annoying '80's production (Winning Ugly; Back to Zero; title song; Sleep Tonight), and so utterly generic (Fight; Hold Back; Had it With You), with so many bad ideas (Too Rude, neither the first nor the last near-unlistenable Stones reggae song), it's hard to believe it's the Stones. But it is - this makes Goats Head Soup look like Sticky Fingers. The only memorable song is One Hit (to the Body), which even then is far from a classic. Harlem Shuffle's nothing to get excited about, but it's fun, though rudimentary. Skip this one, since not even the best song is essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"Have always been a Rolling Stones fan. This album is dated garbage. If they weren't the Rolling Stones, none of this album would have charted, let alone gotten any radio play. It's obvious they hate each other and what they are doing. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judge it by the cover","review":"It sounds as bad as the cover looks- mostly. There are a few very good songs. That's all you need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good.","review":"Keith Richards' wife said about this album that \\"Keith had a lot of anger then.\\" (Keith was angry because Mick was spending so much time on his first solo album). Well, that's what comes across on this album...anger. It is just over-the-top hard rock. People say the Stones are a hard rocking band...and they are...but in there is usually a lot of SUBTLETY. This album has no subtlety whatsoever. It's just noise. I do like HARLEM SHUFFLE and HAD IT WITH YOU."},{"rating":"1","title":"They hit a low point here..","review":"I'm a huge Stones fan and I love most of their work. But after hearing this I have to wonder, what were they thinking??"},{"rating":"1","title":"pass","review":"This is two dimensional rock, that lacks the depth of the Stones usual stuff. When I first heard this album I worried that the Stones had changed their sound for good. But when \\"Steel Wheels\\" came out, I was relieved to hear the Stones return to form. And to address the comment two reviews down that this is Charlie's best album up to the end...well, believe it or not, Ron Wood, not Charlie Watts, plays the drums on the last Keith ballad, \\"Sleep Tonight\\". Charlie was too floored with heroin/amphetamine addiction at the time to work on the song. And, personally, the song shows the lack of Charlie (the same way the Beatles \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\" misses it somehow because Paul, and not Ringo, was drumming). Luckily for us all, Charlie cleaned up. But a bad Stones album is better than most other groups' best album...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot better then I thought it would be","review":"This album is actually pretty decent not amazing but not horable by any state the first three songs are really strong dirty work is a great song and keith does great on his two songs. Over all there all pretty good I think it get's knocked down by fans when they first came out saying this ain't stickey fingers you young punk kids well stickey fingers is my favorite album by the stones but I guess someone my age (only 18) can love them for all the different styles they did. No it's nothing like the stones of the 60's and early 70's but still pretty damn good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, You Have To Give 'Em Some Credit","review":"Upon listening to Dirty Work, I turned to my little sister and asked her, \\"Do want to get this album? 'Cause I don't.\\" Dirty Work is mainly a mid-80's pop album, and I hate mid-80's pop. The album does have a few high points, though. It opens very well with the kick-butt \\"One Hit (To the Body).\\" \\"Fight\\" and \\"Harlem Shuffle\\" are okay. \\"Winning Ugly\\" is the same. Keith's \\"Sleep Tonight\\" is beautiful, possibly the best song on here. Ian Stewart's short boogie-woogie piano at the end, though, comes close to stealing the show, despite the fact that it's less than 20 seconds long. The Stones messed up on this one, but they recovered soon after."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the Stones and hate this album","review":"The album cover really says it all - they were just trying to get by, they didn't like each other, and Charlie was embarrassed to even be there. There is no redeeming aspect to this album. The best tracks - say Harlem Shuffle or One Hit - don't hold a candle to even the bands' low points in the 70's like \\"Dancing with Mr. D.\\" or \\"Hey Negrita.\\"This is the one Stones album which is not only a bad album for the Stones, but a bad album no matter who it's by."},{"rating":"1","title":"their worst","review":"I love the Stones....always have, always will...but for many reasons outlined in all these reviews, by far their worst album...production is way to 80's...writing is lacking....you want good 80's stones? Tattoo you, Undercover (underated CD see my review) and Steel Wheels....for the casual fan avoid this....plus if there are unreleased tracks then they should release an expanded edition...maybe it will make the review a three star :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Down Right Bad","review":"When the band recorded this album, their was a huge rift between Mick Jagger & Keith Richards. The album suffers from their fighting, as it sounds like no one wants to be there. The album is saved by the album's opener, the frantic, \\"One Hit (To The Body)\\" which has a caustic energy of an addict looking for his next fix and the closer \\"Sleep Tonight\\" in which Mr. Richards sings with poignancy. In between, there is no redeeming songs lead by the weak \\"Winning Ugly\\", the awful cover \\"Harlem Shuffle\\" and \\"Hold Back\\". The band mailed this one in and it left doubts as to whether they were capable of coexisting with one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Live Collection!","review":"There are a lot of supporters of The Boss who don't like this box-set because it's a \\"collection\\" of songs recorded live over ten years. As a consequence, there is a lack of continuity during the listening, so maybe it is difficult to catch the magic that you can breathe during a concert of Springsteen. Those who saw him with the E-Street Band live knows exactly what we are talking about. However in this collection you can find individual songs performed and recorded perfectly and divinely (it's not so easy to find these two things in a bootleg!!). And the performances of \\"Thunder Road\\", \\"4th Of July Asbury Park (Sandy)\\", \\"Candy's Room\\", \\"War\\", \\"This Land Is Your Land\\" are the proof that you will have in your hands something really special."},{"rating":"1","title":"SWAMPED","review":"Although set in the usually eerie swamplands of Louisiana, EVIL REMAINS doesn't go too far in advancing the tired cursed land story. A group of students venture off to a supposedly cursed plantation to disprove the myth of it being cursed. Seems twenty years earlier, an abused boy murdered his sadistic father and passive mother, but his body was never recovered. (Hint, hint). The movie tries to achieve some atmospheric chills and its cast is more than capable, but it's too talky and under-directed to provide true chills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of potential, not a lot of substance.","review":"This movie starts out, like most, with a pretty good plot, though it soon deteriorates into just another long, dragged out borefest. For example, you'll get annoyed with the never-ending card game, as well as the painfully tedious conversations between characters who become possessed (ala The Shining), most notably between Estella Warren's character and her on-screen girlfriend as they hide out (I won't give away more than that, in the event you actually want to see this one). On the positive side, Estella Warren's acting is actually pretty good (better than The Planet of the Apes, anyway). In sum, though, I wouldn't recommend this one.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the Brokeback Mountain of Slasher flicks?","review":"Not Bad Not Great.

The three way female connection contacts were improperly molded. The connections sparked and were intermittent even when plugging in low power items such as lights. The contacts heated rapidly at the plug in connection. The longer that I used them the worse the problem became. Since both extension cords were defective, it seems likely that the entire manufacturing batch is bad.I recieved the appropriate information from Cummins Industrial Tools customer service department to return the extension cords, but they did not offer to pay any shipping. I may just dispose of them due to the high shipping cost. The two extension cords cost approximately $80 and the shipping both ways will cost me over $50.Poor quality and high shipping costs are a bad combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Purley Charming Tale","review":"The World of Henry Orient is an amazing stories, and what suprised me most after reading it was that the girls were actualy like preteen girls, they're emotions were dead on, their thought processes and the way marion handled val was exactly like a concerned girl would do.

The tone here captures the comically languid, pointless, and sometimes idiotic role of government and the war machine, matched with a muckraking Jason Biggs and his band of misfits as they battle a despotic, fascist base commander. Throw in a beautiful love interest and a Pentagon coverup and you have an entertaining, admirable near-miss that will leave you satisfied you watched the whole thing, and possibly a bit more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding.

Once again, instead of producing something wonderful, they choose instead to rush out a product to unwary fans, so they can make a few bucks!

Like another reviewer said, \\"I wish I could return the video.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I am so disappointed with this DVD. The DVD is divided into two parts- the women's and the men's gymnastics. I only watched the women's portion. This DVD shows less footage than the live footage on NBC did! Some routines aren't shown in their entirety and some just aren't shown at all. Most of the focus is on the USA team but there are a few routines from the Russian girls featured. The bonus features are a few routines done by other gymnasts from other countries. I almost wish I could return this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Talk about disappointing. This DVD is so not worth the money. We love the Olympics and watch them avidly, especially the gymnastics portion. I bought this DVD thinking \\"great, we can watch it over again.\\" Um, it's only about 30 minutes or so of the entire women's gymnastics competition. That includes qualifying, team and individual! I can't believe what a rip-off this was. Not only did they show little snippets of team USA but there were hardly ANY clips of the other countries. Russia was a major contender for pete's sake and they're barely shown.

Someone at the 'Gravity Games' has messed up big time and no doubt heads will roll but that is of little consolation to me. Perhaps there should have been some sort of warning on the box regarding Mr Jolly's non appearance, or were the makers of this DVD cynically attempting to cash in on Mr Jolly's popularity without having to pay him to appear?.

HIMYM shows TRUE friendships - the joking around, mocking each other, plenty of inside jokes (that they share with the viewer, and of course, helping each other out.

Mitchell plays a beggar who saves a woman and her son from being assaulted by a couple of men with his prowess with knives (hence the title). The movie's familial themes, along with the avenger's conflicts between two divided camps makes this one of Bava's most engrossing and endearing films. This DVD comes with a four page booklet with liner notes by Tim Lucas, a Mario Bava biography and filmography, theatrical trailer, photo and poster gallery, and trailers from other Mario Bava's films.A worthwhile experience. Check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made","review":"The charm looks nice, but it is hollow and very light weight. The skin is extremely thin silver.

I think they discovered the style that suits them best and have developed a unique-sounding, southern metal tinged, and sonically amazing set. Of course I became hooked when I heard \\"Vulture\\", which is one of the best songs, but for me, the whole cd was very solid with lots of catchy, ear-shredding riffs and interesting, unusual song structures. In this genre, it becomes difficult for me to tell some bands from others. Unless they have a very unique vocalist or a trademark sound of some sort, it all blends together for me. And that is not to say that I don't enjoy it, but just that some bands don't stand out from others on the same talent level. ALOL definitely stood out to me, and I hope they release a new one soon! 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE OF THAT GOOD OL' A LIFE ONCE LOST","review":"HUNTER IS WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM A LIFE ONCE LOST.

This DVD is mostly talking with very little music. If you are interested in a history of the M&P's, then this would interest you. If, like me, you already know their history but would like to listen to their music as well as see them, then don't buy this DVD.

Their music was without peer, between the strength of John Phillips' compositions and the execution of them by the group as a whole--most memorably Michelle Phillips and Cass Elliot--they made a profound impression that belies their short existence as a group. As such I have to agree with the previous reviewer, there's simply not enough MUSIC to justify the price of this disc.What's needed is for some enterprising executive at some huge multinational oligopoly to realize that what's really needed is to release a dvd of live and studio performances, preferably as a companion to Cass Elliot's stellar \\"Don't Call Me Mama Anymore\\" show that was broadcast on network television in the early 70s (& recently re-released on CD).

I think it has all been made up, crafted with slyness (but not intelligently) to appeal to would-be Sufi aspirants and fans of mysticism.The only impression I got from reading this book, I couldn't finish by the way because of its sheer banality, is that Mr. Reshad is not very a very genuine man (that's saying it in the best of manner I can).Please if you're looking to know what Sufism is really about, read somewhere else.

The Italians developed a uniquely atmospheric style in black&white photography with minimal resources and maximum talent. Director Freda and cinematographer/director Bava utilized native European influences as opposed to the predominantly Hollywood style of horror to create intricate mood pieces such as 1960's BLACK SUNDAY and 1962's HORRIBLE DOCTOR HITCHCOCK which owe everything to this seminal first collaboration between the two filmmakers. Basically a modern retelling of the Elizabeth Bathory legend of a Countess kept young by bathing in the blood of virgins, with the now classic mad doctor theme added, this fine little film suffered much mutilation in it's transfer to American screens.

So go ahead, maybe you'll see what everyone else did in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One to re-read","review":"I tried reading several books by Francesca Lia Block, and I couldn't stand most of them. But this one hit the sweet spot. I read it at the library, and I liked it so much that I went out and bought it just so I could have it at my disposal to re-read whenever I wanted.Block isn't big on simple texts and storylines, preferring instead to write prose so lyrical it could almost be categorized as poetry instead. Given that, you've got to be in the proper mood for this book or you'll be disgusted with it. But in the proper mood, block makes loneliness, self-hatred, and despair into things of beauty. This coming-of-age novel is unique in its telling, like a fairy tale for teenagers who have become disenchanted with the stories of their youth. It's memorable and enchanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is one of the most enjoyable novels I've ever read.

And, after reading Echo I am afraid of actually buying another. I hate to sound mean, but I found the perspective changes sudden and completely confusing. The reason I am apprehensive about buying another one of Block's books is because Echo lacked plot and reason. It was simply a tale of life and I kept waiting for something to actually happen. But, no, it was simply a tale of her life. And maybe if it held my imagination more, I would have adored it with its interesting characters and such.So, if you really need a book that keeps your mind captive I do not suggest this novel.

I was very confused. There isn't any strange words used, as in Shakespeare for example. But the words are out of order. The story itself does not follow any direction. You always seem to be reading from another character's point of veiw. This may not seem bad, but only until you are almost done with the chapter, do you even know who you are reading about.

However, this is not her best.This book is written as a journey of self-discovery, centered around Echo, a young girl growing up in the shadow of her goddess-like mother. Her life is spent trying to shed that shadow and become a person in her own right. The book interweaves chapters of Echo's life with chapters telling the stories of the main figures in her life. This is an interesting device that works here.Something that more intense Block fans will notice is that the chapter of this book revovling around Echo's health obsession is drawn, sometimes verbatim, from Block's short story Blood Oranges.Although good, this is not Block's best. If you're starting out, read Girl Goddess #9 or I Was A Teenage Fairy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...","review":"... I really *do* think it's time to get rid of the \\"young adult writer\\" label. Sure, Francesca Lia Block's stories are great for teens et al, but this gem of a novel (darker than dark and outrageously uplifting at the same time) can't get confused with the crappy titles that overflood the kiddie lit corner. I mean, Francesca's a unique author with a dazzling vision. Plus, I'm enjoying her works as a wee-begone thirtysomething (and I'm positive I'm not the only one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Echo: Great Characters, Dreamy Sequences","review":"The angel/not-really-an angel was a very likeable character, experiencing some type of inner-healing that -- even though we don't witness it -- allows him to finally be with Echo at the book's end. Echo's mom is not the perfect parent but she did have sincere love for her husband. Her failing is that she loved him so much that she neglected Echo during the teen's own grief. Valentine is a tragic figure, ending up as a high-end prostitute, lovable but sad, a cautionary tale. Her word usage and phrasing is amazing, poetic, and mesmerizing. The ending was sort of confusing, but very, very nice, particularly the setting of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where Echo spends the night. Block uniquely weaves a story of healing and self-discovery around the artistic and dissipated characters of Los Angeles...a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"8 yo daughter's Christmas gift.","review":"My daughter is 8 and VERY curious about science. So, when she asked for a microscope I started my quest. I am a Registered Nurse who is tired of pointless, uneducational plastic toys that break. I wanted school quality & durability and I found it in this microscope! It is the real deal with the metal body, lights, and different magnifications. Not to mention my daughter is head over heals with it, so am I.

I bought it for my seven year old daughter, but it is useful for anyone of any age. Almost everything on this microscope works well and is very well built. The only problem I have is the focus drifts at times. This why I gave the microscope a four star rating instead of a five.The range of the lenses is very good. The dim-able light is nice to have. This is just a very good microscope. I can see is lasting for a very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"Plugged it in, no light.

This book is for quilters who may be tired of the old mundane and tedious world of quilting. This book gives you the guidelines to be freer in your quilting, to let the quilt evolve. No precision here. No templates needed. No cutting and sewing the same block over and over. Quilting is fun again and oh, so creative. You too can create a quilt with lots of personality!

The mower worked fine for my use but the wheel bearing on the rear tire failed after one use. I used the mower for a total of 1.5 hours. Called customer service and they said bearings are a wear item and not cover under warranty despite the fact that it was only used for 1.5 hours. Instead of saying I'm sorry you experienced problems with our product and that I must have gotten a defective bearing and they would send out some new parts, I had to send photos for them to look at (apparently my work is not good enough). After I sent photos it was like they didn't believe what they seen. I had to go round and round, send pictures, and more pictures, wait on hold for 10 minutes each of the four times I called. This company definitely does not stand by their product. To think bearing failure after 1.5 hours is normal wear is completely ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was Hard Cutting for the Swisher 60'' bush hog","review":"I put the swisher bush hog through the works today. The 14.5 hp peformed like a champ. Of course this is the first time i used it since i received it last month. I had to repair four wheeler first. It was rough cutting. Small stumps and limbs, going thru small ditches and old four wheeler tracks that kids had made on the property when the last owners had the property.It was so rough even though i was going a slow as i could in 1st gear.The Lock nut that attaches bush hog to four wheeler came off. So I went and got another and the shoot where the grass comes out, one of the nuts feel off of the bolts on that. Anyway I am well satisfied with the performance it game me today.

Using a Gator for towing, the Swisher has gone through sections of heavy grass hay with no problem and turning on the slope has not been a safety issue.

The remastering is very good, and the liner notes good. I think most people would agree that, though all the discs are enjoyable, the final Cannon's Jug Stompers disc is head and shoulders above the others: I'd give that one individually five stars. This set will also appeal to fans of classic rock, who will find in it the originals of songs later covered by major rock, folk rock, and folk revival artists, like Stealin', Stealin', Viola Lee Blues, Walk Right In, and Bring It With You When You Come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memphis Jug Band And Gus Cannon","review":"This style of music may not be for everyone.

The characters and plot will charm you and keep you entertained. A fresh take on the old series, it still holds true to the Dr. Who of the past. This one happens to be my favorite so far because it combines all the characters I've loved from previous seasons at some point, while giving us new ones to enjoy as well. The box art and extras add to the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Includes two (2) specials!","review":"The Complete Fourth Series box-set will include \\"Voyage of the Damned\\", as well as the Children in Need skit \\"Time Crash\\", which was not shown in North America.

I love how they reunited everyone to fight the Daleks. Sad to see David Tennant go, however. He was great as The Doctor. And I'll miss Catherine Tate as Donna too. I have not watched seasons five and six yet, but this season is probably one of my favorites so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the Doctor!","review":"My ex husband got me hooked on the BBC series, Doctor Who. I love David Tennant as the Doctor. He is fun, witty, charming and so very handsome! Catherine Tate as Donna Noble is a hoot with phrases like \\"I'm not letting you out of my sight martain man.\\" She says to the Doctor shortly after they first meet. There is definately chemistry between the two characters and not necessarily of the romantic kind.The fourth season, is fun, but has some scary moments as well. Watch the episode \\"Midnight\\" for the chills and for the chills and fun part two of \\"The Stolen Earth\\" is great. Donna becomes half human half time lord and Catherine Tate is a hysterically funny.Overall any of the four series with David Tennant is great, but I think the fourth series is my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ones I got were Bogus not the real thing!","review":"I am an avid fan but when I purchase something I expect to get the real thing, not a bad reproduction with all kinds of typos, incorrect titles.

From the beginning with Donna coming back join the Doctor and the little fat babies to the very end with the Medusa Cascade. I was worried that Donna being the companion would mix well but I came to like her as much as the others. Her not being in love with the Doctor was a nice change from the past two (Rose and Martha) as it really felt like two friends on an adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Best","review":"David Tennant. Catherine Tate. Bernard Cribbins. It doesn't get better than this. And it didn't. For those of us bemoaning the cancellation of the Six Nations France vs. Ireland rugby match, or who need to escape this world for other meritorious reasons, accompanied by the singing of Ood, prepare to be mesmerized. Donna Noble is pitch-perfect as the right kind of gutsy companion, a real red-headed woman with attitude. No one can forget the wonderful, inimitable Bernard Cribbens as Donna's star-gazing grandfather. In \\"The Stolen Earth,\\" he declares: \\"It's gone dark. It's them aliens again, I'll bet my pension. What do you want this time, ya green swine?! You get back in side, Sylvia, they always want the women.\\" And the plump Adipose are a perfect story, working contemporary fallibilities with futuristic foibles.

The new series remains true to the original series with plenty of Daleks and metal men. Only gave four stars because some of the story lines are a bit contrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last full season of David Tennant","review":"Oh, how I miss Tennant! Most of his other works don't make it \\"across the pond\\", so his fans don't get to see enough of him! We all agree that Hollywood is STUPID to not give him a series or star him in a film over here, but what can you do?His final season as The Doctor was quite brilliant and I, personally, loved Donna! Finally a character who didn't have a crush on him and could go toe to toe with him! (Don't get me wrong, the love story with Rose, was AWESOME, but after that he needed a buddy!) She's brash, and witty, and won't let his ego get too big! She's tough, and smart, and sometimes even a wee bit sexy. The Vashta Nerada are introduced in this season, and I hope hope hope that they are brought back again someday... they are wonderfully frightening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Donna Noble is a Great Companion!","review":"This is the Fourth Season of the re-kindled Dr. Who. It includes the Christmas Special, Voyage of the Damned. The first true episode stars Catherine Tate as Donna Noble, a temp from Cheswick. She is the most energetic, and sassy companion for quite a ling time. There is no romantic interest between the Doctor and Donna, but the chemistry is excellent. The writing is solid, and the actors did their jobs well. Donna is a super character, and ought to go on in Dr. Who history to be one of the greatest companions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doctor Who Season 4","review":"I'm a HUGE Doctor Who fan, so I was super excited when I got my 4th season in the mail! (it was a couple days late so that kinda bugged me but other than that once it got there all was forgotten) This season is my second favorite season so far so I'm sure any Who fan would be happy to see it. The only thing that's not so great about it is that there aren't as many special features on it as there have been on past seasons of Doctor Who box sets. Other than that it's great, I love it, and totally recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disks play ok but may be a bootleg","review":"There are obvious & blatant misspellings on the dvds.

When I received the DVDs the packaging was all bent up. I don't know if the packaging was like this already or if it occurred in the shipping process, (but the packaging on my other Doctor Who DVDs I have bought from Amazon before were in great condition when I received them). Upon further inspection, 5 of the 6 discs had major typos of the episode titles. The proof of purchase was also missing from the packaging. The video quality itself was perfect, but it turns out that in a fluke thing, I got a bootlegged copy of the series. Great Alexander customer service then contacted me and said they would send me a brand new copy of the series, which I received the next day. I am very impressed with the company's customer service. They fixed the problem quickly and efficiently and I am pleased with the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Dr. Who","review":"one of the best seasons, Donna by far the best companion for the 10th Dr., would highly recommend, loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Episode One was AWFUL, Hopefully the Rest of the Season is Less Suck","review":"This review is for the first episode (\\"Voyage of the Damned\\") of season one. It was absolutely THE WORST episode of Doctor Who ever. I love Doctor Who. I love David Tennant. I hated this episode with a burning passion. We went from one of the best written, most creative, and best acted episodes yet (the season 3, 3 part closer) to the absolute *worst.* \\"Voyage of the Damned\\" was poorly written, dreadfully cliche, heavy handed, juvenile, hackneyed, and just overall crap. Judging from the rest of the reviews raving about Seasons Four (incidently, why are all the reviews for this episode reviews of the *entire season*?), things promise to pick up, but if it's more of the same, I'm going to be very, very annoyed and sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive.","review":"I bought series 1,3, and 4 before Christmas 2009 for $41.99 each from Amazon. Now I see it's going for $62 a piece. What's going on??? I love this show, maybe it's worth $62, but come on guys, give us a break. Don't take advantage of the situation by increasing the price, you might loose some fans out there who are not willing to fork out that much dough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Sub-Par","review":"The only reason this season gets more than a single star from me is because of the exceptional writing of Steven Moffat, who penned the 'Silence in the Library' two parter late in this series, which ranks as some of the best doctor to date. The rest of the season, however, is some of the worst. Whereas Rose was a fine companion and Martha was great, our good friend the bride is simply annoying. Unlike her two predecessors, she rarely shows any intuition. All in all, i'm very happy Russel T. Davies is leaving and handing the reins over to Moffat. Can't wait for season five."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was THE BEST SEASON THUS FAR!!!!!!!!!!","review":"[...]I am a huge Dr. Who fan and this by far was my favorite season.

Bonus features are good; includes: Doctor Who Confidential, David Tennant's Video Diary and the 2007 Christmas Special (Disc 1 of the set) and much more.I can't wait until the Doctor Who 2008 Christmas Special: The Next Doctor.

Not only does it comprehensively explore issues and problems in relationships, it clearly defines what exactly \\"love\\" is and what it truly means to love someone; for it is more than an emotion, it is consistency, deed and action. This book not only helps you learn about your own personality and character flaws, it shows you how to recognize them in others and how to transform your own personal shortcomings into proactive, productive approaches internally and within the context of a healthy relationship. There is such a thing as \\"false love.\\" Where do you stand?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I never bought this but it shows I did","review":"I did not buy this book.

WISH ANDRE WOULD INCLUDE ROSSINI'S \\"PASSO A SEI\\" IN ONE OF HIS CONCERTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"FICTION AS FACT FOR THE MOST PART","review":"Anger's book has become the poster child for poorly-researched books on Hollywood scandal. By now, most of the reading world is aware that the book is full of half-truths, unsubstantiated rumors, and pure fiction. In addition to incredibly innacurate \\"facts.\\" Even the sample text provided here that describes John Gilbert's death as a basis of \\"A Star is Born\\" is almost comically inaccurate. That movie was based upon the relationship between Barbara Stanwyck and Frank Fay. Gilbert's life had NOTHING to do with that film. No true (or self-respecting) Hollywood writer would cite Anger's book as fact or research. He's a nice man, but the book is simply Hollywood trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I've Encountered In Some Time","review":"This book is questionable as far as accuracy. For example, I have read several recent books on Judy Garland. Anger states that she committed suicide and he seems to enjoy pointing out that she looked \\"old..old...\\" and he inserts a very bad picture of Ms. Garland, then almost makes fun of her \\"suicide attempt\\" and how she appeared when she was found. He is very insensitive and trashy in his approach. He seems to list his \\"facts\\" with the glee of someone who is bitter after his own failed efforts in Hollywood. I felt embarrassed for him. I also felt that he really does not cover many personalities.I recommend reading \\"Too Much Too Soon\\" about Diana Barrymore, which was very beautifully written and was co-authored by Gerold Frank. I also recommend Gerold Frank's book on Judy Garland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Balderdash","review":"How anyone could be gullible enough to believe the easily-disprovable \\"facts\\" in this book is beyond me. Anger (a failed actor and director) got his revenge out on the town that scorned him. There are too many ludicrous factual errors and miscaptioned photos for me to list herein, but suffice it to say that (to paraphrase a comment on Lillian Hellman) every word in it is a lie, including \\"and\\" and \\"the.\\" Legitimate historians everywhere should curse the existence of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you crave celebrity dirt, then this book will satisfy you","review":"At times it is hard to determine which came first, celebrity or those who cash in by writing about their foibles and follies. This book is the second round of books having this name that describe the negative events in the lives of Hollywood celebrities. Everything from sexual antics to suicide to murders is covered, including a couple of upskirt shots similar to the recent one of Brittany Spears. If you are a fan of the darker side of the lives of celebrities, then this is a book that will satisfy that craving. There are even photos of the dismembered corpse of a female celebrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood has always produced the Britney Spears and Anna Nicole Smiths of the World","review":"Kenneth Anger paints a sinister, evil picture of a Hollywood that chews its \\"stars\\" up and spits them out. How can you not feel sorry for Frances Farmer and Fatty Arbuckle? I believe you judge a tree by its fruits, from the mindwashing destructive propaganda that Hollywood spews out to the many screwed up people that work in the business as performers, some of whom deserve to be scorned, some deserve your pity. Either way its a poisonous fruit that this tree bares. Hollywood Babylon covers a time period from the 1920s to the 1950s so don't think that human catastrophes like Britney Spears or Anna Nicole Smith are anything but different versions of the same song."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great piece of fluff!","review":"This book would have horrified the entire United States had it been published in, say, the 50's. I recall looking at it when it was published and turning up my nose.As far as literature, I'd rank this book as a really fattening and delicious chocolate truffle, not one bit edifying but a wonderfully fun romp through Hollywood scandals of yore, some of which I was not at all familiar with.I read it in a night, and recommend it with your evening tea or cocoa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it in a tabloid frame of mind.","review":"A fun book, as long as you're more firmly attached to rumor than truth. There's a lot more information out there about several of these scandals, but this book provides a quick survey and a good intruduction. Just remember it's ALL gossip, and should be taken as such -- that is, there's some grains of truth, but separating out the chaff of lies and speculation is impossible. And since the author only tells the most titillating side of every story, there's a heck of a lot of chaff. But it's great fun -- just don't take it seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible.","review":"There is hardly any text in this book. It's all pictures of hollywood stars in lewd positions. Marylin Monroe's pubic hair, Joan Crawford and another girl in flagrant delicto, and the writing is incredibly boring. Lighten up Kenneth. This book is ruined by your bitterness. I'm sorry if the hollywood of the old days is sour grapes for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTERESTING BOOK IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SUCH THINGS","review":"This work is rather well done, in particular the photographs from the 1920s and 1930s. The books is your basic Hollywood gosip stuff, which is interesting if you are interested is such stuff. The text is quite informal and is written in a gossipie sort of lingo, a tad tawdry and sort of fortyish gossip column style, which indeed fits the book and subject of the book. Again, I felt the strongest part of this work were the photographs the author put together. If your taste run to this sort of work and subject, then this is a good one and I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies, lies and more lies","review":"Kenneth Anger obviously hates Hollywood. So he writes this book based on gossip magazines that has little facts in truth. Did you know that Tyrone Power had an obsession for young boys? Did you know that Cary Grant and Randolph Scott shared the same bed? Did you know that Janet Gaynor and Mary Martin went alone to Brazil? Did you know that Errol Flynn was not only heterosexual but bisexual? Why did I ask these questions? Because these are questions that Anger WANTS you to get angry about. No good biographist has been able to prove these facts, and instead of relying on sound biographists, Anger instead dives into the yellow world of Confidential, a magazine notorious for lying and destroying careers almost mercilessly.So avoid this piece of trash at any cost!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting similarities to another book","review":"Some passages in \\"Hollywood Babylon II\\" strongly echo \\"Hollywood's Unsolved Mysteries,\\" an obscure pulp paperback by John Austin, written in 1969-1970.\\"The girl's head was frightfully battered but that was the least of it\\" (\\"Hollywood's Unsolved Mysteries,\\" Page 82, Black Dahlia case).\\"The victim's head had been bashed almost beyond recognition-but that wasn't the worst of it.\\" (Hollywood Babylon II, Page 127-130, Black Dahlia case)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsubstantiated mean gossip","review":"The author's motto seems to be if it didn't happen this way it should have.

Everyone in this book is ancient(and dead) most person's in this book were born in the 1920's. Most of them I never heard of. Ok Judy Garland,(everyone knows she died on the toliet) Jane Mansfield, nothing new here, the picture of the dead dog was no big deal. The way the book was written half the time it was unclear what the author was saying, there is not any good trash in this book, if you want a better read I would suggest the book by Christopher Kennedy Lawford about his own life and those around him such as the Kennedys and many celebrities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rumor, exaggeration, half lies and boring truths. Yawn.","review":"This is a very overrated book. Kenneth Anger (a resentful egotist who made some of the most tedious and uninteresting movies of the 20th century) preserved all the idle gossip and quasi-true stories of early hollywood and its stars. The stuff that is true (if you can figure out which is which) is either dull, common knowledge or unbelieveably depressing.

Despite the wild inaccuracies of now-deceased stars' exploits, the book is still like seeing a car wreck: you know it's awful, but you can't resist looking at it. It's a fun book in spite of itself.The photos are often tasteless, the prose is often tacky and sleazy, the research is put together with two nails and a hammer, and overall the book reminds one of the old \\"Confidential\\" magazines (the magazine is actually profiled in one of the book's chapters). Yet sleaze and tackiness are what Hollywood was all about, so the book seems fitting.If you want accuracy in a book, go elsewhere. If you like gossip in the most vicious and slimy way possible, then this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies Lies Lies","review":"The first time I read this book I loved it. Unfortunately since then I have read the biographies of some of the people in this book and realized that this really is just gossip.Clara Bow never took on the Trojans in her home, Jayne Mansfield wasn't really decapitated, that is a wig in the picture and Fatty Arbuckle wasn't a rapist, Virginia Rappe died from a botched abortion.The bottom line is, you are better off reading the biographies that are just as sensational, but hopefully closer to the facts.Also Crimelibrary.com has truer stories about these people and it is free."},{"rating":"1","title":"SICK, SICK, SICK!","review":"Hollywood Babylon is like the movie, \\"Alive,\\" in that it was great, but so sickening, you're not sure whether or not you want to recommend it to anyone. If you're of the faint of heart and want to hold onto cherished memories of the Golden Age of Hollywood, don't read it at all; you will be grossed out completely and may even lose your mind from the depravity. If you're of a stronger constitution, you may like it, but be prepared for grisly photos of dead people, revolting scandals and disgusting incidents. But if you're just a sick puppy, this book's for you! I, for one, am not one, so I gave it three stars. I would've given it four, but I had to deduct a point for the Tackyness Factor (c'mon--did we really need to see a picture of Jayne Mansfield's mangled dead dog after her fatal car crash? Yeeesh!). At any rate, buy this book if you like, but remember--you've been warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Unique","review":"This film is very unique. If you can overlook how cheaply it was made, and believe me, that alone will be a tough task, you will be pleasantly surprised as to how funny it is.Max Gardens plays Dr Breedlove over the top and is consistently hilarious throughout the entire film. The plot, what there is of one, consists of an alien (Frank Coe) coming to earth to seek the perfect female speciman. Of course, Dr Breedlove is the 'onestop' he needs to make. The models used are all attractive and are reasonably well built. Althea Currier never looked better than she did in this film. She will really knock your socks off. She's the total package. No wonder Russ Meyer used her in three films. Blondes Claudia Banks and Jackie DeWitt are also in the film.The DVD also offers commentary by producer Harry Novak. I think this film is a must buy for any lover of the 'nudie cutie' era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Idiotic, As Scary as a Linus But Women Are Gorgeous","review":"The scariest thing about these two films is the DVD cover. The actual monsters in the film are as scary as Linus from Peanuts but the women get lots of screen time and lots of camera tilts and pans. In Kiss me, they are hynotized go-go dancers and in Bare Mountain, they are bare and I presume there's a drawing of a mountain somewhere. This one is a real oddball setup but this is one the cleanest prints ever from SW and under bright studio lights, you get every detail on how gorgeous, & all-natural the women are - lots of slow pans, tilts and closeups.They are essentially topless throughout and they are gorgeous - all natural and of course, way before the days of tattoos. Both are in color and great looking prints. The extras and trailers are all great. One of the best SW 2-fers.

This book basically uses scare tactics to keep young women from exploring their sexuality in a healthy way. The authors warn about the temptation of masturbation, homosexuality and boys who only want \\"one thing\\". In Part II, avoiding self-destruction, in reference to masturbation it states, \\"Simply praise God and be determined to resist this temptation if it ever sneaks up on you.\\" It also cautions young women not to do anything they wouldn't do right in front of their parents. Unless your looking for something that fuels the extreme right-wing propaganda machine I would not advise you to purchase this book.

She spent most of her life with her grandma who she will never forget, her mom had a drinking promblem and spent most of her time away from Chamique. Chamique also had a little brother that she took care of. She lived in a apartment with her grandma and brother, she played basketball in the park near her house, while girls were busy brushinhg their hair Chamique was busy beating the boys and practicing. This is a awesome book and if you enjoy watching the WNBA or any basketball you should read this book and learn what it takes to get to the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important contribution","review":"I think this is one of the most important contributions to the anthropology of South Asia in the last twenty years. It rings profoundly true and helps us understand Indian civic identity in a manner unmatched previously in the literature. Mines finds a way to critique Dumont while not forgetting his important contributions. It provides an entirely new way to look at Indian identity and civic life - by thinking of an individuality which is defined by the relationships that a person has with others - but that leaves room for a sense of self. This is important readfing for political scientists, economists, as well as anthropologists, and would also be helpful to those in the development world working on demand-driven approaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"14 inch crash","review":"I thought this was a very good cymbal, has good soundprosgood soundeasy to set upconbreaks easy(not recommended for very hard hitters)UPDATE: this is STILL working GREAT, it now has a few dents but still has great sound quality"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This is a profile of Ting Ling, a Taiwanese swimsuit model. She is a beautiful woman, and the DVD is a collection of low key vignettes showing her on fashion shoots and with her boyfriend with some voice commentary; (in Chinese, with no translation). There are plenty of topless and swimsuit shots and, as stated, she is very attractive. My two big complaints are the low picture quality and high price. It looks like the work of a film student using a basic camcorder and editing equipment. This is not at all consistant with the high price. This DVD would need higher production values and cost half as much to be a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Out of all 700 classical CDs I own, this is my favorite. Opening with St. Paul's Suite (Holst) and ending with the romping sword dance from Warlock's Capriol Suite, this CD is wonderful English string music from beginning to end. It's hard to believe there's only 11 members of the ensemble because of their full sound. The music is gorgeous, the interpretation is lovely, and the recording is clean. It is a must-have for anyone who likes the pieces on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST read for understanding HIPAA","review":"\\"Getting Started With HIPAA\\" brought me a complete understanding of the regulations as well as it's impact on patients, providers, and payers.

I also agree it's primary to \\"teach a man to fish,\\" rather than giving him a fish. Where we part company is how to bring that teaching about. What emerges here is a thin and regurgitated paean to a utopian free-market system, again bending poor old Adam Smith's words to the intent of the privatize/deregulate crowd, while blithely skipping over the infinity of human complexity, actual (as opposed to sanitized and imagined) history, and the recent/current demonstrations of political and fiscal irresponsibility we're shuddering through as we speak.

How annoying to re-live those times in my mind with one of them only to have one of his later tunes then play. a tune made popular (and oftentimes BETTER) by Tom Jones, Ray Price, Perry Como, Glen Campbell, Neil Diamond, Ray Petersen, Sammi Smith, you name it. That's the period when he became a Vegas lounge singer. As for \\"You Gave Me a Mountain\\", check out the ultimate version by Frankie Laine or the one by Marty Robbins (who wrote it).

They simply want a step-by-step plan that just tells them everything to do in detail. If this is your mindset, this book won't work for you. It's more about adjusting self-sabotaging mindsets and worldviews rather than a technical manual for breaking writer's block.I find a great companion for this book is A New Earth.

I'm always up for a great book on writing, creating, and what stops up from reaching that potential, and actually going after what we want or what we are being called to do. What I loved about this book was the simplicity of the concepts and ideas. I also loved the style in how it was presented, in short little blurbs and not long, in-depth chapters. There were so many nuggets of wisdom, that I can't wait to go back and extract them in more depth. I did a lot of underlining, but mostly I read parts and said \\"Humph.... that's interesting.\\" It caused me to really think about my resistance in a different way. When any book gets me to think, I love it. It's a great pocket guide, or book to skim through when you feel you are up against resistance. I definitely recommend it to my book writing clients!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Resistance for Good and Buy Something More Useful","review":"I tried to like this book. It was recommended by a couple of people I really respect, but I hated it. I thought the writing was horrible and to me everything could have been said in a couple of pages instead of dragging it into a \\"book\\".As someone with a love for art and a dozen projects constantly in the works, I constantly struggle with resistance and often lose. Though I can honestly say I feel no more motivated or empowered to overcome resistance than if the author had simply said, \\"Just get off your butt and do it.\\" Because basically that is the answer.To each his own, but this book was a waste of time and money for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much mambo-jambo IMHO","review":"I just don't understand how this book got so many positive reviews. I've read and to me this is way too much esoteric talk saying things about \\"It was resistance!\\" and things like that and very few actual actionable stuff that you can use.Maybe I just didn't get it, but if you are anything like me (not very much into esoteric mambo jambo and like to get the facts) then I would stay away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"War of Art has been tremendous for me, and I feel like it literally saved my writing life. You have to simply read it or get this CD set. Worth every penny! Do not listen to these negative reviewers, they are just using it as Resistance to doing their real work. Read it and you'll know what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book","review":"Pressfield is fantastic. I read and loved Gates of Fire, and when I read the description of this book I knew I would love it too. He's an incredibly reflective and observant individual and writer, and he's able to capture the essence of the internal struggle we all face in our quest for self-fulfillment. He describes in beautiful and accessible language our greatest secret: we're our own biggest obstacle to happiness and self-fulfillment. You should read this book, and anything else by Pressfield you can get your hands on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The coach I've always wanted","review":"I read this book to help me get out of a slump. It worked to help me overcome \\"resistance\\", and move forward in both my writing and music playing. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is one of the best books I have read as a guide to why Art is a struggle and what to do about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gift to the world!","review":"I just returned from the National Speakers Association conference in Phoenix where several people told me to get this book and read it. Wow! Now I understand why! I started the book and read it all the way to the end - I couldn't stop!This book is a must read for anyone who struggles with accomplishing what they know in their heart is their true calling in life. Steven cuts through all the nonsense and gets right to the point.Buy this book, read it, and you will detect (and learn to overcome) whatever has been holding you back from achieving your dreams and real fulfillment in life. I'd write more, but I just finished the book and am off to achieve my own dreams! The only thing more important was to take a moment to let you in on this gem of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm here to buy it for all my friends...","review":"I started reading this book and couldn't put it down - except for the fact that it prompted me to immediate action and I HAD to put it down. The author identified such obvious truths that have gone undercover for way too long. Now that they have been identified and named, they can be overcome and annihilated. This is a 5 star book that I gave 4 stars only due to the sparse vulgar language that keeps it from being as universal as it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Writing","review":"I've taken courses and read books. I've written a couple of lame drafts. I've tried to give up numerous times, but still ended up scribbling bits of stories here and there.But now I have this book which enables me to call the enemy what it is and to understand how it stops me. And to recognize why I must write, so I can kick Resistance to the curb and keep writing.This time is different.Have already read it twice.Buy it. It's that expensive life-coaching session you always kind of toyed with signing up for...but now you can afford it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read!","review":"I happened upon this book at a friend's home and asked to borrow it. I read it in short order and fell in love! The War of Art was to the point, inspiring, thought provoking, encouraging,humorous and exceedingly helpful. It was no coincidence that my eyes fell upon this book. It was precisely what I needed. I consider The War of Art to be a must read for everyone. I have ordered several to give to my immediate friends and family. Everyone has been singing praises about how incredible and on-point the War of Art is and they can't thank me enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Challenge for Artists, Creatives, and Writers","review":"The War of Art was a gem to read. It was full of spiritual connections between God and creative work, coupled with real-life practical ways to work through \\"The Resistance\\" and accomplish your goals.As a writer, I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I also found it to be a relevant read for other areas of my life, including my marriage and the daily grind.Even if you're not an artist, this book is well worth the time of anyone who has been frustrated with procrastination and the roadblocks encountered in achieving your dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Personal Figth with Resistance!","review":"We ALL have those little voices that go like \\"Go do it\\" and \\"Not do not do it\\".This book is phenomenal to help you win over YOU, when you conquer YOU, You win."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight","review":"I thought this was a really good book overall. \\"Book I\\" goes into procrastination, or \\"resistance\\" as the author calls it, and attempts to turn it into a real, physical enemy. \\"Book II\\" attempts to fight that enemy by telling you how a professional over comes it. My only gripe with the book is \\"Book III\\" which gets a little ... out there. I understand the point he's trying to make ( where creativity comes from ) but the way he does it is a little unbelievable.But for the struggling creative person, the person who wants to take that risk, I would definitely suggest this book. If you're made that leap and are struggling with getting things done, this book helps explain why. But if you're looking for more of a \\"getting things done\\" book with actionable steps, I'd get \\"The Now Habit\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"easily read in a couple of hours","review":"I expected more from this book. I found it a bit fluffy with not much in take away ideas or inspirations."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice short listen","review":"I found the about 3 hour audio version online and gave it a couple of listens and enjoyed it. Seeing how popular it is and all the great reviews, I should try listening to it again I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a clear and practical insight","review":"Everyone should read this book. A lot of self help books have great ideas, but The War of Art is the one you need to read to really understand why you are still procrastinating, how to do something about it, and actually get started doing what you have to do.One small criticism: Occasional strong words in the text put me off a bit - I don't think they are necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really insightful. Helps to highlight passages and review often to keep you motivated","review":"Really puts the perspective of Procrastination into a new light.In fact I am avoiding stuff right now by writing this review. So I stop here to go and take care of my Art projects.Toodles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and Inspiring","review":"I enjoyed the very practical approach Steven Pressfield takes towards creating art. He makes it doable - it's just a matter of showing up everyday, whatever form your creativity takes. This book is a quick read, I don't want to say easy, because it takes effort to make the practice happen. I took pause when he talks about the source of inspiration - a point of view I do not agree with, but to each their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"what?","review":"Apparently this is a self-help book. Hard to say.If it has helped some people, good for them. I open it and see nothing but a bunch of self-absorbed, mystical mumbo jumbo. None of it is original, much of it doesn't even make sense.My advice: if you're tempted by all those 5-star reviews, check it out at the library before you buy.There's much, much, better stuff in this genre. You want a recommendation?Improv Wisdom: Don't Prepare, Just Show Up"},{"rating":"1","title":"More about procrastination than creativit","review":"If you have already read psychology books dealing with the topic of procrastination(in this book called resistance), then you might find this book a little bit boring.It is more kind of an essay about this topic from the perspective a professional writer (a person who wants to be creative) than a handbook how to fight it. If you are interested in the topic of procrastination, I would rather recommend to read the chapter about procrastination from the book Feeling Good. Or recently I read the book Power of full engagement, which is addressing this topic as well and offer more tricks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this book","review":"I just recieved this book today and started reading. Easy to read and somewhat poetic. Some of the points the auther makes hit me between the eyes! Similiar I think to Robert Fritz's Book \\"The Path of Least resistance but from a different point of view that I found helpful.I literally could feel my \\"unsullied, uncorrupted, soundproof, waterproof, and bulletproof\\" creative \\"part' as I read..good to know it is still there....Missing (thank God) much of the self help lingo which I have come to dread. I think the author did a fine job on his first \\"self help\\" experiment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good advice followed by kooky philosophy","review":"I'll be honest: if I hadn't been listening to this as an audio book, and if it hadn't been a day when I was working as an extra, I wouldn't have finished this book. Not even close.There is some good, solid advice on craft and discipline in the first few chapters, but then Pressfield starts talking about golf and angels and God and other things which, belief aside, I'm not really interested in. I don't want to hear your kooky opinions or half-baked theories about the nature of the universe. And his implication that cancer is merely a symptom of people's unfulfilled dreams is offensive to anyone who's ever lost a family member to the disease.It's not nearly as bad as Dilbert creator Scott Adams going off the rails, but like I said, if I hadn't been stuck on set with few other entertainment options, I would have dropped it long before the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste you Time or Money on this Crap","review":"I got the CD version of this to listen to in the car - what a waste! If I'd gotten this at a big box store I would return it. I cannot imagine how this drivel got so many 5 stars. Resistance is everything, literally, everything from dirty floors to clinical depression. And yet there is not one substantive suggestion on \\"overcoming\\" resistance beyond sit down and do your work. (Srsly?) There is no Art in this book at any level, the writing itself is poor and even the cover lacks creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battle to Read","review":"Somehow, my purchase of Seth Godin's 'Poke the Box' resulted in this book becoming an Amazon recommendation. I purchased it based on that recommendation. 'Poke the Box' ... enjoyable, cute, and pointed. 'The War of Art' ... way too focused on the publishing world to be a book with a broader general audience. Candidly, I'm disappointed Amazon connected these two books together. There are countless other books with a clearer focus, pointed toward action-driven lives. I liked the concept, and the reviews made me interested. The book disappointed me greatly. I would not recommend this to anyone working in the business world who's looking for that spark. This book doesn't provide it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and at times mindnumbing","review":"The beginning of the section regarding Resistance was interesting but then it seemed to take off into some alternate universe. never really gave any direction on how to deal with or get past the Resistance. Did not find useful at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book Of Drama. Don't Buy This","review":"This book is a wast of money. Don't buy it. The author overly dramatizes art. He feels so much resistance in writing. Well, I guess I would too if I attempt to write a whole book about it. Ok taking aside that I don't agree with what he's saying, this book essentially doesn't contain enough intellectual content. When reading this book, I can feel the author trying very hard to put in as much text as he can into an already saturated topic. A real looser. I want my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"The War of Art.","review":"This is a great book for all those who are working towards something big and extraordinary in their lives.

I thought with all the high ratings it couldn't be that bad. Now, I wish I spent that time reading a really good book! The Author is obsessed with \\"Resistance\\" (with a capital R), which he says every other sentence and is just his special way of saying \\"procrastination.\\" The book is basically about the author's obsession with thinking about being unproductive. Skip this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fear shatterer","review":"A great book if you have reservations about anything holding you back.

Highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't Resist this book","review":"Everyone should read this book. For each person out there uncomfortable with \\"Change\\" and \\"Moving Forward\\" this is the book you should have. It reveals how procrastination hinders our lives from reaching our true goals, creativity, karma. Just read the book and see yourself in all your glory and learn something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for creative people","review":"This book was written for me.

That is this book.It's the inspiration and the kick in the butt I need. The advice my father tried to give me but I never understood.The one-star reviews here are hilarious. Resistance in action!Note: If you don't like swearing (as I don't) then be prepared for some, including at least one f-bomb. But read the book anyway. It's not a vulgar book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inspiration for anyone facing a stumbling block","review":"This is a must-read for any writer, artist, athlete or anyone else who's struggling to overcome fear and resistance in order to do something great.The book won't give you a ton of practical advice on how to do it, but it will help you understand the feelings and fear that are keeping you from it. And it will inspire you to push past it.The last section of the book gets a little strange and spiritual. Some might find it \\"out there\\" a bit, but if you can open your mind and understand what the author is trying to get across, I think you'll still find he makes some good points.As a writer, this book has been recommended to me so many times I felt I had to read it. It didn't disappoint. Everyone should read it so they can understand how they sabotage themselves and stop doing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the war of art","review":"Fantastic !To the point, no babble!Anyone who could use an understandingof what's going on in their headand how to get beyond itmust read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Valuable (short), then tedious (long)","review":"How many stars for a valuable 8-page article surrounded by a repetitive 165-page book?Two--because the breathless style, the preachy overstatement, and the thoughtless repetition became so irritating by page 65.Read the first eight pages in the library or bookstore (or in-flight magazine)."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't argue with it","review":"if you sit down and read this book with a skeptical view, it will change you! Everything in this book is written in a way and broken down that is so logical, you cannot argue with it.

Find the detailed explanation throughout this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"Started reading this because I have been contemplating writing lately, yet just can't seem to get started. This book helped to clear a lot of the problems that I was facing (mostly myself apparently). If you have any interest in beginning a project or are stuck read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and Well Written","review":"This book is inspiring, especially so if you happen to be an aspiring writer or other artist. The ideas are expressed in a motivational yet practical way, and I loved the conciseness.You have to love someone who has a viewpoint, and delivers it without pause or doubt. Steven says something here, and as I read I got the genuine feeling that he 'needed' to say it, to get it out there. In my view, that's what makes an author interesting.While I did not share some of the author's perspectives, I really didn't mind due to his unassuming and authentic way of expressing himself.If I could speak to the minority of people reading this review who are aspiring writers, but haven't been published yet. Read this book. You WILL wind up recommending it to others, it's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book from a Talented Author","review":"I enjoyed Pressfield's Gates of Fire, Tides of War, the Afghan Campaign - then I found this, and much to my delight, he shares his views on being creative - not simply being an author, but being an effective human in life. I loaned the book to a friend, who liked it so much I bought her a copy as a gift. Pressfield's talent doesn't just go to the very well researched historical fiction; this work is motivational and succinct enough that it makes a very good audio book. Well worth reading (or listening to) for a change of pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resistance is so powerful! Read this to get through it in writing.","review":"A friend of mine reccommended this book and I am glad he did. I am a writer at heart even though I never knew I was, this book gave me the courage to start writing and overcome the resistance he talks about. No matter what your resistance is you can get some great methods and insights from Pressfield. Put it this way, I am a note taker and highlighter with post-it flags, this book has dozens protruding through the edges!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The War Of Art","review":"Not only is this the best book on the creative process I've ever read, it is also a great work on the nature of Good and Evil. Even though it deals with aspects of the spirt, it is no-nonsense, down to earth and immensely practical. Read a sentence, get inspired, and get to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop doing the laundry and read this book!","review":"This book just made me laugh in recognition. No hand holding here, just plain truth and a good swift kick. An excellent read!When doing the laundry feels more urgent than working, you know you're dealing with resistance. We've all been there and you'll see yourself repeatedly in this book of entertaining and insightful essays.You will be inspired to take your work seriously, move beyond your resistance, and become prolifically creative.On my \\"buy it, get it from the library or skip it\\" scale, this is a definite buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I read the reviews on this book and was pretty excited. Well, I'm very disappointed. The author comes off as a complaining whiner who lists a bunch of obvious bad things and gives no advice on conquering them.

It's all about dealing with resistance, which is a hard thing to get past. Easy to read and lots of good information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful for Certain People","review":"If you are already a motivated person, there is no reason to read this book. If you have trouble dealing with procrastination, this book will definitely help you out! The author pinpoints exactly what keeps creative people from being creative and inspires you to tackle any obstacle in your way. Artists who only work when inspired, or who have trouble committing to a schedule will find this book useful. People who are already hard at work will not find any new ideas that they didn't already know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish","review":"I just can't get through this. It is obvious that the author has a major problem with procrastination but labeling it \\"the resistance\\" and having three or more references to \\"the resistance is\\" on almost every page takes me nowhere.Where you taking me Steven? Gods and goddesses, wars and battles, Jung, Madonna, fluff on one page (\\"the Muse lights on our shoulder like a butterfly\\") and f-words on the next?And what kind of book is this anyway? One or two paragraphs per page? Like a thought for the day calendar or a blog. Is this art? If this writing is a work of art then I'm the guy scratching his head in the gallery saying \\"I don't get it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unseless rambling and blank pages","review":"Honestly, this is one of the most useless and poorly written books I've ever had the misfortune to waste money on in a long time. The only good advice the author gives is to dedicate yourself to your art, and keep at it every day. Make it a priority. There, I saves you the cost of the book! The rest is nonsensical rambling interspersed with full and half-blank pages. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time!","review":"Even though you can read it in a sitting, it's not worth your time. The author's \\"big\\" idea is this:Carve out time to be creative!Any creative person dedicated to their craft already knows this. You already know that sometimes the last thing you want to do is sit down, write, paint, and create. You would be much better served ACTUALLY CREATING than wasting your time reading a book that doesn't tell you anything you don't already know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I was expecting this to be a real winner by reading the reviews.It was actually a dud! There are a few gems in the material, but it's hardly worth the postage.Perhaps if you find it at a yard sale for 50cents!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Resistance","review":"The author starts off really strong about the effect of resistance, along with some great insight on moving forward. Then in the middle of the book he comes apart at the seams, rambling on about muses and angles, artists and the rest of the pathetic world of non-artists. The end picks up with some good ideas. I'm glad I read it. Wouldn't give it as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good affirmations, heavily padded with a lot of new-age garbage.","review":"I honestly do not know why or how this has so many five star reviews. First thing is first; this is not a book. It's a bloated inspirational pamphlet. It's about 120 pages, with most pages only containing one or two paragraphs.(not-so-cleverly aping the style of Sun Tzu's The Art of War) I like the writer's concept of \\"The Resistance\\" (a.k.a. writer's block) However, from early on he begins injecting a lot of very generic and pseudo-spiritual buzzwords and phrases. Some parts of the book come off almost like Scientology indoctrination. I'm sure there are a lot of people who found this a great motivational tool, but I'm sure they would have just as easily gotten the same fulfillment from reading \\"The Secret\\" or anything Tony Robbins has written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid book","review":"Really changes the way you look at and approach art.

It is one to read over and over again. I stumbled upon a copy years ago and each time I pick it up, I learn something new. Many thanks to Steven Pressfield for writing this very valuable, uplifting, \\"meaning of life\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If THE OFFICE's David Brent wrote a book on creativity...","review":"...it would be this.Ugh, just a book of empty words, poor prose, and cliches. Fortunately it was short. I have no idea how it has so many 5-star reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Described","review":"I immediately felt deceived after opening my order. As I looked at the book, the upper right corner appeared to be chewed up by, what I'm guessing to be, a dog. The first half of the book's pages, while still completely readable, were torn, bitten off, and looked far below \\"good condition\\". In the overall appearance, this book looks below average and would not be aesthetically pleasing on a shelf.Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't care for this book","review":"I don't really like this book or the format or maybe it's his voice in the writing. I suppose based on what I've read so far this is just another form of procrastination? I'm sure it's helpful to others, this is just my opinion at this point of my journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accessible, Inspirational Writing!","review":"I'm glad I ordered this book as I found that as soon as I had received it I could not put it down. I subscribe to Steven Pressfield's blog and don't always agree with what he has to say, however I found this slim tome quite relevant to my everyday life and how procrastination often gets in the way. I would recommend this book to friends, especially those with an artistic inclination. I would also recommendThe Artist's Wayby Julia Cameron. This book runs along the same lines, but it gives more practical advice about how to overcome blocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlock your creativity through discipline and by reading this book!","review":"If you are in the creative filed you must read this book!Understand why there are those who make it and those who don't make it in the creative industry.Best book I read in 2012."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivational and Inspirational - time to take a look in the mirror","review":"This book is a splendid trove of observational tidbits about the forces which impact peoples' personalities, particularly when it comes to being motivated. Broken into three easy-to-read sections, the author uses a fabulous range of vocabulary as he shares his insights about \\"Resistance\\", the clever antagonist which strives to keep people from achieving what they were put on Earth to achieve.He shares his personal stories about times of strife as a writer in an open and inviting manner.This book does not offer an \\"action plan\\", as many other self-help books do. Instead, it offers guidance and promotes self-reflection to take a look in the mirror- where you will undoubtedly see... the face of \\"Resistance\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Inspiration!","review":"Steven Pressfield has a way with words that convey to our hidden abilities to rise. Taking his experience and understanding resistance is the way to press through to achieve your own. A must read for all.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Any Creative Personality.","review":"If you're looking for the words to motivate and inspire your to do your creative work, then you've found the right book. Pressfield is right. Overcoming resistance is a war, a war where victory can mean a better world and a better life. So buy this book if you do any creative or humanitarian work and find yourself doubting or procrastinating. You won't be disappointed. Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jumpstart for the Creative Mind","review":"The epic battle between resistance and creativity is the topic of this short but powerful book. Witty, provocative and honest encouragement are given to step out of chosen distractions into a daily life of one's true purpose. Art doesn't need to wait on inspiration. The wait is for the artist to come out of hiding amongst the mundane and do what is necessary continually to bring forth work. This book was recommended to me by another artist who has springboarded into a productive career as a result of the simple ideas presented in this book. I now recommend it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bootcamp for Artists","review":"I found this book very useful. Unlike most 'self-help' books it does not try to 'nurture' the inner 'damaged- artist', help you to search for your undiscovered talents or get you to start journaling, this is a bootcamp for Artists!There are no excuses. This is it. The writer explains in direct language that there is always going to be resistance and the sooner we accept that fact we can arm ourselves and fight it like any other enemy that wants to attack us and prevent us from living the life we desire.Steven fully understands the cunning skills that resistance can employ to keep us from being where we want to be and then clearly explains the reasons that it exists and how, by understanding it, we can fight it and become the artist that we crave to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivating","review":"This book did motivate me to pursue my artistic endeavors more consistently, especially the last few pages. however, I was disappointed to see that the author felt the need to sprinkle profanity here and there to get his point across. Pressfield primarily focuses on our battle with resistance and gives practical information on how to go about conquering this enemy. I just wish he could have resisted the use of vulgar words to accomplish his artistic pursuit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book!!","review":"The War of Art is one of the best books ! It is down to earth, full of wisdom, and very informative. It brings new insights into the age-old problem of creative blocks, how to address the blocksand realize your full creative potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides an understanding of that feeling in the pit of your stomach","review":"Read this book twice I loved it so much.

It will make even more sense reading it this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"As fierce as it gets","review":"I have purchased ten copies of this book, and I imagine I will be ordering more, to give to all of my artist friends. This is a powerful book that inspires the reader to take bold leaps in their creative journeys...it has become my artistic manifesto!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A few too many religious connotations for me","review":"As someone who wants to write but struggles, this book seemed like it might be right up my alley. Unfortunately I found it a bit too oblique to be much use.It essentially characterises your writer's block and lack of motivation as this powerful force called 'resistance' that is apparently lurking everywhere and trying to distract us and hold us back at every corner. Even ignoring the obvious biblical connotations of that, it's a bit too dramatic for me.The word 'angel' crops up quite often too, and while the author does briefly touch on the fact that you can substitute that word for muse if you're not a believer, it doesn't change the overall feeling and direction of the book.In terms of content, I found the book pretty short, and lacking on actual practical advice. There's a few useful tips scattered throughout, but all in all it wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resistance Meets its Match in The Muse","review":"I read this book all the way through in one sitting. Now I look forward to starting all over again--immediately.Mr. Pressfield delivers good and bad news for writers. The bad news: Our creative impulses will always meet palpable Resistance. We must learn to identify and do battle daily with Resistance in all its forms.The good news: Our Muse stands close by to aid. But Mr. Pressfield makes it clear she prefers to help those who help themselves. More drill sergeant than neurasthenic nymph, the Muse holds artists to a hard-line work ethic and doesn't suffer whiners.A former Marine, the author also believes in healthy discipline. \\"The Marine Corps teaches you how to be miserable,\\" he writes. \\"This is invaluable for an artist.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best ever written on what it means to be Creative.","review":"This is a MUST read for anyone engaged in pursuing a career as a creative. Whether you're an artist, writer, director, or designer, Mr. Pressfield takes a no-nonsense approach and shares his own struggle in finding out exactly what he was meant to do. For me personally, this book changed my life, inspired me to continue listening to the inner voice even when you hear the word \\"no\\" a million times or you begin to doubt your ability to derive income from your art. What makes this even more fantastic is Mr. Pressfield is a great writer. One can almost feel the fine tuning, the crafting of this book and the critical editing that honed each chapter into a great read and a focus you don't see in most memoirs or other books on being creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant","review":"This book has some wonderful photos, mostly repetitve and the captions even more so. However, depending on how fanatical you are, the different locos and their appointments are detailed. I could only take so much repitition on Southern's pride in their green locos, polished bells and shiny cylinder covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gospels","review":"The Cornerstone Biblical Commentary on Matthew-Mark uses the text of the New Living Translation. It is just the kind of commentary that a busy pastor can appreciate. Using first rate scholars, it it solid in exegesis, clear in explanation, and concise in commentary. Without a large investment in time, you can walk away with the information you need to put together a lesson or a sermon. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking, not a fan of the sound.","review":"These pipes are a great product. They look great and were very easy to install on my 81 CM400C. The double stand would hit the chain due to the pipe being only on one side and not both. They do give you a bracket to stop the double stand from chain rub but it is just a peice of steal that bolts behind the passenger peg. No re-jetting or carb adjustments were required. I really like these pipes but hate the sound. Best way to describe the sound is a 16 year olds $300 Honda civic with a $400 exhaust. Just not the sound I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment and Unfairness","review":"What a letdown! I, too, had hoped for a boxed set at a reasonable price. The Roloffs are a marvelous family, and their adventures are such treats amid alternate programming riddled with sex and profanity. To see what these people have made of their lives is truly inspirational, and the work that Matt does for the benefit of little people everywhere is nothing short of admirable. For TLC to market their shows in this disgusting, capitalizing way is a real slap in their faces, a bold statement that their work is not considered important enough to market for any purpose other than greed, i.e. another blatant injustice thrown in their paths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bloody Likely!","review":"I too have been waiting patiently for a season release of 'Little People, Big World' - an excellent TV show.What an absolute let down, to discover that one is expected to purchase each episode individually and to the tune of over $20 each.As much as I love this show, I would never consider parting with such a huge amount of money for a single TV episode. The cost of collecting the entire season this way, amounts to an astronomical price.A totally unreasonable way of marketing this product, in my opinion. I'm very disappointed. Hopefully the distributors will reconsider their strategy and make availabe an entire season set at a reasonable price. I for one, will certainly not consider purchasing this show on DVD otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made in USA!","review":"I have no review of the product because I immediately shipped it back to amazon for a full refund upon it's arrival due to the fact that it is not made in USA as described, but rather made in Indonesia. This should be changed on this website, but in case they don't, I'm here to inform you all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Grill Cover","review":"I gave this grill cover as a gift to my Mom who is a dedicated Steeler fan. While I will admit this isn't the most heavy duty cover ever made it did survive for two years at my parents place. My thought is that the white reflected the light better than a darker color which seems to be the standard cover color on most grills. It's fun and for the price held up for a reasonable amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality, Weight and Style!","review":"I am always being asked, \\"Where did you buy your ring at?\\" and even the people at the store \\"Hot Topic\\" ask me where i got mine at.

I don't know the exact weight of it, but its quite heavy and as i mentioned before, eye catching. The feel is something you should look forward to.Price; Perfect. Thats all there really is to say about that. Well, that, and i wish i could go back in order a second one at the time.All in all, if you are considering this as a addition to your ring collection, look no further.

The only thing to keep in mind is that whent eh power goes out you must reset the timer. This timer comes on at dusk and stays on the number of hours desired.

The deep rich tones of the cello combined with the absolutely unique sounds of guitjo make this an truly unique CD. I am sending it this year as gifts to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Perfection!","review":"Live To DanceHannah and Joe are very talented musicians. Their music touches your soul. I find it difficult to put words to my feelings in regards to the wonderful cello and guitar sounds I hear. The music ranges from classical to new age, and celtic to spanish. Put on any of their CD's, grab a glass of wine and settle down in a comfortable sofa. The music will lift your mood and allow you to relax and take a break from the stress around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good book","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer, this book is a great book for kids and it's also great for newbie adults too. I've read at least a dozen investment books and some just give you lots of data (that you don't really care about/understand) and others don't leave you with steps or anything that you can apply in a practical way. I found this book easy to read and if I had a kid I would sit and read it with him/her. Currently, I recommend this book to my friends who are also starting to invest/take control of their finances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Teens to Adults","review":"This is a great book that I bought for 13 & 16 yr olds, but I learned stuff too! The back of the book says it's for ages 9 & up, but I don't believe there's a 9 yr old on the planet that is ready or willing to delve in the intricacies of mutual funds and compound interest. Otherwise, I think the info is presented in clear-speak without being condescending and I wish I had received such a book as a teenager. Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too great","review":"This was obviously made before Blank's \\"Tae-Bo Inc.\\" was set in motion and Tae-Bo became the phenom it is today. I feel I should have just paid more and bought Tae-Bo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This was the worst work out video I have ever paticipated in. In a word, confusing. I've done this tape nearly 5 times, and I still can't follow it. To get a good workout, you need boxing gloves, and the video focuses entirely too much on the women. (particularly the arrogant blonde) I felt ripped off. I wanted to tone my body, and I felt like I hadn't done a full workout. Clicking the buttons on the remote took more energy than the video. I've never tried the new package, but after this disasterous video, I really don't want to try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This tape is confusing and not nearly as fun as the Basic.","review":"I bought this tape and now I am not sure it is even a real Tae Bo tape. Look on the Tae Bo website. There are no clear instructions. Nothing like the Basic Tae Bo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I expected","review":"I have tried the series of 4 other videos I love the energy I recieved from working out with the video. I purchaced this video and was extremly disappointed with it I was expecting some thing more along the lines of the other videos. How can I get a refund. Andrea"},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick workout but not for beginners","review":"I have the Taebo tapes and participate in a class at the gym- and those options are better than using this video. The video is not good for beginners as the moves are not explained, and the participants do exercises/stretches before Billy explains them so it feels as though you are behind. Also his count is off. If you are familiar with Taebo this tape can serve as a quick workout. It is divided into 2 sections and are can be used alone or in combination depending on your time. It is also not as strenuous as the Taebo tapes. So if you have an injury or can't shower after exercising, this tape is also an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Though this workout is inexpensive, it's still not worth it.","review":"This video appears to be a low-budget screening for participants in the more advertised Tae-Bo Workout video set (evidenced by a much less fit particpant that's in the Tae-Bo Workout). Explanations for moves are slow-coming while the people in the background are doing the moves. By the time Billy Blanks gets done with the explanation, they're done doing the move. The tape is also not as motivating and is not a good workout. Overall, I didn't feel like I accomplished anything while doing this video. I don't even feel like I worked out. This video is not worth the money I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This","review":"This is really a horrible workout video. I don't think Billy Blanks had ever done the routine in the tape before it was made. Most of the time he couldn't follow along with all the people behind him or he'd be telling them to do something and they'd be doing something else. I just follow them anyway. This tape includes two workouts that are both very short considering the long warm-ups and cool-downs. The same moves from Tae bo are used in this workout, but there's only time for about one repetition of each. You can get some cardio workout from this tape (if you do the whole thing at once skipping the cool down of the first and the warm up of the second, but that's annoying) however, you don't get any of the toning of the \`normal' tae bo workouts. Skip this and head straight to the other non-crunch tae bo workouts which are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Billy's Best Work","review":"I love kickboxing and tae bo . . . I have several different tapes that I use. This tape was one big mistake. The workout has no continuity, the camera work is awful, and Billy moves so fast that I had no idea what he was doing. I would recommend Billy's Blanks Tae Bo series before I would ever recommend this tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This video left me wondering when the real workout was going to start! It consisted of 2 short kickboxing workouts, the first of which you don't even break a sweat. The second workout was a little better but I had to do a bit more jumping around and more repetitions than they did. I found it very strange that Billy Blanks doesn't even instruct for most of the video..the people in the background are doing the moves. It seemed very hastily made and I'm disapointed that I spent money on this! I don't think I'll be purchasing other Billy Blanks videos anytime soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"I need something a bit more challenging than this. Talk about boring...i'm so ticked I wasted my money...too slow didn't break a sweat and definetly not energetic. Billy just doesn't have a \\"pump you up\\" attitude in this video. It's BLAH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to get motivated","review":"It took me 3 months to finally get going and this video was a great way to start. There was enough of a warm up and slow down to satisfy my aching muscles (I am not very athletic), and now that I have mastered this tape, I am ready for the higher aerobic impact of the advanced video. If it helped to motivate me, it can for anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!","review":"I own the complete set of Tae-Bo tapes. This one is by far the worst of the series. You never really get a chance to get into the workout. He always cuts off the exercise before you feel any of its benefits. I reiterate, Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you expect a workout","review":"This tape shows the very basic moves in Taebo. It is choreographed with advanced students and there is little instruction. It does not provide a proper warm up or cool down and spends too little time on the actual combinations. I would not recommend this tape - to do it live - much more fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you Taebo ... you'll hate this video!!","review":"For anyone who already \\"TaeBo's\\" this is not the same. The video is pre-coreographed and VERY hard to follow. The workout is not nearly as good even if you can manage to halfway follow the moves! The people in the video aren't really used to \\" taeboing\\" anyway. Save your money and buy more Taebo videos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I have the Tae Bo videos and this tape does not compare to them. If you want a workout spend $35 for the real Tae Bo not this Crunch series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment:(","review":"I have the four Tae Bo tapes from the infomercial, I have quite a few Crunch fitness tapes and enjoy the morning Crunch show on ESPN2. So I decided to purchase this video and thank goodness I only spent $10. The editing is poor, there is minimal instruction and the cameras were more on Shannon Tweed, in the Kickology segment, than on Billy Blank's or the whole class in general.What a waste of time and energy. Buyer's beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Video","review":"The whole thing seemed very poorly done. There seemed to be no rehearsal and it just didn't flow. Also, it didn't even make me sweat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very choppy, to much instruction, not enough workout","review":"The whole video seemed as if it were teaching you the steps, but it left me waiting for the workout to begin. Too bad the tape was over then."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad and irresponsible","review":"There are so many things wrong with this video. First of all, could they not have rehearsed before shooting? Could there not have been a warm up (and for that matter a cool down)? Whatever happened to the rule, what you do to one side you have to do to the other? I have never seen so much make-up in a workout video (and I don't just mean the women).There is no flow so for the most part you march in place while trying to figure out what to do next because there are no instructions to follow. This video is so irresponsible it should be illegal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on the other Tae-Bo workouts, I had higher expecations","review":"This workout was underwhelming. I have done the Tae Bo basic workout and was looking for something harder. Blanks spends about half of the time for each routine teaching you how to do it then does one set. On the basic video, he does many sets until it burns. At the end he shows you a few moves to defend yourself, enough to get yourself killed in a fight. I thought the poor reviews I read before buying this video might have been from the company that does the Tae-Bo videos, but after seeing it for myself, I will stick to the more expensive series of his workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST WORKOUT VIDEO EVER!","review":"This workout video is a joke! The group is obviously being led by someone behind the camera. The whole time they are doing their own thing with Billy \\"walking it out\\" most of the time not to mention they only do 8 reps of everything so you don't even get winded and I am not in that great of shape. The thermostat must be cranked up to 90 degrees because everyone in the video is sweating profusely and I know it would take a lot more than that to get them that sweaty because they are all in fantastic shape and as I stated before I barely broke a sweat. Bottom line don't waste your money! There are a lot of other great workouts out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Silly","review":"I bought this tape because I had heard so many great things about tae bo. I thought that it would at least give me a taste of the tae bo workout so I would know whether or not to buy it...unfortunately...I feel like I shouldn't buy it now. I have heard that it isn't nearly as good as tae bo, now that i own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy the real Tae Bo!","review":"There is little to no cueing or instruction in this tape, even Billy Blanks himself (at his web site) does not suggest buying it. Obviously Crunch Fitness is just trying to market off his name. Where the Tae Bo videos may not be the cheapest, this is a waste of $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know what to think","review":"I recently purchased the two-pack TaeBo workout and also bought the Crunch video at the same time. I didn;t open it because I was going to see how I liked the TaeBo workouts first. Well, I think the Crunch workout was dated by Amazon to have been made this year, i think it was made before the TaeBo workouts, I looked up the TaeBo web-site and they even said that the Crunch was NOT in the TaeBo series and that people shouldn't think of it as one of the series just because Billy Blanks is on the cover. He didn't really teach it right, the moves were the same, but you can see he was less experienced in Crunch than he was in TaeBo, his instructions were very unclear and he didn't seem to be confident in teaching it. It was my own fault for not consulting the TaeBo web-site to see what I should have gotten. I wish I could return it now (my curiosity got to me and I opened the Crunch tape)."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay workout -- but no magic.","review":"The Tae-Bo Crunch workout video does not live up to the hype. Both the Kickology workout and the Tae Boxing workout are difficult to follow -- even for experienced video exercisers. Billy Blanks spends more time talking and not enough time leading the class. Although I worked up a sweat, I plan to limit my Tae-Bo workout to once a week -- otherwise it may become frustrating and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied customer","review":"I was very dissatisfied with this tape. I purchased this tape because I have heard good things about Billy Blanks and was interested in his series of tapes. I would not recommend this tape. I never seen a workout tape in which the instructor did not do the exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst possible workout imaginable.","review":"I purchased this video in the expectation that it would be as beneficial and exciting as the Tae-Bo tapes Billy Blanks had released. It was a tremendous disappointment. It wasn't a workout at all. It was reminiscent of an old disco show featuring the Solid Gold Dancers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unorganized, Ill-prepared and just plain horrible.","review":"I was really disappointed. This tape totally lacked organization. While Billy was trying to explain one form of exercise, the class behind him was doing something totally different and by the time I got used to the exercise, they went one to something else. At times, even Billy seemed confused because periodically he had to look back and see what the class was doing. Furthermore, I did the whole tape and still did not feel like a had a workout. What a waste of ten bucks, I mean I coulda just had a V-8."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent workout...great for an introduction to tae bo","review":"I really enjoyed Billy Blank's style of working out. Billy keeps the audience involved and is wonderful for those of us who normally have difficulty 'keeping up' with other workout tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and encouraging!","review":"Although I have not bought too many other work-out tapes, I enjoyed this one. I have tried a few of my mothers and I just find them so boring and I never really cared enough to do the moves. I could offer many suggestions to make this tape better, but all in all I enjoyed it. I did work up a sweat and I do feel it afterward. I enjoy the whole fighting philosophy. It totally relieved some aggression and I eagerly waited for the next moves. Brings out your anger and then let's you beat it out on \\"someone\\" without anyone getting hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Tae Bo at the Gym!","review":"I bought this tape because I had heard so much about Tae Bo. I tried the tape, then did a 1 hour tae bo workout at my club. What a difference! The Club workout was more intense (25 minutes is not nearly enough) was better choreographed and the instructor's instructions could actually be understood.This video is hard to follow. It is difficult to figure out what he wants you to do, and the camera shots don't help. Half the time, the camera is not even on Billy when he is explaining what to do, it is on someone in the class. There is virtually no warm up, not nearly enough stretching. Be sure to stretch on your own first.I bought this because I thought the 2 video pack was a bit pricey. What a mistake. Now I plan to buy the \\"real\\" video set soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to write home about","review":"I have Billy's Tae Bo tapes and absolutely LOVE them, but this one leaves alot to be desired! I thought this would be a different form of workout (cuz it was supposedly made in 1999) to kinda spice things up a little, but you could tell there must've been a huge mirror on the other side of the camera cuz the women couldn't stop looking at themselves and making what they thought to be sexy poses in the camera that they even would loose their place in the \\"workout\\"! They looked like they just got out of the hair salon with enough makeup on Tammy Faye would be embarrassed. The REAL tae bo workout tapes with those people on them, are TRULY working out and not afraid of getting sweaty. The techniques were good in this one, if you can get past the egos and silliness. Also, what was up with the dancing??"},{"rating":"1","title":"get the real tae bo series","review":"While this might be a different workout and all.. this is DEFINATELY a far cry from the real tae bo workout...Even Billy Blanks himself said on his tae bo website website not to buy this tape. the other tae bo tape is much better. sure its more expensive...but its more worth the money than this little 10 buck tape..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"The only person in this video who knew the routine was Billy. Everyone else fumbled along. And by the time you figured out his move, he'd change and go to the next one. Then there was the couple of gals who not only didn't know what they were doing, I think they were actually flirting with the camera men. This video was a complete waste of time. Try the Crunch Abs and Arms for a better workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"After working out to the Basic and Live versions of Tae Bo I wanted to try a little more variety with Tae Boxing. What I found was extremely disappointing. Although it started off with some good stretching, the workout itself was very unstructured. There were not enough repetitions of any combination to make it feel like an exercise program. It seemed more like an extended teaching session."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy for a laugh, not for a workout...","review":"This video has the worst coordination I've ever seen! Althoughthis music was better than his Tae Bo videos, it was apparent thatthis was one of his first videos and it was not edited properly. It was more comical than physically beneficial.I am a big Tae Bo fan and found this video highly disappointing. It is hard to follow (even if you rewind and go back - who the heck wants to do that when you're trying to sweat?) because he explains some moves and not others. Not to mention the fact that he gets you all revved up and then stops at 4 reps of an exercise. The video is shot from bizarre angles that make it difficult to tell what the heck is going on, and he moves way too fast. I have been doing Tae Bo for a long time and was not able to follow this video - it is not among his best work.If you want a good laugh, see this video...but don't buy it or rent it to use as exercise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not safe","review":"Many of the warm-up moves,eg.(Fast Head Rolls and arm circles) are not physicaly safe for the average participant. During the cardio workout and the floor workout, I believe the video should have been previewed by a physiotherapist,and or a professor in Kineseology or by anyone in the professional fitness industry.Safety should come first, and some of the movements are done too fast for the average or even fit participant to execute properly without prolonged injuries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed!!","review":"I have taken tae bo class and really enjoyed it, so when the class ended I thought I would try Billie Blanks Crunch, but what a joke, it's very hard to follow, he changes to new movements so quickly and never emphasizes switching sides. I definitely didn't feel the fatigue in my body compared to the class I took."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I totally agree with others who gave this video a poor review. One person mentioned that by the second part the background people were on \\"auto pilot\\", without any introduction of what the heck we were doing. It was hard to keep up and Billy didn't really seem to know the correct and reasonable time in the music to start the reps, so a couple times it was off the beat which got annoying. It was sort of bizarre how right after the warm up the people on the video were sweating like pigs, and I wasnt even winded yet. When he DOES decide to explain the moves, he spends so much time doing them slowly and then only does it like once fast. He seemed to like to show off too, all his fancy kicks and such, and I can't get through the beginning without cracking up, where the camera goes down the people in the line, and ends on him with that robe thing on and he says in this serious voice all the stuff about \\"kickology\\" and stuff. Its a bad video, dont buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"This video is very poorly produced. It is not a good workout for even the intermediate exerciser. Many times Billy is just standing there and you have to try to figure out what the rest of the group is doing. There is not enough repetitions of any set of exercises to make it truly effective. There is not good cueing...which I'm sure you'd get used to after viewing it several times, but it's just not worth it. Even my 10 year old was disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Follow","review":"While I enjoy Tae Bo videos from Billy Blanks, this one is not only difficult to follow, but very choppy. Billy doesn't lead the class; he throws the viewer off because the class is doing a workout without any direction as to how many reps they're doing or what's next, all the while, Billy is talking. Add to it poor filming (I'd rather see technique rather than how cute someone is) and you've got a workout video not designed for the less graceful or coordinated. Still, Billy Blanks knows his Tae Bo and the last part of the video is a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tae Bo video available!","review":"As a Fitness & Nutrition Specialist, I truly believe this workout video is a great buy. Not only is it available at a great price, but it also gives you such a wonderful workout. Unlike the Tae Bo tapes in his Tae Bo series, this video offers a good amount of stretching for warming up and cooling down, which helps to prevent injury.I think that Billy Blanks has had bad reviews due to the strain involved in the workouts in his Tae Bo series. They don't offer nearly as much stretching or emphisis on proper form as this video does.Save money and time buying this video instead of the ones from his series, and you'll be on your way to a stronger and toned body!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN! FUN! FUN! This video is fun and works great!!!","review":"I'm 14 years old and got this video as a gift. At first it was hard to do but then I watched it a few times and learned what I had to do. Now I try to do it everyday. I liked the kickboxing part so much I'm taking a kickboxing class this winter. It's not only fun it works. I have flatter abs and it tones your body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tae-bo WHAT? I stepped in place for 30 minutes.","review":"I purchased this tape with the impression that is was going to be a high-energy, challenging, fast-paced workout. Well, it was energetic. It was challenging to follow due to MAJOR lack of instruction. Banks neglected to instruct the proper positions on many sets. It was extremely difficult to follow and I found myself lost. I liked regular tae-bo and wanted a quick tape for variety....this Definately is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good, solid workout tape! A great addition.","review":"This is a very solid workout tape. The first workout is focused more on the body with several punch and kick combinations. All of these are fresh and fun to do. And I can feel results. Do like Billy Blanks says and use a pound wait in each hand and really focus on throwing good punches. I've been doing Tae Bo videos (original and live) and this is a welcome addition. I like this video alot, it works, and it teaches you some combinations you can also practice when the tape is off. Why people have given this poor reviews I do not know. The moves are easy to follow and Billy gives excellent cues and directions. This is a serious work out tape at a value price. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible-- could have been done better","review":"It's awful. Just awful. Don't waste your time and money. I've heard good things about Billy, so I know he can do better. Try Crunch: Boot Camp instead. It's a very fun workout, and you WILL work up a good sweat in 30 minutes. Plus the instructor is actually instructing you and not just standing in front of her class. A much better buy than this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Tae-Bo video I've seen","review":"In this video, Billy Blanks spends more time performing for the viewers than leading a good workout. He does not do even repetitions for both sides and relys on his background exercises to lead the workout. Most of the time, he does not cue as to what's coming next. If you do not the difference between a jab and an upper cut, this video is not for you. His Tae-Bo videos are far more effective and instructional than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot.","review":"I rented this video because I wanted to get a peek before I purchased. What a disappointment. Blanks didn't even bother to do the exercises most of the time. He did one or two reps, and then just watched the others. It was boring too. I don't see how you can expect for people at home to get into the workout, when the guy leading the thing doesn't. Glad I didn't buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Blanks at his worst!","review":"Normally, I love Tae-Bo and everything about Billy Blanks' strategies. However, this video is a huge disappointment.I workout with his other videos, as well as doing Pilates, yoga and the treadmill. I use these videos to spice up my workouts, and give me a change of pace. This particular example is very short-- each workout is only about 25 minutes. There are minimal repetitions with each move he teaches (say, 8-10 for each move). This is hardly enough time to feel the impact of the exercise, let alone move on!The participants are uncoordinated, and confusing, as they continue to do the move after Billy Blanks has moved on to the next position.If you are used to Tae-Bo, and think this video will be a nice detour from the usual, choose a different tape. This one is hands-down, the least effective workout video I've bought in a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible video","review":"This video is 45 minutes long, but it's 2 separate workouts containing 2 warm ups and 2 cool downs. The first segment is not a workout, I have to use weights to even begin to benefit from it. The 2nd workout is really annoying. Billy's cueing is horrible and he rarely does any of the moves himself, and when he does, often, it's not what the class is doing. He only repeats moves 4 to 8 times, so without good cueing, I find myself just getting the move right when they're back to marching in place. I have really liked the other Crunch fitness tapes a have, they're usually a good short workout, but don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you might expect","review":"I have a used the Tae Bo tapes and was enthused to find out Crunch had a similar video. Unfortunately, this is a very different video. It is slow to start and hard to follow. It cuts away at key moments of instruction. At the end of the video, I was left wondering where it would begin. I didn't feel like I had worked out at all and was highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Not Part of the TAE BO series","review":"I got roped into buying this tape after feeling great doing the Tae Bo basic video. It's not the same production company and I'm certain the outdated footage is an embarrassment to Billy Blanks. He probably waived his rights and some hucksters trying to catch some $$$ cash jumped on the Tae Bo bandwagon and spliced this garbage together. DON'T BUY IT, GET THE ADVANCED TAE BO TAPE FROM THE REAL SERIES. You'll be happy you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU EXPECT BILLY BLANKS REAL TAE-BO...DON'T BUY THIS TAPE","review":"The Crunch people were really trying to make money from the Tae-Bo craze. This video was a disappointment. It looked as if they took clips from their ESPN show and threw it together on a video. You will not break a sweat and it was obviously taped to be a demonstration of what the exercise is like. I was surprised at how bad this video was. I own several Crunch tapes and they are all great. Crunch should have taken the time and money to put together a real Tae-Bo tape, instead of marketing this one with the Billy Blanks one. Save your money and buy the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Video is horrible!!!","review":"I thought this video, was terrible!!! The only people getting a workout, are those in spandex behind Billy Blanks. Blanks spends the whole time talking, there are so few repeitons that by the time you figured out the step they have moved on to eight other things. Blanks also doesn't show you or describe what to do. the folks in the background conduct the whole exercise, but do not inform the viewer when the moves are changing. Do not buy this, stick with Billy's Tae Bo set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get caught up in the craze!!","review":"When I bought this video I was hoping for a fast-paced workout to get me in top physical shape. I was extremely disappionted that I had to do the workout THREE times to break a sweat!! Don't expect too much from this video if you want to catch the Tae-Bo bug. It doesn't deliver!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a comedy than workout","review":"I bought the Tae-bo series and after LOVING the Basic workout, wanted a tape to complement it. I have been so impressed with Billy Blanks that I almost could not believe I was watching him on the Crunch tape. His Tae-bo series focuses on controlled movements, but this Crunch tape focuses on the women in the background. I couldn't concentrate on the workout because I was laughing too hard at the moves these women were doing! They were trying to make it some kind of dance, which it is not. Definately not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, I bet Billy didn't even like it!!!","review":"I bought this video, and I feel that it was the worst $10.00 I ever spent. There is no comparison between this tape(which Billy Blanks had almost nothing to do with producing, other than as an \\"actor\\"), and the Tae-Bo video series (which was made well after this waste of tape). There is no continuity like there is in the Tae-Bo tapes, no flow, and I had a hard time just trying to break a sweat!!! Don't bother with this one, folks...go for the Tae-Bo series instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that?","review":"I have to agree with another reveiwer. This video is not well done, it is confusing, and it lacks excercising. I had been doing Tae-Bo basic for about 4 weeks and needed a new challenge, I bought Crunch because I thought it would be more intense and better made. Was I wrong, in fact ma husband and I laughed at how lame it was, the second time I watched I was even more disapointed. I sure wanted to get caught up in the hype of Tae-Bo, however, it is just not worth the time or the money. There has to be some better videos out there that are challenging and fun. The funny thing is, Billy Blanks does not even do the \\"workout\\" he just talks. The people do things and go on and you don't know whats going on. In other videos I've watched through the years, including Denise Austin, Kathy Smith, you can tell the people are coreagraphed and they do a lot of work to make it look good. Perhaps Billy should start doing that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what one would expect from CRUNCH or Billy Blanks","review":"I've heard a lot of great things about the CRUNCH club and have worked out to Billy Blank's tapes which were great. I bought this video hoping to get another great workout. Boy, was I disappointed. The first part (kickology) is a regular instructional video which is fine. The second part (Tae Boxing Jam) was very dissapointing. While Billy was saying one thing, people in the back started doing a new set. There was no connection between what Billy was saying and what they were doing until they were well into the set. I didn't even break a sweat. Yes Billy is charming and all, but it's not what one looks for when selecting an exercise video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I Didn't Buy This Video","review":"I was at the store and was deciding which video to buy this one or \\"Tae Boe Foundation & Energy\\". I am so glad I didn't buy this video after reading all the negative reiviews. Thank god my mom talked me out of getting this tape. Get the \\"Tae Boe Foundation & Energy\\" video instead. It has a basic about 66 minute long section where Billy goes through the moves step by step and a heart- pumping Energy section.P.S- I'm not a kid- I don't have a login"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"dont buy!!!!! will rip even if you are careful- impossible to use- too cheap- spend money wiser bc you will wind up having to tape it or just buying another one- the vinly sucks the other material is made out of like paper machei and is better not good- just not as bad as this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"This product is a joke.

He has never used one before, but I used to have one and knew what they could do. He was taken back when he used it for the first time on 4'x8' paneling. It is quieter than the older model I used to have. Cuts are easy to do and rides smoothly across the saw. Making angle cuts on long boards are a breeze. It came with the stand which made life easier. The 30\\" fence stayed in place and the cutting guide is true in measuring distances from the blade. My boyfriend threw away his old hand saw! It's the best little unit for anyone that works with wood, novice to expert. As far as I am concerned, Delta tools are the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only gets better the more I listen...","review":"I've owned this CD for quite sometime and am amazed it still plays! While I struggle to find moving Christian music that is both soulful and actually good quality music - this one is outstanding! The groove of the music makes me want actually listen for enjoyment, and the lyrics of the hymns provide food for thought. I'm sure Sue Nixon would be mortified if she heard me belting my heart out along with her while I'm alone in my car. I've had friends ride along while it's been left on who like Jazz and say, \\"wow, who's this?\\" I tell them it's a Christian Music and they are totally shocked.

The narrow 5/8th inch cotton web leash has begun to tear apart in a spot about two feet from the end clip. My dog is a 60 pound lab and quite energetic when not heeling.

It's easy to buy from a company that reacts so well and so quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Used for walking our rottweiler, it gives her room to trot around the yard without having to stay right next to me.

This long leash gets a little tangled up in bushes and underbrush once in a while but it gives him freedom to run around and expend his energy and as long as I can get within 20 ft of him I can get hold of the leash when he runs off on one of his squirrel chases - everyone's a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"as advertised","review":"Good long leash at a good price.

I couldn't remember for a long time what the movie was like until I saw it now. And I do think and remember that the sequel was so much better and funnier while the original was pretty boring to sit through. What I remember the most was the soldier from the dead in the last twenty minutes. He was the most memorable part of the film. The acting by the cast was fair, but I felt the intelligence of the film to be abysmally low. Then again, what do I expect from Steve Miner and Sean Cunningham, the originators of Friday the 13th series? All in all, I just can't believe House got green-lit in the first place.

Oh, \\"House\\" starts off well enough and the old lady's suicide creates an ominous tone and just when you think it might be a scary movie, it turns into a joke. What you essentially have in the movie \\"House\\" is a dark comedy bordering on just downright comedy. There is pretty much ZERO horror in this flick and when the villain is actually revealed to the audience, you just have to laugh out loud because it is meant to be funny. If you like dark humor with just a taste of horror then this is really right up your alley...if you want a pure horror movie that will produce genuine scares, forget it because you won't get it with this movie. Incidentally and yet very sadly, this movie produced a pathetic sequel called \\"House II\\" that is just plain crass, stupid and mindless humor...it is so bad that I will not even write a review on that garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"House: Limited Edition (20,000) includes House II (1986)-Good flick!","review":"House: Limited Edition (20,000) includes House (1, 1985) and House II (1986). House was a four or five star comedy-horror flick that I really enjoyed. Buying this edition permitted me to obtain both House (1) and House 2 for a good price.I saw House in 1985 when it first opened and thought it was a very clever and well made movie starring William Katt (Carrie and Greatest American Hero). It had good casting, sets, musical score and the creature effects were pretty well done. Special effects were made before the advent of CGI or advanced prosthetics but were effective and hold up very well for the majority of creatures represented."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say about ................","review":"House is a movie from the '80's.

I bought the title only remembering some of the movie but after I watched it I was so glad that I purchased it. I saw it on t.v. a couple of years ago and didn't realize that it was called House. Well anyway as for the DVD the transfer is beautiful and while only in mono the sound is fantastic. As for the acting it is sub-par and the script is lacking. But I still find it entertaining because the characters are so funny its hard not to laugh. All I can say it that it is a classic 80's movie. House is a great movie to own espically with a copy of the limited edition House II disc. While House II isn't nearly as good as the first one because of the lack of horror at all. House II should just be considered a comedy. Well overall if you like the genre then House is the movie for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Budget Masterpiece","review":"House is an excellent movie that should be viewed by anyone with a sense of humor.

Anyone who likes horror or low budget horrors should spend some time watching this movie. The movie is a horror/comedy from the 80's. Do I need to say more? The horror genre has changed into many different forms over the last two decades, and house brings you back to the time where a horror not only made you laugh but made you jump out of your seat at times with the assistance of cheesy monsters.

Not all of his fans may know about McKean's solo comics work. Cages, his magnum opus, was originally released in 10 issues, over a period of 6 years, dogged by publishing difficulties and McKean's busy schedule.

I wish I never tried this product because I'm scared to lose my hair!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have known...","review":"Not only did this combo not do anything to increase my rate of hair growth, but even as just a regular shampoo and conditioner, I didn't like how they made my hair feel or smell.

My hair also only grew 3 inches in 4 years. So yeah, my hair is slow. But I ordered this stuff on September 3rd, and I got it in September 6th. I started using and it's been about a month and my hair grew an inch and a half ! That's more than it grows in a year! My hair got cut REALLY short in 7th grade for locks of love, and now a sophomore in high school, it was shoulder length, but thanks to this AMAZING product, my hair is no down to my chest.

Totally disappointed. The shampoo made my hair incredibly tangled. It felt nasty after rinsing. Also, I noticed A TON of hair loss with this product. Literally 4-5 times more than usual. People may say, \\"Oh you're loosing hair because you are getting new growth\\" -- yeah, no thanks! I don't want all my long hair clumping out for a few new short strands. Overall - never again.

The product did ship on time, however, You must wash your hair with this product every day :( Then on top of that, the shampoo dried my hair out and made it feel hard and brittle. The conditioner made it a little softer, but it basically matted my hair and made it very tangled and difficult to manage.

Stupid me decided to comb my hair, BIG mistake! It felt crunchy and my hair was breaking and a ball of hair (the size of a baseball) was left in my bath tub.My scalp felt like it went through a big process, like hair dye (it felt like burning)and it's supposed to be a regular shampoo and conditioner!

I've only used this a few times on my daughter and her hair is finally growing back. It was almost like her growth was stunted and this woke it up and told it to start growing, seriously! She is thrilled and I'm excited that my own hair has grown quite a bit in the past month as well. I just placed my third order for this product. I have color treated hair and it doesn't do a great job at conditioning my hair so I reccomend a deep conditioning treatment in addition to this product like once or twice a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"total BS","review":"Didn't do anything for me, I bought shampoo and conditioner and zero result, I color my hair so I can really see how fast the roots are growing- it is growing at the same speed as usual.

My hair has grown out very quickly. So happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK shampoo and conditioner but no growth","review":"After a bleaching mishap, I lost quite a bit of hair that broke off about 1\\" from my roots so needless to say I was in dire need of fast growth. I had already been taking biotin before this so I continued to do that and used this shampoo and conditioner every time I washed my hair for a full month. Being that I dye my hair, it is easy to see the growth line at the root. I don't even think my hair grew the 1/2\\" that is \\"average\\" to most people. Looks to me more like 1/4\\" based on the line I see. Very disappointed. The shampoo and conditioner are ok and I will continue to use it up but I can't say it helped with hair growth in any way. For the price, I'd prefer to use other brands. I see it works for some. I guess I will keep taking my biotin and hoping for the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY!","review":"used the shampoo and conditioner for about a month. made hair grow, but made it thinner,break easily, and fall out like crazy. i dye my hair blonde and after using it one day i ran my hand through my hair and squeezed out water and the water was yellow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for me!","review":"The product did exactly what it said it would do. My hair was always slow to grow and it has grown an inch in the 4 weeks I have been using the product. I'll probably continue to use this product for a couple more months and then switch back to sulfate free shampoo! This shampoo kind of makes my hair coarse and dry, but I use Moroccan oil to help that! But I honestly I cannot wait to go back to no sulfate and organic shampoo but this stuff does the job!

Unfortunately I didn't read most of the reviews and little was actually said about hair growth. People were giving it 5 stars based on the fact their hair was so much silkier, and healthy. This product markets the fact that it makes your hair grow, and so I am basing my review on that claim with 1 star, because it does not.Almost any new shampoo/conditioner you buy is going to make your hair feel good, (unless it's really cheap stuff )because it always happens when you switch products. Also a clarifying shampoo will do this as well, removing residue from the last product."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID NOT WORK","review":"I am not claiming that this product did not work or does not work for some, but after two months of consistent use (I did not use any other hair shampoos or conditioners) I did not see any change in my hair growth that I would attribute to this product. Unfortunately I think that when it comes to accelerated hair growth, it just has to happen to old fashion way- a lot of time and maybe some vitamins. If you choose to use this product any way, the smell is somewhat pleasant but it may leave your hair a bit dry at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS REALLY WORKS!!!","review":"I bought this shampoo and conditioner for my girlfriend. She was wanting to grow her hair out to cut all the dead ends off. She was very skeptical at first but she decided to take the risk. We measure on day one of using the shampoo and conditioner(which was 15inch) a month later we measured again(15.5) and two months later(16.5-17inches). At first she used the shampoo AND conditioner every single day for the first month and then during the second month used it every other day. She complained at first that the first month she noticed that her scalp would be dry and itchy but the second month it wasn't a problem. Although she said it was well worth it!

The vinyl doesn't breathe so even with a sheet over it crinks and has an uncomfortable hard feeling to it. And it makes me sweat and stick to the sheet because there is no breathing of the material beneath the bedsheet. Body heat can only go one way - up back on to you. I bought the 3 gauge and it tore up pretty badly when I removed the mattress from the bed after a few months, and before that the top tore a little bit from tossing and turning in the night.

The journey of Cal and Stella contrasts well with the abusive new home of their cousin Fannie. The descriptions are vivid, and the storylines draw you in from the start. As in all Aiken's books it is full of adventure and mystery (but it is not as far fetched as some of her children's stories). Finally, there are those little details (not so little if you've paid attention to her writing) that connect this to her other books. If you've read The Smile of the Stranger, you'll appriciate them, but it is not necessary to have read anything else. All who enjoy a compelling read should get this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Retrospect wants you to buy expensive support and for what?","review":"I use to swear by retrospect and it never let me down until OS X.

When backing up a single large drive, this file easily exceeds the size of a single CD, preventing the use of XP's built in CD burner. The manual said absolutely nothing about this (weak and confusing documentation). Instead, I found the information hidden away in a text file on the Retrospect CD. Because the box and manual said nothing about having to purchase additional software (considering the price of Retrospect, one certainly wouldn't think so), I'm giving this program a low rating. Beyond this, Retrospect appears to be a great program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck","review":"I have an older version of this. When my wife's computer crashed last week, it took the catalog with it. So now I have a recent back up of her hard drive (or disk as Retrospect calls it) which no version of Dant software seems to recognize so as to rebuild the catalog. I have several versions because I originally bought it, and then it came bundled with each of the three Maxtor one touch drives I have purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Hardware Support","review":"I purchased this product based on a reccommendation from the David Lawrence Radio Show without checking its specific hardware support. As it turned out, no drivers for my newer Samsung CD-RW/DVD combo device are available from Dantz, and the program's \\"Custom Configuration\\" device was unable to configure/manufacture one that would work.Now I am stuck with having to return the software (if Amazon allows) or 'invest' in a new compatible back up hardware device.Be VERY cautious when buying this product -- wish I had been moreso........."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice and comfortable shoes","review":"I got 3 pairs of them -- for my father, brother and boyfriend.

Although I listen to R&B, rap and urban stuff, this was one of the more unique heavy metal albums that I got to listen to. Heaven and Sometimes She Cries were the power ballads that were hits, but I love the rockers in Down Boys, D.R.F.S.R., 32 Pennies, In The Sticks and the last two. There's a lot of energy and the guitars are revved up on this effort. Jani Lane sings with attitude on here, and the lead guitars in Erik Turner along with bassist Jerry Dixon and the other members provide the backbone for the band. Although Cherry Pie and later albums did well, they are no contest to this debut. It's good to hear that the remaining members still perform today and still wowing audiences!"},{"rating":"2","title":"80s Hair Metal","review":"One of the 80s hair metal bands that accompany my growing up years!!!

They are nothing more than a second rate Poison, who were nothing but a second rate Motley Crue during the 'Theatre of Pain' Album. (In fact it's rumored that when Motley changed their image yet again with Girls, Girls, Girls, they had a yard sale. Bret Michaels and CC bought all the old Theatre costumes).Warrant for the most part is mindless piffle. Back when this album was released, all hair bands had the same formula. First single had to have a decent rhythm with a strong chorus (Down Boys). Second single had to be the mandatory 'Power Ballad' (Heaven). Third single was whatever else they could dig off the album and make a video for. I love the 80's but am glad to see the likes of Warrant, White Lion, and Winger gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filthy Stinkin' Shame!!!!!!!!!","review":"I'll be honest, I never liked Warrant and still don't anddon't think they were very good but after the garbage I seeon MTV and hear on the radio I realize that this was muchbetter than what is out there.

It is Poison-esque hair metal. Jani Lane, in spite of criticism that he could not sing, actually has a very pleasing voice, in my opinion. All of the songs on here are absolutely great. My personal favorites are Down Boys, Heaven, the title track, and many more. Heaven was a huge chart hit in 1988, reaching #2 on the Billboard singles chart. It is on of the best 80's power ballads. If you like Poison, you will probably love this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not what Henckels used to be.","review":"The scissors are just OK.

I was thrilled to find out that this book was in the making. But when I finally got my hands on it I was furious to find that there were no color plates in the entire book. All photographs are archival. The Richard Crane mansion in Ipswich is a tremendous house, and I appreciate the old view from the beach, but how does that compare to the view now that all of the landscape has come to maturation. Not including color plates and more contemporary shots was a cruel tease to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago's Finest","review":"Though I must say, that I agree that this book could have used some color plates, it in my opinion does not distract from the fact that this is a wonderful book on a fine architect. I personally love the archieval black and white plates, they are so vivid and the Adler homes are quite old, so it somehow seem to fit. This book covers in detail Adler's best country homes, his work was just amazing and the attention to detail in his homes ranks with Horace Trumbaur and McKim, Mead, and White as the best of this age. Chicago is most blessed with his homes, but the Crane Estate, in the Boston suburbs is, in my opinion, his most interesting home and this book does a fine job of covering it. If you have any interest in great American residental architecture, or Mr. Adler's work itself, then I can't imagine you being disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing Up in One","review":"Great book and overview of Adler's extensive work. Having grown up in Albert Lasker's Lake Forest estate; Mill Road Farm (p74), I was thrilled to see the arial photo's of the massive estate in it's heyday.

Where else can a bunch of brainy small town kids become heroes not by stepping through a portal to some fantasy world but by knowing more about our world's natural laws than the adults who surround them? This novel works best as a prequel to the collections of tales found in Brinley's first two books, which are childhood favorites of mine. However, the story stands on its own, and its scope eclipses those earlier short stories. The Air Force has lost an atomic bomb in the town's Strawberry Lake, and only the Mad Scientists' ingenuity can save the day! At first this gang of adolescents can't get the grownups to listen, but they soon prove their worth. Likewise, I recommend that you give them a chance. They won't let you down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Length Fun","review":"If you liked the previous Mad Scientists books as well as I did, you will like this one, too.

The end result was grout that looked about the same as before.We ended up trying bleach on the grout an it works like magic. Let it sit for 2 minutes and then whip it off and the grout comes out clean and white.

Life should be an experience and unfortunatelly not many seem to venture and take the challenge anymore. I guess we are pretty content culture now.

Upon returning to the US, I heard the buzz about this very cool book that I would probably really like. Within minutes of opening it and reading a few pages I knew exactly where his words were coming from, and from whom. He did take artistic license to make the story, we weren't really that out of control. But it was one hell of a great ride while it lasted.

The characters are typical stereotypes of 60's and 70's adolescents. Reading in 1999, the plot line seemed obvious and the characters a bore. The adolescent arrogance and assumption that all is new in the 60's was laughable and boring -- and the fact that they are indulged by the adults makes it worse. The illicit drug plotline shows little innovation. Maybe it was innovative when first published prior to the lessons/publications of the late 70s, 80s and 90s. But now it seems to be only an artifact of a forgotten time. It is not timeless but very dependent on the time period it was published within.

I find this book a tremendous bore. It's wordy beyond belief, and its central character is a boring old man who, for some unknown reason, has captured the affections of a bunch of anti-establishment teenagers. The improbable nature of the plot (that the narrator already knows half of the teenagers before catching up with them in Spain) detracts from the message of the narrative, though some of the individual experiences were no doubt true to the time in which the novel is set.

This is my favorite book, and I've read it a few times now over the years so my paperback is torn, taped, marked up a bit, but I'll never get a new copy.

He bounces his wife on it also because she is in remission from cancer and she feels better afterwards.I purchased one and I set it stategically in the main room and EVERYONE passing seems to be compelled to start jumping on it...even the visitors! It's easy to hop on and bounce while watching a show or dancing to music. It's amazing how good you feel afterwards!I did shop around first because I wanted a quality, lasting product. I love this! Our friends tell me the ones they have at their home don't have the same bounce...not as firm and the bounce is easier. I would tell anyone with kids and on the run...this is awesome product for everyone! Why not enjoy and laugh , while you're working out and get those kids jumping,too! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"Wow, did I make a mistake purchasing this item. First, it is not easy to assemble by ANY means (I am talking about the balance bar), and I cannot even attach it to the trampoline properly so that is remotely useful. Please do not waste your money by shelling out extra for the balance bar.The tramp itself is just okay. My feet and ankles pronate badly on the mat. This is not a comfortable bounce at all. I bounced slightly on it for about 10 seconds, and I strained or pulled a calf muscle and something in the top of my foot.I am very far under the weight limit of 300 lbs, but it feels like it's going to give out under me.Maybe it'll work for others, but not for me. I am so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"exercise for a caretaker","review":"I am a private caretaker companion currently assisting someone who can't be left alone. The cellerciser is just the ticket for me. I can use it in her home (I'm on 24/10 then off for 5 days in her home).I keep my sanity, my health and happiness by bouncing every day.It keeps my figure in shape also...because of hip problems I can only bounce lightly...no matter, I still get everything I need until I can have a day off.I recommend this product for anyone who has a hard time getting out for a walk or to the gym. AND, you don't have to be fit to benefit...I think this is the best equipment for couch potatoes, or anyone who doesn't like exercise, because it is fun, it makes you feel much better, and you can stay indoors, or out, which ever you choose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing is just stupid","review":"There are various sizes when it comes to these garter belt. When I ordered I was a size 16, and I think I bought the 5x. In any other product a FIVE X would be falling off, and just way way to big. This damm thing was way small,and not sexy. No woman wants to feel that 5X is too small, like she's a massive cow.Not sexy. Also, the garters kept coming off the stocking tops. I have heard others complain about this. I'd say pass, unless you find a shop that carries them, so you can see and try them on first. Also shipping took a few weeks.I am so disappointed. Still looking for a sexy garter belt with tummy control. So far years of digging, nothing has come up.

Facing The Giants is a good, clean movie with heart. You won't find cursing, violence, sex or gore. What you will find is strength, determination, humility, courage and inspiration. One of the plethora of powerful scenes in particular that occurs during a football practice session with a player blindfolded touched me so that I will NEVER forget it and will ponder it often in my mind when I face difficulties or obstacles. I am buying this movie to add to my collection. All believers and \\"want to\\" believers should see this movie. God's Spirit penetrates this movie. It's just beautiful. (o8E) Everything we do should be for God's glory. It's what it's all about. I give this one of my highest recommendations. Please see it and tell your friends and co-workers about it.

My only other issue might be that God doesn't always give you what you want, and in this movie's case, everyone seemed to ultimately get what they wanted. Perhaps a little too unrealistic. That said, however, this is still one of the best movies I've ever seen. The positives far outweigh any negatives, so watch this movie!

Good, exciting storyline. And when you consider the shoestring budget it was made on, it is even more remarkable. If it were not an overtly religious piece, I might give it 4 or 5 stars.The problem is the false teaching that the movie perpetuates. That is, if you are a Christian, God will overcome all your earthly obstacles for you and make you an outstanding, victorious success right here on earth. That teaching is nowhere to be found in the Bible. Christians are to persevere and glorify God regardless of their circumstances, success or failure. Rewards will be in eternity, not in the here and now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this is really bad....","review":"I do not understand how 500 people could review this movie and over 400 actually believe it is worth watching. For starters the acting is just plain bad...it's like most of the actors are reading off cue cards. If you can get past that, the message it sends should be a good one, but that is not the case. In this movie God is an all-powerful, wish-granting genie....believe in God and all things are possible!!

Seriously people, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Overwhelmed","review":"If you have seen this movie you will recognize my title as one of the last lines that the head coach says. This film is terrible. Terrible acting. Terrible dialouge. And terrible portrayal of living a good life. The message of this movie is that if you do everything correctly you should eventually stumble upon a trillion dollars in gold in your backyard, because that is how God works according to this film. No that is not how He works, and I feel sorry for anyone who stops living a good life because they haven't recieved thier trillion dollars yet.I wish in the scene where they switched out the coaches old car for a new truck, that they switched out the car for a spare tire. That would have been funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facing the boredom","review":"This movie has got to be the most smaltsy piece of bible pushing rubbish I have ever seen.

That's why I picked this one. Unfortunately, all the 5* reviews seemed to be voting whether God is good or not, not whether the movie was well done. If I were voting for God or giving my life to Christ, I would vote 5* too. But, I was very disappointed in the slow, low quality movie I got after I paid. The movie was definitely substandard as far as quality. The message may have been good at the end, but I didn't get this far. I wanted to review so others, looking for a good movie, wouldn't spend their money. I feel like a church congregation got on and voted this up, hoping to spread the gospel message. Again, gospel of Christ = 5*; movie=1*."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Unbelievable","review":"I cannot believe this movie came up as one of the highest rated. I can only believe that it is just a slew of partisan 'Christian' reviewers trying to make it score highly. Yes the points made by some about no egocentric actors and the lack of anything offensive are true. But what is offensive is that this would be considered a good film. It is badly acted, poorly directed and so cheesy it is embarrassing. If you like the story of overcoming through faith and are happy to sit through embarrassing mediocrity then this is for you. If you want to watch something truly inspiring then try Shawshank Redemption - talk about overcoming and maintaining your dignity - and an incredibly well made and acted film. Sorry, but someone had to expose the emperor's lack of clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great message, bad movie","review":"As a Christian, the message of putting God first in your life is correct. As a high school football coach, I believe the \\"game\\" scenes are authentic and most likely game film from a Friday night. That said, the rest of the this movie is horrible to put it mildly. My 14 yr old son had every scene figured out before it was over. The acting was poor and the sideline scenes are ridiculous. I give the church that made it credit for preaching the word. If you want a movie with a Christian / never give up message check out \\"Rudy\\" or \\"Hoosiers\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facing the Giants is Great!","review":"This is the second film produced by a small church in Georgia and it's great! A small Georgia high school has several bad seasons and the coach is getting discouraged and the towns-people want to replace him.

There are good applications for all areas of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facing the Giants","review":"It is a good movie for young children and yound adults.

It's a good explanation of how our faith should be expressed in real life. Believers who see this film will be touched deeply and then challenged to rededicate all they do to the glory of God.I am a grown man and spent much of the movie in tears. I watched it with my group of 9 teenagers and many of them were in tears, too. They all love the movie, which has been an excellent teaching tool.None of us noticed anything less than good production quality except that the acting was just a bit cheesy in the very beginning of the movie.

The Shiloh Eagles have not had a winning record in many years. There is a movement to fire Coach Taylor. Along with the job stresses, Taylor has many more. He and his wife Brooke (Shannen Fields) are struggling financially, their car barely runs, and they are unable to conceive.In the midst of all of his troubles, Taylor decides to surrender himself to God. He decided that regardless of circumstances, good or bad, he will trust in God and submit to His will. He ends up touching lots of lives and making a much bigger impact on and off the field.This is very well done. It is a compelling story that will keep viewers entertained throughout. In the process, they will likely have a lot of food for thought to ponder.I recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facing the Giants","review":"Emotional - Touching - InspirationalWorth the watch - better than most movies I see at the movie theaterOther movies by this production company are just as good or even betterAcademy voters should take note!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life!!","review":"Awesome depiction of life as it really is.

Watch this movie and be reassured that God hears you even when He seems silent. Learn about God's faithfulness from a coach who insisted on praising God, whether the team won or not.I almost stopped watching this video in its first ten minutes. I thought the actor playing the coach did not know how to show emotions. A few minutes more into the movie, I realized he was accurately portraying a depressed individual. I am glad I kept watching, and I am thrilled the coach found triumph and joy in the face of adversity.With Great Mercyauthor."},{"rating":"1","title":"God on your side in football?","review":"Christian propaganda that doesn't reflect even true Christianity.I can't see Jesus who refused to fight the Romans encouraging football.In my opinion football is the American form of the Roman gladiatorial games where slaves were made to kill each other for entertainment.You have to realize that it is the Muslim version of this type of storythat gets terrorists to drive cars full of explosive into crowdedcities.Do we want our children taught that kind of hate?Learn who Jesus really was:the meek and mild man who turned the other cheek.He told others to put down the swordand love their enemies.The Southern Fundamentalist Christians have lost Godand deny Jesus and His faith.They make a football God who bombsthe defenseless in the night using high technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Acting, Predictable Plot, Cheesy Message","review":"I don't often write reviews but I was so turned off by this movie that I felt compelled to warn others not to waste their time or money on this one. The acting is the worst I've ever seen, the dialogue is extremely stilted, and the biblical messages--while worthwile--are presented in such a blatant way that you feel you've been beaten over the head instead of allowing you to think and reflect about a deeper message. As other reviewers have said, the movie presents God as some type of genie--the minute the characters follow His Word, everything changes for the better. Life isn't this neat and tidy and it would have been more believable if the characters experienced even minor challenges throughout. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that there is no violence or swearing so it would be suitable for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing and bad theology","review":"I was very disappointed in this movie. I have read the background of this movie that it was a small budget film put on by a church but that does not excuse bad theology and even poorer writing/acting. Facing the Giants uses every incorrect (in my view) poor Christian cliche there is. This movie falsely depicts that if you become a Christian all these good things will happen to you and all your problems go away. That is just one of the many failings of this movie that I will not go into detail about. But watch the movie if you'd like a good laugh and you'd like to see how a Christian movie should NOT be made. I will say that it is family friendly and the football playing sequences weren't that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"dvd do not work as well as it should","review":"this dvd did not work good poor recording on that movie the movie would like be working and pauseing at the same time and the voice was behind or front of the actual picture, it was that bad that i did not watch it very far , in fact when i went shopping this past week i went and got a new movie from kmart same movie as this, i felt that movie was junk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Something","review":"I had heard this was an inspiring story, but the acting and dialogue were so boring that I couldn't get through it.

Fail","review":"By far this was one of the best movies that I have ever seen. The Passion of Christ was great. The Chronicles of Narnia was good but this movie was awesome. I agree that the acting was not up to the professional level that you would expect to see in a movie, but the message behind the acting is what most people should have picked up on. I can relate to the coach in the movie. I have been through times in my life where everything was going down the drain and it took an enlightening event similar to this one to bring me back. This movie is definitely a must see for the Christian who is struggling in life with any kind of problem. It could also be a great witnessing tool for those who don't know Christ as their Savior. I intend to buy several copies now that it is out on DVD, to share with those who need an uplifting event in their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 STARS!!!!!!","review":"I don't even know where to begin......this is the most awe inspiring movie I have ever seen.

Absolutly, hands down, the greatest family friendly movie of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting but Balanced","review":"I propose a counterpoint to those who say this movie has shallow \\"genie-God\\" theology. This is not a movie about bad Christians that become good so that God will bless them with only good things. It's about regular people who trust God even as life gets more difficult. God's blessing is not portrayed as a predetermined outcome to certain actions. On the contrary, one of the theme's of the movie is trusting God even when circumstances are very difficult. \\"If God doesn't... will you still love Him?\\" The answer was a tearful but confident, \\"Yes.\\" Along the same lines we hear, \\"If we win, we praise Him. If we lose, we praise Him.\\" Through this uplifting story, these real-life lessons shine through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good family movie","review":"This is a very good movie.

Furthermore, knowing something about the church that produced this movie (I have friends who are active members there), the folks in this movie are the real deal . . . just like you and me . . . which lends to their production an awesome, almost reality TV, sense - the actors live, personally, the message FTG portrays. I highly recommend this DVD for every home library - watch it at least once a year (or more, if you are going through a struggle) and be inspired to trust God's providence in your own life. By the way, though the production is less polished, the Kendrick's first movie, Flywheel, is pretty good, too - check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been inspired lately?","review":"If you have ever gone through a period of intense trial in your life or struggled in your Christian faith, this is a great movie!

But for crying out loud, watching this movie will show you why the secular world doesn't take Christians seriously. It was so full of cliche situations and responses it isn't funny. The acting is absolutely HORRIBLE---why in the world did they use church members to populate the cast? A little realism would be a much better testimony---things don't always work to perfection for believers in the real world. The absolute low point of the movie is the shifting wind direction that allows the little guy to hit the state-championship-winning field goal (of course, coming after he prays to God for help in making the kick)---spare me, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! This is not a sports drama!","review":"I felt very mislead into believing that this was a sports drama movie. Has a very misleading cover and a misleading description. There is no \\"action packed drama\\" and I saw nothing that could be award wining. Very unrealistic since church and state are separate. Should come with a warning that states \\"extreme religious overtones with bad acting and bad directing\\". This movie is a religious force it down your throat movie. If you want to see a movie about how the belief in religion can control ones life, well then this is the one to see. I saw nothing inspirational nor uplifting in this film.

I can think of nothing good to say about this movie, if you want religious inspiration, read your Bible, Torah or Koran. My son wanted a football movie and we were stuck with this drivel.

It teaches you to continue to trust in God b/c with Him, all things are possible. You will reach your goal with Him as the Head of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Winner!","review":"This is a wonderful movie full of good moral values that anyone would be blessed to see. If you are a Christian, or even if you're not, please see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Favorite Movie","review":"This movie was done a church in GA. It is a truely inspirational movie. It made its points well. It mixed in some comedy that also made it a fun movie. My Kids loved it, my parent loved it. It is much more than just a sports, football movie. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facing the Giants","review":"I purchased this DVD after watching Fireproof. The techincal quality is better than the previous (Flywheel), and the story is even more dynamic. Again, I disagree with some of the religious principles suggested, but I still recommend highly to anyone wanting a very powerful story. Putting some of the principles in the movie into practice can certainly improve one's own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facing the Giants","review":"This was a good movie.

The description was the exact same way it came... great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Facing The Giants~Exceptional Movie For All!","review":"I ordered this after seeing \\"Courageous\\" by accident~aka~act of God. Thinking it was a typical Cop Movie. I desperately Needed a diversion from real life at that moment and was so pleasantly surprised it wasn't what I expected. I didn't think I could like \\"Facing The Giants\\" as much, but ordered it anyway. Was I ever wrong.. I LOVED it! It has everything you expect in a movie and so much more! Football fans will get caught up in the exceptional footage, coaching staff, locker room humor. It just has it all humor, action, tears, tests of will against all odds and great acting by (regular people) as with all these Movies you hear and feel many powerful messages not over-done but all wrapped up in a perfect delivery, at the perfect time! No Hollywood Blockbuster Actors, producers or Movies can match this! Watch this Movie, Christian&#65279; or not you won't be disappointed, I guarantee it! It just might save your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very encouraging one","review":"Very encouraging and inspired. It's by far, my most favorite movie!Though the story may not be a true story, but the theory and message applies to our daily lives directly and closely!If you don't believe in God, you can still watch it to be encouraged and inspired! When we come the end of ourselves, knowing we have no control to our circumstances, we learn that we have to turn to the ONE that gives us the true source of strength, security and joy. I do believe the movie/message will gratly encourage you in the midst of our challenges of lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie!","review":"Like most of the other reviewers have stated, this is a very good movie. Very well acted and caries a wonderful Christian message, and a great story line. I too am glad I was \\"delivered\\" to see this film. My wife and I watched it on Stars Family channel and I immediately came to Amazon to order it for our library. Any believer will apprecate the message ... non-believers may come away with a better understanding of the Christian faith. I would give it 6 stars if I could. This country needs more films like this ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome movie!!","review":"Facing the Giants is one of the best movies I've ever seen. We took our three school-age grandchildren to see it in the theater when it was released and we all loved it. I have purchased it in DVD form as a Christmas gift for my 12-year old grandson this year. An awesome inspiring movie of faith, courage, determination. The kind of motivational movie you want your kids to watch. Not just for kids either. Adults get just as excited watching this movie. Highly recommend for all age groups. Worth every cent. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome Christian entertainmet","review":"a must see for kids, teens and adults alike. in a day when God is being pushed aside and especially teens have no direction this movie and its companion flywheel put God and Christ where they belong #1.

For me, the movie portrayed many things going on in our life together. For him, it led him to some realizations that were life changing. All in a movie.

This isn't as polished as the bigger budget movies, but it is priceless in the values it reminds us of!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real surprise!","review":"I expected little and was completely surprised at how much I loved this film. It was a small budget film made by two brothers on staff at a church in Georgia. The actors were not seasoned professional actors, and yet they pulled off believable performances. This faith based film is a wonderful family film every teen should see. This high school football tale reveals life is about more than merely winning football games. It's about knowing where to turn when the going gets tough--a God who is faithful no matter your circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"Obviously this movie was acted out by less than accomplished actors and actresses.

A great story for all of America and the world--do everything for service to God!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing Movie","review":"This movie is very refreshing & has a clear gospel message. The only negative I would say is that it does give the sense that if we are completely trusting God that all will go our way.

Unless you take into consideration the fact that it is small town USA and GA. Then, yes, the accent is right on and I really got into it. I loved the faith and the message. It got me really fired up and I am interested in more movies like. I recommend it for everyone and it will be a stocking stuffer this year! I can hardly wait to see Fireproof!! These movies are MORE LIKE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"I love this movie and recommend it to everyone!

The Kendrick brothers are so talented and are passionate about making clean, Christ-honoring movies. This one's a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"I saw Fireproof last week and loved it. On the extras of the DVD they talked about this film and Flywheel. I ordered them from my rental service (haven't seen Flywheel yet). Facing the Giants was very good. Not as good as Fireproof but excellent in message none the less. It was moving, inspiring, emotional. I was smiling, laughing and crying through it. So what if the acting wasn't perfect, I wanted a good message and a movie that made me feel good and not want to turn away because of gore, violence, sex or greed. All the things that are lauded by Hollywood like they're good things. Family oriented, meaningful, inspirational. I'm glad there are still groups out there still plugging along. Hope they keep putting them out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"inspirational","review":"This video is a great pick me up when life is beating you down. God is in control...though it might be quite a ride.

It's good to find movies and entertainment that reinforce the values we teach and model in our home (if we win, we praise God; if we lose, we praise God). Three weeks after watching this movie, my daughter is still saying this.

As someone who works with dual diagnosis clients (people diagnosed with substance abuse and mental health disorders) I recognized many of the patterns of thinking, and the raw emotions that Damien presented in his early works, and was inspired as the poems went on to present hope and the challenges faced by new-found sobreity. The poem \\"Relapsing Nightmare\\" from the Chemical Life chapter was a powerful piece about the tumultuous early days of early recovery, and the poem \\"Sweet Life\\" was a very poignant and affirming tale of strength. I look forward to introducing these poems to the people I work with, as well as to anyone else who doubts the impact that writing, reading, and sharing poetry can have on one's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"just the boring facts","review":"A hugely disappointing book, after waiting a long time for a reasonably priced copy to become available. It is simply a listing of Broadway and other shows that closed out of town or in previews. It lists some of the creative team, nothing about directors, choreographers, designers. It sometimes lists one or two stars names, but no other cast and tells you nothing about the reasons for closing. It lists the theatre in which the show closed but no other pre Broadway stops. If it closed in previews It does not tell you how many. The author really did a half assed job of researching this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laura Fan","review":"I first began listening to Laura when I lived in Mexico city and since returning to the United States, I have bought every album she has recorded.

In particular, most songs obviously utilize drum machines, which can sometimes detract from the overall song.However, Pausini has an excellent voice -- powerful and emotional, with a good range. Most of the songs do a good job of showcasing her talent. The sad songs in particular are made more forceful because she sounds invested in the emotion. The title track, despite the aforementioned annoying drum machine, is good and moving. The upbeat numbers are also good singing-along songs -- Il Mio Sbaglio Piu Grande and Siamo Noi.It's not a perfect cd by any means, but it's definitely worth a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"screamer","review":"this cd was a total disappointmentlaura pausini falls into the category of \\"screamer\\": she strains her voice. it is not pleasant to hear her sing.I would save the money and spend it on something else"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugh","review":"Unfortunately I can't fairly assess this unit because I got mine from the dealer in a state of disrepair"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS AN UPGRADE","review":"I received the UPGRADE of this product, though I ordered FULL product.

That's not to say that this is a poor translation but rather there are so many minute details in Borges' prose that they are sometimes lost in the translation. Regardless, this collection of stories represents one of the greatest literary accomplishments in 20th century latin-american fiction and beyond. Borges is a writer of the mind, and that's where most of his stories live. You'll find yourself asking questions about what is real and what is not; what is a dream, what is a nightmare. Borges prose is flawless and his imagination is like no other's. Influenced by philosophy, history, and art, Borges captures a piece of humanity into a collection of stories and he only leaves you wanting more and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Borges, esencial","review":"En tiempos de producción en serie a la cual ni la literatura ha escapado, en maravilloso descubrir esa lectura apasionante, fina e inteligente de Borges.

I have recently reread the entire work and am once again blown away. I still don't understand quite everything he says, but even getting past that the stories are incredible. My favorite is 'Theme of the Traitor and Hero,' but I also like 'The Library of Babel,' 'The Circular Ruins,' and 'Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius.' His style is so concise it amazes me- an idea that would take an enormously long novel to examine satisfactorily if given to another author takes Borges a mere four and a half pages (as in 'Theme'). This might sound detrimental to the work or discouraging to the reader, but that is not the case. It is discouraging, however, in the sense that you want to read more- you almost wish it was a 400-page novel (a novel that would probably be the opus for any other writer) and not a short story that the reader is through with in five minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ever.","review":"Succintly put, this is the best writer of our time.

This book if very graphic in it's description about sex -pictures and all.It explains the cold hard facts about puberty, sex and birth control. Nothing is held back. I feel there is too much information for the pre-teen and young teen . I'm concerned that nowhere in the book does it discuss abstinence as an alternative. Nor does it discuss the psychological ramifications of having sex. This book is definitly for the older teen. I strongly suggest as a companion to this book \\"Love, Sex & The Whole Person- Everything You Wanted to Know\\" by Tim Stafford as a balance to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"I was hoping it would have more about STDs as well.

It's one thing to depend on a book to teach your child the anatomy of sex, but the personal feelings, values and expectation of a parent cannot be expressed by someone who doesn't even know your child.Anyway, if you childs virginity is something you want to presereve, you should willing to talk about it yourself, not rely on a book to do it for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"inappropriate for 9-12 year olds","review":"I consider myself a liberal and progressive father but this book is definitely not age appropriate for 9-12 year olds. I was shocked to read in this book graphic desciptions related to sexual intercourse, G-spots, and masterbation.

Some people think that this book is too advanced for your average pre-teen, but having been there just a few years ago, I can assure you that it is not. The book provides a lot of information that I was curious about, yet too embarrassed to ask about. Even being so young when I got the book, I can assure you that it did not cause me to grow up any faster... it only caused me to grow up at a normal speed with more information. I still read the book as I experience new things, and because of this book and the topics it discussed, I was more assured about the changes going on inside of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated","review":"Was expecting something more up to date.

I read the first few pages of this tonight to my daughter. Thank goodness I looked ahead. This author lists slang words for a woman and man's genitals as though they are used in everyday conversation. For all her info, the word abstinence isn't even IN the index. As a 40+ woman, I haven't even heard some of this words, and I am a better person for it. Scary, scary, scary. There may be parts of the book that are fine, but I can't risk it.

The \\"What's Happening to my Body\\" book has the information we needed but it also contains drawings of the male anatomy and different stages of the male anatomy, including arousal, as well as all kinds of different terms and slang words, which I thought weren't necessary for a pre-teen.

I was mature for my age, but shy, so I didn't feel comfortable talking about certain things back then. As an avid reader, this book was the perfect way to explain to me exactly what was going on. I do agree with some reviewers that I wish it would talk about abstinence as well, however, I still think that the book is valuable. Personally, I always knew that abstinence was the only option for me, despite what \\"everyone else is doing\\". I appreciated the descriptions and illustrations in this book, because quite frankly, it took the \\"big mystery\\" about puberty away and made me more comfortable with the changes I was going through. I would recommend this book for young girls that are mature for their age and perhaps just starting to experience a change in their bodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful guide.","review":"Someone suggested this book to me when my daughter was about eight. I bought it and read it. It was important for me to get comfortable with the subject matter before I could introduce it to my child. The scariest thing was what do I (or should I) say to her? When she started asking questions, we would pull out \\"the book\\". After reading about a particular subject, we would then talk about it and share our thoughts. It was just the sections that involved her questions. At first, I held on to the book and when I thought she was ready, I handed it over to her.

I was a kid when it was on the network, back in 1965. However, this Third Season collection is from 1967-1968. The show has easily-accessible features and episode lists. The digitization is good, considering it's only a DVD, and not a Blu-ray Disc. Several fun episodes, including the 4-Part episode: \\"Genie, Genie, Who's Got the Genie?\\" where Jeannie accidentally gets locked in a moon safe; \\"The Greatest Con Artist in the World,\\" with Milton Berle, to name a few. For being over 40 years old, the color is still as vivid as ever. The young Barbara Eden is as beautiful as ever. If you're looking to expand your collection of classic TV shows, this is certainly on the list.The only glitch I noticed, is the episode \\"My Son, the Genie,\\" with Bob Denver is on disc 2, but is listed as the first episode on disc 3.Anyway, you're sure to have fun watching this \\"laugh-fest.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on MIDI protocol details","review":"The book, while a bit dated (chapters on older keyboards' quirks and such may not be very useful to musicians with new gear), does contain excellent descriptions of all types of MIDI messages, as well as hardware implementation details and flowcharts for implementing MIDI data reception, in case you're writing a MIDI program or designing a MIDI hardware gadget.The MIDI protocol has remained essentially unchanged for long enough that this book is still a great reference for MIDI musicians, software and hardware designers."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby loves it!","review":"i just bought it a couple of weeks ago and my 2 year old baby wants me to read it to her everyday, she loves the flaps, the pictures, the whole story. she slmost knows it by heart we've read it so much.

The magic that was the Beatles was never matched by their solo 'careers'....Had the real spirit of the age departed by the end anyway?...However, some solo efforts, like 'Flaming Pie', 'Ram', 'Band on the Run', 'Walls and Bridges' and 'Cloud Nine', had highlights. ....As to this album: lack of logical sequence or continuity of tracks; slapdash production; lyrically threadbare and shallow; poor structure in some songs; lacking in joy. Actually, listen to the last 30 seconds of 'Rinse the Raindrops', which has potential of what might have been... If only.."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"Considering one of his best albums came before it 'Flaming Pie', this is a very weak effort. It lacks the acoustic and melodic sounf of that album and tries to rock too much. 'Lonely road' 'Driving rain' all these songs are boring rock tunes.Even some of the ballads are weak- I don't like 'Froma lover to a friend' meandering and tuneless.The only songs to recommend this release are 'tiny bubble' which has a few nice chord changes, the romantic 'I do' which is what Macca does best, 'Your loving flame' is ok and the best song on the album is the wonderful 'Heather'.The last two tracks are, quite frankly painful. 'Rinse the raindrops' is so boring and pure over indulgence even from a Beatle. And 'Freedom' is absolutely terrible and as bas as 'give peace a chance', actually, probably even worse.A huge let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Driving rain?","review":"Paul McCartney's solo efforts can be defined by one word: mediocre. The composer known for such classics as 'Yesterday', 'Hey Jude', 'Let it Be', and 'Band on the Run' has turned in another subpar effort with 'Driving Rain'. While this CD does not rank as the worst effort of his solo carrer (see 'Wings Wild Life' or 'Pipes of Peace') it is far from his best. The lyrics throughout this CD are weak, uninteresting, and lacking of any depth. The melodies are catchy and the bass playing superb, but that is about it. The standouts are 'Freedom', 'Your Loving Flame', 'Driving Rain' and 'Lonely Road'.Macca finds will find this CD pleasing, safe, and catchy, but not anywhere near as appealing as his last release of original songs 'Flaming Pie'."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love ya Paul, but...","review":"As much as I love and respect The Beatles (and their individual careers), and being a musician of many years of experience, I have to admit I am a bit disappointed with this effort. The music is just not that good! This record does sound \\"fresh\\", as Paul intended, but the quality of the music and lyrics are still beneath his recent album, Flaming Pie, and certainly much of his earlier work. It sounds like Paul is in love again, and just getting a bit careless with his music! Only someone with his stature can get away with it and not have critics all over him. Good for him! I still hope Paul has many many more albums of quality music to come over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"What was this? Paul getting into a studio with a bunch of half written songs and then simply repeating the lines over and over and over and over?There was a time when Paul, or any post-fab-four for that matter, could put anything down on track and people would buy it. You've got to work harder than (and I quote)\\"...one, two, three, four, five, let's all go for a drive. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, let's go there and back again...\\" My God, and that was the HIT.

I don't \\"feel\\" this record at all. Every other McCartney album (and I have them all) has at least one or two cuts that rise up and call attention to themselves (even on \\"McCartney II\\"). I don't see it here. File this one next to \\"Sometime In New York City\\" and \\"Old Wave.\\" Paul can do so much better -- I hope this is an oddity, not a precedent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Silly Love Songs","review":"Paul has never needed the bite and cynical wit of John Lennon more than now. There are lovely bits of melody that float in and out of every song making it sound as if McCartney has too many melody lines with nowhere to put them. For sure, he has no lyrics to pair them with in this very trite, very silly bunch of songs. Each one has thirty seconds of greatness paired with two and a half minutes of balderdash! Get a lyricist, Paul, or a backyard critic to toughen you up! Too much sum with absolutely no substance. What a great disappointment for lovers of the man's previous work. Come on, Paul! Get back to where you used to be! We're waiting for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLOODY AWFUL!!","review":"I can't believe a talent of Paul's magnitude, the man who was 1/4 of the most influential band of all time, the man who gave us some of the 70's best pop/rock would turn out something even remotely close to this 'effort'. The majority of this sounds like outtakes that didn't make the rest of his albums. 'Driving Rain' isn't in the same league as 'Flaming Pie' and especially 'Off the Ground'. It's as if he's trying to appeal to the new age, non-melodic loving individuals who are RESPONSIBLE for making the Billboard Top 40 what it is today and has been the last 5 years. Only a die hard fan and perhaps a McCartney family member would find musical value in this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't done a thing since McCartney 2","review":"I have been really disappointed with McCartney since the mid-eighties.

What happened. I couldn't understand all the glowing reviews when confronted with hearing it. I mean, I even like \\"Wildlife\\". I forced myself to listen a couple times, a very unpleasant task. Is he trying to hard, or not at all? The songs are simplistic, the lyrics juvenile, and they go on forever and there are too many songs and the production and band are bad and..... I lent it to someone to listen to and I'm not in a hurry to get it back. Hopefully he has gotten it out of his system and the next one will be better, it couldn't be any worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, one of his best","review":"I read the reviews on Amazon, and wasn't sure if I should buy this CD. I hadn't heard any of the songs on the radio, and there can be quite a high degree of variability in the quality of McCartney's solo releases.I would place this in his top 5 easily. \\"Lonely Road\\" is a great song, and I hear a lot of real emotion in it, not a common thing in a McCartney song.Another favorite is \\"Heather\\". It just flows as if the song is exactly how it should be.\\"Freedom\\" is a nice way to end the CD. A good little anthem to remind us of the events of 2001. Don't often hear a fighting song from McCartney!I'm not saying that I loved these tracks on the first listening. I didn't. It probably took me 3 listenings before the songs grew on me. Give it a chance and it may grow on you too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Effort....","review":"It amazes me how so many people give this CD either \\"5 Stars\\" or \\"1 Star\\". This is not the perfect \\"classic\\" CD but it is far from being a \\"1\\". (I think the overall average of \\"4 Stars is accurate).Paul has given us a grab bag of styles and songs. Some of them work and some seem strained. Overall it is a worthy effort from this musical legend.On a CD that boasts 16 songs, I think we should almost feel like we are getting a 2 CD set for the price of one...Keep up the good work Paul and here's hopeing you tour again someday soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different But Still Strong","review":"I usually prefer Paul's more polished recordings over the ones he knocks out quickly but this one is still strong. His songs continue to work their way into my head in a way no other artist's songs can. Seems like the only way I can stop humming Magic is to start humming Lonely Road. One quibble, I think it runs out of steam at the end. Riding Into Jaiper should have been axed and Rinse the Raindrops is in need of editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better ,rougher and harder at times .","review":"Other reviewers prefer a softer Paul , this time he is rougher , he jams again ! and it seems that he is been listening to some good rock lately , because at moments this CD takes different turns into a harder territory , (thanks a lot Mr. McCartney).The Indian influenced song (Riding into Jaipur) is a great one(not for love song fans) and shows that he is still searching for something new , the Jam(Rinse the raindrops) is a phenomenal 10 minutes piece that reminds me at moments the great CD \\"The mirror ball\\" from Neil Young w/Pearl Jam.She's given up talking is a departure from Paul's classic sound and shows that there is hope to get a better album next time.The Hammond organ and the raw drums are alive and help the music feel more natural.Keep on listening good rock Paul , get some Radiohead and King Crimson and mix it with the White album and you will deliver a masterwork !!4 Stars because he still let a couple of silly love songs appear on the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY WHY WHY?????!!!","review":"IVE ALWAYS SAID YOU KNOW ITS TIME TO STOP WHEN YOU CAN NO LONGER DO THE THINGS YOUR FAMOUS FOR.....IN PAULS CASE ITS TIME.

Most of the songs I could only listen to for about 30 - 45 seconds before I had to go to the next track. Absolutely nothing that I heard interested me. It was very disappointing.

Save your money and buy something that has some energy and feeling to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Lost It Paul.","review":"I hate to see this happen again. It's like a nightmare that never ends. Another Paul McCartney record. Another flop. What a turn off! Every single time the man releases a new record you keep asking yourself: Will he make it this time? But nothing really happens. I'm sorry Paul. I'm still your fan. You've got one of the greatest voices, either for ballads or rock'n'roll standards, but you haven't written anything listenable from, let's say, \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", \\"Tomorrow\\" and the \\"Band On The Run\\" album. Let's face it. This was thirty years ago. You don't have to prove anything else to anybody. You've done it great, but you've lost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1, 2, 3, 4 Can't Stand Him Anymore!","review":"(...) Flaming Pie was weak, and Drivng Rain is simply horrible. (...)

But that would cost money, and Paul is a reknown cheapskate who would rather \\"let the words take care of themselves.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks inspiration","review":"This album was a huge disapointment. It simply lacks every element I am looking for in a well crafted album; melody, intelligent arrangements, production... I much prefer the Flaming Pie album, with the aid and influence of producer Jeff Lynne on some of the tracks. Ironically enough Driving Rain is just a good example of someone who has gone dry artistically speaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very indifferent","review":"Every new album from Paul is worth waiting for. Until they are released. I haven't even been able to fully listen to Driving rain because it doesn't touch me. Apart from track 1,2,3,11 and 12, these song are totally indifferent. They have no inner strength, they have nothing to express (Spinning on an Axis is pure rubbish). Every artists only task in life is to make good music. Do not fill our ears with indifference, Paul. Please. We are your fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"and when it rains, it bores........","review":"This guy was a Beatle? You'd never know it listening to this garbage. \\"Flaming Pie\\" was a surprise hit with many people when it was released because it had a few good songs on it, unlike the typical McCartney album which usually has none. Paul returns true to form with this disaster. \\"Freedom\\" is one of the worst songs ever written. \\"Your Loving Flame\\" is a half-baked love song which never gets off the ground. \\"Driving Rain\\" is the epitome of dumb lyrics combined with a forgettable embarrassing tune. Of all the four Beatles, Paul has had the most disappointing solo career. In the 70's he sold well, but he has never had an album like \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" that was withstood the test of time. I know I was not expecting much, but I was hoping for better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mc Cartney at his most boring...","review":"Paul Mc Cartney & The Beatles are unquestionabally one of my favorite artists of all time. Having said that, this album simply bores the hell out of me. I could barely get through the whole album, I was praying for it to end. I thought \\"Riding into Jaipur\\" was going to be a great instrumental song, and then Paul started singing and just ruined it for me. I eagerly buy any new release from a former Beatle, but this one just doesn't do it for me. I'm so glad I only paid $5 for this, used. If you want excellent present-day Mc Cartney, get yourself a copy of \\"Flaming Pie\\". Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul-ternative","review":"It's not surprising that on his first album of all original material since wife Linda's death, Paul is exploring the darker side of the spectrum. \\"She's Given Up Talking\\", \\"Lonely Road\\"- many of these tunes would get airplay on alternative radio if someone else had penned them. But it's not all dark. \\"Tiny Bubble\\", \\"Your Way\\", and the title track are trademark McCartney pop masterpieces. This is the freshest album in Paul's output since 1989's \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\". All of the session musicians on the record are a good deal younger than Paul, and they give it a noticeable edge as well. A great album for Paul fans of all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Back!!","review":"This is Paul McCartney's most consistent and solid album, start to finish in ages!! Many of the tunes are very popy and catchy.

There are some decent songs here--about six by my count. But the production is so metallic and fussy, it's virtually unlistenable. And this is the first McCartney album with bad vocals. I know he thinks he's being bluesy but he merely sounds ragged and worn. He needs to care for his wonderful voice and not give into age. This CD is \\"Back to the Egg\\" and \\"Press to Play\\" all over again. At least, McCartney gave us the wonderful \\"Flaming Pie\\" and \\"Run Devil Run\\" in the past few years. And I still listen to \\"Ram\\" and \\"McCartney.\\" Here's hoping that next time he finds his way home again, takes a little time in writing the songs, and grabs back the production reins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Driving Rain","review":"I have really not thought much of Paul McCartney's music since his early years as a solo artist and with Wings. I read the reviews, and thought, maybe I should give him another chance. After listening to the album, my original opinion was reinforced. The songs are not well-thought out, they are mostly \\"silly love songs\\" and seem like they were simply cranked out to fill space. There are maybe two melodies that are worthwile, but the lyrics aren't as introspective or thoughtful as one would hope from a musician of his experience and age. I'm sorry I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hang it up Paul","review":"I've never been a fan of the Beatles or Paul, but I went into listening to this album with an open mind. I must say, however, that I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I expected MUCH better from a \\"legend\\". This is considered good? Man, I would hate to hear a bad album. Every song sounds the same. Where's the variety? And what's up with the lyrics on the title track, \\"One two three four five, let's go for a drive\\"? Come on! The sixties are over. Stupid, meaningless lyrics aren't hip anymore. Please, don't waste your money on this. You will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Older but not wiser","review":"First, I will say that I was impressed with the production quality. The instrumentation is clear and powerful. Beyond that, there is really nothing to recommend. And who are these people who actually like this stuff? Have they ever heard of The Beatles or listened to classic Paul albums like Band on the Run? How can anybody not hear the distinction between songs like Good Day Sunshine, I've Just Seen A Face, and Maybe I'm Amazed and the stuff on this album? There is not a single memorable song to be heard. Obviously, Paul is trying hard to be relevant. At his age and in light of his past glories, what is he still trying to prove? Also, what a pity that Paul doesn't use his natural and beautiful singing voice anymore. Instead, we get a ridiculously contrived pseudo-rock yelp on every song. Paul should listen to \\"Revolver\\" for inspiration or maybe consider retirement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest CD in years","review":"I love McCartney, but this album is the weakest in years. Nowhere close to Flaming Pie. Can't sell it used fast enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst effort (?) in years","review":"I've got all his albums and this is by far the worst dribble I've ever heard! I'm so disappointed in this I can't stand it. This is as bad as Flaming Pie was good. Mr. McCartney, if this is the best you can do at this point in your career, give up, go back to the farm, and don't keep teasing us with you on again/off again attempts at producing consistantly \\"good\\" albums. Honestly, there's not one good song on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just what we needed: MORE bilge.","review":"What can I say? This is another factory batch of McCartney post-Beatles bilge. None of it is nearly as agonizingly awful as Wings bilge, but nevertheless it has no content whatsoever--no lyrical content and also NO MUSICAL CONTENT. The closest Paul McCartney ever came, as far as I can determine, to a decent solo album is \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\", and I recommend you buy that instead (but only listen to half of it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe one of my favorites...","review":"OK - I'm one of those old farts who watched the Beatles LIVE on Ed Sullivan almost 50 years ago so I'm a certified Beatles addict. And for further full disclosure - I'm a McCartney fan. I didn't listen to this album when it first came out. I bought it in 2008 based on a review here at Amazon. This album is McCartney inspired... he was just starting out with Heather (OK-OK... we all know now about her) and he was on a mission to express his \\"love\\" for her. SO many great songs on this album. Not ONE that I hate. If you're a certified Beatles addict (and a McCartney fan), buy it. Trust me. And listen to it several times. It'll grow on you really fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aloft","review":"There is nothing like a crazy Beatle mixing concoctions..Thanks Liverpudlian for this drunken, stoned and psychedelic bounce...It is much needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"This record reminds me the spirit of ABBEY ROAD B side and RAM. Full of ideas and bright all over. As those records mentioned probably there is not a HEY JUDE nor a BAND ON THE RUN but is substituted by an endless sucetion of bright ideas and energy. The songs are not obvious and raise the interest to dig in because, beside other considerations, everything sounds new and fresh. Artistically a step forward, not pretentious but intuitive. My fabs so far: About you, Magic, from a lover, and the hymn freedom (now he's got his \\"give peace a chance\\" live as well) and ... well it is all great including the experiment Rinse the raindrops (this is like Helter Skelter, you might like it or hate it). Excellent and talented record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very personal new record from Paul","review":"Alright ... just gave a listen to \\"Driving Rain\\" on little computer speakers .... nothing too offensive or annoying on it. Song called \\"About You\\" rocks, and \\"Magic\\" may very well be a single. Near end, the track \\"Your Loving Flame\\" is very nice, too.Amazing track is the next to last one called \\"Rinse The Raindrops\\"; it's a 10 minute + jam of a track that may very well be the most raucous thing Paul has done since, dare I say it, \\"Helter Skelter\\".The whole record seems to be a full outpouring of all of Paul's works over the past few years, rather unedited and unabashed -- he can release and express whatever he wants. It also is extremely personal-sounding, with very direct lyrics, much in Lennon's vein of singing clearly about himself and his own experiences.It is topped off by the added live \\"Freedom\\" track.All in all, pretty good for a 58 year old rock legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul is back","review":"This album is quite a departure from the usual McCartney fare. It's content is light years away from the fluff and comercialism of Off the ground, and at times more brilliant than the best moments of Flaming Pie. At first I was taken aback by the overall experimental feel of the album, but the more I listen, the more I like. Particlar favorites so far include: \\"Lonely Road,\\" \\"Magic,\\" the very Wings-like \\"About you\\", and the very Beatle-like \\"From a lover to a friend.\\" The title track is the albums best rocker, and the addition of \\"Freedom\\" from the NYC concert is a nice bonus to an already fine album. Overall, one of the most creative McCartney albums to come out in quite some time. A must buy for Paul fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Driving Rain is great!!!","review":"This is one of Paul's most solid albums. From \\"Lonely Road\\" right through to \\"Freedom\\" ,\\"DRIVING RAIN\\" has absolutely no filler! Each track is unique(unlike most albums out there nowadays). Paul still has that uncanny ability to deliver original melodies time and time again. Some of the tracks like \\"About You\\" and \\"Rinse the Raindrops\\" are as hard driving as ANYTHING Paul has ever released. The ballad \\"From A Lover To A Friend\\" is as chilling as his love song for Heather \\"Your Loving Flame\\" is warm. The title track Driving Rain is the perfect pop song with Paul's pulsating bass line beating throughout. There are also songs like \\"Spinning On An Axis\\" and \\"Riding To Jaipur\\" that prove yet again that Paul is at ease composing any style of music. All in all Driving Rain is a wonderful album that is an example of what a genius like Sir Paul McCartney can create when he has the inspiration to do so. Do yourself a favor: BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His most \\"Beatlesque\\" album in years.","review":"This is Paul's most \\"Beatlesque\\" album in quite some time. The jamming \\"Rinse the Raindrops\\" could easily fit on Abbey Road while \\"Riding Into Jaipur\\" could fit easily on The White Album. My personal favorite is the moody and slightly disturbing \\"She's Given Up Talking\\"...a great song!The album as a whole is very upbeat and fast moving. The love songs are still here but don't slow down the pace and spirit of the album. An excellent album! Play it loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"May Rate A 5 With Further Listening","review":"Paul is experimenting, with great success, on this new recording. I very much like the musicians and the bluesy, almost jazz feeling throughout. This could be a Sting album, for the way that it sounds. Paul's bass has never sounded better, and it's the best playing that I've heard from him since Abbey Road.I had a feeling that, sadly, Paul's music would improve with Linda's passing.\\"From A Lover To A Friend\\" is not the best track, by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"This CD is the biggest disappointment I've ever gotten from Paul McCartney. Sure, there have other less than stellar efforts, but they usually had some saving grace - some small gem from one of the greatest songwriters ever. And his sometimes embarrassing lyrics have been saved by gorgeous melodies. Not here.The songs are almost totally uninteresting melodically, and the lyrics are the worst. For example, \\"Driving Rain\\" begins with \\"12345 Let's go for a drive\\" and goes downhill from there.Lyrics on many of the others are sappy tributes to the new love he has found, but she and the listener deserve better.Take a pass on this one and buy \\"Run Devil Run\\" or \\"Wingspan\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless (as usual)","review":"I checked this out of the library and listened to it all the way through twice. (\\"Tiny Bubble\\", the only interesting song here --still completely meaningless -- I listened to three times.) There are no melodies whatsoever. The lyrics are utterly banal. The song that really irks me, though, is \\"Freedom\\". This one was obviously thrown together as a cynical exploitation piece and tacked on. It's astounding how low some people will stoop."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT WAS HE THINKING???","review":"After barely getting through this entire CD (and thank god I was doing chores at the time so it wasn't a complete waste), I couldn't help but wonder if Paul still has the ability to critique his own work and compare it to milestones like Red Rose Speedway, Venus and Mars, and Band On the Run. It tempts one to think he has abandoned his standards and only releases records out of habit now. Let's put it another way: This disc is only for the sycophantic rabid fan who worships every turd Mac lays. Find it used, check it out at your public library, or avoid it altogether unless you're a neurotic completist rounding out your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reaching and painful","review":"Although Paul McCartney is an icon in the music world, this CD is by far one of his worst compliation of songs that I've ever listened to.

Anything, Sir Paul does I love it, he's a great person and a talent writer, singer,composser and musician. I wish him all the happiness life can bring. When the Beatles first came to the US, I was a died hard \\"Elvis\\" fan, still am, however, Sir Paul is now tired with \\"Elvis\\" in my heart. I saw his concert on 4th of July at RFK stadium, in Washington, DC, wow! what a concert. I got the same feeling seeing Sir Paul, as I did when I saw \\"Elvis\\" in concert, both a once in a life time concert. Paul, be safe and happy always.

Keep singing, always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back Paul !!!","review":"Driving Rain signals the return of Paul McCartney.It has been years since we have had a brand new album.Paul is back in form musically.His melodies and bass playing have never been better.Some songs may have weak lyrics but a few others are pretty good,especially the songs dealing with Linda(From A Lover to a Friend,Magic).Paul tries some different styles.\\"Your Way\\" has a country flavor,\\"Riding into Jaipur\\" has sitars like a George Harrison song.My favorites are \\"Lonely Road\\",\\"Magic\\",\\"About You\\" and \\"Heather\\".I liked \\"Rinse the Raindrops\\" but admit it would have been better if 2-3 minutes were cut from its 10 minutes.\\"Freedom\\" is a nice addition,it will always be a reminder of that wonderful night in NYC.Finally,this CD gets better with each listen.I think it is in the top 5 McCartney solo albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best work since The Beatles","review":"This CD is the best work he has done in over 20 years.Any of these songs could be on a Beatles album.There is a freshness here that has been missing on Pauls worksince the '70s. Flaming Pie, Flowers in the dirt were goodalbums, but typical for Paul, and not much new, and don't even touch the quality of this CD.This album is a total, welcomed departure from old worn out,song formulas he has used, until now. This album gets betterwith each listening, and I am sure will be a must have inany Beatles or McCartney fan's collection.My favorite album had been Venus and Mars, good rock album.This is now my new favorite McCartney album. Good to hearPaul is back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Artistic Rainbow","review":"I've been a McCartney fan since the early sixties. I loved the LP's Ram, Band On The Run and thought that Flaming Pie was brilliant. Now, about Driving Rain. I can't get the songs out of my head. Driving Rain is the most captivating cd I've ever heard. It sneaks up on you and then all of a sudden you're hooked. I hope George Harrison heard \\"Riding Into Jaipur\\". I think of him everytime I hear this song. \\"About You\\" is my favorite, but all the songs paint a different picture. Some with bright colors, some with dark. Paul's love for Linda was more than his fans ever understood. It was \\"Magic\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightnen UP!","review":"Some really pitiful reviews here.Lennon would have loved the loose sound of this record. And if the melodies aren't initially catching, listen to it a few more times. They will be then. Flaming Pie sounded great to me at first, and now sounds dull and uninteresting. Driving Rain grows on you. Great vocals and playing.Get off of Paul about the lyrics! Didn't Lennon write \\"Goo Goo Goo Joob\\" on \\"I Am The Walrus??\\" Didn't REM write about \\"Shiny Happy People?\\" Have you ever listened to the words to \\"Whole Lotta Shaking Goin On?\\" Rock lyrics are typically un-deep.Listen to this one a few times and you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of Paul's worst albums","review":"Worst if not the worst album.

Being one of Paul's biggest fans since day one, and have followed his musical career, I just can't see why people think this ablum is so great! It was put together in 5 weeks..Okay, fair enough.. The actual album is all about his new found love of his life, Heather, and nothing wrong with that.. But really, I did expect something more melodic, poppy, and a few more catchy tunes than the title track Driving Rain.. It sounds, rough, and out of tune..The only track thats really worth anything is \\"Freedom\\" - and with his stature could surely offer more to the 9/11 Relief Fund than one song. Whatever happened to the magic in his albums like, Back to the Egg (a total Masterpiece, Venus and Mars, and even Ram! I think Paul, you are running out of steam. I love all your work, and everything that you have done.. But Driving Rain drives me mad, because you can do su much better..What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let it ME","review":"Paul McCartney's DRIVING RAIN CD is biographical. The opening track deals with painful obsessing since his wife's passing, while \\"From A Lover To A Friend\\" expresses the writer's reluctance to give his heart to another. The album's title cut finds Paul caught up in an exuberant new love. More quite personal songs follow, perhaps to the listener's disadvantage, especially in light of the disintegration of McCartney's second marriage. This is a highly self-possessed album, too much so.The oddly grainy B&W; images interspersed among the accompanying booklet's lyrics should have been an object lesson that keeping things vague just may be beneficial to all concerned.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 67:10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Good songs, and a great band.

He displays his talent very well on many of the cuts on this disc. Everlasting Love and With You are fabulous ballads with a soulful undercurrent. While Head over Heels qualifies more as a mid tempo love song. But still worthy of 5 stars. Then there's the more up tempo Bad Girl which probably rates 4 stars. And on the slammin side you've got Baby Love and Let me love you which are great dance tracks and where we see some of Tony's more playful nature. The rest of the album although not bad is less than exemplary.Well worth a purchase but not quite a plug and play disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony Terry","review":"Love Tony Terry, can't remember if one of his songs had a phrase that said \\" I can't stand the pain\\".

Music for People shows a band acquiring a craft at lightspeed. Not a bad cut amidst its 12 tracks, MFP opens rocking (\\"The Last One Alive\\", \\"Free\\") and pauses occasionally to catch its breath. Curtailing they're love of background vocalists who sound too damn much like the Trio Bulgaria, songwriter Jon Crosby has upped the quota of power chords, Nine Inch Nails thrash, and late-era Depeche Mode sonics. Not a shoddy combo."},{"rating":"2","title":"More mainstream, still really good","review":"It sounds like Jon Crosby got the Christian theme out of his system on the debut. I kinda miss it on \\"Music for People,\\" but that's just me. Most of the first album's strengths carry into the new one, but the sound has moved from Nine Inch Enigma to more uptempo, Beatlesque power pop. The drums are pulled back, the strings play a bigger role than before, and the industrial angst gives way to more radio-friendly tunes. It happens: the passion and urgency driving a band's first release kind of subside when they become more established and have some breathing room. I just hope Crosby didn't change his approach for the critics who panned the first album as \\"marijuana-induced\\" and \\"pretentious.\\" \\"Music for People\\" is smooth and catchy, but I liked his crisis-of-faith mode a little more. Oh yeah, Ryan Policky nailed it - skip \\"The Gates of Rock 'N Roll\\" and you'll be alright."},{"rating":"2","title":"VAST, without a doubt.","review":"VAST, jon crosby could not have picked a better title for his music experience. Music For People is a truly refreashing album that picks you up and takes you to new found heights of awareness. Not many other artisits can combine so many music styles and sounds and produce genuinley amazing music. From hard rock(Free) to complete chill(Lady Of My Dreams) this album is worth a listen to as there is so much manufactured junk out there. Some may say the MFP is not as good as the first album(VAST), I disagree. It is different but it is still VAST and the lyrics, Johns voice and musical arrangement will make you want to wear this record out. ENJOY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please listen to this CD","review":"I remember meeting John (the back bone of VAST) when I was around 15 when we all lived in Sonoma County. At that age I knew that this man was absolutly amazingly rich with musical inspiration and talent and I couldnt wait for him to break though. When I was visiting Spain I had his demo with me and even they loved it. I am in the army now in Korea and we have a radio station here called AFKN and his songs are getting more and more play time and is becoming a hit with many soldiers. Its a fantastic mixture of goth, rock, and symphony and well worth it. I have only listened to some of the songs via internet but all I can say is FABULOUS!!!!!! Please listen to this CD and his past CD, its fantastic. Good job John."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par album that gets John Crosby more exposure","review":"In 1998, VAST released the stunning \\"Visual Audio Sensory Theater,\\" a great mix of pop, rock, industrial, and ethereal tendencies. No one really noticed. Although VAST was on a major label, they recieved little recognition from mainstream radio or TV and their album could be found in discount bins everywhere. \\"Music For People,\\" VAST's second release, actually has a perfect title. It seems it was made for the mainstream music consumer rather than as a new expression of VAST's unique musical vision. It's not the worst album ever, but gone are the driving industrial beats and rare are the ethereal samples that made their first album so great. Instead, we are presented with an album of pure rock/pop (the first song sounds WAY too much like the Goo Goo Dolls for me). BTW, since this album's release it's been all over the radio and VAST has toured with such mediocre bands as Eve 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great - Wall to Wall","review":"Beautiful work if you like the Vast style.

I was expecting a great new cd since the first one was amazing. But it turned out to be just what the album title is...music for people.

In other words, it makes great background music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Short and Too Wimpy.....","review":"Those expecting the gothic/metal/brooding sound of VASTs first album will be strongly disappointed with this sophmore offering. The 12 tracks on this album all average 3 and 1/2 minutes and while some are quite catchy they never are given enough time to fully grab the listener (i.e. Perfect Circles \\"Mer de Noms\\"). 40 minutes of music on a CD is really quite a rip off especially with 12 songs.

And I don't call it boring because of a lack of skin, or sex or anything like that. The movie is a plodder. It plods along. I think parts were really nothing more than time-filling by the film makers. The scene with Alice and her shrink was particularly hard to sit through.

Society was much more open/liberal re: sexuality and the challenging of stereotypes, such as the long-standing double standards afforded to men.My '4 star' review may be slightly high, but what motivates me to do so has more to do with the subject this movie takes on, its willingness to challenge the status quo and collective consciousness of the public at that time, as well as the honesty in which it's delivered.The final scene is hardly climactic compared with the latest Bond film but, like much of the film, there's an authentic message there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the purchase","review":"Bought it because Fred Weller was in it.

It said, \\"Guarding your mind, heart and body in a sex-saturated world,\\" and that sounded perfect. Before giving it to her, I flipped through the pages and read a little bit here and there. To my astonishment, it went WAY beyond telling young women how important is is to live their lives in a Christian fashion. There was a section of the book on the evils of masturbation. I expected the book to contain reasons why sexual purity was important, ideas and tips for protecting virginity, etc... Needless to say, I'm glad I read this before I gave it as a gift -- I would have been SO embarrassed.

One of the chapter headings should have been \\"You'll go blind if you masturbate!\\" Really. It's that bad. Stay far, far away...."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"I'm 26 years old and for the past 5 years, I have compromised myself for the sake of being in a relationship. I have decided that I do not want to do this anymore and recently began searching for reading material to help me (along with my Bible of course). Yesterday, when I saw this book, I felt compelled to buy it. I'm on page 43...and so far, so good. I must admit that it's made me blush a few times because the writings are so frank, but I appreciate Mrs. Ethridge's honesty especially since my parents we unable to counsel me in this manner. I would recommend that parents read it along with their children so that they can answer the many questions that will be asked...and of course, the many times that blushing will happen. Happy reading :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Every Young Woman","review":"This book was such a fresh breath of air. Shannon is a great writer and truly cares for the reader.

You WILL NOT be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Practical, Godly Resource","review":"This book was direct and fully backed by scripture. The authors broach subjects that few talked about when I was a teenager (masturbation, pornography and boundaries). I'm using this book for a young ladies home group I'm leading and I know it's going to reach a lot of these ladies. Excellent, practical book for teenage girls from all cultures and backgrounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally out of touch","review":"I found myself checking the copywrite date on the book because it seemed to have been written long, long ago. The pop culture references are from days past. I noticed this book got a lot of positive reviews from older women and that makes a lot of sense to me.I will say that this book is NOT inappropriate for any young lady over the age of 12. there is nothing described in the book that a girl over the age of 12 hasn't already been exposed to. Believe me Moms, as much as you might not want to believe it, your daughter does know."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"This book was very dissapointing,the writings on the history of redwork are good but the designs offered are very basic and generic and there are very few color pictures or examples of redwork quilts,overall I was very dissapointed with this book and would advise others not to pay the high price that sellers are currently asking for it,there are much better books out there on redwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"Since I helped in the process of the book, I feel it is a comprehensive study of the history of Penny Squares.

His simple yet eloquent artwork achieves a range of emotions; he may be today's most economical cartoonist. Even more remarkably, he earns laughs without resorting to the gross-out humour so prevalent in today's comic world.Twice a year, McDonnell features a week of \\"Shelter Stories.\\" They're bittersweet and sometimes heartbreaking, and serve as an invaluable public service.I never tire of the adventures of Earl and Mooch. Of course, it helps to be a dog owner and animal lover! But I can't imagine anyone not being won over by McDonnell's lovable gang of \\"Mutts.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality has declined...","review":"I have become greatly dissapointed McDonell's work in recent years. In the first couple of collections, Mutts was right on target, witty and fresh, but now it seems that Mutts has become preachy, and cloyingly sweet. Most of us already have helpless guilt from reading newspaper articles on vanishing tigers, do we really need it in a comic strip? Even the artwork seems lacking, as if McDonell was late for a deadline and did a rush job. The Mutts creator definitely needs new ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Hundred Percent Pure Fun!","review":"I bought this because I tend to like British sex comedies. This movie is just simple fun. It is about two perfume chemist who stumble upon a formula that women find irresistible. I am certain Sandra Bullocks movie Love Potion No 9 ripped this movie off as this movie was made first. Just imagine the fun two average guys who probably have never had much luck with women would have if they had a scent they could apply and make themselves irresistible to the fairer sex. A very fun movie. I probably watch this 3 or 4 time per year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blind Justice is masterful.","review":"James Scott Bell does it again with \\"Blind Justice\\". He combines courtroom drama, intrigue, interesting characters, and inspiration in a book I couldn't put down. You gotta love Howie and Lindsay, even as you see their faults. For their faults are our faults--meaning their triumphs are our triumphs? If you like John Grisham, you'll find yourself reading all of Bell's courtroom novels as you impatiently wait for his next one. My request is that people pass the word so Grisham can have a run for his money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictable, sub-par character development","review":"While I appreciate the author's attempt to write an entertaining Christian novel, and while the theme of the novel is very relevant, it was apparent to me fairly early on what direction the story line was going. I kept waiting for it to take a truly unexpected turn, and it never did. Also, I think a better job could have been done of portraying the inner struggles of the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lakes Buoy Tenders","review":"This is just a marvelous, definitive book. Both my Father and my Uncle were Captains of Buoy Tenders which worked on the Great lakes and the St. Lawrence River. Being born in 1931, I have boyhood memories of the actual tenders and life in the Lighthouse Service. Not only does the book enhance and confirm my memories but it provides much information I did not know. I have purchased copies for my brother and my two sons. If it is still available I may buy more copies, in the future. I have been working on the genealogy of my family and this book ties in with our heritage. My boyhood impression was of a little Lighthouse Service going into a big Coast Guard. Now I realize that impression was wrong and the addition of the Lighthouse Service, in 1939, almost doubled the Coast Guard."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the REAL Mariah Carey","review":"For those of you who are too young to have grown up with Mariah Carey from the beginning, there was once actually a time when she seriously could be called a \\"real\\" musician. Her multi-platinum debut album does a fine job of showing what someone with her musical talent is capable of when you don't have rappers and money-hungry producers breathing down your back. Her vocal histrionics on the #1 smash \\"Vision Of Love\\" are still hard to top, the more subdued but no less brilliant \\"Love Takes Time\\" is a beautiful ballad that is well distinguishable from other songs that try to sound like it, and the bouncy, danceable \\"Sent From Up Above\\" is still fresher sounding than any midtempo or uptempo song that she's made in the 2000s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah","review":"This is an excellent album... i dont have to tell all you Mariah Carey fans that!!!

At the NBAs, on 'Aresino Hall', on the radio, and on \\"Mariah Carey\\", 'Vision of Love' is the most classic song of 'Miss MC'. All the singles of this CD went to number one (except for 'There's Got to Be a Way'only a single in Europe, but the best song on the album)and they are \\"Vision of Love\\", \\"Someday\\", \\"I Don't Wanna Cry\\", and \\"Love Takes Time\\". Other underrated songs on this CD are 'Vanishing' (I sang it for the school talent show), 'Sent from Up Above', 'You Need Me', 'There's Got to Be a Way', and of course 'Prisoner'. A wonderful all around CD. If you call yourself a Mariah Fan and you don't have this CD, you are a liar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Mariah Carey's Debut!","review":"This is an inspirational CD as well as an indicator of Mariah's great talent. I enjoy hearing her voice proceed up and down the scale and I love the Gospel flavor on some of her songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Mariah's Best","review":"This is one of my all time favorite Mariah Carey albums. The lyrics are superb and her singing is mind-blowing. I whole heartedly recommend this to any Mariah fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for beginning, but not of career","review":"I bought this album just after I bought the #1's. Vision Of Love, is a pretty ballad I didn't like when I first heard it, but it's a good song. There's Got To Be A Way is my favorite song from the album, I like the choir singing in the end. I don't Wanna Cry is a little bit boring, but it was #1 in US. Someday, hummm, I like the Unplugged and the Extended versions of this song. Vanishing is a classic of Mariah's best vocal songs. All In Your Mind is my second favorite song from the album, cause it has dance sound. Alone In Love is not so good as the others, but I like a bit. You Need Me, when I first listened to this song, I remembered of the times in 1990, and I thought I had listened to this song before, it's very cool. Sent From Up Above and Prisoner are two songs that I like to listen. Love Takes Time is a good ballad I like to sing.I'm a big fan of Mariah Carey's albums, so if I give her five stars, I will be unfair, cause nobody's so perfect like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"its not that bad but do better in the pictures","review":"hey the pictures are great and they look good but you can do better"},{"rating":"2","title":"I changed my mind...:)","review":"Going back to this CD it was easy to find that this effort is pretty powerful. Even the songs that I didn't care for before have really grown on me. Some songs are stronger than others but most are great. My favorites in no order are \\"Prisoner\\", \\"Vision Of Love\\", \\"Love Takes Time\\" and \\"I Don't Wanna Cry\\". At first I thought there were only some standouts but like I said in my review title I changed my mind.If anyone wants to see Mariah at her best look to Daydream her 5th studio album.--Adrian4.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new under the sun","review":"Singers like Whitney Houston, Celine Dion and Mariah are talented, and Mariah Carey is notable for her broad vocal range. But what gets me about all of these artists is the frightfully unoriginal albums and sounds they put out. Each gets some forgettable pap songs to exercise their vocal gymnastics on, sings their carefully coached guts out over a shmaltzy synthesized arrangement the basic sound of which *hasn't changed* in easy listening music since 1982, and sells 8 million albums. It's easy to see why these kinds of things keep getting produced, as they are so popular. But sometimes I wish the public would demand something new; these talents could be put to much more daring use."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOME OF THE MOST MELLOW THINGS EVER!","review":"look, i'm not a fan of this kind of music, but there's 1 or 2 songs by britney that i can argue...3 or 4 from madona...but Mariah is so mellow that turns impossible to hear any one of her melodies...the love desperate screams and the total romantic lyrics are really anoying so stay far far away from this mellow anomality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE STOP THE HORRIBLE SCREACHING !!!!!","review":"When is this terrible \\"singer\\" going to retire?!!!.I cant stand it anymore.Music should be beautiful,this is utter rubbish!."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst debut albums ever","review":"i cannot remember listening to a more lousy debut album from any artist than this awful cd from this woman with a voice like a shrieking pig.this awful woman made it big only due to her husband tommy mottola a record label bigwig.songs like i dont want to cry sound dated and boring.avoid this fiasco of an album.not recommended at all.no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"HER HIGH NOTES ARE NOT DELIGHTFUL, THEY'RE SIMPLY TERRIBLE","review":"Mariah wants us to believe she is a birdie to wake up us every morning by her horrible squeek. Her debut album is a mess, she wants to be Taylor Dayne, she wants to be Whitney, and at the end we all know she wanted to be a ho from the ghetto. Vision of Love a treat for the ederly, she inspired Snoop with this but in what way?...the original record didn't included LOVE TAKES TIME, that's because the recorded another try to be hit, so the album will actually hit....Brenda K. Starr must be biting herself, cos her former background vocalist got more attention than her, life sometimes sux...this album is NOT REAL, cos MARIAH say so, she said that she wanted other type of music...hummmmmmmmmmmm so that makes this another fake record in the industry, with a birdie song, bye bye birdie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah's Best Album By Far.","review":"Mariah's debut album is her best album to date. Although, with the exception of her last two albums I think all of her albums are great. On her last two album you can't really call what she does singing because she just mumbles incohearently. In my opinion if you want a great Mariah album start with this, you won't be disappointed, I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Debutriah","review":"Perhaps the greatest debut by any artist; awesome vocals, great writing.

It was pretty good nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential film reading!","review":"This is an extremely enlightening book for movie lovers as well as aspiring filmmakers. It is refreshing to read about directors talking candidly about their craft with a peer. It is neither boring like some of the more technical books out there nor is it selfserving like books by lone directors. It does not hurt that most of my favorite directors are featured here. The book was recommended to me, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in filmmaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"KILLER and I mean KILLER workout!!!!","review":"This workout is one tough tape! It is not for the beginning exerciser, although beginners could use it without weights and work their way up. I have had this tape for over 3 years, and it still makes me sore the day after I do it. The workout consists of some very tough lower body exercises (leg presses on tall box, lunges, squats, hover squats, dips, and more) that are sure to take the wiggle out of your thighs and make you sweat buckets at the same time. For this workout you will need a square-shaped 12, 14 or 17-inch step box, as this is required for completing the tall box leg presses, which comprise a large amount of the tape, and which really really work the glutes and hips effectively)....In my opinion (and in the opinoin of several others I have chatted with regarding Standing Legs) this is the toughest tape the Firm has ever created. Use it, and as the Firm states...you will see results within 10 workouts, guaranteed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laissez les bons temps Boulez!","review":"found this sucker in the cutout ben at Walmart right next to the greatest hits of 1720. well this music by mister boulay sounds like it could have be written in 19!20! i really like it how it sounds like a jesus rainbow at times. sometimes it reminds me of my daydreams right before I nod off.I definately recommend this and yule like the cool picture of the slinky on the front cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"bought as a gift for a very happy recipient!","review":"These same shoes are sold in our local sporting goods store for $60+, so the price can't be beat.

Now instead of helping to set bad guys free, he leads a team of young, up-and-coming lawyers that puts criminals behind bars. He also has custody of his 16-year old daughter, and routinely goes head-to-head with the DA (Jeri Ryan).James Woods at his best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shark-Season One","review":"I loved this series and was totally disappointed when they took it off. I had missed several parts of the series and have really enjoyed catching up. I am still at a loss as to why it was cancelled!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great Show!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I absolutely love this show. My favorites shows are Shark and The Closer. Even though I watched the first season, I bought Season one DVD from Amazon.com and just finished watching the entire series. I had missed several small things so I was so glad I ordered it. You must not miss the last show of the season \\"Wayne's World 2: Revenge of the Shark\\". In an episode mid-series, Shark lost a case about a serial killer. This same serial killer is arrested and tried again for yet killing another girl. DO NOT MISS THE LAST 5 MINUTES. I could not believe what I was watching. The only thing I don't like is the daughter storyline. Every time her \\"story\\" is on I tend to lose interest. I am hoping they will drop that line in future seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"Originally I wanted to watch this show because of one particular person in the show. Now that I have watched Season One and keeping up with Season Two I have gotten more interested in the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shark is awesome!!!","review":"Man this show rocks!!! James Woods is freakin funny at times and brilliant at others. The story will keep you coming back for more and there are plenty of little plot twists that will surprise you when you least expect it. I started watching this by myself but by the time i was at the end of the season...there was like 3 to 4 other people in my room every night watching it with me...it's a great show!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Television","review":"In an age of reality television - consisting anywhere from choosing bisexual partners, watching MTV wannabee starlets or families with swapped moms to surviving in the wilds of foreign countries - Shark is entertainment with laughs, sexuality, crime and drama. James Woods and his cast of young, attractive, savvy, intelligent lawyers battle criminals through courtroom drama while spicing up voids with appropriate sexual tensions. In short, it's worth the investment and it's commercial-free. Buy it!

The JR and stepmother plotline is trite, predictable, as well as the Nolan and Barbie plotline. Date always telegraphs what's going to happen next, leaving no suspense. The only mildly interesting character is Romer, but Date make him act out of character and illogically.This was also the problem with Date's later novel, Smokeout, although I didn't quite see it then. Date doesn't let his characters free to be themselves. He doesn't respect them. He puts them in straitjackets. Frankly, if this guy weren't a journalist with personal contacts, no one would publish him, and I don't care what nice things Hiaasen says on the book jackets. You want to read REAL comedy in the tradition of Hiaasen, read TIM DORSEY! His stuff is REALLY funny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is my opinion the the edition and not the performance","review":"The Victrola series is cheap and not well executed. While the performances are great, they are not given justice by the ugly covers and CDs that show no imagination in their creation. Happily, I have this in vinyl too. It has a textured jacket, a pic of Mr. Leinsdorf attached to it like a photo album, and real cool program notes.I also have Charles Munch/BSO doing Saint Saens and Poulenc in a Victrola series CD.

It is because that particular review was probably for Legend (Ultimate Edition), but his his review (and everyone elses) is listed under all three versions of the movie for sale. BE AWARE that the director's cut version comes with the Jerry Goldsmith music score, which is not the original score that you heard when you watched this movie as a kid.

The Director's Cut is much more complete without feeling longer, and the mood is a bit darker which might appeal to a mature audience.That said, the score by Tangerine Dream and the end to the Theatrical Release will always recall to me happy memories of seeing Legend for the first time as a child.A _must buy_ for every fan of Legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Amazes me","review":"I loved this movie as a child, and I just recently bought it to watch it again and its still an awesome movie, all the specail effects and everything are just amazing special for the movie in that time.

At the end I found that I didn't care one bit about the characters or the story, that's not what's supposed to happen in a good movie.I'm not sure if Ridley was high while making this movie or not, but I'm guessing that he was.As for so many people liking it, my guess is they saw it when they were younger and remember with rose colored glasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"... ...The DVD does not say whether it is the original European release (... ...

I'm noticing some other reviews that say this copy included both the theatrical and the driector's version, but the one I recieved had no ability to play anything other than director's. Unfortunatly I had to send it back; however, the return was easy and I was refunded in full as well as the cost of shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked and dissapointed by the Director's Cut","review":"Luckily I had the forsight to rent the Director's Cut of Legend before buying it on DVD. I have watched the American released version many times since I was a child and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about with the Director's Cut. All I can say is a soundtrack and a few scenes can certainly make or break a movie. I HATED the Director's Cut version. Although Legend is already campy, I felt like the Director's Cut took this movie over the line from endearing to cheestastic. I could not stop laughing at the way the soundtrack did not fit with the movie. I felt like I was listening to the soundtrack of an old Disney movie. If you are used to the American release of this movie and the Tangerine Dream soundtrack, do yourself a favor and stick with what you know when purchasing this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning about this version of the Movie","review":"If you loved the original movie and soundtrack DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. It is altered and much of the original music is different. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED and whomever \\"monkied\\" with this version of the movie for the DVD made it a worse production than the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY THE ULTIMATE!!","review":"If you're looking for nostalgia buy the other version this is a stupid directors cut!!!! the real version is not on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tangerine Dream Does It Better","review":"The version with the Tangerine Dream soundtrack is much better than The Jerry Goldsmith crap. That's the one I watched as a kid and that's the one I really want. This version is ruined with music that doesn't belong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unicorns","review":"This is an interesting movie. It's with Mia Sara as Lilly. A girl who accidentally looses the unicorns ( in a way ) to the world. It's a very beautiful movie. I love the dress that Mia Sara wears in it .It's a different movie fantasy wise and it's really good to watch every once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST SEE FOR THE ARTSY CROWD AND CHILDREN OF ALL AGES","review":"No other movie creates a fantasy-world so stunningly beautiful that even the \\"ugly\\" parts of the movie are breathtaking. I have seen this movie several times and certain elements have stuck with me: Tim Curry's portrayal as the \\"Dark Prince\\" is probably the most frightening conception of Satan that I have ever seen, he is horrifying, disturbing, but surprisingly sympathetic and even attractive; the cinematography is gorgeous--\\"Legend\\" shows you what it would look like if Spring preceeded Fall by one day (e.g., flower petals showering and carpeting the ground like snow); the dialog and the acting is child-like and simple, but not too cheesy. I hate to dub it a \\"family movie,\\" so I won't. However, it is the perfect movie for a family because the themes and dialog are digestable for children, but there is enough spectacle and substance for the adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good","review":"I was two years old when this movie was made. I was about five when I fell in love with it. Now that I'm almost twenty I gotta say it still has it's old charm. I just saw it for the first time in many years and while I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I did when I was younger, I was still satisfied. Tim Curry made this movie. He has got to be the most menacing villain of all. He scared the crud out of me when I was young and he's still a little spooky to watch in the dark even now. I think the movie drags on a tad though and the dialog is a bit cheesy. I think if it were made today when better special effects and a tighter script it would be fantastic. But it's still a good movie and stands on it's own. This movie also displays yet another ultra-cool hairstyle for Tom Cruise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Kids","review":"I picked up legend because my daughter is into the fantasy genre (Ladyhawke, Dragonheart, Pricess Bride). I was dissappointed with this movie.Legend has all the elements that should make it a great fantasy film, Unicorns, fairies, elves, goblins. . . an innocent princess and a really evil villan. Somehow it still falls flat. It never inspires a real rapport with the characters. The best character is Tim Curry's devil.The emphasis of the film is more on the visual scenery than the storyline. Way too much time is spent grubbing around in \\"hell\\", which was way too creepy for us. Tom Cruise was a two dimensional hero. Not enough substance there to get worked up over.Our two girls (10 & 11) were very disturbed by it, to the point they couldn't sleep. I don't recommend it for pre-teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not order this DVD","review":"I enjoyed this movie as a kid and bought it recently to re-live some old memories. I was beyond disappointed when I realized it was what the director refers to as an \\"enhanced\\" version of the film. The scenes are completely different, some are missing all together, and some are completely new. The music is also 100 percent different from the original and it completely changes the entire film. They refer to it as the \\"enhanced Jerry Goldsmith Score\\" and it literally ruined the whole experience. After about an hour, I had to turn off the film and switch to the old VHS version I have had for years. I was very disappointed. Make sure you order the original if you want to enjoy this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack stinks","review":"Want to know why 73% of people who bought this DVD bought the Ultimate version next? Its becasue they (like me) didn't know they were getting the version with the Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack. His soundtrack STINKS! It ruined the entire movie. Not only that but this version has edited out the really cool scenes of Tim Curry in the black light---gone. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage get the version with the great soundtrack from tangerine dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of 4?","review":"I am a fan of Sci-Fi & Fantasy, so I gave it 4 stars. Only complaint is, I wish the director's version was converted like the theater version. Theater version is unbelievable! Blu Ray for sure! After watching the extra stuff, I really wish Ridley Scott could have made it the way he wanted to & as long as he needed it to be, like Lord of the Rings (4+hrs)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agonizing!","review":"(This review refers to the American version.) I regret to say that renting this for family movie night was my decision. After it was over, I had to get down on my knees and apologize for making those I hold dear sit through it. The acting was sub-par, the scenes were poorly spliced, and the plot was hackneyed at best. The score sounded like someone had heard the Neverending Story soundtrack one too many times and couldn't quite let go of it. The only remotely bright spot was Tim Curry as the villain, but even he was stereotypical and largely wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"best Tom Cruise movie!!","review":"Legend is the best movie with tom criuse in it!!!! Great for the whole family"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I pay for blu-ray?","review":"The quality of the picture is actually worse than the original film. Very grainy, I have other movies from the 80's that have been transferred to Blu-ray and don't look as bad as this. Total disappointment, I love Legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Director's cut sucks!","review":"Non-full disclosure. I was very disappointed when I opened this up and realized it was the Director's Cut, with score by Jerry Goldsmith. I was looking for the theatrical version with the Tangerine Dream soundtrack. The story line is totally different between the two, and I already have the Director's cut, which I didn't want in the first place. I'm sending it back, and I would appreciate it if you could find me the theatrical version to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"legend (ultimate edition)","review":"This is so much better then the orignal version. I can watch the director's version, which has more suspence, and there is more of a background to the film.

It is great!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I still think it's great!","review":"When I was five years old I remember Watching this movie with my sister and for weeks afterwards we used to try and do some of the scenes. I still think this movie is really beautiful...espically for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legend is a journey exploring good and evil","review":"Some may say the movie Legend, starring Tom Cruise, is silly and unbelievable. In other words stupid. Well, perhaps it is just my age that allows me to enjoy it, but personally, I love this movie. It explores both the dark and light sides of life while incoperating fantasy (beautiful unicorns and mischievous elves). I enjoy dark fantasies such as these if good triumphs. It brings about a message about life...that in order to maintain balance, there is a good and bad side to everything. As long as the bad side remains subserviant, then peace, prosperity, and mostly love will prevail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad","review":"Too bad the powers that be did not allow this director's cut to come to the screen originally. In my opinion the movie would have been much more successful at the box office. I really didn't care for this movie at all when I saw it in the 80s, and mostly it was because it just felt like so much was missing (the Tangerine Dream soundtrack didn't help either). Turns out I was right. The Ultimate Edition is excellent, and everything this movie SHOULD have been the first time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Music was not the same as original.","review":"The main reason I bought the movie was because of the original music that was in it. They have re-edited the whole movie with another soundtrack making it a totally different movie. It is just not as good a movie as my VHS tape of the original theatrical release. What happened to it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Legend review","review":"I bought this movie because it was one I had watched many years ago, I just remembered it being like a fairy tale but couldn't remember most of it. I bought it for my sister but had to watch it first. It was her favorite when we were younger. So, when I received the movie, it all came back to me. It truly is a magical movie, Tom Cruise seems very innocent & the beauty of the forest truly takes my breath away, it's enchanting. There were sad scenes, funny scenes, & scary ones. It's strange but movies that are made today just don't capture the magical feelings that come across when you are watching this movie. I would recommend this movie for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover","review":"This is a beautifully done movie about good versus evil. The story takes place in a magical land filled with dwarves, unicorns, and elves. The two main characters in it are Jack and Lily, two lovers who have only known innocence. All of that changes when an evil deamon named Lord Darkness kidnaps Lily and steals a horn from a unicorn. His goal is to have darkness rule the world. Tim Curry does an excellent performence as Lord Darkness. When I saw it I couldn't believe it was him. He fits the part so well and deserves nominations for best actor. This is a film worth seeing. Although it might scare some younger kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"true fairy tale in purest form","review":"This movie is for fantasy enthusiasts like myself. You take all the classic creatures and parts of fantasy[elves, fairies, dwarves, unicorns, and a hero, plus miscelaneous evil creatures]and you add a GREAT storyline,and you end up with the most underrated fantasies ever. Please watch this with an open mind, you can detect slight corny parts, but that is what fantasy is. This romantic, beautifully shot movie has a climactic ending that always brings tears to my eyes. Anyone who reads a mainstream critic reveiw of this movie should ignore it. Adults and children [9 and over] who like fantasy, this is the movie for you! I do not recommend this for kids under 9 because there is some imagery that may prove too frightening or disturbing. Watch it, buy it, it RULES! P.S. The only thing that would have made this a five star movie would have been if they had put a dragon in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality","review":"I have always loved this movie, it's the perfect type of fantasy movie. Tom cruise as a young man in shorts and chainmail and a wicked rendition of the devil played by Tim Curry. Totally wicked."},{"rating":"2","title":"timing error set straight","review":"Well, to set the record straight regading the actual length of the European version, it is actually only 2 (two) minutes longer than the domestic release; however, there is almost 30 minutes of alternate scenes and alternate dialog which makes all the difference in the world and makes the European version infinitely better then the American cut. I have a bootleg recording of this version, which is the basis of my information. I happen to love both scores, but then again, I am a big Tangerine Dream fan. I can't wait to finally get a clean DVD copy of this awesome movie and throw my \\"boot\\" away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok movie","review":"This movie was entertaining to watch (in a good way). Featuring the classic unicorns, fairys, and good vs. evil scheme, this is a great watch for any fantasy fan. It's a shame it didn't receive better. The best part about this movie? This movie was the main influence for the main developer at nintendo (i can't seem to remember his name at the moment) to create the basic story for the hit game \\"The Legend of Zelda\\". The game has fared very well and successful for 25 years, and if it wasn't for a unique movie such as this one, none of it would have been possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"under rated film","review":"This is one movie I feel that never was giving the credit that it should have gotten.The effects are great and Tim curry as the Dark lord was just Awesome!!.Anytime that I have told someone about this movie and has watch it says the same thing.This one is a Classic for me.Thanks,Robert"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watched as child, now again as adult","review":"I love movies from the 80s, when ideas were still fresh and new!

Great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"To the Lactose Intolerant - This film is totally CHEESY","review":"I first saw this film when I was about 8, and loving unicorns, thought it was great. But now that I've seen it as a 22 year old I think differently. I don't know if it was the abundance of glitter on Tom Cruise's face, the annoying voices of almost all the characters, the 80's synthesizer background music or the awful ending song, but I was dissapointed. This is 1 1/2 hours of my life that I will never get back. As a final word, kids may like it, but adults (well everyone but my sister who actually owns this movie) may be better off just watching it muted. The scenes are beautiful but can't make up for the annoying aspects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"I was actually looking for another movie with a big horn guy (not Hell Boy) that I remembered seeing a long time ago but this wasn't it. Anyway this movie's not that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking soo forward to this","review":"I am looking forward to seeing this directors cut. I have correction to make from a couple of prior reviewers.1. The Goldsmith score was the original score. Tangerine Dream was an addition after the fact. Personally I prefer it to the Goldsmith which doesn't have the same dark or magical feel to it that the TD score does.2.The chopped up edit job was actually Ridley Scott's own fault. he was totaly parnoid about how this film would be recieved and went way too far in chopping it up.Like I said I cannot wait to see the new version, I just wish they could done a compilation of the best of both soundtracks instead just the Goldsmith score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legend, (Theatrical vs Director's Cut)","review":"I prefer the theatrical version much better (opening and ending). I thought the images of the feast luring Mia was not visually seen well on the directors cut as well as other scenes. I was very disappointed when I did not see the elf place the unicorns horn back on it's head. I also prefer the musical score by Tangerine. I will now have to buy the theatrical version because I do not like the director's cut version which I mistakenly purchased.Marie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Legend I remember","review":"I recently picked this up to replace my worn out VHS version. I thought the extras would be a nice bonus since this is one of my favorite childhood movies. Upon the first 10 minutes I realized something wasn't right. The Music was AWFUL. It was so cartoony and plays ALL THE TIME. It got down right annoying. I always remembered the soothing beautiful music. Getting online Did a bit a research to find Legend has two soundtracks. The European version by Jerry Goldsmith and the American Version by Tangerine Dream. If you want the American version with the \\"Loved by the sun\\" This isn't the version you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a Legend.","review":"This movie is an awesome movie.

The alternate ending makes the first disk (Director's Cut) totally unwatchable. It completely ruined the entire movie for me. I'd say the DVD is worth buying just to have this classic on DVD, but I found out that the Dolby Digital/DTS sound track is only on the first disk! I buy DVD's because of the superior sound and this version does not deliver it. The first disk and the price needs to drop to make this DVD worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy Flop: Legend, Flee For Your Life !","review":"For starters I would recommend renting this movie before purchasing it. I love fantasy and after watching half of this movie it has almost ruined the genre for me. Legend is much like a minor league baseball player who has not hit a single pitch at bat, in 16 years. I found both music scores to distract and already confusing film. The characters were more like images with no sense of development within the film. As a viewer, I felt dizzy, uncertain, and lost, much like this movie. I would also add that this is not the kind of movie I would allow my children to view. Bottom Line A: Rent, buying could lead to depression. Bottom Line B: This is the kind of movie you buy for someone you do not like."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT one of the best","review":"Tom Cruise struggles with the forces of darkness,goes on an epic journey--and suffers from a perpetual Bad Hair Day.His Afro IS this movie's special effect.Thankfully,Ridley Scott moved beyond this clunker.The premise involving the unicorns is cute,but cuteness isn't enough to save the movie.The \\"Epic Journey\\" is long,boring&drawn-out.The; final music video is so terribly sappy (and it is BAD '80 music),it's practically unwatchable,let alone hearable.If you want to a GOOD cheesy fantasy movie from the '80s,get \\"Krull\\" instead.Or,if you enjoy ogling a blue-eyed short,hairy-footed hero,sit down for all 9 hours of \\"Lord of the Rings.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I'm telling you, don't waste your time...\\"","review":"This movie did deserve one star, because the Lord of Darkness looked pretty cool, and was played well by Tim Curry, but the rest of it was very stupid. I mean, sure, any little kid would want to see this because it has a lot to do with fairy tales and unicorns, but come on, you can see that the horns were probably glued on to white horses' heads, they shook when the horses ran. If they were real horns, they would not shake, so it was very farfetched. The creatures were impish and stupid looking, especially that almost-naked little elfish thing that sounded like Frieza from Dragon Ball Z. I slept through the end, so I couldn't tell you about that. If you want a good Ridley Scott film, try looking at \\"Alien\\" or \\"Hannibal\\", but avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good Fantasy","review":"What is it with this movie? It has the potential to be a great movie because of the caliber of actors and the great scenery, but the plot is too slow for an adult. In fact, a child would really love it except for the fact that there's a demon on it that would scare the Heck out of them and give them nightmares for a week! I was expecting a much better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK","review":"This movie is really really really bad!!! First the beginning of the movie where we see the torture area is just plain gross. The story line was a complete joke. I couldn't even enjoy it. I can't figure out why anyone could possibly like this movie. Trust me this movie will scare your children, and make them cry, when the bad guys kill the unicorn. Besides I thought in Fairy Tales that you can't kill a unicorn. Anyone it's a joke, don't watch it, unless you really want to. Though I can't understand why you would!P.S.

What made this movie resonate so soundly with me wasn't Tom Crusie's boyish good looks or the fairytale fantasies, it was the whimsical fantasy like music that dotted the back drop of this film aka Tangerine Dream. The movie I ordered from your company however changed this completely, robbing the film of its mystery and artistry. I am writing this complaint because you did not provide notice. The soundtrack to this particular DVD I ordered was not Tangerine Dream. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Director's Cut Not Worth Watching","review":"I grew up watching this movie over and over. The original soundtrack by Tangerine Dream made the movie for me, and helped create the world.The director's cut has new scenes that were mercifully cut from the theatrical release, and a new soundtrack that puts a weird campy, pathos-ridden feel to the movie.I couldn't even get 20min in without turning it off, it was that bad.If you're going to get this movie, buy the original theatrical release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad movie","review":"Even with a semi-disappointing performance by Tom Cruise, it wasn't a bad movie. Tim Curry gives a strong performance as the Satan-esque character.Now the thing that really bugs me: everyone comparing every single fantasy film to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Don't get me wrong, I love those movies and the books for that matter, but you can't compare everything to those movies. For one thing, this movie came out in the mid 80's, and as we all know special effects weren't nearly as developed then as they are now. Not only that, but fantasy was a new type of movie back then, Legend being one of the first fantasy movies that wasn't animated, such as the Lord of the Rings which came out in the 70's. All I'm saying is evaluate each movie as something independant from a different movie, most notably Lord of the Rings. Again, Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite movies, but give it a rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important info about the Directors cut","review":"I have a review many pages back already but I thought it was important to note this as many folks seem purplexed by the difference in the two versions of the film and how some scenes from the original US release are missing or different.The edit is NOT a new edit it isn't even the same edit as the original European release. What we have here is an actual honest to goodness, found original edit of the film. It was discovered and decided that it was better than doing a new directors cut.So what you are seeing is in fact one of the first versions of this film, before any of the \\"Suits\\" got a hold of it!This also explains why some scenes are similar but different too and why some scenes like the Unicorn horn scene from the end of the US version are not in this cut.Just thought you'd all want to know this.Excellent excellent film....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fairy tale","review":"This is the perfect fairy tale.

I still like the American Version better and the music of Tangerine Dream fits the movie better then Mia Farrow singing. The story was a bit more through and you can tell where the European film was cut to make the Americanized version. Good vs Evil, light vs dark. This movie is well worth the whole 8 bucks they are asking for it now. This movie and Willow is great for 10 years old and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my favorite movie","review":"Legend has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember. I have had the video since I was six and loved every aspect of the movie. I have been looking forward to its release on dvd for the past year as well and then I get it yesterday. I never thought that I would give it a 4. The director's cut adds great scenes all the way through the movie explaining a lot of loose end but the ending...what happened!!! The ending does not belong in the movie that I know and love and it is for that reason alone that the US version will be the dvd that I watch. I love Goldsmith's score and the added scenes, and I respect what Scott is trying to accomplish in the director's cut ending but after seeing and believing the US ending for 16 year, it makes my heart hurt to see the director's ending. The US ending is the one that I will be watching from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of Tom's Cruise first and best movie","review":"legend is about a young fairy boy that has to save the world from darkness.

Released 16th January 1986 in US, and the 28th of August 1985 in France, This movie is the most beautiful in visual effects but the story was very basic. It was about good versus evil. The movie was often confusing also because you didn't understand where Lily really came from or where Jack came from, and there was no explanation of anything in the movie. That's also what makes this movie so interesting. The Director's cut explains some but not much more and the score by Goldsmith does not go and the Tangerine Dream's score is more appropriate and makes it more eerie. This was not a bad movie but don't anylyze it or you won't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason this wasn't released in theaters","review":"This DVD is only the \\"director's cut\\" version of the film, so please don't be misled into thinking that this is the wonderful film you remember watching. This is that wonderful film re-edited and filled to the brim with awful music. If you can make it through Mia Sara's singing without hitting the fast forward button, you have a far stronger constitution than I do. It is cringe inducing.

Otherwise, don't waste your money, I regret wasting mine. The story was trite, and the characters were dull and lifeless (Save Tim Curry). I could not find one good aspect of this movie. It was a waste of talent, and a waste of production money.

There was \\"no\\" mention on the web page that this was a directors cut, thus I feel ripped off. This is a great film for me in its original format, but very poor in the directors cut.

For me, it does project a true fantasy \\"escape\\" world. Some incredible sets were made and dressed to create a version of a perfect natural world. Also some dark and forboding sets representing a hell of sorts. The story is sort of an Adam and Eve thing, with the parts played by the young cute people. I was eager to finally see the director's cut, with Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack. Sorry, but it didn't click with me. For some reason it took the experience away from a fantasy escape to a story more based in reality. Maybe the reason I have enjoyed this film over the years (the original) is that it reawakens the small eyes big in wonder boy inside of me. Cruise is young and unformed at this stage. Mia Sara makes a sweet princess, but when she gets dressed up in her \\"evil\\" black outfit, all I can say is YOWSA!.

This movie was before Tom made it really big in Hollywood so don't get upset at his crooked teeth. Ridley Scott creates a beautiful world with stunning cinematography and landscape. Mia Sara is really good and Tim Curry Dawns the figure of Darkness absoultely perfect.But the real story isn't actually the plot itself it is taking in this breathtaking world Ridley Scott has created and losing yourself in it.This ultimate edition has two versions of the movie (American,International) along with tons of extra stuff packed into it.

However I found some of it hard to understand. Who was the old lady who was talking to the princess at the beginning of the movie? If she's a princess, why is she out gallavanting around by herself w/o bodyguards? Who was that one gnome who actually turned out to be good, and did he die at the end?

Sadly, I was wrong. Unfortunately, the special effects are so poor that it really is hard to follow. I always compare old movies to Star Wars. If they can't be close to that quality in special effects, then the plot better blow me away! This one is ok for little kids, I quess. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridley Scott's Worst","review":"This is Ridley Scott's absolute WORST. I realize that this film has a strong fan following, but I have to say it: this sloppy mess of a movie is just plain horrid. The storyline is so cheesy and insane. I realize that fantasy movies are supposed to be cheesy, but come on. The dialogue is excrutiating to listen to. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. The acting, with the possible exception of Tim Curry, is atrocious.But it's not ALL bad. The effects are wonderful, and Ridley Scott's visual style makes this movie very easy on the eyes. But great special effects don't make a great movie. If you want to see a great fantasy movie, I would recommend Lord of the Rings instead of this unintelligible mess. Oh, by the way, I belivieve an earlier reviewer said this was a great movie to show to your children. DON'T, unless you want them to have nightmares until they're 30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Director's Cut = Nothing Like American Version","review":"While I loved the original \\"Legend\\" with the Tangerine Dream score, this version of the movie caused me to drive straight back to Borders (where I got it) and demand my money back. There are scenes that are changed, missing, or added that were not apart of the American version I grew up with and fell in love with.This DVD doesn't even give you the option of watching the American version- and nowhere on the cover does it state that it's the Director's Cut only. Had I known that there WERE even two versions of the movie out there, I wouldn't have even bought the DVD in the first place.\\"Legend,\\" as was stated before, is an amazing movie.

He blends, true satanic description with an all star makeup costume. I think he deserved an award for this. I have the soundtrack, and it is magnificent. The floating flower pedals in the first couple of scenes, are truely magical. The unicorns are absolutley stunning, and Mia Sara and Tom Cruise show a love that is stronger than any one else has displayed in movie history! TIM CURRY's best role, with out him this movie propbaly would have lost about four stars, because the actors don't really have good development scenes, and they should have...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film, hard to get hold of!","review":"This film is definitely the best fantasy film ever made, it combines horror love and action with a binding tale of fantasy and cannot be faulted. The acting by all the cast including Cruise and Curry is top class and if your looking for an all time classic fantasy film buy it now. However this is the hardest film I have ever known to get hold of in the UK, with the original soundtrack. You can pick up newer versions really easy but the film just isn't the same without the original 1985 motion picture soundtrack by Tangerine Dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The special effects were some of the best I have ever seen in any movie.

Why didn't Jack try stopping Lilly?3. What in heaven is Jack?4. What's up with that guy in the helmet? Why was he hanging around the goblins?5.

He kidnaps the gal, so the guy has to save her and the world...yukFirst of all, this movie should not have been rated PG. The costume of Tim Curry was a bit frightening, and definitely would have made a 7-year-old pass out. The storyline sucked, and Tom Cruise's companions who help him rescue Mia Sara were plucked out of an '80s Jim Henson movie, excluding Gump, A Midsummer Night's Dream Puck's look-alike.....DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fair fairy tale","review":"Scott's \\"Legend\\" is a capable rendering of a romantic, mythic story. It has unicorns, fairies, a prince (not The Prince) of darkness, a man of the wild wood and of kind heart. They all come together in a well made story.The sets and effects stand up to the standards of 1985. The elves, fairies, and trolls are good, though they lack Henson's genius. Tom Cruise is young and handsome, with the emphasis on young. Tim Curry (aka Dr. Frank-N-Furter) is buried in his evil character - the character is good, but with that getup, it could have been almost anyone in there.The story comes together, the characters come together, the effects are effective. Somehow, though, the total seems less than the sum of its parts.I like it. I'll watch it again. It's good - it's just not brilliant. Given that Scott also directed Alien, I hoped for more.Some scenes suggest real violence, but only suggest. Unless your little ones are skittish, I'd call it kid-safe.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirit Lifting","review":"The account of the discovery of this slave ship and the painstaking research that went into telling us its history is inspiring.

Dangerman ran 29 half and hour episodes and then several seasons as a hour show. Unfortunately it's not in color though. I wish they'd give us a choice of colorized episodes but that's a minor thing and it didn't make the show any less great. This is a show based on well scripted and acted stories so that helps alot. It's so good that even several young people I showed it to were hooked! In spite of the black and white, few youngster can even watch black and white anymore. So that's how good this show really is. Some people think that this is the same character who is the prisoner. That may be the case but probably isn't.

The fact that he was in Danger Man was the primary reason that I purchased it, but remarks from other reviewers regarding the fact that the hero rarely used a gun and didn't spend his time falling in and out of bed with the nearest handy female, was another HUGE selling point. I rarely watch television anymore because I'm so disgusted by the rubbish that's shown, so am always grateful when good televisions series' are brought to DVD.

Unlike most TV dramas today, it is difficult to anticipate/predict the outcome of these stories. Full of surprises and generally more realistic cold war spy thrillers than contemporary shows.The only reason for four stars instead of five is the disappointment that A&E; decided to show the British introduction instead of the Johnny Rivers \\"Secret Agent Man\\" song that opened the show for the US audience.

Not surprising considering the orchestra and the conductor! The sound quality is also excellent.The singing and vocalizations by Cura are first rate in my mind. He brings out the emotion of the piece without \\"showing off.\\" The other singers are also top notch.Although I don't particularly appreciate opera, this is one disc that I believe that I will listen to often in the future.Oh, and BTW, is this disc already out of the catalog? If so, what a shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong, stylish production","review":"I myself am a big fan of Pagliacci, and I can say that this recording is very good, although Frittoli's voice is not that strong and I simply can not call her MY Nedda, My Nedda is and probably always will be Maria Callas... Also on this recording Jose Cura sings Canio and Carlos Alvarez is Tonio. Cura sings this difficult part very well, maybe, at points his voice sounds too forced but in general I just love this kind of performance. Alvarez makes a good Tonio although there can be one better. The voices anyways are of very high level. This recording is worth bying if you're going to hear Pagliacci for the first time, or want to hear something fresh. I can call it an opera-recording of new generation - all artists are young. Someday it will become a good classical recording. Also the package is just wonderful - these two photos of Jose Cura give you a real feeling of a tragedy which is enclosed.

I recommend this book to anyone interested in econ or looking for a quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"inefficient way to learn economics","review":"Economics is the study of how to use scarce resources efficiently, or so I'm told by Czar Chasey. Well, my time is a scarce resource and reading these books was not an efficient use. Reading a 10 page article about economics by an economist would have taught me much more (greater benefit) with much less time consumed (less opportunity cost). The books were mildly amusing but not enough to make up for my lost time, which I could have spent doing something far more amusing or learning much more. There, as much as I don't like talking economics, I think I've used its language to prove that these books are wholly uneconomical. I think Henry Spearman would agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opportunity cost for not reading this is high!","review":"I read this book as it was assigned by co-author Ken Elzinga for his Econ 201 class at the University of Virginia. This book is very good. Short but still interesting, it has tons of economics in it.

If you're interested in econ you should definitely pick up this fun, quick and informative read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun mystery...","review":"If Milton Friedman liked it then hey - gotta argue with him right? :)This is a great book. Its interesting and provides a lot of thought behind it. At the same time, its not challenging in any way. Thankfully, the book is explained well, the concepts are explained even better. Even if you don't understand basic economics concepts (which you should), the book will explain to you quite well in a very fun context.It will leave you a bit curious and wanting a bit more at the end, yet the writer has weaven a great story with an economics setting. A bit dark and gloomy at times though.I do wish there was more mystery at the end, but the novel is a very short read. I believe the writer didn't want to neccesarily bore the readers with too much economics. If you like mysteries, read this book! It'll give you a little thought and a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPROVE ON PERFECTION","review":"I saw this DVD in the bargain bin at my local Wal-Mart for $4.99. At that price, and being a big fan of the original, I was intrigued. I am also a fan of Tom Skerritt who stars in this one as Will Kane, the hapless marshal whose integrity and honor force him to make a solitary stand against four bad guys and an apathetic town.I am sorry to say that, despite a valiant effort by Skerritt, this remake and the rest of the cast fall woefully short. Even at bargain price I would pass on this one if I were you. It's just an impossible task to do what is attempted here: remaking or improving on perfection. Gary Cooper defined the role of Will Kane. Period. You might as well attempt a remake of THE COWBOYS, TRUE GRIT, THE SHOOTIST or THE SEARCHERS with someone other than John Wayne in the lead.THE HORSEMAN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely see it","review":"It won't please everybody, and I know that. Many will compare it to the original. But this one works. It is a nice remake and another film enriched by the lovely Maria Conchita Alonso who is absolutely stunning in this one. She played the role that Katy Jurado did in the original and the role here has been much amplified. And that is understandable. After all, \\"High Noon\\" back in the 50's was made in a time where Anglo- Mexican relations were off limits in a film.. The only other film made back them that touched on the subject was \\"Giant.\\" And it is nice to see her role given some importance in the film. She does a superb job with it. Anyway, you know the story.

That's the advice someone should have given to the producers of this remake. The original \\"High Noon\\" is a movie that cannot be improved upon. No one could possibly bring more to the film than Gary Cooper did. Tom Skerritt brings only a pale imitation. I rank this as the second-stupidest remake of all time. It's not horribly awful, like the laughably awful remake of \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\" with counter-culture kung fu star Tom Laughlin (\\"Billy Jack Goes to Washington\\"). It's simply bland and generally inoffensive. That is an offense in itself, however, considering what you could have bought with the same money. Okay, the producers of this film made a mistake, but you don't have to.

Some sort of new twist or perspective.What I got is basically the exact same movie, only this time in color, with a less impressive casting job, and all the dialogue rewritten so that the plotline is spoon fed to you.I don't know what's worse, the fact that certain shots are remade almost perfectly from the old movie, or the fact that almost the first twenty minutes are devoted to characters explaining to each other things which were obvious to the viewer in the first movie, without the characters stopping to tell each other how they felt. For a movie that's based around the last hour before noon, there's a remarkable lack of suspense here.It would have been hard to top the original, but they didn't even bother trying here. This is just a poorly made clone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Western of all time","review":"High Noon is a film that is suspenseful from beginning to end. It tells the fascinating tale of a man who is abandoned by everyone in his life when news arrives that a man who was his enemy was coming back to town on the noon train. Aside from being an incredible story, the film serves an excellent purpose by communicating the fact that many people are only your friend when things are easy, but when \\"the chips are down,\\" people sometimes bolt, and one has to look at what one can truly count on in this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to the original","review":"The acting is horrible, Tom Skerritt gives the only good performance out of all the actors.

When purchasing the movie, I figured that it was a movie made in 2005 (perhaps a foreign or independent film), but it was a movie in 1973 and Danny Devito has a very minor role (maybe 3 scenes).This movie is suppose to be a comedy. I found the description on the package to be more funny than the movie. Want to know more about the movie?

Being slightly more cognizant of the value of my time, however, I'm setting out tomorrow to buy 10 feet of real chain, a big box of binder clips and I'll make my own.

The vocal performances and music are meticulously crafted and delivered, and may indeed be true to the spirit of the period in which they were written. But they are curiously lightweight, and I felt like I was listening to musical fluff. \\"Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring\\"--in my opinion, the most moving of all the cantatas--was far too fast-paced: it sounded distressingly like the Minute Waltz. \\"Sleepers Awake\\" received similar treatment. Professionally, all of the performers on this CD undoubtedly delivered, but what they delivered was curiously lacking in the soul-stirring majesty that Bach's cantatas can evoke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to rebuild","review":"Bought the IR assuming a quality tool, wrong.

I find her particular style easier to take than most instructors who have unnaturally thin bodies (why are they always topped by unnaturally well padded chests?). She's enthusiastic, knowledgeable and \\"real\\". This particular tape was one that I looked forward to and actually sought out. I bought her book \\"Fit and Fabulous after 40\\" and love it. The tape should have been the adjunct to the book. It's a great tape. A great workout. Intermediate, not beginners. The aerobics is all floor, no step. The toning is well instructed and it has her usual great warmup and cool down. And it was also issued under the title \\"Age Defying/Baby Boomers Workout\\". Very disappointing when you find the workout is same as one you already own under a different title (no indication on the cover that it's been re-issued). My recommendation is buy it, unless you already have it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better for some ages than others","review":"Fit & Fabulous at Any Age is a challenging 45-minute workout. For a person in their twenties, it is probably moderate. But for me, a 50 year-old with a bad knee, it's difficult. I love Denise Austin, and I intend to keep using the tape, but people over 40 should know that the aerobics routine has high-impact moves in it. The floor work (which is great) involves lots of moves from knees-to-the-floor positions, which I have to modify. Nonetheless, Austin's familiar pep keeps one interested and happy to follow along, even if they can't do all the moves. I recommend the tape -- but with caution for people my age."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book. Very informative, but a little drawn out.","review":"This is a very good book. It has very good descriptions, charts and drawings. It covers many interesting topics. It presents facts and figures that help the reader picture in their mind the distances, power (energy) and the size of celestial objects.

The writer indeed contribute a little bit of amazing information about the sizes of stars but many pages are wasted on tidbits which contribute nothing for the science of astronomy. The book is written in light English with not so many words in every page. The diagrams and pictures are of a very low quality and it is very difficult to understand the names of the stars in the diagrams. The pictures are simply disappointing and the paper quality is low as well. The book is as far as possible from a scientific book.

The author understandably doesn't want to step on any toes that might limit his access behind the modern red curtain but this is borderline outrageous. The Chinese authorities have been caught repeatedly proffering outright lies when providing information to their people and the author seems to gloss these issues over and instead attribute these institutional practices to cultural misunderstanding between china and the west.

Needless to say that two of them were defective right off the bat, being unable to hold the vacuum. The problem did not appear to be the seal around the bottle neck, but the port hole where the vacuum tube attaches to the stopper. Upon removal of the vacuum tube, I could hear the air hissing back into the bottle through the port. The third stopper appeared to have had held initially, but by the next day the air was once again back in the bottle.

I would get a 1.5 liter bottle of wine and sometimes I would take a couple of days to finish it off. Well sometimes the air didn't get sucked out, sometimes it bled out.Foodsaver I suggest you come up with some sort of color system where some part of the bottle stopper changes color, blue for instance would mean the air has been sucked out of the bottle, red would be air in the bottle. The only way I could tell if the air had been removed was by trying to remove the stopper and sometimes that action would allow air in.I would lower my rating to 3.5.

Well I didn't miss the point.The point of this movie is not to be a fictional movie but some sort of instruction video for those who are left behind after the rapture that some Christians believe is coming.The fictional elements of the movie are interrupted by scenes where Pastor John Hagee declares that this, in fact, will happen, becaus the bible tells us it will, and when it does, you better be a Christian and be saved, and don't trust the evil European politician that will become some kind of world president and say he's the Messiah, because he's really the Anti-Christ.I wouldn't recommend anyone to see this movie, and certainly not to spend their money on it.

While none of them were stellar, this one was abysmal. It seemed like it was John Hagee's effort to showcase himself, more than anything else, by calling it a documentary. It was a bottom dweller when it came to production values, using recycled clips from Apocolypse more than new footage. It completely lacked both plot and character development. If it was to be a documentary, then it should have had some scripture to it. If Hagee's preaching is as lean on scripture as this film is, then I think I will skip ever watching that the same as I advise skipping this waste-of-time. There are plenty of halfway decent films out there for sharing with friends about the end times, but this one is totally worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biblically Sound & Very Sobering","review":"I found \\"Vanished\\" to be excellent. It is Biblically-sound and Pastor John Hagee does well to back up the events with Scripture throughout the movie. It reminds me that this is not simply a sensational, fictitious story, but one that the Bible is trying to prepare us for. It clarified the sequence of events for me. Often, people have heard about \\"Rapture\\", \\"Anti-Christ\\", \\"Great Tribulation\\", \\"the 144,000\\" and so on, but put the sequence of events into a \\"too-hard-basket\\". John Hagee summarised all this up beautifully and so logically. It would certainly wake up the \\"sleepy Christian\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should have stayed disappeared.","review":"This isn't really a movie. It's a short subject on the conjuncture of \\"The Rapture\\" which term, by the way, does not exist in the Bible. Not that I don't believe in the Second Coming, but there is nothing triumphant or glorious about this short film and I saw no clouds of glory to which I'd desire to be caught up. There are better and much more compelling tales on the subject to be found elsewhere. Search them out. Better yet, search the Scriptures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this cd","review":"I received it on time and in excellent condition.

Teena Marie is truly a great and underappreciated artist -sadly I think that after she's gone, more people will pick up her music & she'll receive posthumous accolades.This disc is yet another stellar entry in the great career of Teena. It contains her usual top notch work, easily blending funky cuts with her wonderful ballads. What I've always appreciated about her is the fact that she never sold out in her music - she stayed true to the form of music that she loves and I think that's why her fan base is so wide, varied & multi-cultural.My fave songs are: Just Us Two, How Can You Resist It, Miracles Need Wings to Fly, If I Were A Bell (classic), Here's Looking At You, Cupid is a Real Straight Shooter & Since Day One.This a great disc to add to your Teena Marie collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was warned but....","review":"While the description of the book certainly came with disclaimers and qualifiers as to the reproduction quality, I didn't realize just how bad it would be with much of each page used for wide borders and the text being rather small font on a sepia or recycled paper.Several pages were blurred and indistinct so as to be almost unreadable with underlying watermark patterns.

Robert Newton, fresh from his role of Long John Silver in Treasure Island, does a surperb job in the role of Blackbeard, the most feared of all pirates. William Bendix adds comic relief as Blackbeard's First Mate Mordey. Linda Darnell does really good in her role as Edwina Mansfield, and I forgot who did the role of Robert Maynard, but he does a good job in the role, and last, but not least, whoever does the role of Sir Henry Morgan, does a excellent job of it.

There are some mistakes in the notes, historically...Never the less they do not affect the beauty of the story nor the narrative. The French Revolution was a blood bath, way too many innocent people met their end during the Terror. For someone to be disappointed with the end is a bit naive! Yes, a part of me wanted the heroes to survive, still Dumas did the best thing by sending them to the Guillotine. He was true to the history and it made wonderful fiction.

I suppose you would have to read the original French to know for sure. The heroic characters are one-dimensional, sappy cliches of the Romantic era.

And this is my point. This video has hopped itself on the sophmoric bandwagon but hasn't added anything to the party other than bad animation. The last episode 'Behind the Local Band' (a made up one) is the funniest thing on the DVD -- which goes to show you that they're trying too hard to be funny by making fun of Britney Spears, but when left to their own devices, they actually do have good imaginations.

However, I have to say that I was pretty disappointed with the construction quality.Unless you're giving it to a teenager or adult as a keepsake type of gift, the paperback isn't going to stand up against an age-appropriate child, or to time itself.

Crockett Johnson keeps the story moving at a fast but easy pace, and as a result it flows very nicely. My son has just turned three and he is starting to really get into it. This one is sure to be one of your children's favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyment over...and over....and over.............","review":"My wife and I have read this book hundreds of times to our daughters ages 5 and 3 for a couple of years now and they never get tired of it.

We all do this each night when we dream...Every page has a 'situation', and the readers look forward to discovering what Harold will draw next with his purple crayon in order to get out of it.

It's not even in the same league as other products like OmniPro or FineReader, so I can't even compare it with them.

The photographs are not just a device, they're a metaphor, but not a heavy-handed one. This isn't the easiest novel to read, which is a relief after some other recent fiction, even some good stuff. It feels good to have to work at reading sometimes, and it helps me to understand what the deconstructionists are talking about when they say the reader is part of the process. Sometimes you hear people say that they felt like they knew the characters. I don't feel that way about this Levantine family, and that's not a criticism -- I feel like I got as close to them as they would actually have let me (an Ashkenazi) if I had met them -- which isn't very close.

Not only will it remove old stains from my clothes, it does so without fading the color. It even removed old stains from Downey Fabric softener that an overnight soaking in Tide wouldn't touch.One of the best things I like is the wonderful light scent it leaves on my clothes.

This is one occasion whhere a single performance changed the way a piece of music is performed. Previn took an overly comfortable example of dated modernism, redolent of the 30s, and applied a more aggressive, angular approach. By giving the Walton First a knife edge--just as it had for its original audience--he gives it an air of great tension and apprehension. You sense the Nazi invasion around the corner.Nobody since has come close, not even Previn himself in his Telarc remake with hte Royal Phil. The LSO is a more powerful orchestra, to be sure, and they play with intensity and commitment here. RCA's crude digital remastering dates from 1988 and has an unpleasant glare around it, along with a crunch in the big climaxes.

The layout is more thought out, the artworks presented are sufficiently annotated and marked. On other hand, I wonder whether the makers of this book feel like they have to fill up more pages and therefore sometimes go amiss in their choice of good fantasy art. Nevertheless, this is an excellent collection of works of fantasy (and fantastic) art, especially good as a first step in the exploration of the field. Those new to the genre might choose the Spectrum series as a beginner's guide to fantasy art and use it as a jumpboard for further research of this creative branch of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best","review":"I originally purchased this album (showing my age) when it first came out and I've always wanted this on CD.

At the core of this work is an attempt to think through the problem of the absence of proletarian ideology. Balibar makes an interesting distinction between the working class and the masses-at a glance this appears to be a semantic gesture, but his conceptual developments overcome much of the teleology ascribed to the Marxist tradition. In particular, Balibar's work on the problem of historicity vs. history \\"in the strong sense,\\" with regard to the development of Capital, is a much needed philosophical contribution to the rather hackneyed critiques of Marxist economics."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!!!!!","review":"I happen to be very pleased with this third album.

As a black female I was probably in the minority of who this group was targarting anyway. Still, I LOVED this group and still listen to their music on occasion. They will always have a place in my heart which has no room for N'Sync, Hanson or Backstreet Boys. Even though I enjoy their music, NKOTB will always have a place there. While their last Album \\"Face the Music\\" didn't do so well, we all can't expect to last forever. The fans (such as me) started out with them and grew up with them.

I remember dancing \\"Step By Step\\" when I was in high school for my P.E. class. I owned a cassette tape of this album before but since it's already worn-out and tapes are getting obsolete, I searched CDs everywhere in different stores but to no avail.

I really needed this book & since finding it I keep looking for memoirs by other fellow sufferers. It is very important to me to know there are others out there. Since I am too close to the material to give a balanced opinion let me just say I very much understand why the author wrote in the third person & he absolutely captures, for me, how alone the experience made me feel.

Had the the 40-second instrumental clip of \\"Where Will You Go\\" been expanded to a full track there would be a third worthwhile song here. That points up the problem: The instrumental arrangements are well done, and there is no denying Babyface's vocal talent, but the lyrics are just too cloying.If that sort of thing gives you a happy emotional vibe, and you already own every recording made by Barry White, then by all means take the advice of all the other rave reviews here.

This double-cd set showcases the best Luther Vandross has to offer, with subtle reworkings of some of his hits (listen to the original versions of some of the songs and you'll note that there have been some additional background work done). Unfortunately, there have been a couple of songs that are not included, like \\"Wait for Love\\" or \\"Forever, For Always, For Love,\\" songs that would have strengthened an already classic compilation.

The books that come with it are great -- one asks you questions, like your name, favorite food, favorite color, etc.; you talk into the microphone; and then it uses your responses throughout the story. The other book is about a frog (the Leapfrog?) and it has a story and games -- like rhyming games -- and helps out with your letters (something she is very into right now). She also has a PowerTouch system, and while she will tote that out from time to time to play a song from Blues Clues or Elmo, she never had much interest.

The copies I watched looked and sounded just fine. Perhaps a few lemons slipped through during production, but the one I saw had no problems of any kind.As for the content: the show itself is wonderful, but I question the need to space the 11 episodes + interview over 3 discs. Two would have sufficed, and would have been cheaper for the consumer. No disc space was used for bonus commentaries or anything else, so why 3 discs? We've all seen DVD movies with running times of well over 2 1/2 hours on one disc, and it would have been feasible to do the same with this set.

As usual, Williams plays his part well, but unfortunately he is in a movie with a severe identity crisis. The movie starts out as a comedy, but suddenly it turns more serious when computer fraud is discovered by a beautiful young woman (Laura Linney) who feels duty-bound to report this to Williams. If the movie had stuck to one genre, such as comedy, satire, or drama it would have been much better, but instead it tries to mix the three with less than satisfactory results. Robin Williams is capable of brilliance when he is in a good movie, but unfortunately this is not a very good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great movie and Robin Williams is funny as usual","review":"This is a great movie. I thought it was a little slow at first, but it picks up. I like the jokes Tom Dobbs (played by Williams) tells. It is very funny and very true, and the debate scene was so awesome! The film is not a comedy though and that is what is great about it. The story is suspenseful as it follows the campaign, which later goes into some deadly men and voting scandal. Christopher Walken is also in it and is good. I do not know if I would watch it again but there are few movies I watch again. I really liked the acting by Robin Williams, he is able to show so much natural compassion with playing Dobbs. It is a good mix because it allows a person to see the funny parts of his comedy routine within the movie but then also enjoy the serious, suspenseful parts as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why","review":"I had been looking foward to this movie since I saw the preview. Finaly it came out on DVD and I watched with anticipation. The movie started out good but just got weird. I was expecting a simple comedy about a stand up comic who ran for president and got elected because people were sick of run of th emill politics. Thats what I wanted, but sadly thats not what I got. This movie has some odd conspiracy twist to it where a company who makes voting computers has a glitch and an employee finds out and threatens to expose it. The company gives her some injection to make her seem insane and yada yada yada, I shut the film off. Why couldnt they just make a simple comedy without this rediculous \\"other\\" plot...dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable","review":"I purchased this movie because I saw the trailer on tv and wasn't ever able to see it in the theaters.

Boy was I wrong, this is suppose to be a comedy but you don't even get anything laughable in the first 20 minutes. This movie was so unbearable to watch and I wasn't able to even sit through the first 30 minutes. Save your money and do not purchase this DVD. Go and spent your money on either RV or Mrs. Doubtfire, both are Robin at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falsely promoted and misguided","review":"Promoted as a Robin Williams romp, for some reason the movie focuseson a whacko conspiracy about electronic voting. That whole storylineis dull and simplistic. Amazingly, after Williams is elected president,nothing remotely funny happens.

The only bright spot is a lively performance by Walken, who is humurous with his numerous analogies.Overall, it was just shocking how badly this movie disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:With its comedy largely recycled from Robin Williams' standup gigs and its plot a hideous amalgam of thriller, comedy, and message picture (not to mention advertisement for Saturday Night Live), Man of the Year is one of the last movies anyone should add to their lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed a programmer on writing staff","review":"The BASIC premise of this movie was interesting, and the story is mildly entertaining, but any high school student with programming experience could tell you that the reason behind the computer glitch is too lame to give any credibility.

Bad jokes at that.Then along came Laura. She took a bad script, bad director, and took over this film. Her acting was intriguing. The script was uneven, but she was able to suspend your disbelief.I still don't know if the voting glitch was deliberate or accidental, it didn't clear that up. It also didn't unfold well enough or explain the outcome too well.Laura saves the movie. I was going to give it one star, but give it 2 stars for her acting. If anyone in this film was suspect to being \\"on something\\" it would have been Robin, he is so spastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different","review":"This is something different for Williams as he plays a 'presidential' role. He struts his stuff and unique personality as a comedian who is urged by the public to run for president of the United States on the Independant ticket.

Then a serious cover up involving voting machine errors is outed by an employee and William's character must decide if he's going to stand by his platform of complete honesty, or ignore the worker's contention that he didn't really win the election.

However, when I finally saw this movie, my first impression was that it could not be further from the truth.

The movie starts out slow and remains that way for about the first thirty minutes, then the suspense part kicks in and starts keeping you a little on edge throughout the rest of the movie. Suspense in a supposed comedy movie?Man of the Year is a great example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything from the poster, to the trailer, to the online advertisements makes this movie look and feel like a comedy.

I assumed this was a true statement since Wilton is (or was) an American company. When the vise arrived, the box was clearly marked \\"Made in China\\". I bought this vise because I thought it was NOT made in Asia. Asian vises have a propensity to be easily damaged due to sub-standard metallurgy. I could have saved time (and money) by purchasing a Craftsman vise (they're now made in China too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Quality","review":"I purchased this vise because the box stated made by Wilton. I must say that I am disappointed. The metallurgy is inferior to other Wilton vises that I've used. The jaws and anvil are soft and distort easily.

I could have purchased a REAL boat anchor for less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boat Anchor","review":"I wrote the first review before I ever used this vise. Now that I have used it, the ONLY positive thing I can say about it is that it MIGHT work as a boat anchor. Every part of this item bent, broke or failed to do what any decent vise should have done. For example, when I was flattening out some #12 copper wire, it actually left DENTS in the surface of the anvil! I have since replaced it with a used (but American-made) Wilton vise. I am NOT Asia bashing. I'm quite sure that the factory where this was made would NEVER use this piece of junk in their own workshops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ventshade works well...","review":"Ventshade works well.

The wilderness of Patagonia is all there for you feast your eyes upon. And these boys go deep into it all in hell-blazing glory. If you're into fly fishing, well, the romance of \\"A River Runs Through It\\" will look like the philosophical examination of Presbyterian grace that it is--that is, right after you get muddied by the insane, jaw-dropping, heart-stopping adventures of AEG's Trout Bums Diaries.

It's a classic B movie. To take a bunch of nobody actors and come up with a halfway decent movie is pretty exceptional in my opinion. It's not the the greatest horror of all time but well worth the watch. Wether or not it's worth $30.00 is up to the fan. I, personally am not going to give it. I don't understand taking it out of print when you have movies out there like The Fog, Boogieman, Dark Water, and Lady in the Water just to name a few. Those movies shouldn't have ever been produced. Madman is ten times better than they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth having in your collection...cheesy and poorly done","review":"This may be worth checking out one time just to see a poor piece of slasher film history in the making that was so popular in the eighties. I'm surprised at the Amazon review saying this was one of the better ones because it is not. If you want to see some decent slasher films that you may have missed, try Just Before Dawn or The Prowler. Of course it's always a bonus if horror films have good acting and likeable actors. Well, this one has neither. This was just a film that was trying to cash in on the success of Friday the 13th however no effort was really made in making this one stand out at all. The 'Madman' looks really hokey. There are a few good moments worth savoring but otherwise, this was not intended for repeated viewings.

The only part I thought looked cool was the first shot they show of the madman standing up in the tree (same shot from DVD cover but looks different in the film). That was kind of spooky. It all goes downhill from there.You know your in trouble when they are actually showing the death scenes of each character in the beginning of the film before the characters have actually been killed.Pass on this one guys....."},{"rating":"1","title":"madman- i think ill turn into a madman after watching this atrocity","review":"OH MY GOD-WHERE DO I BEGIN. Well if i had to choose a movie that best resembled Friday the 13th, this would take the cake. Its about a mad farmer who butchered his family blah blah blah and went into the woods where he was hung by the townspeople. The next day he was gone, still lurking in the woods. Cut somewhat years ahead and a group of teens are ready to close camp for the fall. Some loser who acts like he is in a William Shakespeare play tells them that if they say the farmers name above a whisper, he will hear it and kill everyone. YAWN!!! Well another loser calls out his name and guess what happens. No suspense. No T&A. Little gore.

I am a horror movie fanatic and this has to be one of my top 5 scariest. The acting is amateur to say the least but the star of the movie is Madman Marz. There are no daytime scenes, the old house sends chills up your spine and the foggy silhouettes of huge Madman Marz are enough to frighten anyone. The opening scenes of him murdering his family (including his 2 small children) set the scene and let you know right away that he has no regard for human life. The mystery surrounding him, the slight glimpses you catch of him during the movie, the silence with which he moves about are all enough to keep you tense. Granted, there are several scenes (like the hot tub and the meditation in front of the fireplace) that could have met the cutting room floor, but overall if you could imagine yourself in the situation of these camp counselors, you probably wouldn't want to watch this one alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoops..","review":"I saw this movie when I was a kid and thought it might be worth it to see it again years later.

It's kind of like The Fog, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween (sort of), and Friday the 13th. To get scared in this movie, you do have to take it seriously, and try not to crack jokes about it. If you do that, then I'mn sure this will be an experience you won't forget anytime soon. Watch this one alone in the dark.

Unlike other camp slasher movies that feature teenagers as the victims, under the assumption that anyone under the age of 20 is a complete moron, this one posits that older people don't have a lick of sense either. The first one goes in search of a missing kid, then another goes in search of that one, and another goes out to find that one, ad nauseum. Cliches abound, like the vehicle that won't start (twice), the axe coming from nowhere, the woman who trips and sprains her ankle while fleeing the killer. Everyone...moves...so...slowly. And for those with the patience of Job who sit through this mess, the ending, while different than expected, is rushed and completely dissatisfying.

Now, I'm gay so I usually don't care about these things, but these people were disctractingly ugly with horrible hairdos and makeup.

From an experienced horror movie fan, i can tell you the death scenes were cheap & lame, the camp councelors were 110 years old so that was pretty boring, as there were not many sex scenes either, and lets face it, it's all part of the horror movie package. The music also plays a huge part in any movie especially horror, and in this movie the only music was a kinda violin gone wrong sound and the occasional grunt from the murdering farmer - madman marz.

It was kind of funny each time the ball pushed through without popping open the door I had to hand it to my daughter to solve the maze so I could try a different approach for getting the door open.

I was giving them money, but wanted to do it in a cute way and these puzzles were perfect. It didn't take them too long to open them, only a few minutes, but everyone got a kick out if watching while they did. Just make sure you set the marble to the beginning of the maze, when it first comes its near the end and I opened it right away, but with the marble at the beginning it takes a little longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke while recipient was unwrapping.","review":"Interesting concept, but poor durability. While the bank was being unwrapped, the maze portion of the bank separated from the outer clear box, spilling its contents. Needless to say, this was very disappointing.

I was very careful when closing the door, because I was concerned about this latch breaking. I decided to solve the maze once, to test it out. In the solved position, the metal ball presses down on a plunger, which is supposed to release the latch. When the plunger pressed down on the latch, the latch snapped off.A disappointing waste of $10. Save your money, and pass this item by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken on first use.","review":"We try to gift money to the grandchildren in clever ways. This was a complete dud. The tab that was at the end of the maze, and should have opened the door, was broken. What a disappointment.

This was a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, poor product","review":"My son did research online and wanted this for his birthday. The first one arrived, but we couldn't open the lid at the end point. We were disappointed. Some reviews said this product had poor quality, some work and some don't work. So we decided to give it a second chance. We returned the first one and ordered a second one. The delivery was fast, however, the lid of the second one was always open without even trying. Apparently a piece was broken, so no latch at all. Great idea, but the manufacturing was very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"I have never in almost 50 purchases from Amazon returned ANYTHING, until this piece of junk came! This is a VERY cheaply made item! The lock does not work! You can open the box no matter where the ball is in the puzzle. What is the point of doing the puzzle if you can just open it when ever you want?? Looks like all the good reviews where 2-3 years ago & maybe there was a better product being sold at that time, but now, very very unacceptable. I had purchased for my 10 yr olds birthday, may as well just hand him the money, because this is basically just a money holder not a puzzle to get the money out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product cheaply made","review":"I was so excited to get this product but after opening up the package i was dissapointed.

I don't exactly know where this was made, but their Quality Control is sub-par, as there was actually a HAIR INSIDE THE MAZE when I opened the package.

The concept is good, but the little steel ball takes about two turns of the wrist and the \\"puzzle\\" is solved. I fiddled with it and got the ball to go deeper, but that only messed up the latching mechanism to the point where it wouldn't work. Anyway, I dropped it and the whole thing broke, so in the end it was all a laughable waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I bought 4 of these mazes for my nephews and only one actually worked.

And yes, I started from the beginning, solved it, closed the latch again and resolved it.I wanted to make sure it would work for Christmas, when I present it to my boyfriend, for the first part of my plan.I'm somewhat discouraged to give it to him now, because it's quite easy to open.I would recommend this only for kids under twelve. Maybe even a bit younger than that....Although...if you just present the box to someone and don't tell them how to open it...that might present them with a challenge, because the opening device isn't extremely obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Delite","review":"I ordered 2 of the puzzle qubes. One was cracked and joints not properly glued. Because of time contraints I couldn't return it so I patched it myself. The qubes were for two kids. They enjoyed them. I had to ship the qubes through the mail. The steel ball made a loud rattle. I wish there was a way to secure the ball during shipment, like with a pull string (or nylon tie wrap)to release it and make ready for play. Before shipping I tried to maneuver the ball as far away from the latch as possible, but no telling how close the ball got to the latch after shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a bible for the more advanced & more at ease playing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed it (reading and watching the dvd) - except that it was more than I bargained for (total rank beginner) - (plays other instruments and composer)I had no experience reading tab, and the gradiant was confusing - plus instead of tuning it and staying in one key for a few songs, each tune presented was in a different tuning -These are also complete arrgs. by Ken - What I needed were single line melodies, (I'm a fiddler) that I could play as I heard them -Just lost interest, mainly because was not at his level of competence -plus could not get at that time the basic bum ditty stroke down -however, I can see it's value when one is more comfortable with the mechanics of playing, and conversant with tab."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!","review":"Its not real!!

I have medium length fairly thick hair that's fairly dry and this brush does make it shiny and look amazing when I brush my hair and I like the bristles a lot, they're not too soft and not too hard.My only two complaints are that my scalp starts to hurt after a while from the nylon bristles, I don't press very hard with the brush or use it for too long either, and the brush does make my hair pretty staticy so I usually have to put extra anti-frizz spray in and use my Sephora paddle brush after wards.Other than those two things, I love this brush, I use it daily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maso Pearson Brush Review","review":"It is a nice brush, but it is way overpriced. I have many brushes, and none of them are anywhere near the price of this brush. Also I find the material used to make the brush to be rather cheap feeling and looking, nothing like I expected when I paid $100 for a brush. The handle does not fit comfortably into my hand either.

I originally used it as a sun umbrella though I found the shade from it somewhat unsatisfactory. It feels as though the sun's rays and warmth go right through it. I was using the umbrella as a sun umbrella on a mild so-Cal fall day and a slight breeze turned it inside out. Very disappointing.

It will barely cover your body. In my opinion it should not be used as your \\"full-time\\" umbrella. That being said, this umbrella does what it supposed to do very well. It keeps you dry in emergencies and it's VERY COMPACT. I use this umbrella to put in my laptop bag in case I'm some place when it starts raining and I don't have my full sized umbrella.

She waited over 8 years before she pursued child support from a man who obviously could afford to pay it. She prostituted herself for child support when there was no need for such self-degrading behavior. I was happy that she finally found the strength to get counseling and improve her self-esteem.

These advocacy networks work alongside and often against governments in often non-traditional methods to achieve a desired result. In the case of timber harvesting, for example, advocacy networks were unsuccessful in persuading governments to alter their poicies so the organizations within that network focused on the consumers of timber. They successfully exposed the objectionable timber harvesting practices of various companies and enabled consumers to exert pressure on timber harvesting companies to change their practices."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sticks","review":"the sticks felt great i my hands. great fit.

Some of the same complaints, dust all over when cleaning, not a very good filter, and worst of all mine is not even a year old and is falling apart, pieces falling off,motor dying. What am I to do but go and buy a vacum again. I suggest that Canadian Tire Corp stops selling these cheap excuses for vacums. No way to get a hold of the company for service, always a busy signal.

TVs should really take into consideration of TV series lovers' opinions. Hope that they will admit their mistake and release new season soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"This show is amazing. The acting is superb.I won't go into the plot in much detail. Basically, a boy from a rich family is taken. They hire Knapp, a man who is an expert at finding people. The series has twists and turns and is much more in depth than just a simple ransom exchange. After the first five minutes, I was hooked.Unfortunately, the series isn't entirely wrapped up in the thirteen episodes. Apparently there was supposed to be 22. There are a few questions unanswered, which for someone like me, is really difficult. However, knowing that now, I still would do things the way I did and watch this show. Despite the few things left incomplete the show was great.NBC made a terrible decision by cancelling this show. It probably would have done better on a different station."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kidnapped me for a few nights","review":"Since I don't have the opportunity to watch much TV, I don't remember this show when it originally aired. Now having watched the series on DVD, I am completely surprised that this show wasn't renewed as it is excellent. This show snagged me from the get-go and I enjoyed each episode of the series. I highly recommend it and the unbelievably cheap price is another great selling point!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...Addictive Series Never Shown","review":"This is a great addictive series which was cancelled early in NBC's schedule in 2006.

I was so excited when I first saw there was going to be a new show with him in it. And not only him, Timothy Hutton, Dana Delany and a few other familiar faces I noticed. Unfortunately, it was aired on a bad day of the week. After I bought the whole season and watched each episode, one after the other, it was extremely better than waiting a week. I think they should have made Kidnapped into a mini-series. It would have went quickly and I think more people would have been interested in it. That's just my opinion. I won't give anything away for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but the way it ended, it could definitely have gone on to a second season starring only Jeremy Sisto, or depending on the storyline, the same actors/actresses could have been in it. When I saw it end the way it did, I was thinking, No there has to be more! Jeremy Sisto would have been great in a second season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kidnapped: Great TV","review":"Thank goodness that the DVD finishes the season that was so rudely interrupted. I wish the producers had tried Kidnapped on HBO or Showtime. It's a show that needs dedicated viewers that don't mind thinking while watching. Jeremy Sisto is wonderful. All the acting, in fact, is first-rate. The filming is impressive, and the complicated plot great fun. The plucky kidnapped victim is great bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Keeps Getting Better","review":"I was able to download the rest of the series after it was cancelled.The best part was being able to watch the remaining episodes back to back.There are a lot of major plot twists and turns and it was great not having to wait a whole week for the next one to air,as one would if it had still been on tv.The ending is a bit far fetched but at least it isn't your typical \\"who done it\\".I won't spoil how it all ends,but if you were enjoying the show while it was airing,you will want to see how it all ends.I think the main problem with the show was that there was so much to absorb each week,you had to remember every plot and subplot from week to week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tempo and phrasing","review":"Many of the selections on this CD are performed at painfully slow tempos. Very slow tempos are a challenge. They require nuanced expression and judicious use, which is lacking in these pieces.Included with the CD are very interesting notes about the Historic churches of Nantucket Island and their Organs. The pictures that accompany the notes show the diversity of the organs and if one has the patience to listen to the CD, one could probably pick out their musical differences also."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"It has been a long time since I have sat down to read a book and finished it in almost one sitting.

As with all of Mr. Beck's novels, he takes you through the story like he is right next to you retelling it. The story of Cornplanter and his people is fascinating, hard to put down, and a look into a forgotten and rarely told piece of indian history. You have got to get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will the REAL Cornplanter please stand up?","review":"Beck's contribution to the recent spate of Cornplanter biographies is a great read with skillful narration and an eye for the dramatic. Would be nice to see some documentation for many of the historical assumptions that Mr. Beck makes. I assume that \\"artistic license\\" might be called upon to defend the author, but I would be more pleased with historical documentation. Nevertheless, I would recommend this book for a good overall picture of the Seneca Chief's life and times; and despite faults, it's a worthy contribution to the genre. Well worth reading and comparing with the other Gyantwachia biographies now in circulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Like Moore","review":"It is no wonder that when I searched for this book Michael Moore's books also came up.

It is littered with conspicuous and outrageously bad syntax and grammer errors. Page after page I encountered missing periods, missing commas, run-on sentences, and awkward sentence structures. Frankly, I find this type of sloppy editing and writing to be intolerable.The author's premise for the book's primary story theme is based on his dream encounter with a ghostly Native American. He has this encounter after a late night coyote shooting spree with an AK-47. Besides being totally repulsed by the shooting incident I was struck by the utter amateurishness of the writing style.I am very interested in this period of history and, in particular, trying to educate myself on the Iroquois Confederacy.

You do have to follow with a clean cloth to finish up the job, but it makes it very easy by disolving the grime. I also cleaned my oven with it, and it powers away the grease and mess with ease. The steam is super hot, and I felt like I was really able to sanitize my floors with it, which is important to me with small children crawling around. Additionally, it can be used to clean out small spaces which are normally difficult to clean, like cupholders in the car, around taps in the bathrooms etc. I think this is a great product, and well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I got it from a thrift shop","review":"Meh.

In the preface the author states that much of the material for the book was pulled from his lecture notes and it shows in the text. There is litte narrative flow and the writing style is somewhat stilted. What this book needs above all is a good editor.

In the 60's, a young coach and his wife travel to his first solo assignment in a small town with the expectation of coaching a boys' basketball team. After \\"Clay\\" has accepted the position and moved, he is informed that he will be coaching girls and that the towns' support of his program is virtually nonexistent. Adult politics and prejudice are constants in his battle to transform nice farm girls into basketball players, but the girls are the surprise in this sweet sleeper of a movie. They are realistic but determined to have a program \\"like the boys'\\" and their persistence and determination are absent of malice or crudeness. Clay, his wife, and the girls have ups and downs and unexpected growth in many ways but triumph in this fact-based story. It is great family entertainment that shows a realistic slice of life for many Americans before Title IX."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great girls' sports movie!","review":"I just found this movie by accident in the movie rental store and was most pleased with it. It is based on a true story, and true stories always make for good movies. It is about this basketball coach who thinks he's getting hired to train boys and instead gets the women's team. Being a former military man that is rather insulting. But with the excellent advice of his insightful wife, he turns the team around and becomes a hero to the young ladies on his team. The actor portraying the coach is likeable and the movie was well done. I recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Based on a true story","review":"A young man shows up at a small-town Oklahoma high school, expecting to coach the boys' basketball team. Instead, he is informed that he will be coaching the girls' team. The girls' team has never done well in this town, but the new coach decides that he is going to treat them as if they are boys. That plan comes under some fire from his wife, but eventually the coach gets it right and the girls begin to win some games. This is an inspiring story of a man who thinks that girls deserve the same opportunities to play sports and to be successful at it as boys do. Unfortunately, not everyone in the small Oklahoma town agrees with him, but that just makes the story more interesting. This is an enjoyable and inspiring movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"see my comments where it says 1 comment after another poster","review":"I wrote my review in the the wrong comment section after another poster's review, stupid me.When you read it you'll see there are other Jim Keith's out there in this big country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe in me","review":"Good sports story, Being from Oklahma & familiar with western Oklahma I did enjoy this moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe in Me","review":"This is a great movie, very inspiring, well acted and just fun.

Today it includes an astonishing array of creatures, most famously the family of hawks nesting on Fifth Avenue and 74th Street. It has been fascinating to watch them hunt and raise their young. Although I've been aware of them for some years now, I learned so very much more about them from this book. It's a dramatic story of the endurance and adaptability of life under extremely difficult circumstances. It's also a fascinating story of a group of dedicated people who care so much for the birds of the park. And, for someone who virtually grew up in Central Park, it came as a revelation of an inner life unsuspected till recently. The weekend after I finished this book I located places in the Rambles that I never knew existed (the Azalea pond) and was rewarded with my first ever glimpse of a woodpecker hard at work!

The only small criticism that I might make is that the water in the tub seems to cool off faster than I expected with a \\"THERMAL\\" Bath Mat operating. I think that it would be more accurate to delete the word \\"THERMAL\\" from the product name because my home water heater seemed to be the only source of heat involved in the process. That being said, I would still recommend this product to my friends if they could get it for under $200. I was pleasntly surprised by how well it worked.

The bubbles are no doubt amazing, they're plenty strong even at the lowest setting. As for the massage part, I didn't use that too much- it just vibrates some, and the bubbles seemed to be more massaging than the vibrating massager. The only thing I did not really care for is that it was kind of difficult to keep on the tub floor. It has suction cups, but they didn't work too well- everytime I moved my feet or legs, it wanted to float to the top of the water. Overall, I'd say this is a pretty good gift!

The dust container is triangular and the inner filter is round.

The ones which are present are very difficult to see in dotted grey on a white back ground. They do not contrast well with the road (solid grey) and jeep trails (hatched grey) or the contour lines (brown). The only use of color is blue for streams.Unless you have to purchase this for use with a Garmin GPS unit, I recommend DeLorme's Topo USA which gives you the same level of detail for the whole US for the same price as this one region.

The sheer, raw, intense energy of Mars, the Elgarian styled central theme of Jupiter (think \\"Pomp & Circumstance\\", the graduation march, only a lot better). But best of all are the more mystic pieces: Venus, Neptune, Uranus. Whenever as a teenager my mind was not at ease I would listen to Venus and be calmed....OK, I'm getting campy here. But just to reassure you - I was NEVER a \\"Star Trek\\" fan.One last word: while the Previn recording is awesome, I've heard that Adrian Boult's recording with the London Philharmonic is by far the best.

The later models have the control on the front - that might be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Lived!","review":"Excellent product when first received. Food fried quickly,tasted great and the oil lasted longer. After about six months the circuit breaker on the fryer kept popping. I quickly discovered that the thermostat had gone bad allowing the fryer to overheat and trip the circuit breaker. Item is still under warranty but the postage to mail the item back for repair and back to me would equal half as much as the fryer cost.

I went to their recital and enjoyed their performance pretty much. The musicians played with a lot of emotion and strength, I especially liked the guitar.Most of the songs they played were originally written for guitar and flute, and they also performed works by contemporary composers. \\"Confidencial No.2\\" is a tribute to three Spanish villages that are going to be flooded because of the construction of a dam. Following the composers instruction, Moliner put three stands on the stage to represent the three villages and moved around playing her flute which is very special. \\"L'histoire du tango\\" is a suite about the evolution of Tango music, each piece is about an important style of Tango."},{"rating":"1","title":"No book received.","review":"I ordered this book at least three weeks ago at pre-registration.

I read a glowing review of it in Entertainment Weekly and was not disappointed in the least. This is an absolutely *must have* for anyone who has an artistic interest and wants to better understand why some works of art are considered masterpieces, what their historical context is, the life of the person who created them, and what has happened to them - physically, culturally - from their creation to now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely well researched","review":"This series is wonderful.

Needless to say, it is not meant for OTR shipping. When the vise arrived, it had been displaced numerous times in the box since it was not anchored to anything. This displacement of the vise actually sheared a perfect arc off of the 1/8\\" piece of plywood underneath it, corresponding to the vise base. This displacement also caused one of the mounting feet from the vise to break off and the vise had to be returned. Upon calling Amazon for return, they told me that the vise was no longer available and I was to receive a refund. The refund was correct compensation, but it made me waste approximately one and a half weeks of my time to get another vise from another location."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"I have studied the book about admiral Yonai. So what I tell here is only about that. But for me it is enough.

Most facts about Yonai in \\"Tree Military Leaders\\" are wrong. And a lot about Yamamoto too! That was enough for me to lay down the book and keep it that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great simple sandal, but not very good support","review":"My son is somewhat flat-footed, and these shoes don't have any support features, liek Birkenstock for example.

Unfortunately I was badly disappointed. In addition there is no customer service - website down (six months), telephone always busy.My problems with this unit now include noisy, defective fan, oven door does not close properly leaking warm air and no customer service. In addition to this the product does a very poor job of cooking food as the heat is not distributed evenly (possibly due to defective fan) and the cooking time is not appreciably less than a regular oven.My experience with Euro-pro is \\"great specs on paper, poor performance of products\\". I am very disappointed with Euro-pro as a company and this product in particular. I can not afford the shipping to send the product back to them in New York state. If I could I would tell them to keep it....Thank you!Jim Pepoon (Jpepoon@aol.com)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"Customer service is non-existent, HSN is unhelpful, as is the warranty company that HSN used for the extended warranty.

While using it to melt cheese on a sandwich today (at a low heat setting) the door shattered and glass flew all over my kitchen.

Takes forever to heat, and does not attain the kinds of radiant temps that even a cheapie Black & Decker does. I don't have any sense that the convection feature does anything at all except make noise.

It takes about 10 minutes to heat up. So I turn it on and walk away (make a pot of coffee, scramble some eggs, etc.), then put the bread in. It is hit or miss whether the burners will ever actually turn red after this lenth of time. My toast will come out either burnt, or the oven will turn off (but not the ticking timer) before it's toasted even a little bit. No consistency with the brownness settings. I find I have to stand in front of the unit for 5 minutes and watch it like a hawk so I can turn it off at the right moment (meanwhile my coffee and eggs are getting cold).My old Black and Decker (RIP) used to make perfect toast to my desired settings in 1-2 minutes.I have not used this oven for baking, because most of the frozen foods I buy say \\"not recommended for convection ovens\\".All in all, takes up a lot of counter space and provides no usefulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well design when it works","review":"I don't like giving negative reviews, but to receive a dual lamp light fixture with both bulbs defective is annoying.

Whilst some books create tenuous links supported by few actual facts, this author invents facts all on his own and then presents them as empirical research. I have no doubt that Mr Byrne has had an interesting time researching this book, and (as others have mentioned) there are some items of historical note presented in a highly readable way, this book should be taken no more seriously than Dan Brown - and has about as much a basis in fact as the aforementioned authors own books.In short, if this was sold as a work of fiction then it would be reasonably entertaining, as a conspiracy theory book it borders on lunacy, and considering it as a work of research should result in someone being incarcerated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Christianity","review":"A good mission but poor delivery. I was very, very, very disappointed that this DVD focused on Christianity. The DVD should have mentioned that in its cover. Once a person combines history with mythology and then presents that mythology as historical facts - then it poses a big problem. The DVD lost credibility once that was done. I would file this DVD under Christianity or Religion. If you expect pure history, you will be disappointed, with this product. I would actually like to return my copy or give it away for free. Very disappointed. I gave it two stars because the mission of the documentary, as I understood it, to reveal history from the other side of the story (from Africans themselves) was good, but the execution was very poor, mixing it with Serapis Christos. I would advice the producers to get more historical facts on Serapis before they try and impose that on other people.

Yeah, right! With the exception of a short section with a convict called Cheater, the book is rife with one-dimensional characters.The explanation of the 'werewolf lifestyle ' is laboriously drawn out and, in addition to being incredulous,is boring.

It feels cheap, and performs only so-so. It appears as though it was purchased in a dollar store, or at the check-out counter at your local convenience store. You have to push the buttons hard to change the alarm time, etc. The buttons feel as though they have a weak electrical connection. They don't contact unless you really press on them. It is a poor design and cheaply made. Also, it doesn't keep good time.Worst of all, after only 6 months or so, the clock malfunctioned. I woke up to the vibrating puck going off (erradically) and I could not shut it off. Turning the alarm \\"off\\" like I do every morning had no effect. I had to unplug the vibrating device.

For instance, I rarely sleep with my hearing aids, so the loud alarm isn't necessary. What I do use is the bed shaker and the flashing light. Set simultaneously, I wake up instantly. It is not the most soothing way to wake up, but I don't have another choice. I read previous reviews that normal hearing people use it if they consistently oversleep; I left the alarm on accidently when my husband was home. Needless to say, he wasn't happy with me!

That's how this CD became my first Basia CD. I still play it to this day and never, never get sick of it. I loved the diversity on the lyrics and music types it contains. Agree with a previous poster; Basia is Europe's best kept secret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun story complemented by superb illustrations","review":"Before there was Harry Potter, there was Harvey Potter, gentleman balloon farmer. Jerdine Nolen's story is fun and plays off a child's natural curiosity. The story is great--a little girl spies on the farmer of a balloon farm to figure out exactly how he grows those balloons (and, of course, it turns out that he uses good old-fashioned magic). But what really makes this book a stand-out are Mark Buehner's superb illustrations. Slyly employing a style and upright look that recalls both Grant Wood and Edward Hopper, Buehner turns the volume up by using super-saturated colors--perfect for a book about magic and balloons. There is almost more humor and wonder in the pictures than in the text. I highly recommend this book, especially for budding artists. The pictures are just a joy to gaze upon and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best children's books out there","review":"My son (3-1/2 years old) and I love this book. It is absolutely delightful. The colorful illustrations, the hidden images, the story itself...it's wonderful. The text demands to be read outloud and is completely appropriate. We read it several times a week and I look forward to it each time. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive intentional bad grammar, not appropriate","review":"I was offended by the bad grammar that was demeaning of both farmers and black children. The book portrayed both as being uneducated. I will not make light of this \\"language\\" and treat it as slang. One example starts \\"We never knowed how to grow nothin' but trees\\". Another example is \\"Harvey Potter grew me a balloon that was big enough to carry me off. That's how I landed in this here place.\\" This does not rate any stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful story!","review":"What an excellent book this is!

Leave the water in and you have a large bowl of filling soup for around twenty cents, drain the water and you have flavored noodles. Pair two packs with mixed stir fry veggies and some cut up chicken or beef and you have a meal for four that costs a little over a dollar per person. There is a good ramen noodle recipe book on Amazon:The Book of Ramen : Lowcost Gourmet Meals Using Instant Ramen Noodlesbut I have found that most of my best ramen noodle recipes are ones I created making mock ups of favorite foods like beef stroganoff, lo mein, tuna noodle casserole, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth almost a dollar each","review":"Really, over $10 for 12.

What a piece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very well written book.","review":"I really enjoyed the delightful mix of drama, suspense, and action in this novel. I thought it was very well written and I had never heard of this author before. Claire Heller Chapman is an outstanding character, with plenty of spunk and smarts, but we could have done without the irritating little six year old daughter, I'm not sure what she had to do with it all. Her character description and dialogues made me think the author was not very familiar with children of that age group. Overall, I think the child should have been left out. Also, my paperback version of this book was missing pages 149 - pgs 180! It's a brand new copy - but given to me by someone as a gift, so I cannot return it. The author did so well with the writing and flow of the story though, I was able to keep on reading and not feel like I missed too much. Without those missed pages and the little girl, I would have rated this book five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining.","review":"I liked this book very much although at times it got technical when dealing with the Military and Lawyers.

Both should be on your 'Must Read' list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"As I continue to search for a good thriller, picked this one and honestly cannot understand the rave reviews. While an interesting idea, it was not well written and the characters were not flushed out. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, derivative","review":"Yes, this is a fast read. That's because it reads as if it were an adaptation of a screenplay, rather than the other way around. You can visualize each and every scene as it should appear on the movie screen, and it appears that it was written specifically to be sold to the studios. It's also very predictable. The climax could be seen from miles off, as could several of the events during the story.The book tries to be a cross between Scott Turow (for the legal aspects) and Tom Clancy (for the military parts). In that, it succeeds, but is not as interesting as books by the other two authors. Turow's \\"Presumed Innocent\\" is better written and has much the same plot and climax twists. I'd recommend reading that book over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action thriller","review":"JOSEPH FINDER WRITES A VERY SUSPENSEFUL BOOK WHICH WOULD MAKE A GREAT MOVIE.

When she believes her husband has been falsely accused of a heinous military atrocity which smacks of the Vietnamese aromaticity at My Lia, lawyer takes on the US army in a secret courts-martial. Her husband stands accused of committing the murder of 187 innocent civilians in Central America.As with other Finder novels there are plots and cross-plots and of course the surprise ending.Written pre-9/11, it is still a gripping tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Entertaining, Fast Read","review":"As in The Moscow Club and Extraordinary Powers, Joseph Finder has written a very entertaining,fast-paced book that once you start , you won't want to put down.The story has lots of surprises, the dialogue is crisp and, for the most part, realistic. The main characters are mostly likable but could have been more fully developed. Nonetheless, High Crimes is well worth reading! Further, if this is your first book by Finder, you might also want to read The Moscow Club and Extraordinary Powers. His third book, The Zero Hour, was not as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic! No Serious Legal Research. Baseless Commentary.","review":"The most pathetic book I have ever read. It is sinful that the author claims to be legally accurate; vis a vis: \\"legal consultants\\" in the acknowledgements. The lack of legal research obviates itself. As a federal law enforcement officer, I can tell you with 100% certainty (refering to page 16)that there is no such thing as \\"...authorized to kill,\\" nor \\"...permitted to wound if necessary\\". That's what made the Nazis the Nazis. From this point forward, the book revealed its hand in making the following political statement: \\"The only true evil is the US Government\\". I truely hope that all Americans are embarrassed at the author's feeble attempts at realism (\\"...authorized to wound\\" etc.). The only reason I finished this book is that it was an anniversary present from my wife and she said that I had to. Don't waste your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Displeased","review":"After reading the book I shared my Kindle to a friend for them to read this compelling story. After many emails and phone conversations the pages to this book refuse to turn without a 15 second delay. The problem still avails, even after rebuying the book. I am very disappointed .... The odd thing, this is the only book that I have ever had any trouble with at all. I shall have to purchase this book in a local book store if my friend wants to finish reading it.

It kept me interested. It will make a good movie if the scriptwriters don't screw it up. Finder's characters, decent dialogue, twists and turns, tech terrorism, electronic gadgetry make it a significant cut above the plethora of \\"government agency mystery novels.\\" And how does Finder begin? \\"He that has eyes to see and ears to hear may convince himself that no mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.\\" Sigmund Freud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not deep -- but fast and scary","review":"Fasten your seat belts for this one. You got a professional woman (tough-talking, but you get used to it), her too good to be true hubby, the requisate cute kid...and plot twists that come at you so fast and so unexpected you could get whiplash. Is he a good guy? a bad guy? is he a liar? Reads like a movie, which is good and bad- fast fast fast, unbearably exciting, but not a lot of texture or stopping for reflection. Also really well plotted. Best potboiler I've read in years. It's not Proust, but I never liked Proust anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not thrill me","review":"Lured by many acclaim notes in the front and back covers, yet I could not find that spark that gets me trapped to this plot because in this story I have experienced Finder's trademark again, he uses to write serious drama in his books with the depth and times you will find in an afternoon soap opera. The story unfolds like a tale published in the pages of a glossy magazine. The final product is a light fast read suitable for a cross country flight if you don't like the plane magazines"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE.","review":"If you don't already have this CD- You Are Missing Out!

It's just like rawkfist, I don't how you could say this is such a new sound for them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Farewell TFK.","review":"*Blech* That's about my summation of this album. Gone are the days of old for TFK when in-your-face rhyming would be wonderfully interlaced with well-placed breakdowns and lots and lots of scratch in the background... Welcome to the new all-too-often-heard recycled rock sound that litters the streets of the music scene today. I just felt like most of the songs sounded the same, and the total absence of all rap was a slap in the face. I could just sense with \\"Phenomenon\\" that TFK wanted to go a new route with their music (very much like their FM-Static side-group), and sadly my suspicions were confirmed with \\"The Art Of Breaking\\".It's sad to see yet another one of my favorite bands fall into the music machine of the majority of mainstream bands out there. I don't deny their right as artists to change their style, but I'm not going to be suckered in to liking this album just because I was once a loyal fan...Sorry to say it, but the TFK that once was is now long gone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an okay CD","review":"This CD is okay but definitly not what I was expecting. I was suprised when I bought this Cd to find out that almost all of the songs sound alike. The lyrics are also not that great and they have a weird tune to them. If i had to have a favortie song on this CD it would have to be The Art of Breaking and Absolute because they both sound at least mildly good."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?!?!","review":"Where is the up-beat hope-filled hard rock/rap TFK were used to? Instead this is a venom spraying subliminal mess of try-to-be Christian rock. I mean song number nine is kind of a mess of something that is not what I would call Christian at all (it had promise but the mainstream would say something different). I hope that they get back to their base, grab hold of their Christian roots, and rock for Christ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great film","review":"Fantastic film, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

I was robbed, I think. \\"Based on a True Story\\" is the first disappointment. The kidnapping itself is well documented, and this film doesn't even hold to the facts, other than Shergar was taken from the farm. The filmmakers then weave a fantastic and unbelievable tale of what they think happened (complete with human hair dye that doesn't sweat off of a horse, but rinses off completely in the rain), and a preposterous ending where we're not even sure that the horse is dead.And what in heavens happened to Mickey Roarke's face??? Did he have plastic surgery in a strip mall? He looks like Tahlulah Bankhead in male drag (or that he got Angelina Jolie's lips). Ian Holm, as always, is great, but he's not in enough of the movie to make it worthwhile. And, to note, this is definitely NOT a kid's movie. Or an adult's, for that matter.

I had no idea how the city was actually built. And for all it's horrors, did something good come out of the cocaine trade in the 70's and 80's? This is a fast paced film that really does a good job of explaining the history of Miami. The people in this film are letting you in on secrets.

The documentary covers the flashiest crimes and personalities in the cocaine explosion of the 1980's. Director Billy Corben tells the story of the city built on cocaine via interviews with smugglers, hit men, and dealers. This isn't a socio-political look at the drug trade, rather, it is a down-and-dirty Wild West story, complete with a Godmother who could give Scarface a run for his money.It does drag in parts, and could have been told in a more streamlined fashion. Even at 2-hours on length, the DVD has another two dozen deleted scenes, for anyone who wants more time with the men on the street. Anyone who enjoyed Scarface or Blow needs to pick this one up, as does any armchair economic historian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great In All Aspects","review":"As a Miami resident, I found the film to be intriguing and very informative.

We've all heard the stories of how coccaine used to flow through Miami in the 70s and 80s but never in my life had I even imagined just how much money was changing hands.This real life story of the the Miami coccaine trade is just totally amazing.

More of a shockumentary then a documentary, most of the major players are interviewed and all of them tell a pretty compelling story about the cocaine trade of Miami. You could tell that these guys were proud of what they did and how they pulled it off.

She has one still working made by a more expensive company and hard plastic, her older one,made from the rubbermaid type plastic, she cannot even remember how long she has had it, the mix handle finally gave way-I remember it in her home at least 30 yrs ago...Anyway I am buying her 3 of this type for the price of 1 of the other company I believe my sister may have bought for her as she wouldn't pay that much for a kitchen item-she is 85yrs old and their limits are different than ours. I truely recommend this type for those with arthritis as the mixing mechanism saves you from cramping hands using wooden spoons...Jan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly excellent gadget","review":"We are currently referring to this pitcher as \\"Best. Gadget Ever.\\"A few weeks ago, we realized we didn't actually own a pitcher. I searched around on Amazon and stumbled upon this one. The agitator sounded like a good idea and I'm generally confident with Rubbermaid products.When the pitcher arrived a few days later, it was an instant hit. It makes stirring powdered drink mixes a breeze. Since it arrived, we've had lemonade in the fridge every day. The lemonade also tastes better since it's thoroughly mixed.Admittedly, the pitcher is fun to use. Be sure not to overfill it or leave the lid set at pour while you're agitating. It's rather like not putting the lid on a blender.Definitely a two thumbs up product in our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORKS great for mixing formula!","review":"Instead of purchasing Dr. Browns Mixing Pitcher, I went to Ace Hardware and purchased this for $10. I had to write measurements on this (why I put 4 stars instead of 5) but technically this is not for baby formula and all other powders may be pre-measured... Works great to have bottles ready to go in the fridge! And im sure works great for any other drinks as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised!","review":"Silly me, ended up paying more for the S&H than for the Pitcher itself. I simply do not like it when I do this kind of transaction. I should have read the fine print but as far as the Pitcher is concerned I am very pleased. Looks good and it is perfect for mixing drinks inside. Fits on the side of the refrigerator and now I wish I would have bought 2 instead of 1. Unless, of course, the Shipping charges would have cost double. I think this Pitcher cost around $4.00 - $5.00 and the S&H cost $6.95. Wouldn't it be nice if everything Amazon sold would have the option of Free S&H for purchases over $25.00? Let me tell you this: there would be no ending of purchases!

Today is August 17 and I still have not received it. That is ridiculous! I have contacted the company twice and the second time was to cancel the order. The second time they informed me they were shipping the pitcher that day (today). NEVER did they offer free shipping or did they allow me to cancel my order or did they say anything about that - only an excuse as to why the product was taking a long time (they were waiting on the company they get the pitchers from to send a shipment).

The rack has two levels which it is cranky about changing. Because they do not easily slide, I find myself trying to brace against the hot surface of the oven.

There is no temperature setting -- it's either \\"bake on\\" or \\"bake off.\\" Although I've had better luck with toast than the previous reviewer, I have the same situation with broil.

I have a lot of stainless steel appliances large and small - have no problem cleaning those and shining with Windex, but this toaster seems to attract the dirt and grease and not let go of it. The spots then turn brown with heat, of course and the toaster looks old and ugly after a year of use.5. Same goes for the glue trace rectancle from the warning sticker on top - I was not able to remove all of it so it turned brown with time.

You can increase the screen size which is good for me since sometimes it's hard for me to see the fingers. You can also go in slow motion. I also find that this CD has the newer signs unlike many of the CDs or websites available which have old signs. The book is something I refer to once in a while, but mainly I use the CD.

Unfortunately, Slowmotion Apocalypse is average at best and brings absolutely no new ideas into the fold.

Recorded with love, wrapped up in smiles and foot tapping rhythms. This is the CD fans of roots rock and roll have been waiting for, and the only surprise is that it was given to us by a man known better for high powered blues/rock. Alvin Lee of Ten Years After fame finally gets to bury his past as the Woodstock hero by going back to the past he really loves - that of 50s Sun Studios styled roots rock. With his childhood heros Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana keeping him subdued, Lee manages to create some of the smoothest, silkiest, swingingest music he has ever played. The liner notes makes reference to the fact that the songs both look back and look forward, and that's a great way to put it. Every one of these songs, all Alvin Lee compositions, could have been recorded in the 50s, but every one also has a contemporary feel to it - and every one is a keeper!

What with all the digital production tools at hand these days, the warmth and resonant tones of classic dub seem to have been lost somewhere along the way. Fortunately Guidance Records have found this missing ingredient, and both volumes of the Hi-Fidelity Dub Sessions series are richly steeped in it. Number one took up permanent residence in many a downtempo jock's crate, and this volume seems certain to do the same. High points include tracks by Tosca, I:Cube, and Jah Warrior"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT HORSES!!!!","review":"Movie is horrible but horses are FABULOUS!

You don't need to be a particular fan of his, not that there's anything wrong with him, because there's a good handful of films starring other old-time comedians. One of them, \\"Just Rambling Along,\\" is a very early Stan Laurel comedy, made long before he ever heard of Oliver Hardy. I enjoyed all of these little movies. They're all brisk and fast-paced, and full of fun. I had never seen most of them before, and I've been a fan of silent comedies for a long while. The prints look good and the music sounds great (no needle-drop scores here, they're all custom piano scores and nicely done).

This is, however, one of their better efforts and certainly their best studio work from 1981 to present.There are 2 GREAT Keith sung songs here- one a slow number \\"Slipping away\\" and the other a rocker \\"Can't be Seen\\". Jagger sings the rest and there's not a bad song in the batch. They even throw ina little Brian Jones tribute on \\"Continental Drift\\". Classic rock radio hasn't taken to this group of songs like some other Stones LPs but this is Rolling Stones at the top of their game."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About The Songs","review":"Steel Wheels is much maligned these days because of its polish I guess. Actually, there's some great songwriting to be found on such tracks like Almost Hear You Sigh, Slipping Away, Mixed Emotions, Hearts For Sale, etc.... There's also a spirit of adventure on Continental Drift and a burst of Exile On Main Street-like fury on Sad Sad Sad. All around, this is a wonderfully complete set from the latter day Stones. This is much better than any of the other latter day Stones post Undercover. Go ahead and give it try, it's worth the listen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Absolute Worst","review":"Avoid this album at all costs. Out of twelve songs only two or three even stand out a little. This album epitomizes what was wrong with the late 1980's music scene. The overall production of this disc is too programmed with way too many synthesizers and annoying backround vocals. Continental Drift sounds like a piece created in outer space WHERE ROCK N ROLL DOES NOT EXIST!!! As a matter of fact whats missing from this record is a solid dose of good old rock n roll. I can not understand for the life of me how the first reviewer could consider this trash a Five Star Album! Five Stars is for Classic Recordings Only.

I was concerned about the steam that came around the corners and got the control panel wet, even though I made sure the lid was on well. Then one day it got very hot and showed an error message. It scared me because it could have caught on fire - it was that hot. The grease was smoking and black as tar. The clip also fell off that the basket rested on when lifted. I tried to be very careful to not let it happen by constant monitoring, but it happened again about a year later (out of warranty of course). This time it did not come back on - it burned up.

It's much better than trying to get the oil to the desired temperature on the stove top. However, this unit is not the one to buy. It worked great for about 6 months, then it started switching on and off by itself during cooking. Now it won't come on at all. Customer service at Euro-Pro is useless. Their web site has a search box for you to enter the model number. I did and it says there is no such model. It's out of warranty, so I have no interest in throwing good money after bad.

I don't believe for a second that it would be quiet if we had actually gotten it onto our bed with a sheet over it!We didn't get that far b/c the thing tore when we were trying to unfold it. I assumed it was my husband's fault for being too rough and were were going to just live with a tear in it, but then the zipper pulled away from the plastic upon simply trying to line the zipper up to zip it.

I bought two of these thinking they were going to be different than the ones they sell around my way.When me and my husband were putting this on our mattress (I realized I had been ripped off, but didn't want to endure the hassle of sending it back to the seller) - it ripped. The zipper broke (mind you we were being extra careful) and there's a hole on the other side of it.

This is noticeable in the unique combination of short, bluesy rockers (\\"Good Clean Fun\\", \\"Let Me Ride\\") and longer, more complex pieces (\\"True Gravity\\"). A bit of the Band's influence also creeps in with the twin keyboards of Gregg Allman (organ) and Johnny Neel (piano) teaming with the twin guitars of Dickey Betts and Warren Haynes, and Allman, Betts, and Haynes sharing lead vocals and songwriting. This CD is a must-own for any true Southern rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good record","review":"I had never listened to anything by this band, and learned that this was a comeback album.

We tried to contact the place we bought the blender, but they were not interested in replacing or paying for repairs and we tried the vender and have not received any sympathy (or exchange/replacement/refund) from them, either. This is very unfortunate, since the blender has a great pitcher (really sturdy glass) and when Is aw it demonstrated it worked really well....I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Excellent narration with uplifting arrangements of Passover songs. The vocal choir is so full of spirit. In addition, I also apreciate the recognition given to the fallen heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto and those who tried to rescue Jews during the Holocaust.

Both the handle and the shoulder strap are irreparably busted and a sizeable handful of my discs (about 20) have been fatally damaged by this case. I am a DJ so I need to move this case around and its simply too flimsy to handle the job. If you plan on taking it anywhere, discs will inevitably become badly scratched {The pockets are very loose and if your discs aren't scratched because they fall out, they will be scratched by the dirt and debris that can far too easily make its way into the roomy pockets}.

But three problems. I have trouble zipping up the wallet. Also, the disks seem to keep falling out. Finally, the biggest issue is that this wallet as many others requires you to PUSH OUT the plastic for each and every disk slot. And some of the plastic remains until you keep pulling. My gosh why can't you just provide the pouches with no plastic-removal piece for those of us who have better things to do than spend time tearing out plastic on perforations which sometimes cause you to \\"over tear\\" the cut out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great DVD / CD wallet","review":"What can I say about this product, other than the obvious? It's HUGE, and holds more CD's and DVD's than a shady person at a flea market. The packaging was excellent and the shipping was fast... so the seller is legit and the product actually seems top notch. The only thing I have found with larger CD wallets is the fact that the weight of the DVD's tend to make a bow in the middle of the larger cases... the only way I see of avoiding this would be to make the case out of metal or something that could handle 40 pounds of dvd's constantly pulling down on the case. All that being said, it's a great case at a great price, so what are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!

The second weekend of use the zipper broke.

The quality is not worth it. The slide does not stay on the ground properly. It is rolled when you receive it and for some reason I could never unroll it so that it remained flat. There was a permanent curl at the end and it would end up rolling at each end automatically! This was dangerous because I nearly fell several times trying to slide and the curved ends were not secure. The company should put the rubber backing on the entire product not just the end. Anyway, save your time and money and research other products because you will be charged for shipping and restocking too...if returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"We got this in the mail and were never able to use it the \\"easy assembly\\" as they say was not so easy the screws on both ends did not catch and therfore the slide never assembled correctly.

Please do not waste your time or money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read in my entire life. The writing style is terrible, with the most hackneyed dialoge and plot. I felt like I was watching a bad episode of Walker: Texas Ranger or V.I.P.. There was the cast of elite commandos who act like little kids, (Like the guy who is always hungry). Having a bunch of bikers as the bad guys? They aren't bikers but your normal stereotype associated with them: dirty, dumb, and loud. There is plenty of action, which is the same exact thing over and over. ... It was funny the first time but he did it in every fight scene! Then the blood and gore descriptions from bullets sounded like a bad video game, like eyeballs being the only thing left on a table.

I've always been very pleased by how well the extra-soft bristles cleaned beneath the gum line. This design is also great for people who travel. It easily fits in your bag without a bulky extension cord. However, the battery quality is terrible. My first Interplak lasted several years. The second one lasted almost two years. This one barely made it six months before the battery stopped holding a charge. If you want your teeth really clean, this brush is for you. Just expect to replace it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"I really liked my old Interplak toothbrush but this new one is not anywhere as good. Since the bottom is plugged directly into the electricity to recharge it, that means it has to be put together and taken apart with each use. Big heap of trouble. The brush size is smaller than the old one which I don't like, and it doesn't clean as well either. It's hard to find a non-sonic power toothbrush nowadays, I wish someone would come out with a good one, this one is not worth the money in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Cleaning Power","review":"This product sounded great, with the direct plug-in, but it didn't have any cleaning power. I had previously used an Oral B, and have now gone back to it. The interplak would stop moving with the slightest pressure on your teeth.In addition, I was very annoyed with Amazon because when I purchased the toothbrush it recommended purchase of replacement heads, which I purchased, but which did not go with the toothbrush I ordered. So be careful. This has now happened to me with another purchase for bike accessories, too. What a hassle to get an item, have it not work, and then have to return it.

First of all, you must leave it charging at all times or risk getting less than optimal performance. Two or three uses over a day or two and the battery pack is nearly if not completely drained. On the lowest setting, it gets easily stopped by regular brushing action, making it nearly impossible to use effectively. On it's second, and only other setting, it performs marginally well using regular toothpaste.

I think the rotary action is the best way to clean ones teeth. The first one I bought had an electric cord attached to it. It lasted for many years. Then they stopped making the brushes so I had to buy one with a battery. In the first battery tooth brushes the battery lasted a little over a year. You can't just buy a repayment battery you have to buy a new tooth brush. Every time I buy a new one the battery last less and less. I bought one 6 months ago the battery died.

I am also pleased with the new charging system... pull it apart and plug in the bottom half.... no more base/charging station.There are 2 changes I am not pleased with: 1) The on/off switch is difficult to toggle. It requires me to hold the toothbrush with one hand and push on/off with the other, and 2) the plastic cover/protector for the brush head does not \\"click\\" into place; it just sits on top of the toothbrush head. This is okay as long as you just store the toothbrush in the medicine cabinet, but if you want to take it somewhere, the cap comes off with the slightest movement.

On the other hand, I've found only one that I like as much, an Oral B model.

The machine ran it's full 65 minute cycle, and no dice. I tried to run it through another cycle (after waiting a couple of minutes to turn the compressor back on as per instructions). Unfortunately, it forces you to wait 15 minutes to start the mixer.

I was using it backpacking and it would work ok when I left it in the sun or put it inside my coat, but once it got cool, the only thing I could photograph was a polar bear in a snowstorm. I've fixed and torn apart camcorders before, so I got me a busted Optura 10 on eBay with a bad tape drive for a song and a dance...less than 20 bucks. I figured I could swap the CCD board out if my Optura 20 got any worse. Wrong!! The optura 10 had the EXACT same problem.

He does include some pictures of varieties in the front section of the book (which deals with culture) which he then fails to include in the field guide, and his comments on cold hardiness are vague in many cases, but he has obviously been growing most of these roses himself and offers first-hand information.

The book is an essay of the brutality within the Legion, which the film has great difficulty in bringing to the screen. The first half of Full Metal Jacket is far more effective and convincing in that respect. I have read Legionaire three times, and was hoping the movie would convey the spirit and events contained therin. It did not.

While it's not a perfect product, it does exactly what is required for the price. I was wary because so many others said the plastic has an unbearable odor, but it's really no worse than a brand new shower curtain and it only took about a day before it aired out enough that I could no longer smell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok - does the job","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect reading the reviews, but it was inexpensive, so I thought I'd try it. I was especially careful when putting it on because some reviews said that's when it ripped, and that's exactly what happed to me. It seemed that the vinly attached to the zipper isn't attached well and comes apart easily. However, it came apart only a little at the zipper at the foot of the bed, and I only purchased for the waterproof aspect, so it still does the job. If you are purchasing for protection against dust mites or bed bugs, this is definitely not the way to go, but if you want waterproof and inexpensive, this is it.

As I zipped it up the zipper pulled completely away from the rest of the protector. Not only is it not waterproof at the seams, the seam didn't even hold up to the product being put on the bed! I called the 100% Customer Satisfaction number to let my complaint be heard--I had to leave a message and it said if someone did want an exchange it'd cost $10 s/h. Obviously that wasn't a problem for me since I bought on Amazon. I just left it on my daughter's bed since accidents happen on the middle of the bed and I'd just had a baby and was too tired to go through the return/exchange process.

Imagine those emergency rain ponchos that can fit in your jeans back pocket.

The adults in this fim are crazy. They push their kids to be major Bible thumpers. In fact one insane parent even admitts \\"I am raising my children to be warriors for God and the republican party (army).\\" These adults totally admit they are trying to brainwash chldrn for Jesus.

The viewer is also free to decide how we feel about what was happening. The directors avoided making the belief system the object of concern, but rather focused how a religious pulpit is being used for political movement. This was one of the more frightening aspects of this film for me as well as the congregation's implication that logic and science are an enemy of faith.Overall, a very interesting film."},{"rating":"2","title":"though-provoking, for those with open minds","review":"Jesus Camp was a thought-provoking movie.

This \\"documentary\\" was very polemic, subvertly criticizing Christians for voting, and often misrepresenting these extreme fundamentalists (who speak in tongues) as the Christian norm. In doing so, this documentary does a disservice to itself and minimizes its impact.My wife and I explored Christianity at one point in our lives, after the birth of our child, primarily to see what our parents found in the religion. While we are not Christians, we found only one church out of numerous that was even remotely like the folks in the documentary.While we don't agree with Christian views, it was actually refreshing to know that so many in our community around us were focused on improving themselves.

Its not place to say how they should be treated but....there are boundaries. This movie is amazing and terrifying at the same time. You... you just got to watch this to get what im saying.

Much of the terminology used in the film is spiritual, Bible jargon, but it was made by the film makers to seem like these people were taking words like \\"war\\" literally when it was actually referring to \\"prayer\\". While the movie itself was well done, I think the film makers did not present it without personal bias. In the documentary, they showed what was contraversial and what would sell a movie from an entertainment and shock-value standpoint. The stringing together of certain segments and the dark music give it a sinister feel in parts. The movie, in its presentation, causes people to make a judgement based on a very small glimpse into these people's lives. Even though it may be a documentary, the viewer needs to remember that in order to sell, it also needed to entertain its audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"frightening and sad.","review":"it should be called:\\"brainwashed\\"seriously, these young freaks are being traumatized by their sick and twisted (not to mention slightly deranged and most of all ignorant) parents/adults.nah, \\"we don't have to worry about global warming honey...we will be in heaven when that happens.\\"WHAT THE !?@#%&*the BEST part about this documentary is that evagelical idiot, ted arthur haggard's cameo.BUSTED!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing, very disturbing","review":"I just finished this documentary and was bothered at what I saw. This \\"camp\\" does a great job at whipping kids into a frenzy of spiritual devotion. What are they teaching, love or hate?

The child said that God only comes to churches where everyone is jumping and singing in prayer, not churches where people are quietly praying. Just sad.

The fact that children were made to believe they were not Christians because they acted differently at school or may have done a mean deed was absolutely crazy. People have faults and children make mistakes and that doesnt make them less of a Christian or love God less. The woman who runs this camp sound like a mental who needs help and shame on her for using children to help her personal cause.As a Christian I found this documentary disturbing. I really cant believe there are that many people in the United States who attempt to brain wash their children.

Started off well enough, but quickly bogged down, much like the american's attack in the book. There was no real development of the characters, no real story line and no build up or climax to keep one turning the pages.

Sharpe fans will instantly see that the story lacks the character development in other Cornwell novels. In addition it is usually easy to overlook minor historical inacurracies in Cornwell's other books but in Redcoat they stick out like a sore thumb. I was dissapointed in the end also with the main character's actions. Maybe since this book was written for an American audience the author felt it neccessary to write the ending to meet their tastes. The result though is a novel that failes both the reader and the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book with Good Characters, but an Uninteresting Plot","review":"Redcoat is a novel depicting the consequences of war on a country and a family. It's full of (not necessarily interesting) detailed war scenes, and a variety of characters. Of all the characters, Martha Crowl is by far the most interesting. She's an independent widow who develops her own opinions and views based on her observations, and hers alone. This quality gets her into trouble later in the book. Jonathan Abel is another interesting character. He shows what it's like to live in a cruel, ridiculing world. I, personally, enjoyed the characters and life scenes in the book, but not the war settings or battles. They were often too detailed and lacked interesting appeal. If you're a war book junkie and enjoy battles and fighting, this is an excellent book for you.

The role played by Claudette Colbert is based on the story of my dear Aunt Dot, and the George Reeves role was based on my Uncle \\"Boots\\", whom I never met as he died on the Bataan Death March. Although some \\"poetic license\\" was obviously taken in the screenplay, the basic facts were true and the movie was a wonderful tribute to what these brave nurses contributed to our war effort.

There are several memorable lines. Such as \\"What makes us heroines?\\" \\"We're alive.\\" The plot is developed meticulously, so don't expect this to have the fast pace of modern movies. However, it is well worth watching. And I think it should be shown in history classes in school. It really brings to life the hardships of WWII.

The shear number of instances cited is absolutely incredible. (After finishing the book I was somewhat amazed by their apology at the beginning about leaving so many cases out...) The book is written with both extreme clarity and passion. The biggest growth area on campuses the last decade or so has been in the number of administrators, so it was good to see their often dubious benefit get some badly needed attention.One very minor quibble I had might be with the way student and faculty issues are somewhat intermingled -- the lack of any mention of non-tenured faculty makes be conclude they have the least rights of all on university campuses today (which is dealt with in the excellent book \\"The Invisible Faculty\\").

I was a little surprised to see the description of my own school, Bowdoin College, in the book (pp. 93, 147, 217), because the description given didn't match what I knew of Bowdoin's policies -- and, indeed, their description has nothing to do with Bowdoin's official policies on harassment, as published on Bowdoin's Web site. One wonders how many similar cases can be documented, given the lack of referencing of their claims about such speech codes. Their apologie for the activities of racist organizations like the Pioneer Fund (pp. 136-143) is similarly unfortunate. It's too bad, because a balanced book on this topic would be very useful -- but this ain't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and accurate","review":"As a Bowdoin student I feel compelled to respond to the review written by a fellow student. I was elated to see a description of Bowdoin College in The Shadow University. It seems that too often smaller colleges are overlooked, allowed to operate in obscurity giving their administrators free reign to intimidate, threaten, and harass. Bowdoin's official policies as stated in the Student Handbook (not the web site) match the descriptions written by Kors and Silverglate. I take comfort in the knowledge that Bowdoin has lost major lawsuits for improper dismissals but I fear that little will change here. This is a great book that should be read by every college student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are all the educated people liberal?","review":"This book is an excellent foray in the the ugly underside of the American higher education system. Finally we get unbiased accounts of what really goes on. After reading this book I understand why all those seemingly educated people refuse to believe in conservative christian values. For a while I thought this was due to reading all those books by authors from different countries and time periods, or reading books written by historical figures instead of about them, or reading books with a bibliography and/or based upon empirical studies, but now I know better. The authors clearly establish the truth, that there is a vast conspiracy by the intelligent, the educated and the scientific people of this country, how else could they all have drawn the same conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paranoia","review":"This book is a product of reactionary backlash. The authors are driven by their liberatarian fundamentalism to reduce every issue to a simplistic, formulaic level. They have no sense of historical complexity or the dilemmas of balancing different claims and imperatives. Instead of trying to take the true measure of the challenges that universities face in the present situation, they trade in the cliches of American libertarianism. Instead of exercising their skills and education to give the reading public a balanced view, they feed the paranoia of the \\"conspiracy theory\\" crowd by presenting isolated instances in the most skewed and one-sided ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Wing Nonsense","review":"This book is a prime example of Ralph Reed's \\"stealth conservatism.\\" It offers views from the very far right while insisting that it puts forth a moderate, even progressive viewpoint. If you believe that Christina Hoff Sommers is a feminist, you'll believe that these two are civil libertarians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every armchair anthropologist should read this book!","review":"I read this book many years ago and it is still one of my all-time favorites. It combines an anthropologist's journey to answer questions about neanderthals with the scientific debates over human evolution. It is suspenseful and thought-provoking. Mr. Shreeve is a creative, objective and often witty science writer who will make you want to read more about this fascinating science.Though the mitochondrial DNA evidence was just starting to be accepted when this book was written, it is still an excellent resource. It will also enlighten new anthropology enthusiasts about the separate battlecamps of multi-regional and replacement theorists in the human origins debate.If you are on this page, you should just buy the book already. Then go get The Seven Daughters of Eve by Bryan Sykes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible science writing","review":"Anthropology is a field about which I knew nothing when I picked up this book, but this account got me interested. Shreeve does an admirable job not only of explaining the science, but makes the discovery process, with its conflicting opinions and lack of hard data absolutely riveting. This is journalism of the highest order."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't need to be a rock scientist","review":"As a layman, I found this book to be extremely accessable. Academics might find it lacking in technical details, but for the general public it gives a very good insight into the search for our origins and explains some of the controversies in the scientific community."},{"rating":"2","title":"A excellent introduction to the Neandertals","review":"I intially checked this book out from the local public library, but liked it so much I bought it. I picked up this book knowing next to nothing about this subject and came away with a consuming interest in it. Shreeve, weaves a great story as much about academic backbiting and squabbling as about the Neandertals. He gives a strong overview of the competing theories of human origins as well and talks to all sorts of scientists, not just anthropologists and archaeologists but population geneticists and molecular biologists as well. He gives all sides their two cents worth, but isn't afraid to criticize esteemed scientists for sloppy thinking either. This book is ideal for someone new to the field who wants to understand all the sides of the debate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well made","review":"This bag is leather,but It's paper thin and began to fall apart 3 days after I received it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I thought this would be his piano playing and was very disappointed to learn that it was vocal. Not that I have a problem with his voice; it's just that an early cd I heard of his piano music was fabulous and I am trying to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoop Dreams (a.k.a Piece of Crap)","review":"IF I could think of one book: it would not be this book. I do not like it, and Charles Barkley's introduction is not well written - as if he was a high school drop-out. Personally, I hated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoop Dreams","review":"Hoop Dreams is about two kids who are looking for the best thing in Highschool, a state championship and Not just any State championship, but a basketball one. The two kids in the book are Aurther Agee and William Gates. They both get into St. Joesph's, but then Aurther gets kicked out because his parents can't pay the bills. Later on he Aurther gets into a smaller school called Marshall. In their senior year, Williams team gets beatin in the Semi Fimals to go into the championship round to play Marshall, but Aurthers team goes on and wins the whole thing.this a great book for anyone wholoves basketball guy or girl. It's a book that as soon as you get it in your hands and starts reading it that you can't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greater Insight into the Hoop Dreams Movie","review":"This is excellent reading if you enjoyed the movie. It just gives the reader a deeper look into the lives of Arthur and William. There is so much detail we didn't get in the movie. In the book, we learn about additional family members and best friends. Who knew William lived with his sister when he started attending St. Joes? We found out more about race relations at St. Joes and that William had janitorial duties at the school to offset his financial obligations. There's more to how William felt about Coach Pingatore. We learn more about Arthur and his relationship with his father. Best of all, there is more about their lives once they begin college. It's a must read for everyone who enjoyed the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight Ballin","review":"Hoop Dreams is a book everyone can relate to. Whether it be for the fact that it is for athletes or just for people who like real stories about people struggling for success. I personally liked the book because you got to know the kids and where they came from, not just about their basketball lives. You know it is a great movie when in the credits for He Got Game they have both the kids, one is one the brooklyn bridge and the other is in the gardens. Great book. I recommend it to all who love to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Art Book!","review":"The quality of the pics of this book is wonderful. Several images just need a frame to decorate your wall.You will spend hours looking any detail of the book. It makes a wonderful gift or addition to a collection. Highly recommended.This is wonderful a coffee Table book. Buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Book to have..","review":"This is a coffee Table book. It has very beautiful illustrations and maps.Its not in English, but place names seem to be in Latin or Dutch which only compliments the books authenticity. Anyone interested in old maps or history would find this book wonderful and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok if you've got a PHD in Geography","review":"Very disappointed that there was hardly anything about the US. Most of the maps you cannot determine which present day country you are looking viewing. These maps are beautiful but not at all what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Great!","review":"I recently purchased 3 original maps by Blaeu. I purchased this book just as a reference for some restoration work that was going to be done on the maps. The maps are the original size with blow-up of some of the cartouches. They are fantastic.If you are into collecting or just like the look of the Blaeu maps - this is the definitive book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ultimate atlas","review":"This is nothing less than a work of art. Its a comprehensive reproducton of John Blaeu's Atlas of 1665 in the form of a gigantic annotated book. The color reproductions are outstanding. The book is very large and very heavy. Its almost too big for a coffee table book but for people who enjoy history and illustrated maps, there is simply nothing else like it. Its not a 1 for 1 replica of the original 11-volume work. Some maps are reproduced at less than the size of the book to make room for information but they are generally lesser maps. There are other Blaeu reproductions out there, but this is a one of a kind treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is exactly what I expected from.","review":"A huge and beautiful atlas ! This book will make me travel to ancient times. Now I want to buy antique maps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dramatic Beethoven 7th","review":"This version of the Beethoven 7th ranks with the best ever recorded. Although I have classic recordings of this work by Furtwangler, Carlos Kleiber, Karajan and Bruno Walter, I usually turn to this Leinsdorf performance when I am in a Beethoven 7th mood.Hard to find, grab it when it is available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with Edgy","review":"I wish I had seen Edgy's review before purchasing this DVD. I was interested in a movie with skiing footage. This has about 25% ski footage, 25% base jumping, and about 50% stupid skits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edgy Teen Appeal","review":"I purchased the vid given the hipe and because McConkey is an awesome skier. Having watched this back to back with some of other ski flicks... my impression was that the film was not of the same standard (skiing or filming).The thing that bothered me, and everyone of the adults (expert skiers) in the crowd was the immature non-skiing footage. It really detracted from what could have been an entertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem","review":"This album is brilliant. It was [and remains] so refreshing to hear a band of that era write and perform music that purely guitar-driven. The songs hold up to this day, decades later.The one negative review posted here is mystifying to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice straight 80's underground.","review":"This band is more Sonic Youth than anything, although I doubt they knew it at the time. It still pretty atmospheric though. A sort of L.A. counter part to that whole Live Skull, Band of Susans thing in New York. I like the album, but it doesn't live up to some of the tremendous things that were happening in music at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Fun to Watch, But Corny","review":"Most of us who grew up in the 60's and 70's can still remember this \\"claymation\\" series about Davey Hanson and his talking dog Goliath. Yes, they're hopelessly out of date and really corny, but for some strange reason I still find them fun to watch, albeit a little campy.The series was produced, as I recall, for the Lutheran Church by Art and Gloria Clokey of \\"Gumby\\" fame. In spite of every other bad thing I've said about this series, the moral lessons are still timely and relevant in this day and age. It's not an unpleasant trip back if you want to take the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shark Cordless Sweeper a Disaster","review":"I bought the UV 610 several weeks ago and after using it precisely according to diections I deduce that this product is, to be polite, a piece of junk. It demands multiple passes and even then fails every sort of pickup. Its dust catcher broadcasts dust. Its brushes become entangled with dog hair, etc. and are all but impossible to clean. Its rush of air exhaled from its lead edge blows much of that which itintends to collect away. All in all, it is a failure. I have replaced it with Dirt Devil's cordless which works wonderfully, and is less expensive. I will donate the Shark to someone I dislike.Martin Last, Montréal, Canada"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a reason it's called a SWEEPER","review":"This is great. I have been reading through the reviews and it seems people are trying to replace their vacuum. This is a GREAT little machiene (especially with a house on the market) for between times when you vacuum. The only problem I have run into is the cord, but I attribute that to my 1 year old pulling it around the house. When you ar running out the door this is a great way to make the house look good. My 6 and 4 year olds fight over what rooms they get to do. I have owned this one for over a year and will buy another one when this one dies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for me!","review":"I haven't had a problem and I use it all the time on carpet and a little bare floor. Works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sweeper","review":"Highly recommend this. As with any chargable small appliance once used it needs to be recharged. But after it is, it is ready to go again. I have a terrier and it works great on picking up his dog hair, all kinds of messes and is awesome on my Pergo floors."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],W={key:0},N={key:1};function M(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(O,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-3466182c"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/17.md","filePath":"people/17.md"}'),H={name:"people/17.md"},P=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
