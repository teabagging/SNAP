The only thing that keeps it from getting 5 stars is one of the stones is quite a bit darker than the other stones. However it is still a quite stunning piece.

They're soft, have a great double zipper feature and honestly seem to aide her sleep--she started sleeping eleven hours at 8 weeks, much earlier than my other two. You can pair it with warmer items underneath for colder weather. An excellent buy--the only caveat is that my child is very tall and we had to move her out of the smaller one at three months. Just the same, you can always leave the bottom zipper undone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!","review":"Be very careful with this sleep sack...the fabric around the neck is not stretchy, and was so tight on my baby's neck that it left a mark.

Especially the end where it discusses planets, space, and how everything came together. It's amazing how much we puny humans can figure out about a star half way across the galaxy.The one thing that held this book back from getting a perfect 5/5, is the fact that it had _no_ pictures to help explain the concepts.

Gibbin has exibited a good, easy to read writing style in putting out a slew of science books. He should maybe slow down a bit. A book of this sort cries out for supporting illustrations, but has none. What it does have is a number of careless errors in the few early pages I read: He erronously refers to atomic weight, in a context where atomic number would be correct. He says e/m for electrons was found to be about one thousandth as big as that for protons, when he should have said about one thousand times as big.

The songs presage alot of what is now called American Deep House with their repetitive hooks and spare and emotive vocals.

I admire Susan and Daniel for all they have done to keep the memory of Theo alive, and Pan Am 103 as well. Theo's death wasn't expected, she wasn't slowly fading away, she was murdered by faceless cowards! How would you feel if your only child was murdered, and the murder could have been prevented? This book doesn't have a happy ending, and why should it? Theo was murdered when it could have been prevented by Pan Am or even the State Department. I never experienced anything that Susan and Daniel have, but I myself get mad over what happened to Theo and 269 others. Susan and Daniel I encourage you to keep fighting for what you believe in."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Little Book","review":"I have to agree with others who've derided this book. The Cohen's venom ultimately drowns out any kind of sympathy the reader might muster."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching Book","review":"This book blew me away! I had always heard of the Pan Am 103 disaster at Lockerbie, but until I read the Cohen's account of the disaster, I never understood exactly what happened. The book details the anguish of loosing a child, the incompetance of the United States government and its leaders, and the persuit of \\"justice\\" by the Cohens. I say justice, but the Cohens, in actuality were really attempting to \\"put a face on the disaster,\\" and that face was the one of their daughter, Theo.The book did drag at parts, and that only occured when either Dan or Susan would overload on information, but that happened only two or three times. My favorite part of the book was Susan's last entry, which she wrote as a letter to her beloved Theo. Congratulations Dan and Susan, you succeeded! I will never be able to forget the disaster, or your daughter, the face you have now associated with the disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should not have written this book","review":"I feel for the Cohens loss and if they had directed their justifiable rage and their justifiable quest to bring Pan Am and the terrorists who did this to justice then I would feel differently about the book.They didn't do this. This book is a lashing out at anyone and everyone connected with this tragedy. The trashing of the other Pan Am 103 families and the town of Lockerbie was the extreme low point of a really horrible book. They have very little focus and the egoism of these guys is stunning.I read a lot of books. This one may be the worst I have ever seen. It is a pointless rant with no technical, operational, or analytical detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the other 269 people who died?","review":"Is it just me or do these people need to grow up and move on? Sure, their daughter was important, but 269 other people were just as important. What the Cohens and their cohorts did to the children of Lockerbie is disgraceful. I have no sympathy whatsoever for these spiteful, hateful people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, Angry, and Uninformed","review":"One can be sympathetic to family members of the Pan Am 103 tragedy. Unfortunately being sad and angry does not guarantee knowledge of the intimate details of this tragedy. For real knowledge of what happened read Marquise' book \\"ScotBom\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly dreadful book, of which the authors shouls bd ashamed","review":"The trouble is that the authors do not have the slightest understanding about what Lockerbie is about, having swallowed the lies and fabrications of the US authorities. To correct them: The destruction of Pan Am 103 was an agreed joint operation of the governments of US and Iran to give Iran its one and only one revenge for the provably deliberate shooting down of Ir655 on 3rd July 199, which gave the Iranians a revenge according to their traditional law of qesas.They must be sympathised with for their loss. I lost a relative in a terrorist bombing (provably attributable to Libya), but the fakery of the 103 investigated is so crude, it beggars belief.The book deserves no stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock","review":"At first, I was very sympathetic with the Cohens for their loss. But, their bitterness and self-absorbedness blows me away. What they and their cohorts did to the children of Lockerbie was terrible. And, to degrade the people of Lockerbie? Hello! I am an emergency responder and know what those people must have gone through. And, you degrade them? Maybe you're not so hot, either. Too arrogant, self-absorbed, and bitter for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tends to grate after a while","review":"When I initially began reading this book I felt compassion for the Cohens. It is the same compassion that I feel for the many other victims of this bombing. It is the same compassion that I feel for all who fall victims to tragedy. But about halfway through my sense of compassion for these parents began to wane. Their daughter was obviously a fine, beautiful young woman and they have every right to grieve for the rest of their lives. But there is such a thing as dignity. The Cohens use this book as an opportunity to vent a series of spiteful and mean spirited attacks. Fine. Some of their targets deserve it. But what is truly appalling (and what lost them my sympathy) is their attitude toward the town of Lockerbie and toward some of the families of the other victims of this disaster.Hatred, vengeance, and bitterness are emotions that are more poisonous than cyanide. And the Cohens certainly prove that.This is a book to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touching, but too self-absorbed","review":"Some very heartfelt moments in this book that make for an emotional telling of two parents lives following the bombing of PanAm 103.But in the end, that's all this book becomes....one grieving moment after another. It dawns on you after a while that even 12 years later these people have not worked thru the pain of their daughter's death. The result is that this book devolves into a never-ending emotional mish-mash. Surprisingly, by the end of the book I had lost most empathy for the Cohens and, as harsh as this sounds, found them quite pathetic.I also found it downright rude their back-biting of other families who did not share their passion for wallowing in the loss of a loved-one.A sad book.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-centered, pathetic people and a horrible book","review":"The Cohens apparently believe that they are the only people since the dawn of time to have lost a loved one.

And, to boot, they couldn't spell while being nasty (which isn't the end of the world, but I expect less obvious spelling errors from a business).

Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant : Varia","review":"Having read both trilogies by Donaldson and compared them against Tolkien's works,there is a clear winner, and that is Tolkien. Donaldson may mature into a great writer of fantasy at some point but if I see the word 'vertigo' again I'll jump! I may be prejudiced as I was brought up near to where Tolkien based his excellent works in Birmingham ie. Sarehole Mill and the *Dingles*(a great surprise for many!) but the two cannot be compared. That said, I did find Donalson's work enjoyable despite the repetition of the prose and hope that in his future projects, such repetition is not repeated (how's that for rotten English!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"An over analysis of a great work.","review":"I really like the Covenant series, and so I picked this book up to see how others reacted to it. What I found was a work that read far to much into Donaldson's work, missed some major points, and committed simple errors (such as which hand Covenant had fingers amputated from). Maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan of lit.crit., but I found this text very dense to work through, and Senior came across as trying too hard to make his points."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Realistic and Spellbinding......","review":"This was the best series I have ever read, I kept going back to it again and again....for those who like Tolkien you've got to read this...believe me you'll laugh, get angry, frustrated, and cry with every character in this book....this is a must read!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Paper","review":"This paper produces photo quality prints whn I used it with a Canon BJC 8200 printer.

Having bought the two year extended warranty and calling Canon, they sent me to a local repair expert who got me a brand new replacement Pro 9000, and I have used Canon Photo Paper Pro ever since without any need to even clean the nozzles. I have a Nikon film camera, FE model and am ecstatic that I can get CD's and rival ANY pro photo shop I have ever tried.

Owen) account of pros hen equivocity and the \\"as structure\\" of the science of Being (metaphysics) is a major contribution to Aristotle scholarship and is more than likely the source for G.E.L. Owen's notion of \\"focal meaning\\". This is a thematic account of Aristotle's Metaphysics focusing on the role of equivocals. However, Owens does provide pretty close readings of most of the books. He has extensive notes on the other major secondaries (obviously, written prior to 1978) and a bibliography of 608 entries. This is one of the most comprehensive, influential, and refreshingly readable accounts of one of Aristotle's most difficult texts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, love this vintage sign!","review":"I love just about anything vintage and this sign is no exception.

And we all know that this is the most successful period of the Orbison career. The great thing about this Cd is that it doesn't limit itself to \\"Greatest Hits\\". So whilst you get the obvious tracks like \\"Oh Pretty Woman\\" and \\"Only the Lonely\\", you also get tracks which are just as strong, but which, for one reason or another, didn't make it. \\"Belinda\\", \\"The Crowd\\", \\"Drifting Away\\" and \\"Goodnight\\" are all examples of songs which were strong A sides, but didn't really achieve commercial success. And then you have the B sides. Some are banal, such as \\"Candy Man\\" and \\"What'd I Say\\". But some eclipse their more famous A-sides in terms of artistry. See \\"Only With You\\", \\"Here Comes That Song Again\\", \\"Yo Te Amo Maria\\", \\"Indian Wedding\\" and \\"The Actress\\" to understand just how special this man really was as a singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roy Orbison - The Big O","review":"I received the CD promptly, considering it was shipped from a seller in the UK.

This book includes a biography and photos of Amy Beach, with amazing details of her early life of genius talent.

I especially love \\"Gavotte Fantastique\\", \\"Scottish Legend\\", and \\"Menuet Italien\\". There are a number of duets included in this book, too, some of which are beautiful.

I would recommend it for general use."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Genre-Bender","review":"\\"Black Friday\\" (1940) survives as a rarity in cinema history: the gangster-horror film. Unfortunately, the reteaming of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi was jettisoned during preproduction - leaving poor Bela with a minor supporting role and Boris playing second fiddle to Stanley Ridges (who delivers an excellent Jekyll and Hyde characterization originally intended for Karloff). Though \\"Black Friday\\" moves at a fairly good clip, it remains one of Universal's lesser thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Were People Really This Stupid?","review":"Professor Kingsley is on his way across the street and gets run over by Red Cannon, a mobster who has other mobsters chasing him. Both are transported in the same ambulance with Prof Kingsley's friend, Dr. Sovac. Kingsley has some kind of concussion and will only live a few more hours, and Cannon is paralyzed. Sovac decides to do a brain transplant between the two (apparenly with no one in the hospital the wiser), and save Kingsley - his physical body anyway. Later Sovac says this was a \\"partial\\" brain transplant. Needless to say, Red's personality comes out in Kingsley - this is when he slicks his fluffy hair back on his head with his hands, and it automatically sticks and becomes very shiny. The only reason Sovac did the operation was to get Red's $500,000 he had hidden so that he could open up his own lab and do whatever he wants, perhaps more brain transplantations. In the end as they say, there are no winners in this film.Basically, pretty silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"GANGS/ MURDER AND A SAVAGE KILLER","review":"The greats,known as Karloff and Lugosi,star in this tale of murder.

The visions make him a bit paranoid of his real life, and he starts to wonder if they're just mental delusions, or if they're real. As i said before, it doesn't have a lot of special effects in my opinion. Its really more of a character driven movie; which wouldn't be a bad thing if the dialogue wasn't so boring. I don't want to recommend this movie because I don't want to set your expectations too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out strong, weak ending","review":"I really wanted to like this movie, but in the end my wife and I both disliked it.

It has a nice feel for life in our complex times, and life in a small town.But as many reviewers have noted, it could use about 15 minutes of editing. And especially the last minute, it completely undoes the movie and makes you feel you've just wasted the last two hours of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the 2 hours","review":"Great movie showing what schizophrenia can do to a person/family but had little to nothing else to offer and really not much of a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical artsy fartsy","review":"Ok, the acting was good, but I am the type of movie watcher who wants to be entertained. If I want to strain my brain, I will pick a good forum and try to stir up a debate. So, if you like the kind of movie which doesn't really go anywhere, but has dark pockets of cerebral imbalance with matching mood music to titillate the artiste in you, well....have fun. At the end, I said....why did I waste my time. Oh, sure the critics loved it, and some audiences, but for my two cents, it was not entertaining, but painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes too long to go anywhere","review":"I thought this would be an entertaining post apocalyptic thriller, but instead far too much time is spent with the hero thinking he's going crazy, visiting his schizophrenic mom, and developing the small folksy hometown feel of this small Ohio town. I watched 45 minutes and all that happened is the hero had a few bad dreams. I fast forwarded to the end to find out how it all ended, but I was disappointed.I thought the film was atmospheric, and I liked the characters and if there was a sequel which might explain what happened next, I could've gone for it, but far too much buildup for me not to want to see the payload which is barely touched on in the last few minutes of the show.I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours...","review":"and two minutes of my life I would like to have back.

VERY slow moving. You become convinced the guy is nuts. Takes way too long to get to the point of the story and then it's disappointing when it ends. Not much character development of any of the characters. Kathy Baker had a VERY small part, which in itself was a disappointment. She's a great actress who was not given enough screen time to appreciate. Do NOT waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy and engaging","review":"I had been wanting to see this flick for a while since I'd read some reviews.

Based on the other reviews I believed the ending may be disappointing, but the trailer looked really good so I wanted to see it and form my own opinion; I'm glad I did! I don't understand why people keep making it out like the ending of this movie is somehow ambiguous as to whether Curtis is crazy or his visions are omens....*SPOILER ALERT*....he's NOT crazy; I don't see why anyone would have interpreted it any other way. To me it was very clear in the end. I can see how some people would feel that it moved too slowly, but I was interested in the story the whole way through. The actors were great and the storyline was interesting. All in all, I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I loved this movie so much that I bought it.

The special effects are pretty good, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bridge to nowhere","review":"The pace is slow, but the acting and dramatic tension are superb. The lead actors really catch the anguish associated with his problems and the growing tension between the spouses. There are also some very eerie scenes that will command your full attention.The problem with this movie is the ending. It leaves you wanting more finality and clarity, you're not sure where you are in the end. However, this is a good movie despite the drawbacks and all said this is probably one of the most unique movies you'll see for awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this","review":"The blu-ray quality is amazing.

Seriously. this is 2 hours I will never get back... The acting was great, the story had great potential, but too long and TEDIOUS to watch, and the ending was not worth the wait. It had Such potential, like a real \\"Noahs Ark\\" type story but this was just down right painful. Augh, I feel like anyone giving this over a 1 star is probably looking at it from some cinematic avante art student way and the botton line is it was not that entertaining. Sooo dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give this a zero!","review":"I had high hopes for this movie. It seemed like it had an interesting premise and perhaps some suspense.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It dragged on forever! The payoff was literally 2 seconds at the end. Nothing else in the plot was resolved.The only saving grace in the movie was the acting. The performances were pretty good, they just didn't have a plot (or story) that moved.I was thinking of donating this to the library, but it would be cruel to inflict this on anyone else. I'll probably just throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and Anticlimactic","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this pointless and anticlimactic excuse for a movie. I usually hope to be, at the very least, slightly entertained from a 3 1/2 star movie.

It moves way too slow. Very disappointed. Make a real survival movie. Why did the guy have to be portrayed as nuts? The only thing that made sense was the expense to make plans for a shelter and survive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, predictable, and the worst movie I've ever seen","review":"This is the worst movie, I have seen in 10 years. 'Got Milk' used to hold that place on my scale.Everything moved so slow, and in the end you feel like you wasted your time. There wasn't a twist ending.The guy's 'storm shelter' was a shipping container. Even if there was a natural disaster, that would have been his tomb. What a joke.I couldn't even stand watching the whole thing, I had to fast forward every few minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"The movie seemed like it was going to eventually get interesting, but somehow never did. It was a little strange and the acting was good, but that can't make up for the fact that nothing really happens in this movie. I really wanted to see it, the trailers hooked me in and in the end I was just happy the movie was over. I can sum this movie up in one word, \\"Boring.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"It could have, it should have but it didn't. Great idea, good acting but so endlessly dragged on to ending I no longer cared about, I just wanted the movie to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"On mental illness","review":"The protagonist in Take Shelter is a young family man who loses his job and is about to destroy his marriage as he keeps seeing nightmares (and day-mares) about an upcoming apocalyptical storm and other related occurrences. He spends everything they have and don't have to build an underground shelter complete with gas masks, a generator, and amenities. There are many distractions that lead a viewer to believe the storm may actually be coming (some reviewers believe the storm is actually coming). The ambiguous ending contributes to that goal. You may believe that too. To me Take Shelter is a movie about mental illness rather than a supernatual thriller with a proactive hero.I did not enjoy the movie because it was singularly focused and seemed artificial at that. The main actor's skills seemed overshadowed by that of a secondary character, his smart and devoted wife.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Following","review":"This moving was very slow, you had to watch very closely or you would miss the story line.

It would be acceptable if not for the fact that most of the portions I read seem to be a poorly written memoir of him, and not a useful guide on how to get by in China. Also, his advice is mostly outdated and he doesn't seem to be able to give good, useful advice that actually pertains to situations one might encounter."},{"rating":"2","title":"very comprehensive","review":"I've worked in China for some time, and also worked at a Chinese company in my home country.

I have read and enjoyed other Culture Shock books before (Culture Shock Malaysia is wonderful and very helpful) but I was blown away by this book's awfulness. It should have been called, \\"Out-dated Personal Ramblings of a Typo-prone Journalist in China.\\" Sarcasm is rampant, the author refers to the reader as \\"pal\\" and frequently admonishes him (as in, \\"too bad, pal.

The first disc contains a 72-minute history of the Dallas Cowboys from their first season of 1960 through the 2002 season. A lot is packed into these 72-minutes, but of course for diehard Cowboy fans, it still leaves us wishing for more. The history is presented primarily chronologically, but there are some topics- the Redskin/Cowboy rivalry or the Cowboy image- where this strict chronology is broken.The second DVD contains a 70-minute program of the Cowboy-49er NFC Championship game played on the January 17, 1993. That would be my pick for best Cowboy game of the 1990's. The game is presented chronologically and although it doesn't include every single play, it is extensive.

This box set has none of these qualities. Alot of effort has been put into this box set, and it shows. Although most of the alternate takes presented here are not as good as the final masters, they are great to hear, and are of good sound quality. I kind of have mixed feelings about all the false starts and studio chatter, but I will say they are interesting to hear. The booklet has a small commentary on every song, and plenty of pictures, and is great, too. \\"Today, Tomorrow, and Forever\\" is a great effort by RCA/BMG."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD Collection!","review":"I was thrilled to listen to all 4 CDs in this set. I know that some of the audio quality is limited by the fact it's live recordings from some dusty stage in the mid-50's, but the electricity and edge in Elvis' tone and delivery are inescapable. I enjoy the brief exchanges before or in between some of the takes between Elvis and the guys - it adds to the experience, not detracting from the material. It really is a musical journey through his entire career. I highly recommend this set to anyone that is interested in the King. As someone who was 8 years old when the King died, I've always been fascinated by this guy that could make my aunts AND my grandmother all swoon - how could anyone reach both those kinds of people? - and as I got older, I learned that he had been making aunts and grandmothers swoon long before I came along.

It is basically made out of the same material as a picnic table cloth - vinyl on the outside and that fuzzy white stuff on the inside. This inside lining catches on everything and sheds. I have not used the cover long enough yet to know how it will last in cold and sun. It is large and would likely fit most bicicles, but there is no way to keep it in place. It is basically just a large wind catcher that you drop down over the bicycle. Wind will lift it right off. There is one miniscule little square of velcro that I suppose is supposed to stick to the fuzzy white lining on the opposite side. This one tiny square of velcro would not hold up to even the slightest breeze or movement so it is useless.

For starters, it is very, very heavy. While that sounds good, it is so heavy, and stiff, that my wife has a hard time wrestling it over the bike. And then, it does not want to drape very well so you have to further wrestle it to get it to align over the bike properly and then to get it to come down to its full length. And since it is stiff, it catches on things ... like pedals or other metallic objects of which there are many on a bike and then the stiff material splits.

I believe this was one of his earliest performances in the US. He is partnered with a scary Gelsey Kirkland, deep in her anorexic period. Although it hurts to see her so thin and shaky, Mr. Baryshnikov partners her with surety. His last solo is a collection of comedic/dramatic character portrayals that keeps the audience thoroughly entertained. This concert from Wolf Trap is worth watching over and over again. (Don't miss the comments by Ms. Kirkland warning young dancers that her way was not the best way.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I was very anxious to see this, as it was the first solo performance for Misha since he arrived in the U.S. Unfortunately, the pieces chosen did not really illustrate his great dancing abilities AND they were all done with no backdrop whatsoever, so it was more like the local ballet school's graduation recital.

This performance showcases both Misha and Gelsey at the height of their fame, the mid-1970's. The technique and refinement is evident in their Don Quixote varation. Gelsey's pointework is divine, and no one quite matches the height of Misha's tours en l'air. Their popularity touched off the dance craze that carried through much of the 80's and is a nice portrait of 2 of American Ballet Theater's finest artists.

The manual shows you a few test screens and is real vague at explaining what to do with each one, then when you put the DVD in it shows you different test screens that are not in the manual and asks you to select one. So then test screens show up on your TV for around 20 seconds each then it changes to another one and you are supposed to hit pause each time and adjust something on each one. The problem is very few of the test screens are in the manual so you have no idea what to adjust on 3/4 of them.

So for them to put \\"Shot in HD\\" all over the cover, and to make people think that they're going to recieve beatiful images is just crap.

But if you are among the many more casual riders looking for an enjoyable day or two trip to beautiful locales, then please purchase this book. It is a great buy, don't be discouraged by people expecting hardcore rides, leaving bad reviews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Catastrophic support","review":"I believe this product has been replaced by SOHO Notes.This company has the worst technical support and policies I have have ever run into, period. There is no telephone support, no email support, only a form where they promise 1 to 5 day response (right...). Their program stopped working in Snow Leopard, for which their response was to offer a $25 upgrade.Which crashes my computer.So all of my data stored in their database is no lost, because no version of their program that I have will run. And they have yet to return any forms I sent them. For what it is worth, the phone number I located thru directory assistance is never answered.As for the program itself, I found it useful but incredibly slow for my tiny database.But,the primary consideration for any database is that it not lose your data.Which theirs just did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!!","review":"The metal frame that comes with this started bending the first week, and every time someone sits on it the frame swings back and hits the wall.

I get mad every day when I look at this thing. I'm guessing the company that sells these wrote the positive reviews for this product because it really is complete GARBAGE!

However, there are a lot of small parts (the various tips) and the small package they come in is not adequate for storage. Thus, these parts are very easy to lose over time rendering the tool useless.The mfg should include a small heavy (not flimsy) zip lock bag for storage with the tool... ideally a small bag with a cord that can attach to the tool when not in use, so at least all the pieces and tool stay in one place in the tool box. Or perhaps someone ought to start selling small corded clear bags as a new business. It is fairly common to need to associate pieces with tools, and Amazon could \\"associate\\" the bag with the tools making it easy to find the new product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Duty Indeed!","review":"This is by far the best pair of snap ring pliers I own. The tips are very tough, come in a variety of sizes and can be rotated to meet the needed angle of approach.I bought these pliers because the ones I had couldn't remove a particularly strong snap ring on a motorcycle drive shaft - these got it done on the first try. Putting a new ring back on was just as easy. The handles rotate to go from an internal to external configuration easily enough but at the same time lock into place and stay put when using the tool.This really is a quality tool that will outlast whatever car you're using this on - it's the best pair of snap ring pliers on Amazon.Bonus Points: Made in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"49200 Heavy Duty Snap Ring Plier","review":"A great tool to have.

Frank symbolically represents that strain in the American culture that desires a hero that is terribly flawed yet ultimately passionate about seeing that justice is done. Frank is a werewolf! \\"F as in Frank\\" could have easily taken itself too seriously and eliminated the fun and drama of examining society through the eyes of \\"the first Boston werewolf cop\\". Furthermore this book could have reduced itself into a slapstick comedy ridiculing itself and ultimately reducing the protagonist into a mockery of the American ideal of a \\"crime fighting\\" superhero. Instead the author skirts these traps neatly, neither adhering to the expected nor creating a farce but rather creating a neat little murder mystery with all of the fun of a Robert Asprin novel. \\"F as in Frank\\" is a fun, fast paced, thriller of mystery that will have you \\"howling\\" for more.

Of the many \\"layman geology\\" books about the Sierras that I've read, Matthes's is my favorite. I think I understand why. The book was published around 1950 by the University of California Press, shortly after Matthes's untimely death. Plate tectonics was not universally accepted at that time, so conspicuously absent from this book is the 20 pages of basic Plate Tectonics that distract the other books. Matthes instead focuses on the fascinating glacial morphology of the Yosemite region. In my mind, the book's biggest treats are the 30+ black-and-white photographic plates, including 25 by Ansel Adams. I love to see Matthes place some Adams classics in their geologic context.In summary, this book is easy-flowing, highly informative, and visually pleasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rediscovering Cheap Trick (follow up)","review":"Having lost track of this band as early as their 1979 \\"Dream Police\\" album, I've recently embarked on a Cheap Trick' rediscovering attempt considering their career proceeds well into the 1980's, 1990's and into the XXIst. Century.This I was unaware of until, accidentally, while searching for late 70's iconic albums, - among them, Cheap Trick's \\"At Budokan\\" and \\"Dream Police\\" albums -, I came across their post seventies career.Cheap Trick 1997 album, titled \\"Cheap Trick\\", is instrumental in that rediscovering attempt. As a follow-up acquisition of their 2006 \\"Rockford \\"album, I've listened to it twice thus far and I like it. They remain true to their sound; both rock and ballad-like tracks exhibit that distinct instrumental and vocal \\"Cheap Trick touch\\" which tells them apart within the genre. Cheap Trick remains as such, thank God!Rediscovering them too? Well, in that case \\"Cheap Trick\\" 1997 album is a good start!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap Trick's Cheap Trick","review":"I've wondered why Cheap Trick seldom gets much airplay--I suppose they're considered '70's or '80's 'relics, like many other groups from those areas. But I find their music from the past 15 years is even better than a lot of previously-released things that were 'hits'--not that some of those hits weren't good, or even great. But I've never heard the group sound better than on this release. One of their best songs, ever, is here--\\" It All Comes Back\\" but there are plenty of others that deserve your attention. On this tune, which has many different emotions in the lyrics and music, Robin Zander's voice is as expressive as it has ever been and he fills it with emotion. there is some great cello accompaniment inside the song but it's a ballad that I don't think you will forget. There's an awful lot of variety on this CD and you won't regret picking it up--I recommend it highly!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The album you knew they could make","review":"Sometimes the cut-out bin yields treasure. Cheap trick deftly integrates their roots (Beatles and Who) with their own strong pop chops. The album starts with the most generic song in the collection (\\"Anytime\\"), but quickly gets on track with \\"Hard To Tell\\", and then the incredible \\"Carnival Game\\". Robin Zander's howl is a dead ringer for Roger Daltrey's on \\"Eight Miles Low\\".This album rocks to hard to easily fit into the \\"power pop\\" category, yet it is too melodic and hook laden to sit comfortably in the \\"hard rock\\" bin. So forget the labels and treat yourself to an album by a band that has finally regained their composure after too many years of being lead around by the nose by some big label A&R man.My only complaint about this album is it's too short!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Late Cheap Trick!","review":"Best set of tunes since Dream Police!

Honestly, I think he needs help himself more than I do.So, if it gives you comfort to be blamed instead of understood - feel free to read the book. But, if you want to be understood as well as taking control of your behavior, there are much better books.Another big issue I have with the book is that it deny's the environmental factors of anger, from racism, exploitation, sexism etc.Just says it's all your fault. I'm open to the fact that some of those factors I need to let go - but it's not right to say they don't exist.I considered selling the book on amazon or half to get at least some of my money back, but I Think I would rather burn it since it will be hurting others more than helping.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice book","review":"As if he is talking about me, I just received it yesterday, and already finished 3 chapters. you have to read it if you are as angry as me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry!","review":"This is typical!

In a Safe Place lacks Eno's subtlety, Penguin's craft (PCO specialized in simple songs, but when all the harmonies and instruments were in full swing, swirling in and among one another like small-winged insects fluttering near a porch light, believe me, you'd swear that this music was quite complex) and Air's chewy hooks. At its best, In a Safe Place offers pleasant--albeit repetitive--soothing melodies. At its worst, it inspires me to learn how to use sequencing software with my dusty Yamaha keyboard and start penning songs.For more reviews, visit http://unpaidrockcritic.typepad.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing unique","review":"The best song is the one with Jonsi from Sigur Ros, but other than that, this album is lacking any sign of originality or expression.

Also, I moved from one state to another this year, so I downloaded both states' programs.

Taxcut includes these forms, but offers little guidance on filling them in. It would be just as easy using a pen and paper. Worse still, although it happily excludes by foreign income, it refuses to acknowledge the existence of non-US earned income on 1040, so I had to manually enter that too.Second, I imported capital gains data from Quicken. Oh dear! One transaction was repeated six times in Taxcut. And, when you deleted one of these repetitions, it ALSO deleted another unrelated transaction. In short, I had to do it by hand.In general, despites its own flaws, I'll go back to Turbotax next year.

Had to 'force' the entry which then brings up an error in the review.In general, very frustrating to use, and each year it becomes worse, not better. The good days of TaxEdge are gone, and had to convert to TurboTax, which also grew more cumbersome each year, so I switched to TaxCut. This may be my last year with it.No way to give feedback either, unless one would 'pay' $20 to tell of the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Customer Support, No Refund","review":"I've used TaxCut for a few years and used to be satisfied with it.

In fact, I bought it back in December and so there is no way I could have made use of the product within the first 60 days.

I had to override the computed values for a couple of fields to correct the problem.Then, I got errors trying to send my return electronically.

I thought their questions were too vague and the program skipped around a lot. For example, if you were wanting to go back to the last question, it might take you way back to the beginning of the section instead....Very confusing and poorly made.I could have all the numbers right, but I don't want to be so quick to pay the IRS $1000!

After many screams and hollers, I was ready to e-file (a big joke!); I had to fill out even more paper work then I did when I had to do it by snail mail. And I couldn't even print it out for snail mail! Whoever made this program, must have been a nerd who got picked on a lot and this is their revenge.This program stinks, stay away from it and do what you normally do.

The main reason being that the makers of TurboTax decided to include a piece of spyware with their software which couldn't be deleted from your computer.

TaxCut does not download 1099 information from most financial institutions, the \\"help\\" feature is almost always well... unhelpful. One calculation in my return was unquestionably wrong (the software designers seemed to suspect that it might not give the right figure for many users and thus suggests overriding the program's calculation--but overriding a single figure means the program will not allow you to file electronically.

Last year I worked in 2 states so I had to partition my income by state. I TaxCut would not do this properly, kept changing my address listed on the return from IL to IN and back and forth when I tried to fix the data, and ultimately became more trouble than it was worth. In the end, I had to manually override the data to print my return. What a waste!

Depreciation shows up on the worksheets but not on my tax form.

Why does a email reciept have to be so loaded with HTML ads for nonrelated products that IE creates script errors?I never did get the state download, the web pages never load. I can't ask for help, no email address ever appears and a telephone call is $10.00.I don't want to go back to Intuit and the endless ads.

This water tower is one of my favorite pieces in the Department 56 collection and it works great in a Lemax village as well. Amazon's price on this item is usually better than most stores. If you like this stuff, this is a great piece.Incidentally, the picture shows two bendable trees, but ours has one and was clearly designed for one.

I totally understand that the eggs can't be packaged with the kit since they are alive. What I wasn't expecting was to have to pay another $12.95 to get the eggs. What I really wasn't expecting is that the eggs are only available January-April.

If you are ordering this for the praying mantis, make sure you order by April, so you can get the egg cases sent to you before they are out of stock). This is well made and easy enough for a 5 year old to get in and out of to take care of the praying mantis. Its nice because it has a zipper at the top for smaller opening. It has handles to hang as well. The screen is small enough to allow oxygen in and keeps the insects inside nicely. Great for educational learning about nature and other creatures. This can be used over and over again for other purposes as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"great educational toy and slightly better than other choices","review":"I actually liked this version of the butterfly kit more than competitors because it's better made and has all those little things like tweezers, magnifying glass, etc. and a very educational booklet.

Olson has produced a superb scholarly refutation of the Rapture belief held by many evangelical Christians. Olson's treatment of dispensationalist errors seems irrefutable.My own background is similar to Olson's and reading this book was of great interest to me. Olson surprised me that there is no scriptural evidence proof-texts for the Rapture whatsoever, even Tim LaHaye concedes this. The Bible's references to the imminency of Christ's coming invariably includes the taking away of the wicked to judgement. It is the wicked who will be surprised by the sudden destruction that comes upon them, rather than waiting for 7 years from the surprise Rapture knowing exactly when the end will come.The main problem Olson faces is that the people who really need this book (fundamentalists) will dare never read it.

It has lists of possible \\"gas-producing foods\\", and \\"cow's milk-containing foods\\" that helped solve our problem. It was very down-to-earth, and explained everything I needed to know to help me understand how to best feed my daughter. She is now 8 months old, still breastfeeding (and on some solids), and is the happiest baby I know.

There is NO INSTRUCTION. The girls just start doing moves and expect you to catch on. The routines are technical and repeated. But forget about showing a move, then adding on. They just do it and expect repetition will teach you. Very frustrating.But if you are looking for something different and don't need instruction, then buy this video.

It did not live up to my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Beginners","review":"I have both the Cheeracise videos and I do not understand why there is a twilight version.

This book has been my resource on a great many occasions.In 30 chapters, author Simon covers the entire Win32 API with concise, reasonably comprehensive explanations of each function.

There are a lot of code examples, as well.A very readable, very usable reference on the Win32 API.Jerry"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Super-Bible!","review":"What else can be said about something that claims to be a superbible? It's name says it all: almost every API you could hope to want to see is in here, with hundreds of examples that are easily programmed by hand or cut-and-pasted with the source code on the CD. Basically you set up one program (given to you at the beginning of the book) and then all the examples follow programming a \\"case\\" statement for the TEST menu control that will execute. If you're looking for ODBC or DAO APIs, this book has none, nor any APIs that will help with Multimedia or Telephony. Even so, this is a fantastic reference to anyone still using APIs to do their programming (which, unlike MFC or COM or at least not until you have a lot of experience with it...and not using AppWizard, allows you to program exactly what you want, how you want it) this book will pay for itself the very first program you write using it.

Worst of all is that we can't even enjoy reading it as it is as that awful out of tune battery failing whine keeps playing and we can't remove the batteries or turn it off, no no singing along without the music either. He is sad and I am faced with buying another copy for perhaps another 1 week of use? Don't think I will be doing that. Other issues include volume being way too loud, having to close and reopen book halfway through to retrigger 2nd half of music, and IMO, somewhat mediocre artwork.

I'm also wearing thick wool socks, but compared to the Hush Puppies slippers I had been wearing with the wool socks they are warmer.I wasn't sure of the size to order, but based on the other reviews I ordered one size up and they seem a little big.

One of the most interesting pieces, in retrospect, is the piece on Tom Stoppard: Tynan compares him to a then little known Czech political playwright named Vaclav Havel -- who later went on to become a prominent dissident and the first president of the Czech Republic.

The cartoony ghosts and ghostbusting gorila do absolutely nothing for the plot.

Cable and over-the-air TV signals only go up to 1GHz, so the rest of the 2GHz bandwidth just lets in the interferors eg. cell phones, microwave ovens etc which actually mess with the TV signal. It's true there can be extra loss in the different ways a signal can be split, but it really is unnoticeable. It's more important to minimize the number of connections, cable length and use good cable and connectors in your setup. However the 24K gold does look great and if I had to have a splitter exposed to view, this one would surely impress my friends and neighbors, just like my other gold connectors, Bose speakers and monster speaker cable.

The author discusses how the original game was sacrificed for the American players game-playing needs, which are very different from the original Chinese game (not nearly as ancient as we were led to believe in the 1920's.)The author is very precise in his decription of the original game and the Chinese thought processes of that original game.

Oh I speak english, it's just I couldn't understand what the hell these people were saying. They talk in this low grade incoherent British babble. Now for the movie. Its got some real shock value and the acting is good. Ray Winstone is great, even though I only understand about 30% of what he says. The actress who plays the incest victim is an incredible actress. She is also really hot, you almost can't blame the father(I'm going to hell for that one). The guy who plays her brother doesn't really do much but stand around with the same dumb stoned look on his face. You call that good acting? I spend most of my time doing that. The mother is also very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travesty Of A Superb Novel.","review":"My one star rating is for the technical aspects of the film, particularly the cinematography.All these people trying to work out why the characters did certain things should read the book. They obviously felt they had to change some very important aspects of the novel.It is made plain in the book that the daughter was the instigator of the 'incest' and that she was jealous of her mother's reltionship with her father. When the baby was born she took her opportunity.Another important thing changed in the film is that in the book Tom THINKS he is having sex with Carol but as he is blindfolded he's unaware that it is his sister.SO my advice is READ the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More tea, vicar?","review":"Tim Roth chaired an open forum to answer questions about this film on release. When he heard an opinion he objected to, he invited the opinionator to step outside. Phew! What a commitment to free speech.

After a charming scene of buggery, Mr Roth pauses to set up a nicely framed bit of arthouse aesthetica with daughter in the middle and dad to one side in halo's of light. Aw, bless. What worries me about War Zone's pre-publicity is that all the sleazo's out there will fast forward to find the bunk up in the bunker for a quick dodgy Barclays.

Although the treatment of each topic is very brief, the message is clear and concise: individual ambition is key to understanding world events. Adherence to religious and moral values would have limited the scope of ambition, so these values were routinely twisted or cast aside.This survey piece is ideal for someone who doesn't have the time to read \\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\" but who does want to understand major events that have gotten us to the present state of affairs.

I've been using it for almost 2 months now. It's totally a subjective opinion, but I do think it has helped with the clarity of my vision, I don't see those little floater proteins (I call them worms) hardly at all, no halo-ing (is that a word?), and I actually see a little better at night than before. It's still pretty early which is why I'm only giving it 4 out of 5 stars... but so far, I think it's working so I'll stay with it.

He is spending most of his last years trying to do what has eluded physicists in the quarter century since he passed away, reminiscent of Einstein's fruitless quest near the end of his life. Mlodinow is a young post-doc at Cal Tech hoping Feynman, or anyone, can help him to get a foothold in physics and not too sure he belongs in this world. For a young student this memoir should resonate with the fears and hopes peculiar to a profession with so many towering figures. Feynman exhorts Mlodinow to just find his own way and never mind what anyone else thinks.

It's 40\\" corner stand with a piano black top and bottom with one glass shelve in between. The base of the TV is almost exactly 40\\" and it looks like it's made for this television. It cost only $90.00. This TV is a pleasure to watch and taking advantage of all the new DirectTV HD channels makes a perfect match. The only disappointment was shipping. It took 16 days, over a week past the due date and the shipper never called me. I had to track down the TV myself. They also missed the first delivery date of Friday, but did deliver it on Saturday. Overall I am beyond pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"I am sooo happy with this purchase. Every aspect of the deal was wonderful. The TV blows away me and my familys expectations. We are not super tech'ies but LOVE to watch movies. My 19 year old son and I are up till 2am now fighting over channels. :o) Of course the funnest channels are the HD ones. The only problem is that we can see every blemish on every actor and actresses face and body. Seriously, you can clearly see warts, moles, freakles, zits, make up lines, etc.... its halarious!! Samsung stuff is hands down the nisest ever. We are happy campers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Visiter to Marrakech","review":"I read this book while living with my family for 6 months in Morocco. I found that the book portrayed the same problems and frustrations that both me and my family were experiencing, as well as some of the wonder. Included are some wonderful descriptions and insights as to Moroccan/American differences and the way Americans are percieved by the rest of the world. I thought it deeply desplayed Moroccan culture and customs as well as one of the most interesting cities in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"This case is waaay overpriced at ... . It looks like something you'd see - but pass on - for ... at Wal-Mart. The leather is thin and padding virtually nonexistent. It does not completely cover the camera. And the closure is a huge piece of velcro which makes quite an obnoxious noise everytime you open it up. My advice is to buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy case, worth about $5 - SHOULD BE NO STARS!","review":"I wish I had read the reviews first before ordering this. It is a terrible case. I thought there would be cushioning of some sort and a small pocket to store CF cards or a spare battery, but it basically only makes the camera bulkier. I plan to return it and root around in my old camera equipment for something that fits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't buy it","review":"I should have listened to the other negative reviews on this product. Bought it and finally have to return it. It's really what the others have said. I ended up buying a Samsonite at Best Buy for my Canon S30. If your camera is also as small as mine, that Samsonite is probably the best you can find out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slippery as a bar of soap!","review":"I agree with the other negative reviews of this case: it's too expensive for what you get, it offers virtually no padding/protection and, in fact, endangers rather than protects the camera because the case is made of very slick leather & is difficult to hang onto. The case tends to slip out of the hand easily, like a wet bar of soap! Unlike the camera it's intended to hold, this case is not a well conceived product. If you use it, be sure to have the camera's strap attached to your wrist so the camera doesn't hit the ground when it slips out of your hand; trust me: the slippery case will definitely cause you to drop the camera sooner or later (probably sooner)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this case","review":"I bought this case a year ago on Amazon, and I haven't used it very much. It is very poorly made. I had it on my belt a few days ago, the belt strap came off (threads unraveled) and the case with camera went flying to the pavement. Luckily, the camera survived. The top row of threads came off, and bottom row was very loose."},{"rating":"2","title":"The PSC-30? A Pretty Nice Case","review":"An opposite view... I bought this case because I wanted something that was as small as possible and easily carried on the belt instead of a pack good for trekking in the Amazon rainforest. Sure, some cases are armour-plated, and let you carry two dozen batteries as well as gigabytes' worth of CF cards (plus perhaps also a card printer just in case you really need it then and there), and that's fine, but if you want the slickest case for an S30 for that adventure to the park with the kids, then this one is it. And its also real leather instead of nylon or whatever else. Having said this, fitting a second battery for the camera is somewhat tricky, explaining the 4 rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A standard case that doesn't add much","review":"This case is good for protecting your camera from nicks and scratches caused by storing it in purses, briefcases or luggage. But don't count on it to protect your camera from falls, dirt or dust.It looks good, the PowerShot logo gives an authentic look to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small! No room for accessories!","review":"The camera (Canon S-80) barely fits in the case and there is no room for even an extra storage card, much less a second battery pack or the charger. I ended up using my old Tamrac case that has an extra zippered pouch for accessories. Total waste of $$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"The game of mystery","review":"I didn't like the first few chapters but after a while I got in to this book and then I couldn't put it down.

In my reading group only the girls said it was \\"O.K.\\" If want to read it because you like Egyptian stuff, DON'T. Save your time and money and don't read this book.

It gives you ideas for your own game like wearing costumes, making gods, trying oracles, believing in spirits,playing in a very secret place, and keeping it all a secret is the most fun of all! This book is very mysterious and makes you want to keep reading for hours and hours and plus it inspires you to read other books.

There are character april, Melanie, marshal, and to boys. the only suspenseful part is where one of the girls almost gets killed. The book gets better for a chapter and the it gets lamer and lamer.

I does however promote imagination, and gives some good ideas for people who love Egypt. But there are some problems to it.- not very well written- descriptions are lacking- does not have a clear story lineLastly, I must add that in a strictly Christian perspective, the rituals, cermonies, and gods seemed to grate on my nerves. These kids shouldn't have gotten so caught up in heaten practices. When I first read it, I quit because I wasn't sure ifit would be ageanst my bliefs. Nevertheless, I will say that it can be worth the read, but I would recommend checking it out at the Library before you buy. I ABSOLUTELY think if you LOVE it though, you should buy it for Amazon.com only.

The clerk is thought to be the murderer by a lot of people; however, the only one who thinks he's innocent is April.The Egypt Game is a good book. Most people would've thought this book is just about Egypt, but it is cool because the author puts in the part about the murderer. The plot is pretty exciting, and all the characters act differently. By looking at the author's writing style, it seems that he or she likes to keep the book interesting throughout the story. The Egypt Game is a good book for ages ten and up, or it could just be for anyone who likes Egypt and crime stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Egypt Game","review":"The Egypt Game is an exciting book.

Ken always says,\\"Sheesh\\", Marshall always takes an octopus with were ever he goes, and April also moved to live with her grandmother Caroline.

They ended up joining. After that, they created a new alphbet and rituals/cerimonies . Then they tried an oracle . Mysteriously it answered. They found out that one of the 6th graders did it.

The murder that happened came very late in the book. This book was very slow at the beginning but got faster at the end. The kids in the story pretended they are Egyptians in a junkyard. The main two characters are two eleven year old girls named April and Melaine. The reason I did not like this book is because it wasn't exciting. I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone. You won't learn much about Egypt if you read it. It only names a few Egyptian gods and goddesses. A good chapter was the one about oracles and that's about it. I wouldn't read this book over and over again. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sketchy at Best","review":"Don't waste your money. This book assumes that you already know all about Egypt and are very excited about all the rites, objects of worship, etc. It also leaves a lot of the details of the game itself to the reader's imagination.

I lost my insterest in this book in the beginning when i found out that the Egypt Game was to be a pretend game played by some girls and two \\"weird\\" boys.

If so, I would give it a -*. I truly haven't read anything worse. Basically, the story is about a group of young freaks who sit around an abandoned lot worshiping the Egyptian gods. I would give away the ending, but it doesn't really have one-just the vague promise (threat?) of a sequel about gypsies. I admit that I and a group of thirty others were forced to read it, and we all hated it. I have liked school books before, for instance, Seth of the Lion People is a great book. This, however, is simply award-winning idiocy. If you like it, go ahead and read it. If not, don't expect it to get better.Also, the last reviewer was correct.

Instead of an insightful, thought provoking fiction, it proved to be a negative inticement for young readers. Children, be careful what you read and what you watch. Being intrigued by the darker side of things is understandable, but it is dangerous and unwise. My concern is that our society is embracing what my generation would never have tolerated. It is not the book itself that is so scarry, but it is that parents are allowing their children to absorb the ideas, values, and practices of books like Harry Potter and The Egypt Game. We must set a higher standard for our children. If no goal is set, it is sure to be obtained."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Egypt Game","review":"The Egypt Game was, to say the least, a unique book.

I hated this book so readers BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Egypt Game","review":"I didn't like this book.It's a mystery about a murder.lt's kind of exciting,but not that much.If you like books that are about games then you should read this book.Also it has really weird names that you don't know what the heck they mean.If you love Egypt and mysteries then this book was made for you.I don't know why anybody would like this book.It's a great time waster too.The book was really dumb.This book stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Egypt Game","review":"I didn't like this book because the beginning was boring. Only the last 4 chapters were exciting. The beginning only had facts about the characters. I don't think this book deserved a Newberry Award.

The book is great from the beginning to exciting end. So if you see this book in your requiered reading list, I would recommend for you to check it out and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"A few years back I read this for literature circles in my class. There was maybe 4 or 5 other kids in my group. We all were completely lost and could not stand to read the book any longer! Our teacher ended up just letting us stop because it was so horrible! I would never recommend this book! It is the most confusing thing, and I really found the plot itself kind of dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice material - dries quickly","review":"I bought this for my Dad and he loves it.

Every scene in this movie made me laugh - sometimes it was a slapstick laugh and sometimes it was an \\"oh my god, I can't believe they did that\\" laugh. Patrick Voss (Robot Monkey Lab, special effects guru) wrote - with Adam Hackbarth - and directed this hilarious parody of two X-file-esque agents caught up in the alien abduction of a family of inbred rednecks. The special effects range from finely detailed to deliberately funny, but are all very well done and are the backbone of the entire movie showing the great talent of Patrick Voss and his crew. I guarantee you will have a great time watching this movie. I will warn you though that this movie has some really raunchy humor in it. Recommend highly!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yee Haw Anal Probe","review":"This is a must see sci-fi comedy. The one and only independent comedy I can watch again and again, and still laugh my ass off. Crazy rednecks chasing aliens through the hills of Arkansas and crazy aliens abducted rednecks for sexual entertainment. Hilarious non-stop action with tons of awesome special effects including flying saucers, giant alien costumes, and laser guns that vaporize anything they hit. The flying saucer interiors are dressed like a MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000 set which adds to the humorous overtones. From Adam Hackbarth, Patrick Voss and Eric Stanze comes INBRED REDNECK ALIEN ABDUCTION."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not see again","review":"The whole movie needs to be edited.

It's beautiful, comfortable, easily adjustable, and it has wheels!For me, the choice has always been between this chair, and Earthlite's Avila II. Experience with both made it clear to me that the Avila II's limited armrest positions were an absolute deal breaker for me. The only thing I like about the Avila II better than this Oakworks Portal Pro 3 is the face cradle. But those are interchangeable, I believe, so if I can find an Avila II face cradle in the same color as my Portal Pro 3, I'll have it made!Something I noticed at a recent event, where I had the chair set up on turf grass, is that having the base be long bars is a real advantage in that situation. There's another fairly popular chair I've seen (can't remember the name of it, though) that has four feet, and on soft turf, those would dig right in. More confirmation that I made the right choice with this chair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite must have!!!!","review":"Anyone who is mildly intersted or intensely obsessed with the American Revolution needs to have this reference on their bookshelf!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written with a strong anti-American bias","review":"If you like your history served up anti-American style, this book is for you.

They have a substantial weight and the nonstick surface is quite good. My pizza slipped right off the pan. The deep dish pan is equally as good. I even threw it into the dishwasher and have not seen any rust. It is always best to hand wash nonstick bakeware to prolong the life of the pan. My pizza turned out crisp and perfectly browned. I was worried the dark surface might cause the bottom of the pizza to burn but this was not the case. The deep dish pan produced a beautiful crust but my pizza had much to be desired. I must look for a different recipe.WARNING! Don't do as I did and forget to wash your pans before the first use. They are covered in some type of black dust from the factory. I found out too late that I had forgotten to wash the pan. My crust quickly turned a filthy grey and had to be tossed.All in all, a very nice set with a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost got a 5","review":"This one's good...not great...but fun...full of revenge...starts slow...ends quite well...a must for thriller fans...and a great testimony to young girls are stupid enough to venture off into the wide blue sea with strangers.

The \\"film\\" concerns another one of those \\"we killed someone and lets cover it up\\" plots. Of course, nothing goes the way the characters want and they all end up paying for their transgressions. The problem with the film is that the characters are all isolated on a yacht out at sea. While the yacht is pretty cool, there is not many places to hide or do much else so the tension is more or less evaporated and comes down to who is going to kill who next. None of the characters seem to behave in any sort of realistic way and thus I must assume they are all idiots. The film contains some full frontal male nudity which I guess was thrown in so that there would be something to talk about. What was not included was any sort of plot or characters that were at all interesting. This same movie might have made a better comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible: Porn, bad writing, slashing.","review":"What an awful film. There were some moments during which I thought it would be an \\"ok\\" flick. But, as soon as the women got on a yacht with men they had never met, everything went downhill.

I research a bit to see if there's a fix but I have not found one as of yet.

But apart from that the game is Very Good. The game play is fairly realistic, the weapons are good and the graphics are pretty good. The multiplayer is about the best part about the game, the single player is not bad though for some strategy and nice explosions. The one thing I am very disappointed with is that EA would sell expansion packs for they're game, but would not always work, I just wish they would have tested it and made sure that is was ready for sales.

There is no character development unless you count all the characters becoming flattened versions of their original selves. It just seemed that the author didn't know what to do and decided to just kept on adding characters until something clicked in her mind.

Second, the gameplay is always challenging and whatever unique elements they add to each level really provides a new and exciting challenge to the player each time. But don't worry, you end up getting so good at the excellent controls that you can handle the difficulty as long as you select the right plane and configuration for the mission.This is what I love about the wii, just like in need for speed carbon, you can get so caught up in the motions you make with the controlers that after playing for a while, you almost feel somehting similar to sea sickness.

I simply could not put it down from the moment I began reading! The way Ms. Allen dove into each character's thoughts and background made you feel as if he/she was a personal friend. When you finishing reading it, you want to pick up the phone and tell all of your friends and family how much you love and appreciate them. 'The Search for Shannon' is a \\"feel good\\" book that is a MUST to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE THAN JUST \\"MEDIA HYPE\\"!!!","review":"I don't usually do reviews but I have to disagree with the previous one written about The Search for Shannon. I know from reading an article about the author that this book was not based on media hype. She wrote it after meeting her own birth mother and created the characters based on the real emotions of a real birth mother, adoptive mother and adoptive child.Regardless, looking at it from a fictional perspective and not as a nonfiction reference on adoption and adoptive families, The Search for Shannon is incredibly well-written with vivid characters and clever dialogue, and reflects the true meaning of family, blood-related or otherwise without being sappy, overly sentimental or humorless.I thoroughly enjoyed The Search for Shannon and recommend it highly!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has bought into \\"media hype\\"","review":"I had high hopes for this novel, but unfortunately found it \\"echoed\\" a lot of the media hype of the adoptee reunion where all ends \\"happily ever after.\\" From learning about many of the bad adoptee reunions out there, I would say this is ridiculous pap for those who like \\"romance fiction.\\" I mean, how many bmoms actually (many years later) \\"marry\\" the bdads?

No cutesy language, and definitely neither for dummies nor idiots. The first few pages on goal setting and the model they provide alone are worth the price of the book. I actually started reading the book backwards. The chapters are self contained and well written.That said, the book suffers a certain dryness in delivery. What would enliven it and make the content easy to remember is well placed diagrams. I do not mean the kind of useless icons one finds in Dummies books, but serious business oriented diagrams that visualize the concepts.You buy yourself a great education in managing when you buy this book.

The film is a turkey though."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read it half a dozen times - it's still great","review":"Our technology has grown exponentially in the years since Solo, an AI robot prototype, went AWOL as a matter of conscience. But the story never grows stale. Solo was designed to be the perfect warrior, but he grew far past what was intended. Not precisely Superman, but much more than machine, Solo has a philosophical mind and a heart of gold. This book can be read as a thriller, and it is certainly suspenseful, with plenty of high-tech detail (from several decades ago). I read it when it first came out and half a dozen times since, and it's just wonderful. Nowadays it isn't the technology and suspense that hold me, because I've read it so often, but the way in which Solo interacts with the world and grows as a thinking, feeling entity. The sequel, \\"Solo\\", is equally good. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys thrillers, suspense, but also to anyone who likes to think about the ramifications of AI."},{"rating":"2","title":"What First Law of Robotics?","review":"Remember the First Law of Robotics? Well, forget about it. If Solo wants you dead, you're dead.Solo is the hero of Robert Mason's \\"Weapon\\", and he's thoroughly badass.

Solo has other ideas.If this isn't the best technothriller ever written, I don't know what is. Download the sample, then part with your […] - yeah, it's a little steep - and start reading. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"I really enjoyed this book in the beginning. The whole AI aspect I loved and solo's developing intelligence/emotions. However, I did not care about any of the villagers and their lives. In the end, this book just didn't pull me in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Snap Shot in History","review":"There are events in time that shaped who and what we are today. This book sits in the center of such a time and events. If you are into fantasies and happily ever afters this is not the book for you. This is a book about the way it really was. It delivers attitudes and climate that produced the great loss of life in the mines. More importantly it delves deeply in the resulting effects on the lives of those who lived through these times and events. It's not pretty, not nice. It's just how it was, written by a man who lived it. The Snnysidewar should be required reading for anyone who wants to understand more of were we have come from. The events discussed in the book have ramifications that effect high-risk professionals to this day. Mining is still one of the most dangerous jobs on the planet. But because a few good men worked and fought together for something more miners now have a chance of living past 40. Read the book and open your eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Fiction","review":"I enjoyed the book enormously. It is the best fiction book I have read in a long time. The description of the mine in the 1920's was the best I have ever read. Having read all of Tony Hillerman's books, I also liked the Indian connection. And the surprise ending was fun. I think it is an excellent book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Part of American History I Never Knew","review":"In this well-written and interesting historical novel, Fred Civish introduces an important era of American history I never knew. As a native Utahn, it is difficult to escape at least a cursory education about the Mormon trek west and the history of early settlements throughout the region. Yet I have never heard much about the story of mining in Utah, an integral part of Utah's early economy and political history, along with the railroads. Mr. Civish creates an easily-readable, believable, informative, and romantic story to introduce the reader to the battlefields of a lesser-known chapter of American history: the gritty, tenuous, and politically volatile underbelly of the Rocky Mountain mining economy in the early 1900's. Thank you, Mr. Civish, for bringing this part of history alive for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story and good reading","review":"This was a great story. Having had family in the coal mining industry, it really brought me back home. Any more books by F. Civish??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading","review":"The story is really good. It kept my interest from start to finish. I enjoyed this book so much I got a copy for my daughter. I enjoyed the discreption of how the mining was done back in the 20's. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Free of Charge","review":"Probably the worst historical novel I have ever read. One half of the book consists of a syrupy faux-Victorian love story between cardboard characters, the other sounds as if it was lifted verbatim from one of the duller pre-World War I military textbooks. It would seem hard to make the Charge of the Light Brigade sound as exciting as the daily Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, but that is exactly what Ms. Stuart's does. Obviously the publisher is trying to cash in on the current vogue in 18th and 19th century soldier and sailor yarns by republishing this dud, but you'd do better to save your money and re-read the Sharpe series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a very good series","review":"I agree with Tim Cole - the Sheridan series is pretty weak. V.A. Stuart is no Bernard Cornwell. The author knows her history well enough, but the main character isn't very interesting, nor does he really do anything interesting, despite being involved in the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny. On the whole, I was glad I got these from the library rather than buying them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"Way too much romance and too little action. With that said, stuart offers one of the most complete explanations for the miscomunication that led to the ill fated charge of the light brigade.

Another story on the tape seemed equally bad: \\"A Big Operation\\" (Sally shown in a hospital bed.) No where near the quality or story lines of Best Busypeople, Best Counting, Best ABC, Learning Songs, etc. Produced by Cinar/Polygram Video, the quality is so poor (I opened one of them - First Easter Egg- so bad, including music, story & sound) you might as well tape off of Nick jr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum... back to watching the original El Hazard","review":"The original El Hazard had one of the most beautiful, touching endings that I've ever seen, animated or not.

You win some, you lose some."},{"rating":"1","title":"This story goes nowhere","review":"I wanted to review this book because I enjoy a good non-fictionmystery. I was sorely disappointed by the first line. There were more adjectives in the first sentence than a text book. The author goes on and on to over-describe countless scenes, most making no sense with the previous one. He skips from thought to thought taking the reader on a roller coaster ride as you try and keep track of the happenings.At times I found myself wondering, what is he talking about? Manyparagraphs are long and sometimes run two or three thoughts together and you're left wondering, where did that come from?This story does not flow well and is cluttered with numerous typos and repeated words and phrases. I doubt even another edit could help this story.I'm afraid \\"The Man From Nowhere\\" is going nowhere fast. Too bad, the bases for this story seemed to have potential.I cannot recommend this book.Reviewed by Katharine L.

Heroic, innocent Indians are the major theme, and their savagery is excused by every means possible. Major battles are left out, making room for more commentary on George Washington's self-serfving ambitions. How the producers could read his mind so thoroughly is beyond me. To their credit, or more likely because they were ashamed not to, they even allowed one of Washington's references to his reliance on \\"Providence\\" to be included. Keep your money.

I hate that I am forced to give a negative review on this as I wish more videos were out there on the subject.Pros: Great video visually. Finally a video on the French and Indian War! It is an overview of the war.Cons: This production spends more time attempting to convince you that George Washington was a frightened fool with weak skills as a leader. This is unfounded and irresponsible. Why add something like this which is nothing more than an opinion of the author? This also discusses the Indians in a positive light, ignoring the atrocities they committed to focus solely on those of the English. One is left feeling that the English were lucky in victory when history does not support this. This isn't the first time a PBS production has tried to rewrite history to their views today.

The tone was fun and it felt like I was hearing from a well-informed friend who was not being judgmental of my questions.

The book tells you of the lives of these masterminds. Greenday right now is not the most popular in mainstream music, but I'm hoping for them to be number one again with their new album coming out in November.

It guides you through all the formalities that you should go through to operate with partners, particularly for capturing decisions and running meetings. I've run things fairly loosely and there have been a few sticky situations that if we'd followed the guidelines in this book it would have made it a bit easier to manage as well as to go back in time and review decisions that were made in the past.This is not a tax guide or really a legal guide. There are other books that specialize in that. This seems to be more about helping you to properly run the business and not being too lax about your procedures. That said, it does borderline on ridiculous with some of the procedures and processes that in my opinion are overkill. However, at least it does make you aware of them so you can decide for yourself if you want to incorporate them into your LLC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for small LLC's","review":"This book is great for small LLC's, including stock market traders using LLCs to enhance money management benefits. The best part is the CD with all the forms and the instruction on when, why and how to fill them out through the year and with each activity.

Forms and templates for almost any business need are included. Unfortunately for me the vast majority of those forms and instructions are for things that I'll never need.Also, there are specifics that vary by state for LLC; this book is doesn't pertain to any one state, so you will still need to do additional research on operating your LLC within your state.In summary, if you just need the LLC to protect assets and you are the only member, you probably don't need this book. But if you have a medium to large LLC with employees, meetings, etc, this guidebook and template (with CD-ROM containing templates), this is a great \\"operating manual\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the section on Loans is worth the money for this book","review":"I am actually very pleased with this product and highly recommend it for all LLC owners/partners.

The title and premise of this book is that the witness and insider accounts of the early days of the flying saucer phenomenon accounted for these fellows disappearing and/or going belly up. And I don't doubt that in some instances that might have been true. I found the book interesting enough to buy because it was such an early account of the phenomenon and as such important because the information was still fresh and strategies for disinformation were still evolving. However, if \\"they knew too much\\" then they took it to their graves, because the author is unable to relate anything here that would have gotten anyone killed - let alone pestered.

Over the years I misplaced my original book and so with this opportunity to purchase this reprint I now have the opportunity to enjoy it all over once again. The one thing I remember most is that this is the first time the Men in Black are mentioned and since then they have popped up in other writings as well as on screen.

However, those were far and few instances and they could not carry the book. The only reason I finished it was because I thought there might be a great ending but I was wrong. Extremely boring and disappointing because you knew by the writing style that this Author could have done way better.

Billed as a sequel to H.P.Lovecraft's celebrated novel \\"At The Mountains Of Madness\\", the book tacks on the entire plot (and most of the set pieces) of Nigel Kneale's BBC serial \\"Quatermass and the Pit\\", perhaps better known in the US in its movie incarnation as \\"Five Million Years To Earth\\". To this mix Curran also adds the central conceit of Kneale's last Quatermass story, known in the States as \\"The Quatermass Conclusion\\", and large chunks of John Carpenter's version of \\"The Thing\\". The resulting stew is quite entertaining, if heavy-handed in parts.This borrowing doesn't make the book a bad one, but it is annoying as Curran is obviously a skilled writer who - with a little more effort and a decent editor - could be a really good one. Hopefully as Curran continues to write, he'll become confident enough in his abilities to come up with his own plots in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it...but...","review":"Let me start by taking Christ's name is vein. Christ.Now to move on. The main problem with this book is the writing. It's just not very good. The use of language is so distracting infact that it made it impossible to enjoy the story. My main gripe is the fact that the author keeps shifting the focus from the characters to the reader. Rather than show you how the character feels about a situation Mr. Curran tells the reader how the reader would feel in that situation by constantly using \\"you\\". It's distracting,presumptous and completely pulled me out of the story everytime it happened, which is often.I appreciate the effort that went into the novel and the general ideas were interesting, but if you are a fan of craftsmanship in writing, I can't in good faith suggest you read this book. I also can't help but think a good editor could have solved many of the problems of this book.

There is much natural drama here, indeed perhaps to find the stage in the future as some variation of \\"Long Day's Journey Into Night\\". It would make sense to view this video as a final chapter of his life and work, complemented by the earlier \\"Nureyev\\", and at least one full-length ballet-- such as \\"Romeo and Juliet\\".

I explained that I hooked up my Garmin GPS to the software and it locked on in less than 1 minute. He was rude and disagreed. Needless to say I took the package back to Best Buy and exchanged it for the Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007 with Locator. The software installed easily and the GPS locked onto the satellites in less than 2 minutes from a cold start. The next time I used it the time to lock on was less than one minute.

The question is can an African ever be accepted as an equal by the colonizer? While you probably know the answer, Toundi's journey - as told by his journal - is an enthralling read.

The story begins well with Skye encountering yet another difficult set of parents - this is a major theme for the book - and I especially loved the ending wrap-up with her and her mother. Too cute. The middle was fast-paced and attention-grabbing, making the book go fast in a hurry.As before, this \\"cozy\\" mystery stayed warm and soothing, with violence implied and bloodshed nearly nonexistent.

I checked out a few tunes online first and was immediately hooked. Uptown kind of reminds me of the Kinks, Fountains of Wayne, Dismemberment Plan, Replacements, and Prince all swirled together in an awesome kind of way. I know everyone talks about how they can't understand why they're favorite indie rock band isn't huge already, but seriously I don't understand why these guys aren't huge already. Get this disc, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome rock band!","review":"I wish I could come up with a more clever way of saying this but, simply put, these guys kick serious ass.

Ferguson has chosen his subjects well; simple mountaineers to whom the forest is a way of life, moonshiners, American Indians, and trappers are just some of the people who allow us to see the woods as something more than a pretty view from the car.The writing is strong, and the subject matter is entertaining. You don't have to be a tree hugger to enjoy this book. You just have to be open to developing a respect for the world in which we live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I just finished this book literally five minutes ago. It's Friday night and normally the last thing I would be doing is reading but this book is different. I even declined going to a party just so I could finish it.

My favorite part is when Josh's Uncle is going to burn the town unless he gets 200,000 dollars and Amelia...Well I won't tell you what happens. Ann Rinaldi took a true fact of History and made a thrilling book. I highly reccomend it.

She could never find this perfume and I was kind of sad to see the smell go away.Then I found it here on Amazon and once again the wife and I are both happy!I love the smell of this perfume: It is a light, flowery smell. It is subtle and will make your head turn if you ever get a whiff!Gentlemen, if your lady likes a nice, fresh scent you can't go wrong getting this for her!NOTE: This is actually an \\"Eau de Toilette\\" which just means it isn't as strong as \\"Perfume\\".

I purchased this book, used the forms, and I got it on my first try.His forms that I filled out(daily activities) and attached to all of my Doctor's forms were extraordinarily helpful and I believe essential in the decision making process for Social Security. It also proved helpful to the doctors who were making their reports. As long as your doctors know you, they still cannot be with you all day to know your moment to moment activities. These forms give them a birds eye view of what one deals with on a daily basis.I recommend this book very highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, it was just bad !","review":"I'm sorry , this was just a very mediocre book at best.

Easily read and addresses many frequently asked questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but doesn't answer the Qs","review":"I agree with most of the other reviews here. This book does a fairly good job of distinguishing the differences between factions of Amish and Mennonites, but as far as answering the \\"20 Most Asked Questions,\\" the answers provided are either very shallow or the question is not answered at all in favor of the authors' own philosophical ramblings. Point in case, Chapter 4, Why Don't They Accept Modern Things? Instead of attempting a response, the authors answer with their own question: are we living a \\"modern\\" lifestyle that much better off? I suspect they didn't answer this question because doing so would have highlighted the many inconsistencies in the choices made of what technology to accept and what to decline using. The authors should have dealt with these inconsistencies honestly instead of ignoring them. Their shallow treatment of many of the other topics seems to indicate a lack of specific knowledge, or reluctance to talk honestly about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"adorable","review":"This is one of the cutest toys Ty makes -- so cute, in fact, this one was bought as a replacement (or companion to) for the Yodels we bought our granddaughter some years ago as she sleeps with it every night and the original one, though well made, is showing signs of all the \\"love\\" she's given it.

Furthermore the edging is sewn so tightly that the silver side puckers and ironing is very difficult as the material moves.

I rediscovered it again among the forgotten and neglected books in my high school library.Now, several decades later I have located and bought myself a vintage edition very much like my mother's beloved copy.Never have I come across such a lovingly assembled collection of nonsense and whimsy. Even after the span of 80 years since it was published, the humor in this book shines with all the raucous exuberance of it's day.Nostalgic, but not dated; innocent, but not naive; silly and playful to be sure, but never stupid -certainly never coarse or vulgar; this is an assembly of inspired daffiness, genuine wit and brilliant humor.HIGHLY recommended to anyone who seeks to know what humor really is.

Oh yeah i give this game 4 1/2 stars.THE THING THAT SUCKS: u need a credit card number for your friends list and a clan. if your parents won't let you use your credit card number, there could be a problem.Overall the game is very nice so far. i've only played the game for about 3 or 4 hrs so far, and i haven't tried the single player missions yet. yes, there are 32 players online at once, but 16 on 16 is pretty laggy sometimes. so its better if u do like 10 on 10 or less if u don't want any lag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Socom","review":"I received this in a great time frame and everything looked great .

Single player is fun but online is simply awesome. The only complaint I have is somthing that has occured in every socom so far, the dumb A.I. I mean really it gets annoying sometimes. For example when you are driving a veichle, you can order your bravo team to drive in a seperate veichle. However you may not want to do that because 99.9% of the time they will either run into a wall and end up not following you, they may just take forever(if you are at your destination it may take about 5min for them to arrive), and somtimes enemys come up near your fireteam, and your dumb teamates wont even notice. Even the enemy, its not uncommon to find enemys running into walls and just running into that same corner. Like I said before this has been a problem for all the socoms, however it is still a very fun game. Especially the weapons and ghillie suits. Online mode is fantastic! No problems there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Great as Overrated Reviews - Socom II Better","review":"Socom 3 is the worst of the series. The previous series where more realistic in gameplay while Socom 3 is more arcade like. For example, you and your team is automatically healed at checkpoints on the same mission - how realistic is that? I enjoyed playing Socom 1 with the knowledge all it takes is one shot. I was real frustrated when I played the Socom 3 Poland episode because it was arcade-style like Syphon Filter 1. I cannot stand stealth mission (or earning a driving license) on video games and wish game developers stop putting that in! The vehicles are also unrealistic and totally unneccessary.People claiming this to be the best product ever are questionable at best. I'm a real Socom player and this has got to be the worst they put out in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon didn't get my game to me","review":"Amazon gets the 1 star, not Socom 3.

There are i think 38 weapons and 20 vehicles to use. you can customize your weapons with over 21 attatchments. the weapons are552, m16 ,m4, rtk 74, ak 47, mk48, m8, G36, LA96W, m401, m14, sr25, marine bolt action, ag94, hk5, 9mm sub, stg77, iw80a2, f90, f57, d.e, m18, m82, svd, mark 23, 9mm, m60, ra 14, at4, rpg, c4, frag, smoke, flashbang, and more. the granades and explosives and rocket launchers cant be customized and the the other con is you can hold only 2 attatchetments per weapon but it is an awsome game so buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I got this game for christmas and it is amazing.

The online play is greatalthough i still miss blizzard from socom 2.What is UNFORGIVABLE is SOCOM 3 needing a credit card for onlineverification. They even ask your mothers maiden name. Zipper and sony need to rethink this policy. Obviously this is a major security threat to everyone that gets \\"verified\\".

I have nothing against that concept; several of the versions I already own are abridged, animated, or storybook versions. But this version is by far the worst of any I have seen. The story line has been modified so much that it's barely recognizable, the characters have no personalities, the animation is amateurish and lacks detail, and the voice acting is stilted and unemotional.

(and thanks to the other reviewer, Taran, for posting this and another movie online, which is how I came to find it.)It's a great version of the story and still kept me entertained and made me laugh all these years later. I think any little kid would certainly enjoy it. One thing I found is that it is not close-captioned as stated in the 'Format' section of the product details, which I would have liked. Other than this, I am very excited with my purchase and encourage you to buy this version of the classic story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real deal","review":"My grandsons love Disney books. We often read one and then I order the movie.I inadvertently ordered this version of Peter Pan. It is not a delightful asthe original Disney movie. I learned a lesson here. The Disney was more expensive, but worth the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent cheap tire","review":"I actually bought this set of tires for a different bike, but decided to throw them on my Nirve B-1 until my Felt Quick Brick tires come in. They're actually pretty decent tires for the price. I don't race my bikes or off-road, I'm just a cruiser. These tires work great! The only thing I noticed is that rolling through small gravel, the tread will pick them up and drive you crazy! Don't know if it's normal, but my white walls came with black marks all over them, not a bid deal though - I just cleaned them right up with some water."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is strictly a price tire.","review":"I'm very disappointed in this tire. It's clearly a price tire and can't hold a candle to the ones I want ro replace on my '52 Schwinn Panther. I wouldn't want to put them on for fear that a pebble on the road may go through and cause a blowout. Also, the supplier has been very lax in working with me to solve the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun show","review":"I loved both seasons. I am sad that it has been cancelled. It reminded me of Sex in the City and the Sopranos together. Watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this series!!!","review":"I was looking for soomething to tide me over while waiting for my fav authors to put out new books and I stumbled onto this series. After I read the first one, I bought the rest of the series!This is full of great characters and equally great stories! It's like Harry Potter meets Sex and the City! If you like either of those, or any of the vampire series, you will love these books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle sample chapter hooked me","review":"Very likeable characters, intriguing series, very hard to put down. Well worth the full ebook price. The flow of the story is great. I just finished this first book in the series and quickly bought the rest of the books. It's been a while since I've found a series that has me wanting to know more and more about everyone in the book and what happens next. Since I can't find anything wrong with it, I'm rating this one a rare 5 stars. Now I just have to make myself read the books in order although I really want to read the last one next so I can find out what happens to Owen and Katie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Harry Potter for adults","review":"I loved this series.

I would love to get a job at MSI!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot, Poor execution","review":"I was excited to read this story, the promo sounded fun and unusual. I was disappointed. The storyline is a fanciful, untypical, magical idea. Unfortunately, it wasn't told well. I couldn't bring myself the finish the book. It was very weak in character and scene development. The dialog was not interesting or engaging. I decided that it was a waste of my time to read it. I would like to see it re-written with much more creativity put into giving individuality to the characters and liveliness to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"What a delightful find! This book (and its three sequels that I loved) has great writing, dynamic characters, just the right mixture of real life and magical fantasy, and good old-fashioned romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"this novel rocked!","review":"I loved this book from start to finish. In fact I was desperately hoping there would be a sequel and was excited to learn there is one coming out: Once Upon A Time In Stilettos...the novel is quirky, cute & original. In fact it would also make a great movie!If you like magic in an adult harry potter way you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and intelligent","review":"This is a light-hearted and intelligent novel.

Luckily this was a quick read because I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bibbity-Bobbity FUN!","review":"Shanna Swendson's \\"Enchanted, Inc.\\" is a fun, fun, fun read. Perfect for poolside or curling up in your favorite chair. To borrow from Ms. Swendson's own description, it's the perfect blending of Chick Lit and the world of Harry Potter with a twist of the modern business world (As a Human Resources(Personnel) staffer, I loved how Katie defined Personnel's role in the company)My only complaint is that I have to wait for the sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay.","review":"I bought this based on the reviews and was disappointed. I loved the Twilight and Sookie Stackhouse series. This was just okay. Nothing really exciting ever happened and no romance. The writing was good so I got through it quickly, but I will not be reading book two."},{"rating":"2","title":"enchanted, inc.","review":"I bought this book awhile back and just got around to reading it. Usually, I read paranormal mysteries, so I was a little wary that this book was paranormal chick lit. I can't believe I waited so long because this book was great. The plot was interesting enough for me, and I usually like a mystery to drive the plot. The author made the magical circumstances seem real, and all of the characters at Katie's office were hilarious. I loved the New York City setting, and I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in chick lit or paranormal books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I wanted it to be.","review":"The book was pretty predictable and forgettable. I bought it used on Amazon and at the very end I discovered that two pages had been torn out. I kept reading and felt like I hadn't missed anything as a result of torn pages. Very disappointing overall because I wanted the story to be fun and sexy and magical but it was really just blah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"I was really hesitant to buy this book because the author was unknown to me. However, I just bought the first in the series to give it a try. I loved it. It had a really good wholesome romantic/ mystery storyline that kept me moving on to the next until I finished the available books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insert pun on \\"Enchanted\\" here","review":"A must-read for fans of both chick-lit and Harry Potter-esque fantasy, Enchanted, Inc. was a great novel.

I strongly recommend it to anyone capable of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"mitsubishu 65inch tv","review":"I bought this tv 3 years ago and replacing the bulb now for the third time at $100 EACH. I was told I was lucky by Mitsubishi that if I get a year out of a bulb, that is good. Some places charge up to $200 a bulb. I just wasn't expecting to have to put this kind of money into a tv yearly. Well the last bulb only lasted 9 months. I would not recommend this tv for this reason. It is nice was it works, but unfortunately it is costly every year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly executed","review":"This was one of 3 books by Lydia Adamson I have read. This is one from the \\"vet\\" mystery series. The other 2 were from a \\"birdwatcher\\" mystery series and a \\"out of work actress/catsitter\\" mystery series I did not find any reason to recommend any of them.The plots are haphazardly constructed. Many of the situations are tortuously contrived. Characters are 2-dimensional and banal. The writing itself is clumsy. The vocabulary and structure seem to be \\"dumbed down\\". Perhaps these books are intended for younger readers?The reason I award 2 stars rather than 1 is that there is nothing truly offensive here. It is a predictable \\"spunky female protagonist solves mystery that baffles bumbling males\\" kind of story. It is simply more sloppily executed than most.If you enjoy trying to \\"figure out whodunnit\\" as you read, these books will disappoint. Most of the pertinent information is only revealed in the last few pages - in a kind of rush to tidy up the loose ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!!","review":"I got this a few years ago.I had the pleasure to sing in a backup choir for an album in Houston, TX and Javen was one of our artists. One thing that I noticed about him is that out of all the other artist, he was humble. I have seen him preach on TV and heard him sing live and it is always encouraging. He is also in the movie One Night With the King which was a beautiful epic movie! Support this man of God, I always will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial information","review":"This book does not offer what I was looking for, namely some in-depth information on the Axim PDA. There is a lengthy chapter devoted to the stupid games you can play on this device. But I was hoping to learn how (if at all possible) you can create a shortcut to rotate the display. Or how to always have Word and Excel start up at a predefined zoom level. Instead the book tells you how to play BallBreaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Bother","review":"This book has a wealth of information, but I really would not bother. The new smart phones have surpassed anything this device will do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Without more detailed information about the operating system and its methods, this book is a useless waste of time. I threw it in the trash after 15 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"right: Not the disney version","review":"Wow I just decided to buy this DVD only because there wasn't other cartoons on the rack with a familar story. However, certainly this isn't the disney version. It is rather old. I would say more Scooby Doo quality, or the old Super Friends quality.The only good thing about this old cartoon is that it was during the days of more lax regulations, so the story seems a bit more realistic. So for adults, it's probably more enjoyable. Without the story, I would say it's a dull DVD.I would recommend the Disney's Fox Robin Hood over this one. But that's only if you don't mind animals always playing a lead role in American cartoons. Sometimes its just good to see humans on cartoons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work on an ASUS Transformer","review":"I bought this item because the description stated that it would work on my android device.

We've barely made it through two episodes. I'm not sure if this was considered wildly funny at the time it aired, but if so, it hasn't aged well. We will likely watch additional episodes, but it's hard to get through them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kids music - you'll want to sing along!","review":"This CD is a lot of fun! My toddler gets a big kick out of Build a House because we imitate the hammering, sawing and sanding motions in each verse of the song. Our other favorite tracks are Insect Safari, Now We're Fishin', and Gibberish. I can't describe the feeling I get watching my kid dance to this music. I hope these guys come out with another album soon - Kathy and Tom rule!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tunes that teach as well as entertain","review":"I bought the CD after hearing that the title track \\"Build a House\\" was a winner in the International John Lennon Song Writing contest, but the songs are great from beginning to end. Especially good for younger kids, it's also a great CD to pop in the car stereo on a family roadtrip for everyone to sing along. Not only are the songs catchy and humorous, they also have some great messages--like using words to express your feelings; the beauty of diversity; the importance of being kind to others. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and less then awe inspiring.","review":"After reading the \\"Second Time Around\\", I wanted to like this first effort by Ms. Wainscott. I wanted to like it but I was disappointed. An interesting idea that brought no strong characterizations to the characters. I didn't care about the people in the book. Jaimie DiBarto was handsome, and devoted to the idea of being responsible to his wife following her coma, but other then that, who cares? I didn't care about any of the characters and that was what was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"inadequate","review":"Ironically, do not purchase this book if you are seeking in-depth information on your specific MBTI type. I purchased this book after taking the official Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which recommended the book \\"for a complete discussion of the sixteen types.\\" Even though this book is 228 pages long, it only devotes approximately three paragraphs to each of the 16 types! One type is specifically discussed for merely there sentences! That is unacceptable. If you want to know more about your specific type, I recommend that you google it; there are many webpages devoted to thoroughly discussing each type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic warm-up program","review":"This is a good basic warm-up CD for singers who want to protect their vocal chords from damage, by exercising the voice properly before singing. She offers a variety of exercises that get progressively more complicated. There are a couple things that make it work for a contemporary singer (mahs for a bright sound and counting seconds to limit vibrato) but for the most part, it is made for a classical singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the job","review":"First of all, there is absolutely NO difficulty removing the cover with the rear feed in place. To prevent any tendency of dislodging the rear feeder in the process, lift the front part of the cover off the printer first, then lift the whole cover easily off the printer. When you install the cover, retrace those steps: place the cover over the rear assembly first and then pull the front of the cover over the front edge of the printer. Nothing could be easier.It's a beautifully made cover, as has been previously described, and part of the seemingly hefty price can be chalked up to the Tumi surcharge, but, as with so many things, you really get what you pay for.The fit is absolutely ideal, and there are a few small nicely placed button vents in the rear for air circulation, but not enough to allow dust to be a problem.Highly recommended, and an overall good value, even at its price point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a glove!","review":"I wasn't sure this cover was going to be worth the money, but once it arrived and I put it on my 3880, I had no doubts. Excellent product! Fits great! ..and yes I do have the rear paper feeder attached. If you want to protect your printer in style with a cover that will easily last the life of the printer, I would definitely go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting/suspenseful","review":"This isn't as bad as Leonard Maltin's review would indicate. I liked this far better than the Black Room in which Karloff had the lead role. Here, Karloff has a supporting, not a staring role, but the movie is worth a look. Sets are done nicely, music reminds you of Frankenstein, and acting is good. Basic plot is about an evil Count who lives in a gothic castle, and has killed two Englishmen, whom he sought revenge on. Enter Richard Greene who is out to find what happened to them. In the process, his own life is in 'grave' danger. I won't ruin the ending, which is as good and suspenseful as any. Lon Chaney Jr plays a loyal brute butler, Karloff a doctor of the Count who's not so loyal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you","review":"This CD at first didn't impress me as much as make yourself sick did. However, once I realized that the whole CD tells one continuous story (not as easy as you think when the songs are shuffled on an iPod) everything comes together. The disc means so much more. The lyrics aren't always obvious, and you're constantly discovering new parts to the story you didn't notice the first time round. Listening to the doctor speak at the beginning and end of the disc also sheds a more obvious light on the sometimes abstract ramblings of the patient. All in all, well worth the $10 I got the disc for at warped. It's worth it for anyone picking it up here too, just make sure you give it more than one listen before you judge."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"What happened? I guess this proves you cant assign one particular genre to every band, and this female voice is becoming a cliche; not that there is anything wrong with that. If you are a fan of Boys Night Out you should probably listen to samples of the CD before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you liked old boysnightout then stay well away from this album","review":"First off the lyrics and idea for how this album is portrayed is well thought of but to me it appears that the band has thought too much about the lyrical content and not enough about the music, quite frankly it's boring. The one track I liked and still like off this album is purging because my mind just cannot escape the sound of the female keyboardists voice, it's innocent and sweet. I just cannot understand why the band felt they had to part with the sound they used to have the concept would of worked out exactly the same with the old formula but they took the pop out of the heardcore/pop and threw away the speed. This band used to be a nice different sounding experience now they just sound like thousands of other bands that are churned out of record labels daily. I find the title somewhat of a pun \\"train wreck\\" just about as much fun as one."},{"rating":"1","title":"shame!!on u guys","review":"there first and second album rocked hardcore rockedand they follow up with this I'm so disappiointed I'm gonna stop write>>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing better than primary sources...","review":"If you have any interest in what it is like to live in a society run by a socialist-led government, this book will give you a good idea of what the average person's experience was like.

I am a huge Big Al fan and perhaps my expectations were too high. I was very, very disappointed. The story was stilted and you do not have an opportunity to 'fall in love' with Shrimpy, so the story was flat and evoked little sympathy and emotion. I am teacher for students that are also Big Al fanatics and I didn't even read it to them.

Be prepared to be helping out a lot for the younger kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"Her Interactive's series continues with this latest entry, another one taken from one of the classic books. This one is on the scary side, with mysterious noises, dark tunnels, ominous warnings, and a plethora of creepies that all strike at 3:15 a.m., for some reason.Be forewarned, however: This game is harder than the others, with more difficult puzzles and fewer in-game hints available. (Neither of Nancy's hint-spewing friends is available, which in some ways is a good thing -- their hints were usually vague and their personalities annoying.) You may very well need a walkthrough to manage all the puzzles, especially if you don't play a lot of these games.Game play is smooth and intelligent, as always. Graphics are charming and clear, without being masterpieces. The writing and acting are fine, though the not-quite-convincing English voices get a little old.

Boy was I wrong! This game was full of tasks! I was going back and forth and still progressing slowly in the game. The plot was boring and I wouldn't think that even a teenager would find it fun, much less a child. There was very little to explore in this game, and you ran back and forth and had to do mundane puzzles to finish the game. And the game was a bit... creepy. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.

I didn't see the game, but from what I gather from their comments, there was a scary thing floating over Nancy's bed. It scared them so bad that they came screaming and running into my living room. It terrified them so much that they didn't want to go to bed alone last night. All three of my children ended up sleeping together in a bed with many lights on.I would say this is not a family friendly game, and I am not sure why they would make such a thing for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I found this game to be boring and the graphics so-so.

There is no option for adjusting screen resolution and anyone who has a monitor larger than 15 inches will be terribly disappointed. As this is the 11th game in the series, and fairly recent, it is a shame HerInteractive decided everyone probably has a 5 to 7 year old computer with an inferior graphics card. Even if the game is excellent, the graphics are totally unworthy. Their website offers no solution and does not even address the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing gaming experience","review":"After playing four other EXCELLENT Nancy Drew games, imagine my shock and dismay after having tried to get into this one. Being in agreement with the other reviewer, I am extremely disappointed that HerInteractive, a company which has put out so many wonderfully family-friendly games, would infuse this one with so much dark and innapropriate subject matter, such as witchcraft, astrology, mysticism and the occult. Not at all what I was expecting, I am sorry to report. My recommendation is to stay far away from this game and the harmful content that it contains."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is getting very annoying!!!!!!!!","review":"This will be the third review I wrote!

I still recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I have never played a game like this before so I'm not sure how it would rate compared to other such games, hence the 4 stars.

Yes, graphics are great, but there is no direction of what I need to achieve; I fumbled from room to room repeatedly, then figured out I have to make my own checklist; no map to jump quickly from one location to another; I just gave up initially, but will try again later. Not thrilled with having to get a walkthrough from other sites just to play some of the games. I like to figure things out myself, not rely on a walkthrough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, fun, challenging!","review":"The coolest storyline and graphics amongst the ND games, in my opinion, BUT the puzzles can be quite challenging. Took me a long time to finish the game. I had to use the ND website for many clues, but I am not the savviest game player anyway. Definitely worth the time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good first choice","review":"This is not a good first choice for a novice gamer nor is it a good first choice for a Nancy Drew computer game. The clues are so vague they are almost non-existant. Somethings can only be done at certain times and I would never have known anything without the \\"cheats\\" posted on the internet. Even the cheats are confusing. I am very sorry I wasted my funds on a game I am not able to play. No more Nancy Drew for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't play this game","review":"I have downloaded many games from Amazon, and never had a problem - till now. I simply can't play this game. The cursor freezes for long monments, but even more irritating, the dialog seems to get stuck, like a broken record. The dialog repeats itself over and over. I haven't been able to get past the intro. Has anyone else had this problem with it? I even tried uninstalling and re-downloading the game. No Dice. I don't have a really super gaming machine, but I do have Win 7 with 4GB ram and everything else runs great on it. So sad, I really wanted to try this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy But Cool","review":"This game was good in a certain fashion.

Still playing it... I have enjoyed other Nancy Drew games, but this is the best so far: long gameplay, lots to discover, lots of nice and interesting puzzles to solve that are not so hard that you need to use a walkthrough constantly... 5 thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A review from a 10 year old girl","review":"I played this game with my dad and my cousin, we thought it would be a lot of fun, but it turned out to be close to impossible for us, even my dad. Getting through the maze, even with cheats, was incredibly hard and you need to do it many times. It says ages 10 and up. but it should say ages 20 and up , the only way to beat the game is with the cheats. Some of the game you play with the little girl are fun, but some just drive you crazy, and require way too much knowledge of astrology and chemistry and rune reading. for younger kids I would recommend a game like Shadow ranch which was easier and less scary. My little cousin (age 8) freaked out because it was so scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring-not spooky- blackmoor manor","review":"i have played all of the nancy drew games before and was really looking foward to this one. but it turned out to be a big disapointment. it is NOT that scary, and it leaves too many unanswered questions after you solve the mystery. there is so many puzzles that you have to figure out that after awhile you forget what the purpose of the puzzle was. the manor could have had alot more rooms to explore, and you only got to talk to some of the characters a few times. hopefully the next game, the secret of the old clock, will be much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Game For All","review":"You've already heard about how great this game is from other reveiewers, so I don't need to say much. I'd like to say one thing though. Most people think this game is just for preteen girls. But, that's not true. Curse of Blackmoor Manor, along with all the other Nancy Drew Games are games that are for all ages. From children to elderly, including men! I promise you these games will become a part of you. Once you start it's impossible to get them off your mind. You will become addicted! Curse of Blackmoor Manor is no exception. I am a male, one of my friends had me try one, and I have become a huge fan! It doesn't matter if you're male, I didn't think I'd like it either. I didn't want to play this dumb little girl game! But I played it, and now I can't stop! Men! You have to try this game! It's for you too! Believe me, it will be worth your time!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was OK...","review":"Ok I played this game and it was OK in the beginning but as you progress through the game it gets very boring and I admit the puzzles were kind of purplexing but not as hard as Her Interactive reported it being and it was also NOT as scary as Her Interactive said it would be either... So my conclusion is that The Curse of Blackmoor Manor was a cheesy game, and you SHOULD think twice before purchasing this game from Amazon or anywhere else... If you want a scary Nancy Drew Software Game than I reccomend either The Final Scene or The Message in the Haunted Mansion..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique treat for Air Supply fans","review":"I loved Air Supply when I was a kid in the '80s. In college I grew to love acoustic music. These days it seems everyone is making acoustic versions of their old songs. But this does exactly what any \\"remake\\" should - it makes the songs BETTER. If you're not a fan of unplugged, acoustic music, it might not be your cup of tea. But I found that stripping away all of the extra, plugged in instrumentation (especially the ones that tended to be somewhat bombastic - though I loved those bombastic ballads as a kid), lets the messages of the songs be revealed in a tender, touching way. A delightful album.From all out of Love - \\"I'm lying alone with my head on the phone, thinking of you 'til it hurts. I know you hurt too but what else can we do? Tormented and torn apart\\". I could never make out that last phrase on the original pop recording! LOL. Again, the stripped down bare way of singing this makes it even more poignant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the title fool you!","review":"In my \\"humble\\" opinion, the characters were one dimensional, not very likeable, and quite comical.The product name dropping was annoying. I expected more from Ms. Nelson since her non-fiction works are very good. This book, however, was, simply put, \\"Silly!\\" It was as though payment would be received by the word and there were many unnecessary words to describe simple things. After several attempts, I had to chock it up as a lost. Definitely borrow this book from a friend, enemy or the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable......","review":"I place the blame firmly on myself for buying a book recommended by Essence magazine.

I read the whole bole. The subject matter was interesting and I was curious as to how it would be treated. The sex parts were boring and somewaht trite. The characters were one dimensional and could have been developed more. The actions in the book were so unbelievable that I thought there was going to be some type of trick at the end. I got this book from the library and I am glad I did. Jill, you got talent but the fictional writing needs some work. Keep at it girl. The one positive thing about the book is that it did make you think about yourself as a sexual being that has a need to be respected and cared for always."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe It's Me","review":"I only got to like page 20 of this book. It didn't hold me at all. Usually I read a book in its entirety, but being that I have other books waiting on me, like Nervous by Zane (review coming soon), I decided to pass on this book.Maybe this book was good, but it was so slow in the beginning that I didn't have the patience to wait on the juice.Sorry Jill Nelson, but pick up the pace next time.Later!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexual Hurting","review":"I loved the concept of the book. I hated the presentation. The book had too many characters, was wordy, and not even entertaining.Jill Nelson should have hung out with some 40-something sistas to get the lingo right. She tried to hard to make them hype and they came off fake.Fiction is not real but dang at least make it interesting.I think Ms. Nelson should stay with non-fiction and/or write about her generation and what they really are going through.Lord have mercy this book gave me a headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Okay! I thought this book was Awesome! I loved it! It made me laugh! I was thrilled that these incredible sisters stepped out of the traditional boxes that we all live in! I say Bravo to Ms. Nelson. She can certainly weave a tight story. She writes with a crispness that kept me up all night until I completed the book.....Come now....not too many things keep me awake and having fun all at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"I thought this book was HORRIBLE. I didn't even finish it and can not recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexual Healing? How about dysfunction.","review":"I was severely disappointed in this book. After reading the synopsis, I thought I'd be in for a delightfully, funny read. This book droned on and on and never caught my attention. The story line has possibilities, but between the one dimensional characters, the product placment overkill and the superfluous chatter between the characters, it was lost. Every other chapter had a poorly devised erotic scene and more banter between the characters. I gave up halfway through this book and took it back to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexual Blah...","review":"This book was really disappointing, especially since I'd read a lot of raving reviews online. It was often dull and tedious to get through, with lots of lengthy unnecessary designer product descriptions. The dialogue seemed odd and unrealistic to me, but maybe that's because I'm only 28 and the characters are in their 40s. Anyway, while the concept was cool (a discrete and tasteful full-service spa and brothel for black women) the execution fell flat. And for all the book's promise of this revolutionary, liberating approach to black women's sexuality, it turned out to be nothing more than a standard-issue supermarket romance novel, minus the romance. If you want to read about men \\"eatin' that pie\\" and \\"finding your love nugget\\" by all means, pick this book up. Otherwise, I'd advise you to skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I get ya, but...","review":"Ok, so I get some of you out there that felt the book was drawn out a little. But they way I see it, is that the entire story was well developed and therefore what they are assuming is drawn out is just the development of the characters. These characters weren't shallow and the business concept itself needed to be wroked out. Not sure if you noticed, but this really could be a business venture. If you have partook in any business venture you'll enjoy that piece alone. It is slow to start, but once it has you, IT has you! Happy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yellow Pages for a foreign resident","review":"Laid out alphabetically by subject, this book is of some help for the English-speaking foreign resident of Seoul or its environs.

I found myself returning to season one especially Requiem which is by far the best episode of the first 2 seasons. I just had to add it to my DVD collection. I've loved Amanda Tapping since her Stargate days, and Robin Dunne is great on the eyes. The stories are very well written, and none of your B movie type stuff. I'm not always big on SciFi, mainly SG1, and X-files, but this series has made my must have list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and well written,atmospheric show.","review":"This is a very good show.It is well written and acted with subtle plotting.After the first few episodes it quickly finds its feet.Very entertaining.If you are looking for something a little different then this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sanctuary Season One","review":"I am a great fan of the SciFi genre and especially of Stargate and Stargate Atlantis.Unfortunately, Amanda Tapping does not shine in this series. The accent that she affects is very off-putting. The individual shows are very slow to develop and don't have very much oomph.The series saving grace is the fact that it is shot entirely in front of a green screen but has not overwhelmed viewers. In fact, most times you forget that it the show is so heavily special effects. Although, even some of those special effects are questionable. The mermaid is slightly fuzzy and doesn't appear to focus on the person she is interacting with.I'm hoping that the second season will improve but if it doesn't this will mean that I won't be returning.Sanctuary: The Complete First Season"},{"rating":"1","title":"Torchwood 'wanna-be'","review":"The premise for Sanctuary is exactly the same as the British series \\"Torchwood\\" and very similar to \\"Threshold\\" another \\"let's protect the aliens among us from the bad US Gov't\\" show. If that topic appeals to you then you might like this show. The characters are all likeable but I found the stories slow, and uninvolving--its just a matter of taste.

Bad acting, bad special effects (beyond bad) and plots that are so thin you can predict each step along the way. Season 1 was worse than Season 2, but it's like comparing two piles of garbage that are rotting in the sun...which one smells worse?It was a terrific concept (santuary for all) that was executed poorly. In Season 2, Will seems to be told \\"ok, act tough here\\" so he leaves his lower lip hanging as though seeing his teeth tells us that he's now a rough and buff toughie.Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"drum pad","review":"I have 6 year old son and he's really enjoying the drum pad .

That means if you have a widescreen TV, you get letterbox on all four sides of a small picture - letterbox on the sides because the pictures on the DVDs is really 4:3 (not 16:9), and letterbox on the top and bottom because it's part of the DVD picture. Some widescreen TVs can \\"zoom\\" this to fill a widescreen TV, but you're just throwing away resolution that way.It's even more insulting because the MENUS are anamorphic widescreen! The quality of the over-the-air HDTV broadcasts are much better than this DVD set. Had I known it was not anamorphic, I would not have purchased it.

The story's center is an ongoing analysis of what is wrong with House. The viewer keeps hoping for a cure."},{"rating":"2","title":"This summer's 'gotta have'!","review":"He is mean, sarcastic, caustic even! But Dr House is also brilliant and always right! He isn't the nice soft doctors we are used to seeing on the screen. He doesn't do the pleasant patient touchy-feely thing. But what he does do, is make them better - regardless of what it takes. Convention be blowed! And feelings be trodden on!This is seriously compelling viewing - I defy anyone not to buy this series and not watch every episode at least twice!All the supporting cast are very good - but Hugh Laurie shines through as a real star and who could not fail to be intimidated when glared at by those icy blue eyes!Buy it - watch it - love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear God, keep it coming!","review":"I absolutely love this show!!!

However, as I continued to watch each week, it occured to me that every single episode of this show is virtually identical: A patient comes in who House immediately diagnoses with a common illness. But guess what? It isn't a common illness! It is in fact the most obscure and farfetched explanation possible, and in the process of finding this out, House will break protocol, alienate his superiors, and almost lose his job, all for the sake of saving the patient. End. While this isn't necessairly a bad plot, seeing it over and over and over is rather formulaic and it is easy for your attention to wane. The only real reason to watch this show is for Laurie's sarcasm, but I get enough of that from my kids already."},{"rating":"2","title":"House Season One","review":"The DVDs arrived on a timely basis, nothing was wrong with the packaging or the discs themselves.Thoroughly enjoyed them."},{"rating":"1","title":"bastante molesta por el producto.....","review":"Lamento informar que cuando realizé la compra el pasado mes de mayo del presente año, el DVD de Dr House temporada #6 llegó con tres de los 5 Cds que trae la caja, no tenian NADA de peliculas, no vino rayado, ni golpeado, sólo que no tenian NADA de NADA gravados el CD 1, 3 y 5.....osea que perdí mi dinero en un producto que ni lo chequearon.....lamento decvir que vivo en Venezuela y se hace imposible por mi parte mandarles de vuelta su producto malo, porque me va a salir mas caro......tendré que comprar otro igual a ver que tal resulta.....que rabia me da!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad service","review":"I ordered two dvds and only got one of the dvds.

House is a rude, egotistical MD with about as much acting ability as a a stool sample. The writing is so lame they would have been better off to just overdub Godzilla scripts rather than to subject us to their horrible wit.Avoid this turkey like the plague.

My review is not a statement on the show itself but on this poor dvd release."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great new series","review":"This show proves that good characters can make a show. It is essentially a procedural show with background drama. The plotlines have more or less been seen before, but don't take that as a negative right away. By now most stories have been done and it's impossible not to find corollaries.What makes this show is the actors and their chemistry. Most of the characters have been fairly fleshed out and are distinct, not the cookie cutter variety we see in most shows.The writing also makes this show stand out. Dialog is fast paced at times, and very witty. Some people complain that house is to mean, and yes he is, but that is part of his character. Revel in it and you will find the joy in this show.I would strongly recommend this show to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"House is by far one of the best shows on TV.

Great writing, great acting, and the most delightfully snarky protagonist you can imagine. OK, the medicine is sometimes a bit off, and occasionally story arcs persist a bit longer than necessary (eg., the Vogler entanglement). But the show is smart and funny, and assumes its viewers are not idiots. And Hugh Laurie, in the title role, is absolutely compelling.The added features are fun -- interviews, tour of the set. The only thing that was not included, that I wish was included, was the unaired version of the pilot episode. As you may recall, DVDs of the pilot were distributed in TV Guides, and these versions of the pilot contained some scenes that were not in the aired pilot. Not a big deal, but it would have been an obvious choice for a special feature -- if not the whole episode, then at least the deleted scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"House","review":"I love this series!!!! I know that a lot of people when they first heared about it, thought that it was going to be a knock off of E.R. But House, M.D. takes it one step further. There is no other show like it.

So why did Universal give the DVD release such slipshod treatment?The series was shot in High-Definition. The DVD box is labeled \\"Widescreen 1.78:1\\". Yet these DVDs are scaled down to the width of a 4:3 picture, losing 36% of the visual detail of an anamorphic DVD. The video looks like a postage stamp on widescreen TVs--thick black borders on all four sides!. What were they thinking? Was this a technical screw-up or was Universal so desperate to squeeze it onto three DVD's that they just threw quality out the window? I can't believe executive producer Bryan Singer would have signed off on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe people are supporting this!","review":"It blows my mind that people would encourage Universal's carelessness by buying this inferior product.

There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of laziness in this day and age. Anamorphic content has been available for OVER A DECADE NOW! Furthermore, it costs the studio nothing to process the video in this manner and it creates a better picture for everyone (not just 16x9 TV owners).If you are a fan of the series, do everyone a favor and don't cave and buy this DVD set until they release it in IT'S ORIGINAL (AND INTENDED) FORMAT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, but a problem.","review":"I ordered House (Season One) and enjoyed it.

Instead of playing Three Stories, it skipped to the middle of Honeymoon. I wasn't too upset and just decided to trade it in, but the second one I got did the same thing.Other than that, great buy, great show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Widescreen owners BEWARE!","review":"Anyone planning on watching this on an HDTV or other widescreen needs to know that season 1 was issued as 4:3 letterbox DVDs. This means that instead of filling your screen, the picture will be the proper ratio only taking up about the middle 3rd of your screen. Otherwise, it will be stretched too far wide.Also, maybe I'm just sooo used to the HD on TV, but the quality of this master is horrible. All of my other movie DVDs look much better. There is very noticable noise in the blacks (and all colors) on season 1. I should note that my setup is calibrated and I have NO macroblocking issues.It is a HUGE SHAME that they butchered such a fantastic series when putting it on DVD. I'd rather watch a 4:3 Seinfeld on my HDTV anyday.

I had only known him as Bertie Wooster in the Jeeves and Wooster comedies. I had my doubts as to whether he could handle a role that was so totally different from what I usually associated with him.But, my reservations were quickly swept aside as I watched him take on this incredibly funny, and yet quite often, tragic role of Dr. Gregory House. I've never seen a more moving portrayal of a deeply flawed human being, struggling with drug addiction, constant physical pain, and a cynical, caustic outlook on life. My congratulations to the cast, creators , and writers of this show---this one is a real winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show, hate the box set though","review":"I love House. It's a great show, but I'm not here to review the show. I'm here to talk about the season 1 box set. I was lucky to get it for an excellent bargain, because now that I have it I'm a little miffed. My major complaint is that these are double sided discs. They are so very easy to scratch. It's hard to hold the dvds without touching at least one side of them. I've already gotten a tiny scratch on one of the discs that now makes one scene skip. I don't even know how it happened. My advice is not to buy these until you have the capability of copying them. Then I would store away the originals. I hope with future releases they will have normal one-sided discs. My other (much smaller) complaint is that there is a lack of bonus materials. There are some, but I was hoping for a little more.

Dr. House is witty, intellectual, and a brilliant doctor. However, he's also rude, blunt, and very sarcastic. Ha, I love this guy, the acting is very good and it almost never comes off as being too much like shows in CSI, or Lost. House is truly a unique character, and is also more developed then a lot of leading characters on telveision today.

Season 1 is the pinnacle of great writing, great acting, and learning the secrets and stories of these most fascinating characters. We learn why House walks with a cane, we learn Cameron was married, Foreman broke into someone's house when he was 16. This all mixed with witty Houseisms,friendships, lovers and all done realistically and dramtically well. Lets also not forget lying patients, medical mysteries, and Vicadon. I love an antihero pill popping, brillant but cowardly doctor. This show is about charachters and Season 1 is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a marvelous serie!","review":"This serie is just wonderful.

A cynical and sarcastic man who doesn't gives a damm about what peopple thinks about him. Drug addict and anti people, House is just a man trying to protect himself while expressing things as he sees them, with no addendos or intentions of softening the words.The serie is great, and I don't know if it's for him or independently of him...There are some episodes that doesn't left you untouched, that appeal to some part of you that make you connected to the people who's suffering, even afterwards you have turned TV off.I think this serie is innovative in the area of medical series, and also think is a must have or a must see! ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ok","review":"I have not had time to review this item yet, but it arrived in perfect condition and apparently in good shape.

He is ascerbic, caustic, and has the bed side manner of an SS Oberfuerher. If you have the misfortune to be under his care (mainly because you have a desease that no one else can identify, not to mention cure), his manner will make you want to commit homicide before you sucumb. But, when it comes to pulling life out of the jaws of death, he's the best there is. Laurie is well buttressed by a marvelous supporting cast and a staff of top notch writers.

House, M.D. is one of the greatest shows I've ever seen and is probably my favorite medical show (even compared to E.R.). Dr. House is funny and sarcastic and the same time which makes you attached to him from the start. I started watching this from the season premiere and I loved the first episode. He is addicted to his pain reducing pills but after a few episodes the show doesn't really revolve on his drug habit but more on the cases. Even on of his colleagues (Dr. Cameron) likes Dr. House but Dr. House resists her attempts to make him enjoy a date with her. Instead House is still attached to his ex-wife. There's even a few episodes when the hospital got a huge contribution from Volger who soon wants House to fire someone just because he hates how House acts and he wants to ruin him! This season is a great one and I cannot wait until season 2! Watch this show now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"4 stars for show, 2 for dvd set","review":"I love this show. The second season was a 5 star as far as I'm concerned. The writing and the acting is tremendous, and if grading on a curve, it's perfect to me. The dvd package seems very good but those double-sided dvds just didn't play well and have already given out on us after a few viewings. NO GOOD FOLKS. I have the second season on the way, I think they are one sided so hopefully that won't be a problem. I can't recommend this 1st season set though. Cross tape or burn copies. They don't last.

To me that is just plain cheap!! The dvds get fingerprints on them and scratched up SO much more quickly, it's annoying. For the money I paid for this dvd collection it should have separate disks, instead of dual side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, greater star","review":"This new drama has it all: strong story-telling, complex and witty scripts, intelligent acting by a roster of compelling performers, and a gutsy, mesmerizing turn by British actor Hugh Laurie in the title role.

It explained a lot about who everyone was, where they are coming from, and why they are the way they are. I thought it was helpful also to understand some of the medical terminology and know what the abbreviations stand for. I would have liked maybe a bit more information on the backgrounds of the characters, but that doesn't keep very much in the tradition of the show, where we learn about the characters as we go through the seasons, much as you would learn about collegues.

Even so, Steamboat... is not bad and the music is (if I remember well) the same as in Kino's edition. The General looks a bit fuzzier, the music is old jazz and not really related to the action, but not bad. If you take in consideration that this DVD is being sold for around a dollar... I think it's worth it. Still... to appreciate Keaton at his best, buy the Kino editions.6-15-06 P.S.: Well, I see they finally put the title to this DVD. Mission accomplished... ¿¿¿????

The 'book' is based mostly on lindstrom's perception of the truth and on the 'writer's' speculation about Miss Bergman's behaviour during her life. It is pathetic. There were parts where I couldn't help laughing out loud because it was sooooooo obvious that what was written was a delusion of the writer.

He pays scant attention to Venice's Adriatic possessions and does not always even seem to have a basic grasp of geography. As for Venice's all-important relations with Constantinople, he is completely at sea. But after looking at his dreadful history of the Byzantine Empire, one could expect nothing better.

The opinionated tone is maddening -- who cares if this author thinks a Doge from the 9th century was dull, incompetant, feckless or brilliant?

The color is NOT bright red or a red hot, it turned out more like a weird brick color, it was only slightly red( more of a weird brown-ish red color) I can say that i will never buy this color again, and i really hope the collection isn't like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this DVD!!!!!","review":"I would rate this as zero stars but Amazon do not give this as an option. There is little or no Flamenco or Bellydance on this very low production value piece. The dancing of either style is very limited with some OK moves in the flamenco and one adequet bellydancer. I know and love both these dance styles and am angry that there are those who put themselves forward as dancers and charge for productions such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur, Mediocre Flamenco Dancing","review":"I only got through the first 15 minutes of the DVD so i can't speak for the rest. I don't know much about Bellydancing but I have studied Flamenco and have seen plenty of professional Flamenco productions on film. I feel cheated by this DVD. I thought it was going to be a professional production but it looks to me like some amateur dancers got together and decided to make a videa. At least the Flamenco dancing is mediocre. If you're looking for quality dancing, you're not going to find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new outlook on diving","review":"This book takes a fresh look at the adventure of diving, discovery, and dive travel in every American state.

I learn about different areas, where to go and what the culture was like. Specificly I found the section on \\"women traveling to Dubai\\" very helpful.

I say \\"borrows\\", but it is more like cut and pasted. That is to say, most of the information in the book is also available in other previously published documentation fromvarious sources. Still, if you prefer not to thumb through those horrible telephony standards docs, it is handy to have this book around. It covers some stuff like AAL2 better than other recent books (mostly because this book lifts information from standards docs and uses it as is!), so it is useful in that way. Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"He is the true history of the American people in his time.\\"","review":"Mr. Barrett, the author, was both a contemporary and strong partisan of his subject. His book is a product of its time, 1865. Nonetheless, it contains many interesting passages about a number of subjects still argued over. As examples, General McCellan is reported on in detail (and excoriated) and the war powers of a president under the U.S. Constitution are discussed in length, given the pointed criticism President Lincoln received for suspending the writ of habeas corpus.I greatly enjoyed the full text that is often provided of President Lincoln's statements and addresses.While pages on the detail of certain battles will be wearying for the modern reader, this book should be owned and read by every serious student of Abraham Lincoln."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend it.","review":"Big, a lot of polital mumbo jumo I don't know or care about, I just wanted a book telling of him growing and his wife and kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men's watch?","review":"If you have not seen this product in person, be prepared. This is the size of a traditional woman's watch. I am not sure what Nike considers \\"midsize,\\" but this does not seem to qualify as such in my book. I immediately sent it back and had to eat the postage for returning it. I had an Oregon that I liked very much and it fit perfectly. I didn't realize that I had what Nike considers the \\"super\\" size of watches. Moral of the story, pictures don't lie per se, but they don't always show the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool watch but band breaks","review":"This is a great watch in many ways and draws a lot of attention.

Time to go to something less sexy and more practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Nike watch that FELL APART in a few months....","review":"I love this design and the features were what I needed. Too bad the band fell apart from the watch body within a few months. I mailed it back to NIKE and they just put it back in another envelope and mailed it back to me. Just the watch in an envelope without any explanation. I was a fool an bought another Nike watch and it was supposed to be waterproof and within 6 months it fogged up. Get smart and spend some money on a real watch. Nike products are designed great but put together terribly...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bulky; band broke","review":"I got about a year out of this watch. The band broke, and because of the way that the band is part of the watch, it cannot be replaced. There was no sudden strike that caused the break. It just basically wore out. Also, for a sport watch, it is very thick and heavy. It's usable but not a great watch, and it doesn't hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!!!","review":"I purchased this item, and it was delivered to me today. I would excercise caution when buying this particular item ... because it is not the same as the item in the picture. It is the new version which features Darth Vader's helmet coming off revealing Anakin Skywalker... it also has a differant stand from \\"Return of the Jedi\\", and not the base shown in the picture which is from \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\". Be carefull, and make sure you get what you want when you order... Good luck everyone! ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense Rock that blows you away","review":"If you are not familiar with James Blood Ulmer, you are certainly missing an important artist in your collection. This particular albumn is his best work though I would recommend some of his other albumns as well. With Calvin Weston as one of two drummers, the music drives forward at a frenetic pace, while Ulmer dives in and out with short riffs. Irene Datcher, who sings on a few of the cuts with the gravel voiced Ulmer, has the vocal power to rise above the busy music and is a real stand out. When it comes to guitar mastery, James Blood Ulmer should be better known. Pay particular attention to his work with the waw waw pedel. This album is not for the faint of heart, Ulmer's melding of Harmonolodic Jazz (a la Coleman) and rock takes some listening effort. I suggest that the listener relax and focus on James' Guitar as the rest of the band comes at you like a steamroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From This Product Please!","review":"Worst product ever.

It was to their favor so I didn't worry about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for your kids","review":"Hey this is probably one of the worse DVDs you can find. I figured I would buy it because it would be good to just have for my kids. I do own 20,000 leagues under the sea, and also Totoro, and other kid's dvds.Okay I admit, I enjoy watching toons in general. But this was probably one of the worst! It has too much adult story for it to be a child's movie, and yet not enough production quality for it to be a decent movie. The animation is so bad I have seen 1950's cartoons with better animation. It reminds of me of those Christian cartoons designed to teach the bible. But at least those have a purpose. This dvd doesn't.I recommend you select an alternative dvd to this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"While I was originally happy with these chairs, after 3 months the chairs are proving to be very cheaply made and are cracking.

I was very excited to assemble them when they arrived. It was fairly easy to put them together, but the hardwares that came with were low quality. You pretty much have to do it right the first time as the hexagon wrench screw turn into round! I was very happy when I got them put together. They looked great with my table, however after using them for 2 weeks, the chairs were wobbly and the screws were loose. I tightened them, no big deal. However, after 3 weeks of using them, while my 8 yr.old son was sitting on it, one of the chair's foot broke at the corner where the screws meet. My son was alright, but the chair was not. It is now in the basement waiting to be trashed.Bottomline not recommended for use with kids. Looks great but not sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"picture not exactly what we received","review":"The picture shows that there are supports between the legs on each side. We wanted that as it's nice to use them as a foot rest. Ours did not come with this and it's not that pieces are missing... just a different chair. The fabric wasn't exactly as shown either.

I don't know what the materials are that are in this wonderful speaker, but the small size of the radio does nothing to this giant sounding machine.

Talonsoft had a very good game in their Battleground series that had all of the things that another reviewer was looking for (some semblance of history!). I was very, very disappointed, thinking that Talonsoft had been resurrected and the Battleground game improved but found this in its stead. I enjoyed the Battleground Civil War games (Gettysburg, Shiloh, Bull Run, and Chickamauga). Outside of the title, this game bears no resemblance to those games. Talonsoft's tactical games (East Front 2, West Front, Rising Sun and Divided Ground) were excellent, but they are not even supported anymore on the Web. Definitely a waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its ok, worth buying","review":"This game has pretty good graphics for a cvil war strategy game.

There is no story just great visuals and music to relax and immerse youself into: After a hard day at work, great to come home, turn down the lights, turn up the sound and enjoy the experience.

Business actually has scientific principles governing it. The only way to make money with business is to pull out more money than you put in. The book does not describe how to go about doing this. It makes some fanciful overtures, but in the end, all it is doing is describing some lucky dice rollers. These people got lucky. Their success is luck and won't apply to you. The rest of the book is advertising. If you want a quick way to make money, affiliate programs are the only means to make it happen. Even most of those are [junk].

In between these nauseating self promotions is advice such as \\"when dealing with a commercial lender, try to negotiate a lower interest rate.\\" DUUUHHHH!!! I never would have thought of that!

Mr. Hicks does hit on important concepts, such as leveraging and no-money down deals, and definitely stresses importance and usefulness, but never gets into the nitty-gritty details of doing it. I felt like the whole book was a \\"fleshed-out\\" table-of-contents, with the main items, but no meat to how to get it done.There are plenty of good books out there, I would suggest getting one of them instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT waste your money","review":"Readers, If you are curious about real estate investing, then take my word for it, this book is NOT what you are looking for.The author spends the whole time pretty much giving you a pep talk about just getting out and and making offers to people for a hundred percent plus in financing and while im not saying that you couldnt get that, I am saying that this book does not tell you anything that a little common sense wouldnt tell you. And common sense is free. Plus the whole book is like one big plug for the authors other businesses that hes trying to sell you. I felt like I paid money for an infomercial!!!!

Even if they are legitimately helpful tools, who wants to take the chance?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not realistic using his method","review":"At the end of the book he gives you the plan to make it. It boils down to finding extreme good deal one after another in increasing value and using the equity of the last deal to finance the next one within a month repeatedly. Extreme good deals like those may happen a few times in your life and it is possible but expect to visit over 600 properties in between before finding them and give yourself a couple years in between not one month to prospect.

Is this guy for real????He also spends too much time talking about his testimonial letters from the people who have tried and succeeded with his methods. Furthermore, he finds every opportunity to mention his get rich quick newsletter with the hopes that you will subscribe.On a serious note, my advice to you is to stay away from this book!

The entire book is peppered with similiar profound insight. I wonder how the people who unsuccessfully tried to build a million-dollar fortune but ended up declaring bankruptcy felt?

This book was so disappointing that I can not justify the purchase of it an will be returning this book. There are other books that are more worthy of your hard earned dollar. Sorry for such a negative review, but this was truly a worthless book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"The book is basically one big ad.

Now that I've actually sat down to read it I can say that this book is useless, vague, and a waste of paper.Approximately seventy-five percent of the book is either a testimonial of someone stating that a particular money method worked for them or an attempt to get the reader to subscribe to the author's newsletter or his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not rate this 0 stars, so I chose one star.","review":"This book is really THAT bad. I finished reading the book and I know very little more than when I started! This is literally an infomercial in a book. The instructions are so vague it is not funny and the author constantly refers you to his previous book for more details! What I learned in his book was: 1. Buy his newsletter for $24 a year. 2. If you want to be succesful, buy his two books for $90 each. 3. If you want actual details, buy his previous book. You may think I'm making mountains out of ant hills, but trust me. Read the first two chapters in the book store and you will see. Even his valued letters, sent from several of his faitful readers, were thanking him for his previous book and not this one! Do yourself a favor. Stay away from this book and look for one with actual steps. This one is so vague that I learned much more in two hours of reading Internet forums than I did reading this book.

From the front cover to back, Mr. Hicks repeats over and over \\"how to make Millions in real estate with no cash,\\" but does not exactly show how to go about doing it.

Instead the reader is encouraged to a.)subscribe to his newsletter b.) buy his \\"special reports\\" to get the answers. It just like getting bombarded with pop-up ads, but they're in print and WON'T GO AWAY.Another hilarious suggestion offered up: if you don't have a computer to access the Internet, try your local Boy Scout or Girl Scout troop.

I don't feel that this DVD is for beginners. It is way too advanced and she does not go into any detail to explain the poses, plus her voice is taped over the segments.I like exercise DVD's where the instructors' voice is talking throughout the DVD like you are in a yoga class in your own living room, she does not do this.Actually the thing I find the most distracting and unprofessional is her choice of clothing for the sun portion of the DVD. .... Desiree is a beautiful, very well endowed woman and her yoga top is cut just way too low. Others may not have a problem with it, but I certainly don't think it honors her as a yoga instructor. Maybe it was done to increase sales? Fortunately the second half of the DVD she has on a different top, so no problem there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga For men, Noooo??? ... Um Yes!","review":"I have always thought to myself Yoga is for women. I'm a man I must lift Heavy weight and I must be strong and not do girly exercises. Well what a mistake. Desi makes it easy to follow in this DVD as you need to sort of watch the TV as you do it and she does it well (no punt intended). After a couple times of doing the workout I found myself able to just follow along without looking and at a pace that any beginner can enjoy and do. Being from a predominantly Hispanic area I found the Spanglish to my liking. Desi takes you on a peaceful journey that not only makes you feel great physically but mentally and spiritually at peace.

In addition, the novel under the same name written by Jules Vernue, enchanted my whole life when I was young. This title with 40 minutes running time in DTS/Dolby Digital format is a total disappointment. First of all, the movie squeezed the great story down to 40 minute nonsense. There is no inspiration or excitement I got from reading the original novel. You can never have any kind of Disney style amusement. Neither DTS or DD track gives you any quality sound you may expect from an average DVD. It is just loud!

On the plus side the receiver is quite sensitive. The unit has a good appearance and feel of the controls is good. It would also be nice if the AC supply was contained within the unit.

I'll see articles and even covers on other sources that were not on my Kindle and not only is there no explanation, but you can't get any help fro either Amazon or Kindle. Basically it's a huge rip-off, if you want Atlantic then just get a regular subscription and let the Morons who produce the issue for the Kindle get their act together.Also, how cheap is Atlantic in cutting to 10 issues a year?

You have to resize it in order to read without straining your eyes.Unfortunately, using the touch screen to move from column to column is difficult.

This documentary visits a number of the remaining artifacts of the border and does a good job of telling stories about the conditions and procedures along the way.

So, I have no way of knowing if it would help him or not. I had high hopes for this product, but if he won't take it, he won't take it. He takes other vitamins just fine--multis, vitamin C, omega-3 and a similar product to this one by another manufacturer. I tasted it and couldn't see what the big deal was. He usually isn't picky. I wasn't able to really elucidate if it was just the taste or the way the wafer made him feel. Hard to get a kid of this age to really pinpoint such things."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!!","review":"I just had to come back and write a review. My second grader is struggling in school. She is about a year behind in reading. She has a lot of energy and she gets distracted very easily. I knew she wasn't in the \\"medication\\" catagory but finding something that might help rather it be diet, supplements, etc. I found through research that the Attentive Child and the Carlson for Kids DHA was a great combination. I hit the jackpot!! Within a week her teacher and reading teacher asked what has changed. They are totally thrilled with the results. I had no idea it would work. I prayed a lot too. I hope it works for your child. All kids are different and maybe have different results but it's worth it for you to give it a try.

Alright the list can go on and on. The matches people put matches going on the dvd, that arent even there. I was expecting the classic Randy Savage vs Ricky Steamboat match from Wrestlemaina 3 and when I saw it not on there, I was mad. I wanted to return it, but it was already opened. I decided to give the dvd a whirl, and it still has yet to impress me. Like Astpierre stated, should have been early 80's and late 80's instead of some great stars of the 80's. Some matches are good, but bad dvd overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set in need of variety","review":"This is a great DVD set for fans that grew up watching wrestling in the 70's and 80's. However it lacks a little variety as far as matches go. I like the Iron Sheik but he's highlighted here 3 times, when other wrestlers could of been highlighted, such as Harley Race, Brunno Samartino, Ken Patera, ect. The biographies are well done and 70% of the matches are well chosen. The DVD's come in a nice set, but a program should of been included. It's a great set for those old schoolers like me. A lot of feud were left out like the Chief Jay Strongbow/Greg the hammer Valentine feud, but all in all it's a great DVD set that will bring back memories, especially when you watch the biographies. Maybe they'll have WWE greatest stars of the 80's part 2 in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tweak on the formula","review":"I enjoyed this wholeheartedly. Mainly because wwe did a little tweak on the formula. Instead of mimicking the one-time use of the Flair dvd formula or using the formula that everyone else gets this three disc sets spreads everything around. All the featured stars get their own video package highlighting parts of their career that made them famous or recognizable. Then every wrestler gets their own match, some of which overlap which makes things interesting. Although we do see some perennial \\"best of\\" favorites it was nice to see some obscure pieces of footage. Who would have guessed Sal Bellomo would be on a dvd in the 2000's. If wwe continues releases with rarer footage, I think they'll have a better chance at impressing the older members of the fanbase."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"the product is very thin so you won't feel extra load, I didn't give 5 stars because you may find something better, but for me is the best I have ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"EMS 4 EMS","review":"This book will help other medical careers.

James Horner did a wonderful job in helping to set each scene of the movie with the appropriate music. This CD is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music","review":"Listening to this CD is one of the most profoundly relaxing experiences you could ask for. The orchestration is wonderful, the melodies haunting--you can see and feel what the music is trying to convey with no effort at all. Pure enjoyment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Again and Again","review":"If you don't like repetition then this CD isn't for you. James Horner uses themes he has used time and time again. The love theme from Bravheart which was used previously in Field of Dreams and the main theme from Deep Impact. There is even a hint of The Spitfire Grill. However I am a huge fan of James Horner and though some people do not like his self-rip offs, I have to commend him on his score for Bicentennial Man. He uses themes he has used before and makes them better and even created some haunting new themes. He has totally hit the heart-wrenching theme of this film squarely on the head. He took themes he used before and made them even more emotional. Though I don't believe this is his best score, it is certainly one of his most emotional and heartbreaking. From Track #7 all the way to the end is awesome. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine entry","review":"James Horner is one of the finest (if not THE finest) composer of the past two decades. His score for Bicentennial Man is fantastic, providing you have not been closely following his history. The score occasionally sounds somewhat similar to pieces used in An American Tail: Fievel Goes West and Braveheart, and one other film I cannot remember as I type this. However, these are fine scores, and their placements in the film truly push the emotional effect on the audience to their limits, and then some. The intro score is a perfect way to begin the movie, especially because at the core, the movie is a humanistic sci-fi flick. And the final piece, leading into Celine Dion's Then You Look At Me, is so speechlessly done that it's probably the best lead-in for a finale theme song in any movie in the past few years. Its underscoring leading into the song is right on the money. If you were moved by Bicentennial Man, this comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Horner at his best!","review":"This soundtrack is absolutely stunning. He combines many of his past works such as \\"Fiefel Goes West\\", \\"Titanic\\", and \\"Star Trek II\\" into a beautifully flowing and peaceful experience. I can't describe how well this music makes me feel, but since I have purchased it I haven't listened to anything else on my CD player. I won't compare Horner to the classical masters such as Beethoven or Bach, but this work definitely will have a place in my top 10 classical works of all time! I think Asimov would even have approved of this score to his classic short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth 5 cents or five minutes","review":"This propaganda stuffed film is only 30 minutes long.

How soon they forget that Nazis WERE Christians, albeit Catholic Christians, and darned good ones, too, in the sense that they followed the dogma to its necessary conclusion: Death. No, if one wants to seek answers to such heady matters, one would be wiser, along with C.G. Jung, to look to the Gnostics for answers.

In examining the Fascist mind-set, he builds a case that much of modern \\"liberalism\\" is actually repackaged Fascism. Doubtless many will be upset or offended by his claims, but they are difficult to refute.In addition to tracing the history of Fascism and demonstrating many of its excesses, Veith also shows means of combatting its intrusion into modern thought and life. In so doing, he also establishes Fascist links to Postmodernism. For those interested in the historical aspects of Fascism, especially the alleged Martin Luther connection to Hitler and Nazi thought, I also recommend Uwe Siemon-Netto's The Fabricated Luther : The Rise and Fall of the Shirer Myth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Office 2007 Saves the day","review":"I've been running ScanSofts product for a year because I think Adobe PDF creator is overpriced.

I had it on a level surface (checked with a level) and the water markedly shifted to one side. It was also missing the anchors and is NOT 2\\" deep.If the depth is not an issue for you, I suggest ordering from someone else.

It just looked so cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birds love it!","review":"The reviewers who are complaining that this birdbath is plastic must not have read the product description. It's very clear that it's made of plastic resin, which is a plus for me.

Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"After having this bird bath for only 3 weeks all of the paint had peeled off and chunks of it were floating in the water. Amazon should not be selling this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay But Error Filled","review":"Adam Webb has done a good thing by bringing attention to Dennis Wilson's wonderful music. But this book needed some decent editing and fact checking in a big way. Webb continually makes mistakes that even the novice Beach Boy fan would catch. For example by stating that Dennis was not at the \\"Surfin\\" sessions. It is well documented that Dennis was there, his voice is obviously on the recording, and he sang a lead line on the B-side \\"Luau\\". Webb also states that Dennis sang lead on \\"Catch A Wave\\". No. That was Mike Love. Webb states that Brian's song \\"Lay Down Burden\\" was on his BW solo LP when in fact it was on his \\"Imagination\\" LP. These kind of annoying errors are rampant in this book. It takes away from the believability and enjoyment factor in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"An compelling life story, sadly ill-written.","review":"Much good research work went into this book, but it is badly let down by the often juvenile character of the writing and opinions (on subjects musical and otherwise). A shame as Dennis was an extraordinary personality and a creative, original musician. His songwriting in the period when Brian Wilson slowly abdicated creative direction for the band after the collapse of 'Smile' was undoubtedly the creative highpoint (along with Brian's occaisional work). Nonetheless it is also reasonable to argue that Adam Webb overwhelms Dennis with more of a weight of genius than is strictly fair. Some elementary factual errors also jarr - Smile's 'I Love To Say Da Da' is NOT the same song as Sunflower's 'Cool Cool Water', for example. I went for this book with great enthusiasm as Dennis's story reaches out beyond that of the band in a way that only Brian's has otherwise done, but it's very difficult to really recommend it as an enjoyable reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentions, not-so-good results","review":"Besides the lack of fact-checking mentioned above, I was bothered by the lack of basic writing skills Webb displays. The occasional misplaced apostrophe I can ignore, but this book is rife with mistakes, the most annoying of them being the author's habit of using incomplete sentences.However, if you're not bothered by that sort of thing, this book is a quick and interesting (if not particularly accurate) read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Angel, Dennis Wilson","review":"Hi All,I was a radio announcer for 25 years and we booked the Beach Boys for concerts a whole number of times. I met Dennis and the rest of them.This book is so cerebral that I don't believe it. Within the 1966-1980 context, this book is a waste of time as it pertains to each personality.Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"What makes this book so great is that ANYONE can use it. Any path or tradition whatsoever. THe author doesn't preach and tell you it has to be done a certain way. I'm so tired of books that tell you exactly how every little thing should be done as if the author is the only one who really has all the answers -- this book does not do that and it's perfect!

George C. Scott mastered his English accent so well, I thought he really was a Brit. It's tops in suspense; you won't even want to take a bathroom break.

That Frenchman survivor hooks up with British-accented detective George C. Scott to unravel the mystery of who is killing so many, and why.\\"The List of Adrian Messenger\\" was a staple as a Sunday afternoon movie when I was a kid, and it was always really scary to see how many people George C. Scott just misses saving. Of course, the best part of this movie are the latex mask disguises so many of the stars are wearing. Fairly early on, the audience learns the identity of the murderer while he is removing one of these disguises, but now that we know that disguises are the order of the day, we find ourselves scrutinizing every face, trying to decide if this one's a mask, and who's underneath it if it is. A pretty good way to develop paranoia, I'd say!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD, PLEASE!!","review":"When, when, when is this terrific movie going to come out on DVD?

Based on an obscure novel, Adrian Messenger is a film that features well known actors not just in character but \\"in disguise\\". I know that Huston used body doubles for some of the actors like Robert Mitchum. However, the film is an enjoyable lark.Note: This film has been unavailable for several years. Thanks to Amazon , The List of Adrian Messenger is available to fans everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD! DVD! DVD!

When I came across this speaker system, I was suprised at what a big bang for the buck it was. Went to Worst Buy to actually hear the system (which I would suggest). Of course the kid working the speaker room was prepared to set me up with a much heftier sub, larger fronts, etc. For my application (6.1 Surround), it not only met my needs, but didn't freak out my wife. Sorry, I guess I'm one of those people that don't want a dorm room look for a theatre system."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fairy Tale...

How does one describe badness of this level? The wolf suit is so poorly assembled he actually knocks his own nose off in one scene. The woodsmen have a disturbing interest in a small little girl. Scene continuity appears to have been inspired by Ed Wood as people run from late-night thunderstorms that strike in the middle of a clear day. I have told people about this movie and they don't believe me. I show it to them as proof and they stop asking me for movie recommendations. This movie is so *bad* I loved every minute of it.If you are like me and enjoy bad films and are a fan of MST3K, then this is a must for your collection.

I had suffered an accident while unloading a truck. A huge printer slipped and fell onto my leg, which put me into the hospital for about a week while I had a few operations done. I was hoping this book would help me pass the time, but the dark heart that wrote this shed no light upon the world and only continued to showcase all that is wrong in the world. I was hoping it would be a little bit uplifting, but it's not, and to top it off, it's not funny either. The title is witty, but that's where the inventiveness stopped with this book. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly lacking in humor, writing skill, and planning...","review":"The stories in this book were advertised as being incredibly funny but they AREN'T. The only funny part was the title of this book. This could have been such a funny and entertaining read if it weren't for the poor planning and lousy writing skills. The writer is lacking in the most important area of all and that's called \\"talent\\". This book gets a big fat \\"F\\".

Songs like You Can't Change That, Rock On & Get Down are awesome and funky. His solo stuff lags for me but is good. Even his session work (most notably guitar on Boz Scagg's Jojo) is great.This cd is a good relaxing cd. The 2 instrumentals are the best cuts. I wish they were longer and that there were more of them. All i can say is BUY THIS ALBUM! If he sees good sales, he'll release more!I'd also like to see a cd by him of smooth jazz renditions of some of his old solo and Raydio hits.

His major characters are two dimensional (which made fochs's description of himself as a piece of paper rather ironic) and uninteresting; by the story's end, I felt no connection with anyone or anything in the story as having some semblence to reality. Even the therapist appears contrived. However, I enjoyed the way Evenson set up the story--as a collection of papers from the therapist, letters, and thoughts from the mind of the killer. Very unique and interesting; hence, 2 stars rather than one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth music from Patricia Kaas","review":"Those of us who are fans of Patricia Kaas love her distinctively French musical style. The Piano Bar breaks from that style, a lounge-bar style CD mostly sung in English.Even so, it is great relaxing music . And Patricia's voice sounds superb. There are lots of other singers who could have done this, but that doesn't take away anything from the CD. After all, she set out to make a musical tribute to lounge bar singers and this is the result.One comment for those who are unsure as to why the mixed reviews. It does take a couple of listens before you appreciate its subtly understated style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over arranged and dated","review":"I loved Patricia Kaas in \\"And Now Ladies and Gentlemen\\" and I hoped to get a CD of her piano bar style as seen in the film. Unfortunately, this CD has horible arrangements and orchestration: echo-y, with a real dated sound of synthesized keyboard and electronic rhythm. Patricia Kaas would sound fabulous in a more \\"unplugged\\" version- ala Diana Krall, featuring her alluring voice and a simple piano, base and drum arrangement. This CD makes the songs sound very cheesy. Very disapointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of a beautiful voice","review":"Did Michel Legrand really produce this CD? Those who saw the movie And Now...Ladies and Gentleman will long for the soundtrack after hearing this recording of the songs Patricia Kaas sings in the movie.We are treated to a disco-like synthesizer and monotonous invasive electronic percussion that completely destroy the mood.It is pervasive throughout the whole CD. There is never an opportunity to sit back and relax to her wonderful voice.The producers and arrangers have let Ms. Kaas down badly. She has such a beautiful voice and would have been better served with a more traditional cabaret setting. I hope she does a re-make some day with a different producer as the songs themselves are wonderful selections."},{"rating":"2","title":"New side of Patricia Kaas","review":"These are the kind of songs I believe are perfect for Patricia Kaas and her voice. If I listen every each of them by itself I love them. Unfortunately, if you listen all songs in sequence you get an impression of repetition. The arrangement of music by Michele Legrand (is it really the same Legrand who created so many great melodies?!) is quite monotone. It works in one or two songs but not for all of them. Having said this, Patricia Kaas still has a great romantic voice and it salvages the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can put you to sleep very easily....","review":"As much as I love Patricia Kaas' voice, I must say that the monotonous beat of this album, from first note to last, can leave you wishing for an espresso bar instead of a Piano Bar.This is a very self-indulgent album, that only the French might consider \\"Cool.\\"Do yourself a favor and buy some Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello and some Cohen. At least those songs leave you with something to think about, much like a self-induced hallucination acquired by night at a hookah-smoking Piano Bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I'm very disappointed that almost entire CD is in English.

Yesterday was the third time we TRIED to use it and it would not even power on. We will give it one more try because we really like the idea of being able to operate the unit from the front seat. Hope the second time is a charm. We will update when we see how the other unit holds up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Piece of Junk!!","review":"I bought this product in spite of all the negative reviews. That was a bad idea. The player worked for about the first 45 minutes we used it, and then it stopped working consistently after that. We put in the first movie which played at first, but then it just froze on the screen and never resumed playing. We turned the unit off and back on and tried to start over. When we did this, the unit decided that it couldn't recognize that there was a disc in the player. We tried several different movies with the same result. We tried the original movie over again and it eventually started to play again. However, it would only play for a few minutes before it would freeze-up again. I thought it was freezing up because of the car ride. However, we plugged it into a TV in the house, and the player did the exact same thing. It is a total piece of junk. I hope Amazon stops selling this unit with so much negative feedback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Axion Portable DVD System","review":"Product arrived promptly and worked as expected.

We sent it back to the manufacturer about 4 weeks ago and still did not hear a thing. I tried calling couple of times, but no answer. Very bad customer service.The unit would not read the CD/DVD.. It just says there is no DVD in there at all. Very bad experience. I sure hope I hear something back from them. I would not recomend the product to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!

On our first trip with the players, within 5 miles of our house, the bracket holding the strap on one of the screens broke. Thankfully I was able to rig it together with a band-aid. After the trip, I put away the players (my kids only watch movies on long trips) and took them out a week later for a 2 hr trip. One of the players had sound only, no picture. Completely and utterly broke. Thankfully I bought it through Amazon and returned it because it was defective.The screens and player are so cheap, I would never buy again. I'm now on the hunt for a new dual-screen set, or even better, two tablet-style dvd players.DON'T BUY - it is total junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was so bad, it's sad that it will be taking up space in landfill","review":"Got it and immediately checked it out using the regular plug. No problems in the 5 minute trial. Got in the car and it did not work with the plug for the lighter. We bought a new plug. It took 4-5 tries loading a disk before it would stop telling us that there was \\"no disk\\". This included two brand new, out of the box DVD's. The \\"ok\\" button didn't work on the unit so we had to use the remote. The cables weren't really tight, so sometimes they would unplug. Not a huge deal, but the unit had to be turned on again every time and our kids aren't old enough to do this themselves.At this point, we were almost ready to try to trade it. An hour later my son kept saying his screen was turning off. Then, it turned off completely and it never went back on.Not a good deal for all the aggravation.

This one is junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Owned for two months with no problems","review":"This is the second two-screen system we have purchased (first was from a different manufacturer). This system has worked as advertised so far. The video quality is better than our previous system as is the sound quality. My only complaint is the DIN cables that connect the screens to the DVD player are not very well designed. The cables have about nine very small pins that have a tendency to bend when attaching it to the player even when you are being very careful. I think these DIN cables are common for the players with separate screens since our last player had them, too. Just be extremely careful when plugging in the screens and all is well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it last","review":"Very good the first 3 months, then suddenly the picture will freeze and you have to start the dvd over, 5 months after it didn't turn on anymore and we only used it for long trips.

However, we have one child and do not particularly want to watch her baby videos at all times. We ended up returning this product because it would only play one movie at a time. Also, this one required that you have each screen and the player connected to power. If two people watch it it would require that 3 power sources be available. There were wires all over the place which is not very safe with an infant, or any other child for that matter.We tested it and although the picture quality was fine, it was not good enough to keep based on the above reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed","review":"I have only written one other review ever, but I wanted to post this. I read all the reviews on the Axion and I felt like it was about 50~50 chance that it was good, but it was a good price. I felt like I had to buy a really expensive Dual DVD player before I got to more positive reviews. We used the DVD player on one trip up to Maryland and it worked great. Then on the ride home it stopped working right in the middle of a movie. I pulled over and tried to replug in the wires (in case something came loose), but not such luck. Thankfully, Amazon replaced it. (unfortunately with the same DVD player) Hopefully this one will have a longer life. I honestly think Amazon shouldn't offer this system to its customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD player not reliable","review":"I would not recommend this package. Although the picture quality was very good and we like the features, our DVD player broke after 20 minutes of use. We brought 5 DVD with us on our first trip with it. 20 minutes into the trip the player froze up. It no longer recognized that DVD. 3 of other DVDs would not play at all. Only 1 DVD out of our 5 would work and you had to try several times to get that one to play. We had to buy an different player in the middle of our trip and that one worked fine. We returned the defective unit.If the DVD player did not break, I would have highly recommended this player, but based on the short life span I would never buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"We bought this for our toddler son to make the car trips more bearable. At first, this worked fine but then we started having problems with the power shutting off and not coming back on. It's a cheap brand so you can't really expect much from this product. It's been nothing but a headache to our family. Next time around, we'll spend the extra money to get a more reliable one. Seriously...it's just not worth the money or the headaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Bought this for a long drive over Thanksgiving. Arrived in late September but I did not take it out of the box until November 20th. It worked when I set it up the night before we left. However, 15 minutes into the first movie one of the monitors began to flicker and would not work. Switched cables, turned off the unit, unplugged it - nothing.Neither Amazon nor Target have been any help in resolving the problem. Trying now to contact Axion, but I'm not hopeful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start...lousy finish","review":"First the good news......We ordered this product for a six hour car ride. It arrived on time and worked like a dream. Great picture quality and really loved the fact that the actual player was sperate from the monitors. It made changeing DVDs much easier.Now the bad news....On our ride back home, the player stopped working. Just stopped. No bumps in the road to jog anything loose, no power problems, no children handling it...it just stopped, never to start again."},{"rating":"2","title":"well, so far so good !","review":"we used it for a 10 hr trip. it worked fine. based on different reviews (mostly bad) I was skeptical about the performance of this product.

She hooked it all up and played one movie and then tried to load another movie and it cam up no disc. She and I tried several movies after that and it worked off an on, more off than on.

No complaints about it at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go for it","review":"I've never owned one of these before so I have nothing really to compare it to, but we just took it on a short family trip (2.5 hours one way) and we loved it! It's easy to set up and easy to use. The picture and sound quality are both good. I do wish it had batteries so you didn't have to start the movie over every time the car was turned off, although on long trips you don't turn if off all that often. We borrowed a portable DVD system (some walmart brand) from my sister before we bought this one and this one feels much sturdier and the sound and picture quality were much better. I also really liked the carrying case is came with. Over all a great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great car dvd player","review":"We were a bit skeptical reading some of the quality issue reviews, but so far (knock wood) it's been just fine for us. This is really easy to set up, comes in a nice carrying case, and for the price you really can't beat it. The screens affix to the headrests -- which is really nice b/c you dont want to have anything that can fly around in case of an accident. The actual dvd player is compact. Cords are long enough so you have plenty of slack to set it up how you like it. Sound and picture quality are fine.

The thing I enjoyed the most was that Chris didn't sterotype the African American women to be the loud, rude women with bad attitudes that people assume they are.

She was Johnny Carson's favorite. He had a crush on her, most of us did.Joanie could easily have been a much bigger star but for the staid selection of material. Of the few \\"rock\\" numbers she performed she was a stunner. Nobody had her vocal range at the time. Her voice just oozed sex appeal though your speakers. She was also a great woman devoted to her husband who was also her manager. Joanie never let her energy go. This album is a good example of her style.

You may not think so if you do not like nudity or think that it should not be in a book. Let me state that I have no problem with nudity or the porn business as a whole but this book is trash.

Borrow a friends or go find it at an adult bookstore and browse through it. That is the only way it will be worth your money (by not spending any that is). The photos are pretty boring, and they look like they were done by someone without a lot of photo experience. I feel like i could have done better myself with a digital camera. And the subjects themselves are not all that fun to look at or even attractive. This is not the story of some porn star you love. This is the story of some porn star you may not have seen before, and may not care to see again.

The only difference is that the authors of Terrorism Today use elevated language and esoteric, arcane references, so uncovering any points in this book is extremely laborious at best. Most of it is nothing more than a series of polysyllabic ramblings. One of the most upsetting aspects of it is that the authors make outrageous claims about the motives and psyches of various groups, but they don't back up their claims, and they're obviously not psychologists.

This beautiful catalogue was produced to accompany a traveling exhibition and presents 52 works of this period by 42 American artists. Each painting and sculpture is reproduced on its own page in full color and faces a succinct but informative discussion of the artist and subject, along with a brief stylistic analysis of the work. The effect is that of a private gallery tour given by an insightful curator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very small and the face is ugly.","review":"I bought this as a baptism gift for a friend's baby.

I contacted the company who makes it, and they kindly sent me a replacement. Sadly, the second book didn't work any better than the first. I think the story and concept of the book are very cute.

It is about individualism versus conformity with a lot of history thrown in. The peripheral characters are quite well written and the book is extremely funny. Auntie Mame is a memorable character and deservedly so. There are many funny moments but touching ones as well. The character is well-portrayed in the 1958 movie starring Rosalind Russell and also in the Broadway productions starring Angela Lansbury. Just skip the unfortunate movie starring Lucille Ball, which is deadly. However, the book, alone, should be satisfying enough. Definitely one of the five proverbial five books to take to the desert island.

The characters were shallow and uninteresting. The underlying message was good, but the way he went about it was bad. The motivations for a lot of the characters were questionable. The ending was too contrived. Jilseponie didn't come across as a hero. The solution was basically just dropped in her lap. Very little action."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For Any Salvatore Fan!","review":"When I read the end of the Demon Apostle, I was shocked to find out that Elbryan had passed on. I was wondering where Salvatore would go, since he was the main character throughout the first trilogy. However, Salvatore definitely shows us that Pony is just as much a hero as Elbryan was. I just absolutely loved this book and the way that it showed real human nature. I could really see some people locking themselves away so that the plague wouldn't get them and some of the others plunging headlong into it to alleviate the suffering of others. This is just a great book and a worthy addition to the DemonWars. I can't wait until the next one comes out, so that I can find out what happens next to all of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The POV jumping was jarring.","review":"Let me start off by saying that I am huge RA Salvatore fan, so I decided to read some of his other works. I was very disappointed in this story. After awhile, I just didn't care about the plot, but I continued to read hoping it would get better. It was difficult, until the very end, to determine who the main character was (Spoiler Alert: It's Pony). The author jumped randomly from one person's point of view to another to the point where it was jarring. He introduced new characters frequently all throughout the book and their point of view, which didn't bring anything to the story and subsequently didn't hear from them again. It was also difficult to care about any one character. With the exception of a few minor characters, which I liked more than the main character, most descriptions were at a surface level. I just expected a more interesting story and characters that a reader would care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salvatore, what were you thinking?!?!?","review":"I have read all of Salvatore's books and the DemonWars was one of his best series, knowing this, I read Mortalis think that it would be another hit. However I was horribly mistaken. This book has no big antagonist and the only thing that this book accomplishes is emphasizing how pathetically stupid Jilseponie is. Its only good attribute is that it has De'Unnero in it and the good qualities end there. I would recommend reading the first trilogy, forget that Mortalis exists and skip right down to the goods of Ascendance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salvatore has gotten off track","review":"I have bought and read most of the demonwar series. Some was good, but it went rapidly downhill after Elbryan died. The plot became convoluted, hard to understand , and Jilsiponie became a character who was driven by the plot, not part of it. As I have often said about Movies, I hate it when stupidity is necessary for the story to continue. I believe that entire story could have been well told in two books, and without the stupidity, could have been resolved much quicker. Some books let you know how it will finish, and you don't care, because the book is good. This series let you know how it would finish, so I didn't care to plow through it to read it to the end. Let's get back to Drizzt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Salvatore's best yet","review":"Mortalis continues the sweeping epic Salvatore started in the Demon Wars Trilogy, and sets the stage for further adventures in his world of Corona. There is enough action and intrigue to satisfy most adventure fans, but this is a deeper book. This is a book that examines the responsibility of organized religion to the people it serves; a book that questions who is saint and who is heretic; a book that takes a hopeful look at miracles, and a cynical look at the traditions that religious leaders hide behind, a book that decries the apparant futility of fighting an evil that will eventually just reappear in one form or another. It is a journey that many of us have made ourselves; and - while you will find few clear-cut answers here - Mortalis will give you renewed hope in our world as it takes you deep within the world Salvatore has created so vividly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"This is one of Salvatore's greatest books to date. He truly put his soul into this work , and you truly feel the pain of Jilseponie as she tries to get over Elbryan the Nightbird's death. A lot of loose ends are tied up in this book (although they are opened again in Asendance), and it makes you feel pretty content to see that everything just might work out for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrepentant Coyote strikes again!","review":"Okay, I'm not an expert on Native American tales, so I can't tell you how close this story comes to the \\"original\\". What I can say is that I kind of liked Coyote. He sort of reminded me of a ten year old boy. He steals a blanket and gets chased around the desert. At first, he asks for help from all of his friends. But not even his friends can help himut of this mess! Finally, he's forced to gives it back. But does he learn his lesson? No! The illustrations are excellent, with the eye for detail that is the hallmark of Janet Stevens. This was a good \\"mulit cultural\\" tool ."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book for children","review":"I bought this book in a local bookstore out of curiosity. My 5yr old loved it. It's humorous and the ending caught us by surprise. This story also gives children the opportunity to participate (when the rocks \\"rumble\\" after coyote).I'd recommend it for kids up to age 10. My reason for not rating it 5stars is this: There isn't any info. included on the writer. As a Kiowa-Chickasaw woman, I always like to know who is writing the books under AmerInd. subject matter and their background/experience. I bought the soft cover. Maybe the jacket on the hardcover has this info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coyote Steals The Blanket","review":"A greedy coyote thinks that he owns everything. One day he comes across these beautiful blankets but before a little bird had warned him not to talk them, but the greedy coyote took them anyway. The rock chased him all over and there was no way that he could stop it, unless he returned the blanket. I like this book because it teaches a wonderful lesson that I believe all children should learn, that you should not take what is not yours. I think the author did a great job getting that lesson across in a simple enough fashion that young children can understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Out-dated","review":"This work written by Schoff in 1912 is one of the first published pieces on the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. The Periplus, by an unknown Greco-Roman merchant living in Egypt in the first century A.D., has fascinated scholars interested in Roman trade with Arabia and India. Although the following commentary of the translation is a bit out-dated, the book remains one of the few works concerning the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea still available to purchase. Lionel Casson's Periplus Maris Erythraei, published in 1989, is much more accurate and contains the original Greek writing but it is however very hard to come by. Overall, a good book for someone just begining to learn about Roman trade with India and Arabia. I would also reccomend The Commerce Between the Roman Empire and India by E.H. Warmington."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN TRADITION!","review":"THIS BOOK WAS BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED. THE CORNROWS GIVE A SENSE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN PRIDE AND HISTORY.

Peart did put a family tree in the back of this book, as I have been asking, but it is very slender and not comprehensive at all. However, when I finally quit reading to see if everything \\"fit\\" with the previous fourteen in the series, I really enjoyed the story. The characters of Joy, Gayle, and Dr. Wallace were thoughtfully rendered, and the initial concept, Joy's mural, does become a sort of ministry for her. Joy's journey to Montclair and her discovery of Rose's journal was riveting, and Gayle's acceptance of her slave ancestors was touching and thought-provoking. If the book is read singly, you will find it a heart-warming and enjoyable story. However, as a conclusion to such a wonderful series, I was left empty and disappointed that Montclair is now out of the family and that there are almost no Montrose/Cameron ancestors left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Montclair homecoming","review":"Very nicely written, enjoyed it very much.

With the simulated 3D Surround Sound I found myself actually thinking that there were people humming behind me or other various sounds that were actually being produced by the headset. I also love it's function as a necklace when not in functional use as a headset as it allows a place for quick palcement when not needed for short use. It's User Interface is also very easy and has excelent connection strength with my Samsung Blackjack.

I have yet to have them die on me, although I use them for 6-8 hours straight every day. They are relatively comfortable (or at least, no more uncomfortable than any other pair of earbuds I've worn) with a decent sound (although the BT stack in WM5 devices causes some distortion in the higher frequencies). The ability to attach the individual ears together via magnets seems kind of gimmicky at first, but is actually a very convenient way to store them. The cord also stores very well and you have the option of charging the headset either with a USB cord or through an A/C adapter. All in all, the product works as advertised, has a good price, excellent battery life, above average sound quality, good range, and a cool form factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"lack of support, proprietary USB cable make this useless for me","review":"my fault for losing the USB cable, but Lubix does nothing to assist in finding a new one. the cable is NOT a standard USB as the small connector is proprietary.

With that in mind, I decided request a copy and give the CD a review. Earl Carter is a jazz guitarist that's molded out of established artists such as Norman Brown, Paul Jackson, Jr and Paul Brown. His music is hip and smooth, not too abstract like many artists I've encountered. It's also has great production value. Every track is great on this recording. It's hard to pick what's my favorite. I'm currently playing the title track, \\"Cocktail Showers\\", \\"The Dream\\" and \\"Out on a Limb\\" in my rotation as provided by Live365.com.

This product is noticeably thicker than any other floss I've used and is not a great choice for people who lack space between their teeth. Additionally, the floss has poor durability, thus far I've needed two pieces of floss to get though my whole mouth because the first piece routinely breaks.

I would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can You Say Comma?","review":"I have said repeatedly that I was finished with DS, yet, like some other reviewers here, seem incapable of resisting. I remember when a new DS novel was cause for celebration. Now I look forward to seeing how much further she has slipped!This is by far the worst yet. I also wonder if someone else is writing for her now. I had a hard time reading this due to the poor grammar, total disregard for punctuation and repetition. At least I didn't see any spelling errors.I am a writer myself, working on my first novel. I read fiction as a break from my own writing as well as to continue to work on my writing skills. I resent the fact that this author is able to get away with the kinds of errors that would cause my manuscript to be rejected by any publisher to whom I might submit it.One star is too good for this one. Don't waste your time or money, or even your library rights!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The bottom of the barrel","review":"I've been reading DS for years - it's like cotton candy - you know it's bad for you but somehow you eat it anyway. This novel is the worst I've ever read - maybe out of all books I've EVER read, not just DS. Does she even use an editor anymore? I didn't count the number of times she used the phrase \\"Wacky Artist\\" but it was about every other page, if not more. Reading this book felt like watching a bad movie where the only sound you heard was a voice-over. The characters had no voices or personality of their own. I wish I had read the reviews on Amazon before I checked this out of the library and wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wacky, Wacky, Wacky","review":"I am so sick of reading the word \\"wacky\\" and her going over everything over and over.

I don't know all those Parisian Restaurants and places to go, and I'm not interested. Does she think her characters are special because they are rich.

I have read all of her books and even named my first born after a character in her book \\"Palomino'. Fast Forward some 25 years and 60 some books later and I have never been disappointed in one of her books until now. Impossible was boring, the story line was repetative and I had to force myself to finish it.

I will wait til they come out in paperback or until I can find them at a thrift store or garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money on this one","review":"I usually like Danielle Steel. Her books are always a quick read and I usually breeze through them. This one, however, I could not even finish. I thought Sunset in St. Tropez was bad. This one is even worse. She used the word \\"wacky\\" to describe Liam on every other line. Come on, Danielle, use a thesaurus!! Blah blah WACKY blah blah WACKY - and I'm not exaggerating! She made him into a ridiculous character like a child who never got his way and put him in stupid situations, like barging in on Sasha's business meetings with snooty clients. Get real. I was VERY disappointed with this book. I was mad at myself for not trudging through the muck but I could only take so much \\"wacky\\" artist. Don't even bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wacky Artist!","review":"This book was quite repetitive, but very much on track with other Danielle Steel books. I listened to this book on audio and the first ten tracks of this book did not include one single bit of dialogue. It was strictly narration telling us the life story of the main characters. That was a little boring, but then the rest of the book was a little boring and repetitive. It was very frustrating that Liam was so immature and inconsiderate of the main character's professional life. It was funny at times also, especially when Tatiana went to the house in the Hamptons and \\"met\\" Liam. Overall, the story did have a happy ending and a sweet message, but the phrase \\"wacky artist\\" and \\"impossible\\" were used about a zillion times throughout.

This book is a mess. There are only two reasons that I finished the book; 1) I paid for it, 2) The characters were likable. Otherwise... it was a complete waste of time.

How many times do Sasha and what's his name need to break up and get back together? How often does Sasha need to cry about this artsy guy?This book was so annoying that I had to literally put it down and stop reading it.I will never pick up another Danielle Steel book, and I am still appalled that the publishing world even let this one be published!"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't she have an editor??","review":"Why do I continue to read her books???

I can no longer stand the repitition. why does she repeat herself over and over again?? does she think her reading audience is stupid?? and why doesn't an editor take out all of the extra stuff?? this book could've been about a hundred pages.I didn't like Liam. of course, heros can not be perfect but I found him completely unlikeable. He was a mooch, a slug, a leech on his wife. How could I admire this guy?? He sucked the life out of his wife, cheated on her w/her sister, and ignored his kids for many years and thought it was ok b/c he was \\"creative\\"I give up.

Like others on this site I will never again read a DS book. Talk about repetitive -- it got so bad that I began to underline everytime the main love interest was referred to as a \\"wacky artist\\". Between Chapters 5 and 7 the term was used 15 times, three times on one page. To make it worse, the \\"wacky artist\\" is also characterized as extremely immature and childlike, making him very unappealing to me, anyway. In the space of 3 pages the following phrases appear -- \\"looked like a big kid\\", \\"she felt like his mother\\", \\"his childlike style\\" \\"he was very needy sometimes, and self-centered, as children are\\", \\"he acted like a bored schoolboy\\", \\"pouting\\", \\"acted out, more often than not, like a child\\". What a bore. Both the book and the people in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes I wonder!","review":"I sometimes wonder where DS is when she's writing these stories...I was worn out by hearing about Liam's personality issues and his age difference with Sasha. It got old very quick. I struggled through the last part of the book wondering how I would manage to finish. I'd say the next book needs to be more exciting and unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danielle what are you doing?!?!","review":"If I had three words to come up with to describe the plot in this book they would be: ping-pong match.Why is that you ask? Because the characters go back and forth, changing their minds literally probably a hundred times. Do they want to be together or not? Sasha and Liam spent the book either in passionate lust or dislike. I really didn't see \\"love\\" between them.I have a issue with how they continue to bring up the difference of their ages (9 years apart), as a reason they're not together. 9 years isn't a big deal, and much of the book you spend saying \\"Get over it!\\" But they never do.Steel's subjects and story line are worn out - I'm sick of gallery owners, and widowers. Come up with something new that hasn't been done that doesn't involve these two subjects! For now, I'm just going to go back and re-read some of her classics. Don't bother with this book - if you must, wait a month or so until you can get one on here or Ebay dirt cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"After reading \\"Impossible\\", I think I've come to the realization it's time to give up buying Ms. Steel's books.

I found myself skipping pages which is something I rarely do while reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible...to read","review":"I was so angry that I wasted time reading this spectacularly boring book that I had to warn others. The storyline is repetitious as is the diction...I have to agree with the author of review that asked if DS even has an editor anymore. Sheesh..."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Surprises, but Like Visiting an Old Friend","review":"After 63 books you kind of know what to expect from an author. And in this book you will not be dissappointed. In fact, if you're an experienced DS reader, you can probably guess the plot.There's the established, kind of dull, work-a-holic, tradition bound 48 year old Sasha. She meets up with the wild and crazy, impulsive, but of course extremely talented artist, the 39 year old Liam.The plot is less of a plot than a character study of these two people. There's passion, there's keeping this scandalous relationship secret from his wife, her grown kids, and her gallery customers.Is this the world's best novel, nope. Is it even DS's best, probably not. It's one of those books that if you're a DS fan you'll enjoy. If you're not one of her fans, this wouldn't be a bad place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old Story","review":"This story line is probably one you've already read by another author, and it's very easy to tell how the book will end. The details of the book are original, and it does move along and hold your interest, but it's a repeat of a relationship between two people. I was actually surprised that Ms. Steel would go down this road, and not offer something more original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible is Right","review":"I haven't been a Danielle Steel fan since I was in 8th grade. Picking this up reminded me why. While anticipating a relocation I started trying to read some of the books that have been on my shelves for years. I figured if I read them before the packing started, I wouldn't have to pack as many. I inherited this one somewhere along the way and it has been shelved for, no pun intended, an \\"impossible\\" length of time. It took more than one day to read only because it was so painful. Sophomoric and repetitive writing, canned plot line, trite, predictable, but aptly named as it is nearly impossible to get through. This one needs to return to the book mill from whence it came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have always enjoyed reading Danielle Steel's books, but finally read Impossible and found it extremely disappointing. My thought when I finished the book was \\"you've got to be kidding; that was terrible.\\" I came away believing her publisher must have pushed her into getting another book on the market, and she just threw this one together. And to get it finished, she used lots of filler. The filler being the waffling relationship back and forth between the main characters. They broke up and got back together so often that it became funny. And when Sasha tried explaining to Liam (one of the times) about his behavior, I thought I'd scream if she said \\"You have to play by the rules in my world\\" one more time. Come on, give me a break. This was a terrible Danielle Steel book, and I'll be quite skeptical about getting another one to read. What a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"GEE Turkey Beard Display Board","review":"This product is VERY low quality and is a waist of money!

Tunes like \\"If Tomorrow Comes\\" or \\"One More time\\" will please you as drummer or drum fan. \\"Give the drummer some\\" is a great smoking drum solo.

Frosty sings like a drunk. Don't wanna hear him. Everyone sings horribly (they should stick to singing in the shower.) I think the plot wasn't that good. The movie says that Rudolph got his nose from some fairy god mother. The real answer is he was born that way. He's a freak of nature. Spend your money on something fun like roller skates with square wheels or twinkie hotdogs or something useless. I think Rankin Bass was desperate for money when they made this.

I was and am still shocked at how the Rudolph and Frosty storylines were allowed to be butchered in such a way. With Winterbolt, the origin of Rudolph's nose, and all the other sci-fi characters, you'd think the writers were on acid while putting this abominable script together. There is zero holiday spirit here. It's just terrible. Unwatchable. And once and for all, as with all of the Rudolph sequels...can we establish the fact that Rudolph was GROWN UP by the time he was pulling Santa's sleigh?? Yet all of the sequels star a BABY Rudolph. I hate to get fired up about a kids special, but there is just so much wrong with this thing. Thank God its not on network TV, or there'd be way more outrage than what I'm expressing. I can't believe ABC Family even bothers themselves. It is really that bad.

The book is hard to read, as the sentences and ideas flow into a tangle of words, sometimes forthright and cuttingly honest and then as illusive and mysterious to grasp as the dry wind that blows through Northern New Mexico. What little I've seen and know of that region, seems hazily yet honestly etched in this very unusual writing. Summer Wood gives the reader a glimpse of the desolation, the bonds of family and the struggle for survival and meaning. Very far away from Hillerman's version of this landscape. More a symphony of wind and hope and hopelessness and caring. Twice I put the book aside, for it became overwhelming and I could just absorb so much of the rather poetic cadence and illusive emotion. I am unconvinced that I truly understood it, but I certainly enjoyed the richness of this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not profound but enticing","review":"Perhaps nothing profound is in this book, but itcan lead the reader to suspect that Thomas Sowellhas written other, deeper things. It is full ofstories about various sorts of irrational bureaucratsin academia, in government, and in the military,maybe not _quite_ as extreme as the pointy-hairedboss in _Dilbert_, but definitely the sort who couldhave inspired that character. Thomas Sowell could beconsidered a sort of minor patron saint (or \\"patronhero\\" if such a thing exists) of the virtues ofsticking to one's guns, calling the shots as onesees them despite heavy pressure from those whodon't understand, refusing to follow any partydoctrine as if it were infallible dogma, and caringabout one's students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"As a Native American and Hispanic, Sowell brings hope for those attending school and getting into a profession.

The author reveals in this book that the Song of Solomon is in fact a metaphor for Christians who wish to develop a stronger relationship with Jesus Christ. As the reader explores with the writer, the Old Testament book, \\"Song of Solomon,\\" a mysterious theme emerges in the pages: the Bride first meets her Bridegroom in a very immature state and is guided by him in a journey of her development into a supremely mature loving being with the same nature as her guide.The book clearly draws the connection to the life of a new Christian who first comes to the LORD in a lost state and receives the LORD's Salvation. The new babe-like Christian is then introduced to God's Master Plan to develop them from a selfish immature person into a loving, fully spiritually developed being, prepared to enter into a marriage relationship with the Son of God upon their entry into eternity."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very technical, and mostly low level when it is","review":"This book will tell you about Brocade's stock price and EMC's corporate culture, and about computer forensics' need of SAN storage, and about FC-AL, but if you need to know the different scalability characteristics of GFS versus StorageTank for your SAN file system, this is the wrong book.

Tried to use it again this week, and the leak has become a torrent. Took apart the handle, there is a 3\\" vertical crack in a hard plastic tube that connects the flexible hose to the actual trigger. The crack is in the plastic and not a seam, so I believe the plastic part was either under engineered or made of poor plastic. In total, I've used this unit maybe 2 hours.Tried to get help via email customer service, they were pleasant until I said that can't find my receipt.

Like everything else, the dialogue is forced, with nothing colloquial about it. (\\"And here I am, in a miserable miniature raft where I'm certainly going to die with an equally miserable monster.\\") Butler and the publishing company should have had the book edited by someone who can actually write. I was stuck on a 5-hour airplane flight with nothing to read but 66 Days Adrift, but not even that helped me get over the horrendous writing. After reading the first 75 pages, I've had enough. Don't expect this one to make it to Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"An arrogant, gruff man and his boring, repetitious book","review":"I agree with others who say this is a boring read. Once they are in the raft it is nothing but the two of them arguing about the same things every day it seems. The author comes off as arrogant at best. Save your money or buy some other sailing book.

Or better yet, just buy your own sailboat and experience the most sublime thing one can do--singlehanded sailing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall disappointment","review":"I agree with whichever reviewer wrote that this was a great story poorly written.I am so happy that the Butlers survived their ordeal. I think that this story had a lot of potential. I know it must have been difficult to fill all those pages with exciting prose, but it does get monotonous after awhile. The dialogue is excrutiating to slog through. After reading about two weeks worth of Simone's whining and Bill's chest-puffing denial, I would have wanted to be eaten by sharks. And if Simone didn't divorce Bill for his behavior before this ordeal, she should have after she read what he had to say about how great she'd look after she starved for a few more weeks on the raft. What a schmuck! As we say here in the midwest, the man needs killin'!Would have loved to have seen photos of the Butlers, their boat, their family, the raft after their rescue, etc. Also would like to know more about why whales would sink a boat and how many times this type of thing has happened in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore","review":"I don't like to write bad reviews, but I have to say, this might be the worst book I've ever started to read. I couldn't finish it because:1) It was very repetitious. I naively thought the chapters would move the story along. The only thing that changed was the weather.2) William Butler is kind of unlikable.

I missed the large number of puzzles in some of the other games and the tasks and challenges of other titles like Secret of the Scarlet Hand and Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake. I felt there just wasn't as much to do...maybe I didn't like having to think it through so much; don't know.

This was purchased for me as a Christmas present. I am greatly involved in the study of martial arts. It moves a bit slow to set up the story line in the beginning. However, I love it. One of my favorite movies I've watched this year. Jackie Chan's 100th movie I believe.

The story-line is one that young peoplesee frequently in \\"gaming\\". But cartoon characters don't bleed, or cry. So this is tough for teens, in a way, but thediscussion that follows is very thoughtful. Of course if you love Shaolin, and Kung Fu, you appreciate that most of the action was\\"wire-less\\" and authentic.Jackie Chan's segments were amusing and well-done, but since \\"comic relief\\" only appeared in onesegment, it seemed a bit odd and out of sync. We might have liked to see more of him, a little less humorously, for balance throughout. Worth watching with parents, friends, teacher(?) for discussion of moral an ethical meanings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaolin Collector's Edition","review":"Love me some kung fu movies that are done we and this one was excellent.

In the Revolutionary War it was John Paul Jones. In World War II it was Nimitz. During the period around the War of 1812 (which also included combat with the Barbary pirates, it was Stephen Decatur. This is his story, well written, and able to place Decatur in the story of the United States of the time.Decatur entered the navy in 1799 (well after the Revolutionary War) and served until he was killed in a duel in 1820. This was a duel that appears to be even more stupid than most. And the author goes to some effort to describe the failings of their seconds who probably could have prevented the duel from happening.During his brief career, Decatur rose rapidly in the ranks and with a combination of skill and luck was able to do the right thing, in the right place, at the right time. His promotion was fast, and he was the most famous officer of his day. His is quite a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitzi's first recording","review":"I had the priviledge of working with Mitzi as her road manager in the early 80's. During that time I was given a copy of this album on vinyl. It is a wonderful representation of Mitzi's early years and is beautifully recorded and performed. Pete King's arrangements rank among the best of the era (57') including the likes of Riddle and May. In fact, this album gave me the desire to find more work by King. Mitzi's energy and love of her audience is appearant in this recording. She also only worked with the best, and her first recording effort represented here also presents the best in arrangements and production of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG disappointment","review":"I bought this album for one song, and as it turns out, that one song is the only thing that would prevent this disc from being a good tabletop coaster. Erase/Rewind is a really great song. It has a great mood, riff, melody; it all just flows beautifully. The rest of the album, however, is rather boring. It all sounds like \\"filler\\" just to make the effort a full-length album. They would have been better off just releasing an EP or a single of Erase/Rewind and left out the crap that surrounds the song on Gran Turismo. If you are like I was and are considering this CD just because of Erase/Rewind, don't bother. Find a single or get the Thirteenth Floor DVD (good movie, also has the song's video). If you are a new fan of the Cardigans and absolutely love their other stuff, you'll probably like this just for who recorded it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland very bland","review":"this is my first album which i bought from the cardigans it also this will be my last , after hearing my favourite game i thought this album would rock but instead it turned out to be very slow and the music becomes bland after listening to it at least four times, people!!!don't buy it .....,,, i'd recommend singers like alanis morisette and the great band , garbage.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too discordant for such a lovely voice","review":"I loved her voice, having heard a song on TV with acoustic accompaniment.

This CD is so totally different from the group's last CD, First Band on the Moon, that I hardly recognised it. If you liked the Cardigans' first CDs, this may not be a great one to buy. The group's former fun-type sound has been basically washed down the drain. All the songs sound very dreary, like they've gotten stuck in a rainy day for way too long. However, it may be a good CD if you like the talent of the Cardigans, but didn't like the upbeat style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really moving music.","review":"I didn't really care for Lovefool very much, but after hearing \\"My Favourite Game\\" on the radio, I thought that I might check out this album. The Cardigans have established a darker and more mature sound with this new album and I cannot stop listening to this. All of the tracks are fabulous, except \\"Explode\\". This album is for any fan of trip-hop or even alternative music. Anybody who gives this album anything under four stars does not appreciate or recognize good music when it appears in front of them. I hope that those who ripped apart this album with one-star reviews stay away from all other good albums so that they don't curse them - with bad reviews. All \\"Lovefool\\" fans should stay away also - this new sound is not at all like that annoying top 40 hit. \\"Gran Turismo\\" is a wonderful and dark way to escape the torture of peppy, annoying music that you'll often find plauging the radio stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thin, tuneless, forgettable release.","review":"Overall this CD is really disappointing. Each song drags on with peppy but weak drum loops, random guitar gibberish and whining, incredibly tuneless vocals that make the hum-drum sound even worse.

Sus etapas de \\"Life\\" y \\"Emerdale\\" eran muy vintage y muy mellow. Tal vez escuche \\"First band...\\" y ese fue el mejorcito. Pero Gran Turismo es algo completamente diferente, hay un enorme abismo que separa la calidad del sonido y tendencia entre GT y \\"Fist band\\". Puedo catalogar a este disco como el disco oscuro de la banda.Canciones como Paralyzed y Marvel Hill son bastante chocantes si se las compara con \\"Pikebubbles\\" o \\"new Cokoo\\" de discos anteriores. Las primeras 8 canciones son las que le dan caracter a este disco, luego caen un poco en lo comercial con la 9 y la 10. Pero rematan con la instrumental \\"Nil\\" ,es buenisima!.. muy darkie , muy melodica.Un disco buenisimo, de pronto el mejor que sacaron desde 1998. Musica eclectica bastante recomendada."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Ok","review":"After hearing \\"My Favorite Game\\" on the radio, I decided to buy 'Grand Turismo'. I do agree that is isn't the same as 'First Band on the Moon' but it still seems a little s l o w.

They have never been a fluffy pop product, they just rock. Give them a try and when they get close to you, check them out live. Just as we did. Unbelievable!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute trash from the formerly brilliant pop group","review":"life and emmerdale are two of the most magnificent and exceptional albums of the decade. first band on the moon, while not as fundamental as its predecessors, was also a very great record. brilliant b-sides, wonderful live performances, and charming personalities only enhanced an already perfect combination of pop smarts and musical genius. so what in heaven's name happened on gran turismo?! gone are the melodies, the backing vocals, the shining 60s moments of pop perfection. instead we're privy to hookless throwaway tunes and (gasp) ineffective trip-hop! this would be an unlistenable album by anyone but to hear it with the memory of the cardigans' undeniably brilliant first two records in your mind is downright nauseating. i don't know when i'll be able to digest solid food again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody tell me why I didn't like this one (?)","review":"Sure, I first heard of the Cardigans when I saw the \\"Lovefool\\" video on Mtv. So I went and bought \\"First Band on the Moon\\", and was happy to find out that the rest of the CD kicked some major butt.Eventually I obtained a copy of this, after hearing \\"My Favourite Game\\" on the radio. I didn't like it. I was thinking that the Cardigans were seriously disappointing me, after displaying so much genius previously.Undeterred, I eventually bought the \\"Life\\" CD and was VERY PLEASED. That's the Cardigans I know and love. I even bought the import \\"Other Side of the Moon\\" for the b-sides, and I guess I am a happy boy now. I love the Cardigans, but unless they find their way out of this \\"trip-hop\\" bull, I will have to be content with the earlier stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you were wondering. . . .","review":"The Cardigans are a very hip band, very wide range of style. In case you wanted to know what the title track to Playstations Gran Turismo 2 was: It was 'My Favorite Game' by The Cardigans. Plus, the lead singer is hot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album...a more mature and dynamic Cardigans!","review":"The Cardigans have made several great albums, and although this one is a little different, it still ranks up there with the others. Everyone keeps saying it is more \\"dark\\" but I disagree and think that maybe Nina has mastered her vocal talents and has created a more \\"ethereal\\" quality in some of the choruses, but definently not a \\"dark\\" quality (but hey, I am an x-goth so maybe I have a different definition). The instrumental talents also seem to be at their full potential. One of my most listened to albums right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant piece of work","review":"On their 1998 fourth album The Cardigans sorta became the Swedish answer to Garbage, this as opposed to their previous efforts in which they sounded more like the Swedish answer to the Sundays. Yet, this change was a wonderful one, & Gran Turismo definitely proves it. The album's strongest moments are \\"Paralyzed\\", \\"Erase/Rewind\\", \\"Explode\\", \\"Starter\\", \\"Hanging Around\\" & \\"My Favourite Game\\"; Whilst when you'll first hear \\"Marvel Hill\\", \\"Do You Believe\\" & \\"Nil\\" you'll find it hard to believe that they're the same band who recorded the 1997 hit \\"Lovefool\\". The only song here that is somewhat reminiscent of \\"oldskool\\" Cardigans is \\"Junk Of The Hearts\\", yet the incessant electric drumbeat reminds you that it's not the Life Cardigans you're listening to. Anyone who appreciates alternapop should be happy with this album, just as long as you take it on its own merits instead of comparing it to its formers. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me a lot of Garbage \\"Version 2.0\\"!","review":"I remember hearing \\"Lovefool\\" all the time when I was in 3rd grade, and always wondered who sang the song. When I found out that it was the Cardigans, I immediatley bought the cd \\"Gran Turismo\\". I had heard the song \\"My Favourite Game\\" on the radio once, so that was another reason I wanted the cd. What a change from the \\"Lovefool\\" days! This cd is so dark and strange, it's safe to say that The Cardigans are now alternative rock, not pop. It seems that The Cardigans have been waiting along time to expose this, one could say frightening, side of themselves, and finally got the nerve to. The first thought that came to my mind when I heard the first song \\"Paralyzed\\" was Garbage's \\"Version 2.0\\". Both cds have something in common, a type of gritty, uneven feel to it. When I listen to \\"Gran Turismo\\", it's almost as if I'm reading someones diary, or reading their mind and personal thoughts. Please buy this cd, you will not be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST FOR TOURIST","review":"First listen: \\" What?...Just \\"My favourite Game\\" is good? no, here must be another good song\\"Second: \\"Ok, now i know this is a waste of time\\"third: \\" Do you believe\\" \\"Junk of the Hearts\\" \\" Erase/Rewind\\" and maybe just maybe \\"Paralized\\" could be so-so tracks.CONCLUSION: I want my money back.The entired cd is so slow, calm, and i was waiting some strong tracks, whit fast rythms...but i got this. Nina Person ( The blond singer) have a nice voice, but whit this album i was fooled like a tourist in a foreing land."},{"rating":"2","title":"It&#65533;s a new and improved Cardigans sound.","review":"Gran Turismo gives us a new and slightly more rocking sound from the Cardigans. Sure they still have the soothing songs that make perfect background music (Paralyzed and Explore), but they also have expanded their musical themes to present a more rock'n sound (Favorite Game and Do You Believe). The best new flavor (by far) offered by the Cardigans is Favorite Game. This new hip song will send you to the dance floor and have you humming the tune in no time. If you already own a Cardigans CD, buy this one to add to your collection. If you have yet to try the Swedish sensation known as the Cardigans, buy this CD and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"new\\" Cardigans","review":"I have only owned \\"Gran Turismo\\" for a week, but i can already tell this is going to be one of my all-time favourite albums.The thicker sound together with ninas angel voice works extremly well. Gran Turismo is less pop, more rock, and i like it. I think that they will get a new group of fans with this \\"harder\\" album. Besides the hits \\"My favourite game\\" and \\"Erase/Rewind\\", theres a whole bunch of tracks that smells \\"hit\\". For example the third track \\"Explode\\", a stunnig beautiful ballad, where ninas voice just melts the speakers.So this is my advice, if youre an old Cardigans fan: Buy the album, you wont regret it, and if you are a new fan: Buy it, you will love it..//Johan"},{"rating":"1","title":"only one great song on this","review":"Don't get me wrong I love the Cardigans but the only song I ever put into my iPod is \\"My Favourite Game.\\" Like much of the Cardigans catalogue, there are a lot of less than stellar tracks.

In much the same way that Brick, Ben Folds Five's biggest commercial success, was unlike anything else that they did, Lovefool was not at all what The Cardigans were about. True, the music was similar, but if you listen the words, you'll realize that there's much more going on than the music lets on. Their music has always been a little disturbing to most of their fans, and with this offering they finally figure that out themselves. This CD is amazing. I gave it 4 stars because I rarely give anything 5. This CD is usually what I turn to on miserable days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy buen papel fotografico","review":"Tengo una impresora K550 de HP.

I bought a bunch of HP Premium photo paper because it was 2 for 1. Big mistake. The prints had a mottled pattern which was quite ugly. I thought my printer must have clogged jets because the print quality was so low. I cleaned my print heads and tested the alignment, but I kept getting same lousy quality. So I got on the phone with Canon tech support which immediately suspected the HP paper (apparently HP papers are a known problem). They had me print the same photo on Kodak paper I also happened to have on hand and it was beautiful. The Canon tech support person told me that HP, unlike most of the other manufacturers use a different process with the result the paper surface will swell as the ink is applied to it causing image problems.

This is designed so the printer can recognize which direction the paper is loaded (in case you loaded some sheets the wrong way). Unfortunately, it is more of a problem than a help. No matter how the settings are changed on the printer, it will always print on the perforated tab and leave a blank bar at the end of the picture.

I would not recommend using this paper if you have an HP printer similar to mine (2355, 2175, 1315, 1350, etc.). Premium PLUS paper indeed corrects this problem, but it is almost twice as expensive.

This series ranks FAR below the original Mobile Suit Gundam, and just as far below Zeta Gundam. The animation is better because it is newer, but that is about it. I could barely finish the last disc.

Anyone who has ever truly suffered from depression, especially long-term depression, can tell you that this simply isn't the case. While he does raise some valid issues, for the most part, his arguments are both facile and specious.That being said, the videography in the various cities was quite pleasant.

I practiced meditation and felt a sense of \\"calm\\" that I have never felt before. It gave me hope and hope is critical in the healing process. One thing he said that helps me is 'this too shall pass'. He also recommended making a list of things/people you are grateful for.

Although I'm not feeling 100%, I feel like I will most definitely recover from this...and much faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"practical tools in the age of technology","review":"Ira Israel's dvd on depression in urban settings was very informative and well executed. In todays information age we need tools to help us cope with the constant bombardment of technology in our everyday lives. Ira is well versed in the topic and his knowledge comes across brilliantly in this film. He uses poignent quotes from different philosophers and poetic writers to back up the material. Shots in every city from Paris to San Francisco remind us how the hustle and bustle of city life can often feel overwhelming. The numerous shots of Ira meditating in various congested areas was a great reminder that we're not victims of outside occurrances but we can choose how we feel in any given circumstance if we remain mindful.

This book is for intermediate to advanced weavers, and it's of great benefit to those who are looking for something challenging to weave. There are no patterns in the book, but LaPlantz gives the name of the pattern and weaver of every basket whose weaver and pattern are known, so you could go online, find the pattern, and buy it. Weaving just one of these baskets should keep you occupied for a long time! While there are no patterns, there are many diagrams, so that you can see what you're doing with the twill you're weaving.

Get the little plastic one that sits on top of a coffee cup and have the same coffee for 35 bucks less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great....if you like a mild coffee","review":"I bought this item because of it's beauty (I bought the hand blown model...$78). I like a flavorful stronger brew (somewhat like Starbuck bold). This coffee maker produces a milder brew because the hot water does not brew in the coffee beans long enough to produce the rich flavor that I prefer. After one use I went back to my French Press which produces a much better cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could have bought the a 10-cup for the same price","review":"This purchased turned into a real cluster. I purchased the 8-cup @ around $38 bucks, and right after I received the coffee maker I received an email from the Amazon supplier that my same coffee maker was now $30 bucks, and that the 10-cup model was $38 ! I would have rather had the 10-cup model instead but sure as heck didn't want to go thru the hassle and time to repackage, resend the 8 cup-er.This was just a hassle. Yes, the difference was credited to my credit card, but ultimately thats not what I wanted knowing that I would have had the larger pot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressed","review":"We decided to switch to a non-electric coffee maker. We wanted something that didn't require electricity and wasn't metal. I found a few reviews for Chemex and decided that we would try it. It is sturdy and well made. For the first couple of days I used two regular coffee filters with my Chemex. They did work but the coffee flow was much faster but I can't say the coffee tasted awful, it was still good. The biggest advantage with the Chemex filters is that they are very large so can hold the wet coffee without tearing. Overall I am very happy with my Chemex coffee maker and wish I had switched years ago. My husband and I each have a 12 oz cup of coffee every morning. The 8 cup coffee maker is just the right size with a little coffee left over."},{"rating":"2","title":"great coffee","review":"love it!!! every coffee drinker should have one.

It is an excellect resource if you are seriously thinking of collecting these fabrics and it gives some wonderful histories of fabrics. Judith only talks about US fabrics and that is okay because she stated this in her intro. It is a slim tome so you could not expect it to cover the depth of fabric history across the ages.I will refer to it often. There is not much about pricing so be warned if you want to know what you should pay for that 1940s head cloth this really won't be the book to turn to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Millwaukee 18V Lithium Ion hammet drill kit","review":"I am verry happy with this drill, I am upgrading from about a 10 yr old Dewalt 14.4 drill to the Milwaukee 18V Li Ion and this one seems much more powerfull and the chuck holds even the small bitts very tightly.

Opening the shipping box you are presented with a giant red suitcase. Inside is the drill, a charger that is quite large, and 2 batteries. It took less than an hour to fully charge both batteries to full. This drill is a beast, it is big, heavy and you can feel the quality. I have used it so far with a flexible drill bit it worked great. I used it for removing/driving screws, and today for installing corner bead on a door frame I removed. I love the setting dial that prevented me from driving the screws too far into the drywall. The battery is still at over 50% after all of this work.

My recommendation for anyone thinking of saving a hundred bucks by buying a girly-man drill is to invest in this machine - you won't regret it. I almost bought the \\"highly rated\\" Panasonic or something and kept seeing people compare it to this beast, so I decided to just bite the bullet and get a real tool.I like all the extra touches designed to NOT irritate you, like the extra big case you can just throw screw and bits in, without any problem getting the drill in too. I didn't even know about the high-speed button until drilling on some masonry, hit the switch, put it on hammer drill, and it ate through like butter.Yeah, it's loud - duh.

They have been nothing but trouble... I DID follow the instructions carefully regarding cleaning the window... we've tried everything... wet suction cups, clean with rubbing alcohol, I can't even get them to stay with duct tape!

Since they came as a two pack, I still have the second one. I am going to Lowes or Home Depot to buy better suction cups and will remove the suction cups on the product for a swap.

The spring recoil is okay (though after a year of off-and-on use one of them is slow to recoil completely), but what good is a shade with good recoil on the floor of your back seat?!?! It's not because they're old, either. They never stayed up well, not even the day we got them. As for the white hot thing, it's not a bad idea, but if you're going to get into the car, you're going to get into the car, thermochemicals be damned.

I wrote them and told them this is unacceptable. The customer service lady wrote me back and said they could do an exchange for a comparably priced sunshade. Today I recieved my new sunshades from the company, which happen to be the same shades that I purchased previously and that I had said the suction cups DON'T WORK!

It was way too easy to catch the bad guy. I also thought that the graphics weren't very good at all.

I have bought them in reverse order, though, with Message in a Haunted Mansion being first, then Stay Tuned for Danger, then this one. I highly recommend all of them. They are all a lot of fun, challenging and humorous in places. My only complaint on this one (which wouldn't change my opinion on how much fun it is to play) is that this is the only one out of all three that uses cartoon drawings for the characters, instead of 3D graphic animation, like the other two. The scenery is all 3D,though, just like the rest. Needless to say they improved upon this minor detail in the other two games. They are definitely must-buys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is a killing of a game!","review":"This game is very addictive. You start out with an opening sequence showing that a high school student (jake Rogers) has been murdered, and it's up to you to find out who did it. You meet several characters who all had connections with Jake in some sort of way. There are tons of clues to help you. What I liked about this is that you don't HAVE to solve every single little word puzzle in the game to beat it. This is challenging for kids and adu;ts alike and definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning-Cartoonish Graphics-Don't compare with later games!","review":"If you have played the newer versions of Nancy Drew games, you will be very disappointed with the graphics.

I have played all the other nancy drew games and this is the worst one. When you want to go somewhere else, half the time you have to change disks which is really annoying.

Do not get this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"...First of all, I noticed there were two CD's, which got to be extremely annoying when I was playing the game. The characters were to cartoon like, they didn't have a lot of dialog, and they were..well...quite boring to be honest with you. There wasn't enough puzzles and clues either, making the game lack in excitement and mystery. The game was really short, and I really didn't like the ending. All in all, I really wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless you like staring at your computer screen and clicking aimlessly on stuff and solving a boring mystery in just a couple of hours. But I would definetly recommend Nancy Drew: Treasure In A Royal Tower (lots mystery and fun mixed with a lot of interesting French History)and Nancy Drew: Message In A Haunted Mansion (nice story line, and it was really fun and didn't bore you to death like Secrets can Kill. It also has a lot of interesting Chinese history)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhh...","review":"For being a game published in 2001, this should have been much better, at least technically, than it was. There was a poor timing match between the visual effects and the sound effects, it was difficult to find where to place the pointer in the save/restore area, the sounds/music were poorly recorded and generated a lot of hissing/static, and the too-frequent need to switch CDs during play were major minuses in a game that could have been ok. When Nancy has conversations with the characters, if the questions asked/answered aren't done in the proper order, the game doesn't progress and you either have to start over or restore a saved game. Also, saving is critical because there are some actions Nancy can take that will result in disaster, necessitating a restore.The story wasn't bad, even for an adult (very similar to the novels) but the technical flaws made this a exercise in frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK","review":"I did not like this game at all.

Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst one ever!!!","review":"i have played and beaten all the nancy drews and this was my LEST favorit ones.the graphics were cartoons and you dont even get to meet the bad guy.do not ever play this game!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lower than the LOWEST LOW!","review":"This game [is bad]. Period. I would rate it negative 500000 if I could. I mean, you can buy a LOAD of Nancy Drew games and love em all and trash this one. But the teachers lounge IS kind of cool.......... Wish you could e-mail me but I can't give you that vital info. Too bad if you are a challenger seeking a debate."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I really didn't like this game at ALL! The mystery about somone dead was good and all, and I know it's Herinteractive's first game, but come on! Cartoon characters?! Plus, it was easy and short, and not hard at all. If I were you, I would NOT buy this at all, NAH-AH! I hope this review helped! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game!","review":"This game is wonderful! I gave it 4 stars because it's not as much fun as the other ones though. You get to sneak around the school and try and find out who killed Jake! There are a bunch of suspects and code to decipher. The only bad thing about it is that you have to switch disks to go to different places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but , Hard !","review":"This was my first Nancy Drew game and I never read the books.

A must play!"},{"rating":"1","title":"swapping disks is no fun","review":"It's an interesting story, and it's a challenge, but the constant swapping of the disks towards the end of the game really ruins the mood..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it...good for kids and adults","review":"I really liked this game: it wasn't too difficult, and it was interesting. The only drawback was that the game didn't take me very long (1 day) to complete. And I did it on the middle \\"Spy IQ\\" setting. This game was entertaining, and will be great for my kids as they get a little bit older. I would definately recommend buying \\"Secrets Can Kill\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!","review":"I BOUGHT SECRETS CAN KILL AND WAS VERY EXCITED!I LOADED IT ON TO MY COMPUTER,AND I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED!I HAD DIFFICULTY TRYING TO GET NANCY TO TALK!I HAD TO CLICK THE WORD I WANTED SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE I ACTUALLY GOT HER TO TALK!THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER PROBLEMS LIKE I COULDN'T GET TO THE SCHOOL,AND THE CHARACTERS TALKED VERY SLOW!EVERY OTHER NANCY DREW GAME IS GOOD!BUT DON'T WASTE YOUIR MONEY BUYING SECRETS CAN KILL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I absolutely DO NOT recommend this game. First of all, it was way too easy. I finished it in about 4 hours and since it is really no fun after you've played it once, I felt that the game was a total waste of money. Secondly, the game contains two discs and you have to keep switching back and forth between them which is positively annoying. Third, the graphics look way too cartoonish. I wouldn't really mind the cartoonish graphics if everything else about the game was cool, but it's not. I would not recommend paying money for this game unless you've played all the other games and are just desperate for another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Die Hard Fans Only","review":"I read Nancy Drew religiously in my early teenage years so I was really anxious to try these games when I heard of them. I really wished I had skipped this though. It was terrible. The graphics are too cartoonish. The characters are flat and one dimensional. It doesn't take very long at all to play. I finished it in a fraction of the 20 hours that the package promises. And the thing I disliked most about it was all of the coded messages. It has a lot of messages hidden around but they do not advance you in the game and do nothing more than give away each of the characters secrets. The messages just kill any suspense in the game. Oh and the game also has two discs and you have to go keep going from one disc to the other throughout the game. It's not too much of an inconvience, but this game just isn't worth it. I don't recommend this game unless you just have to own all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"No hard evidence","review":"The author doesn't provide any hard evidence to back his thesis. To put it simply, I don't believe the mob was capable of covering this up. The mob would have had to have the 1)Secret Service 2)Military intelligence 3)the FBI 4)the CIA 5) The Justice Dept (including Robert Kennedy!) 6) The Warren Commission 7) Dallas Police etc. all in its back pocket. Anyone who believes all that is delusional. Jack Ruby himself seems to provide the only credible link, but even this is a bit shaky. Some believe that Jack Ruby's fantasy was to be a gangster and rubbing out Lee Harvey Oswald gave him the opportunity to project that image. Who knows what really happened? It's possible the mob may have been involved somehow or played a role, but I don't think they were the ones in charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contract on America","review":"The best book on the JFK assasination that I have ever read. An outstanding case for mafia involvement in the president's murder. Like the Academy Award winning film, The Departed, this book reveals the often blurred line between criminals and law enforcement. Jack Ruby is the real key to understanding that there was a conspiracy to murder President Kennedy. Contract on America offers a very revealing look at Ruby, that I believe is the most accurate description published to date. This book's perspective on \\"the crime of the century\\" is highly focused, and supported with details based on facts. It is an exciting book that will give any reader a better understanding of the personalities and events surrounding the JFK assasination."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Zoo's Review","review":"I bought this for my little nephew because I grew up watching the show and loved it.

And my niece is enjoying watching them too...feels good to pass it on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dated","review":"The messages are excellent, but it's too slow for today's audience. The kids like the costumes, but it misses the mark in a number of areas. When the kids are old enough to understand the messages they get bored with the time it takes to make the point, and some of them while good lessons, are sad and ugly. Other shows like Berenstein Bears, or Franklin, or Care Bears to name a few, teach the same lessons but in a much more enlightened manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book only for the seniors","review":"The book is pretty good and very useful! What I find most exciting is that the author always explains you the phenomena physically --- not only mathematically, which helps you to have a better understanding of the physical mechanisms. I ensure you that you will have a clearly \\"feeling\\" of the phenomena which are badly explained in other books.Each figure is well prepared, each sentence is clearly written. This is a book need to be read extensively, not roughly. This is also a great reference book since it does not struggles with too much details but only the essentials.But you'd better have learnt Quantum Mechanics and Solid State Physics before. Otherwise, you will find yourself lost. Therefore this book is NOT written for a freshman."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your looking for a reliable guitar, look no further!","review":"I recently bought the Guitar Hero World Tour guitar at Walmart.

They had sent the wrong guitar controller, and I had to sent it back. But it was at my cost of $12.30, in which they would only give me back $3.99 for the shipping! So I had to pay out of pocket $8.00 for the mistake they had made! Which I think they should have paid the whole thing being it was their mistake!!Now to top it off, I am now not even getting the controller. They had refunded me the money for it! I have a son that is very upset that he is not even getting his controller that he ordered!! So I paid 8 dollars for something that we didn't even get!! How great is that??

It works great and I have not missed a note because of a bad connection. The style of the guitar is really sweet too and reminds me of some great heavy metal bands. The only issue I have is that I find it difficult to strum really fast. The way I normally strum quickly is by anchoring my forearm to the body and then shredding as fast as possible.

All of them have drawbacks and you have to pick your poison, but the old GH2 controller gets my vote for the least amount of trouble overall. It's wired, it doesn't have solo buttons or anything fancy, it's a bit smaller than other controllers, the clicking is pretty loud, but it's durable, reliable, and easy to play. The only serious flaw besides not being wireless is that when playing online there will be a constant hum emanating from any headset plugged into this controller (even when the headset is muted!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor service","review":"I did not receive an important piece as part of this package and I do not recommend this seller to anyone as he made no attempt to send me the piece that was missing even after I told him/her that it was missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The Tracks on the double CD set are all synthesized....Very dull sound and cheap sound......This is not the real deal..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cornerstone Of the Comic Book Industry","review":"The Overstreet Comic Book Price guide is the cornerstone to the comic book industry.

This is a classic example of misreading the formula that made you successful in the first place. Sequels are usually bad, in this case Siegel's are bad. The reviews and cover quote by Warren Buffett are misleading, and I seriously doubt whether the reviewers read the book. There is nothing new here. Undervalued stocks (value stocks) have been touted as being superior forms of investment for a long time. Eugene Fama, and others, have produced fantastic research in this area. I found the book to be self aggrandising, offering no original contribution and totally out of character relative to the first book. The data mining is significant, and to suggest that tried and true is the way forward simply because the past delivered such a pattern is foolhardy. Give this book a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another book that is WRONG about the Stock Market","review":"Right, Mr. Siegel gives the great advice in this investment book to buy stocks that pay high dividends.Well, I took his advice and bought GE stock in 2007.

But I think anyone who has a great passion for our national park system would enjoy it. I had expected it to be a somewhat tedious plod through NPS history, but instead it was the very personal story of Horace Albright, and the role he played in getting the NPS off the ground. It was a page-turner from start to finish. It would make a great gift for anyone who's ever been involved with the NPS as well. I bought my copy through the Grand Canyon Association (who run their bookstores at the park). They also have a website you can order form.

The only weakness I found is that the pulse indicator is not at all accurate but in 50 years of walking on tradmills I have never found one that was accurate. Customer service at both Amazon and Proform were very helpful in informing me when it would be delivered. The assembly instructions are clear and easy to follow but it takes two people to put it together.

The running track is a bit narrow but not too bad. I'm 5'10/190 and a flat footed runner and it works ok. The bolts could be a tad bit longer to ease installation. It has very easy to read controls and display. The display could have had more features easily with an added \\"mode\\" button to the console instead of flashing the calories/speed back and forth. Be sure you screw the bolts tight as mine came off this morning while running but I fixed it. (bolt was a bit too short with the spacer so i had to bend the bracket over.

A tall blond haired, blue-eyed girl from small town Illinois heads to sunny California, teaches college math to fund her passion for the blues, plays gigs almost every weekend and tours in the summer with her band, including her ex-husband on bass. Sounds like fiction, but it's fact. Laurie Morvan wields her Stratocaster like a Chicago tommy-gun and every note hits the target. She's a talented song writer, and a fine singer with a husky alto. If you don't smile when you hear \\"Where are the Girls with Guitars?\\", or shed a little tear listening to \\"Family Line\\", I feel sorry for you.Her band is tight and rock solid behind her, with great vocal harmonies and smokin' bass work by Pat Morvan.The Laurie Morvan Band may not be a household word yet, but here's one old rocker who's rootin' for them.

For a freshman, i think reading tooth & nail was completely useless. It got really annoying seeing BOLD words everywhere you read. Also, there were parts that didnt need to be written. They were just written so they can add in SAT words. I didn't even like the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, But not worth your studying time","review":"While I found the story in this book quite interesting, I do not think that it significantly improved my vocabulary. By using an \\"SAT Word\\" once in the book, I did not learn that word. The same words should have been repeated more than once, when possible. Perhaps, as another review suggested, the definitions should appear at the bottom of the page and not in the back - constantly flipping to the glossary was detrimental to my reading experience. I would not reccomend buying this book to learn vocabulary words, although I think the approach has some merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRULY A NOVEL APPROACH THAT WORKS!","review":"This book is definitely among the easiest ways for students to augment their vocabulary.

This book allows you to enjoy an exciting story, while increasing your vocabulary and ultimately, raising your SAT score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, bad format","review":"I just finished reading the book Tooth and Nail. The reason I've chosen to review it is to warn you of the annoyance to come. Yeah, the mystery story line is an Ok touch, but having to continue going to the back of the book to look up the boldfaced words is so stupid and time-wasting. When I first started reading the book, I was learning a couple words because the bold ones didn't appear so often. When there were as many as 5 or more boldfaced words on one page, I got sick of flipping to the back of the book, trying to find the word in the glossary. This really messed up the purpose of the book: to better your vocabulary skills. I think that the publisher should have put the definitions of the words at the bottom of each page that it had the words on. This would have been much more efficent. All in all, I'd say if you can't study your SAT words any other way, this book should be one of the last choices you turn to."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting to struggling teen readers? puh-leeze!","review":"As a high school English teacher, I wanted to like this book. Sadly, as with many books that have an agenda, this one suffers from the story serving the message. My struggling readers do not relate at all to the main characters. They chose the book, and now they are begging to stop reading it-at chapter 8! Plus, there are paragraphs with 4 or 5 (or more) target words in them. That is way too many new words to be able to figure out what the words mean in context. (See others for the \\"looking up\\" problem.) Sorry, but I won't be offering it to other unsuspecting students on the pretext of its being an easy way to learn new vocabulary. I'd rather see someone be given permission to search more compelling pieces of literature that are or could be read in high school for SAT vocabulary and allow that researcher/writer to make up SAT workbooks that complement study of that novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste you time","review":"For all you students out there who are trying to improve you SAT verbal score, do not get this book. It was impossible to follow because of to many vocab words crammed into one sentence. I desided to stop reading it because doing something that I really didn't want to would not improve my score. I thought I would be able to muscle my way through it, but the bland boring nature of the plot and charecters made consider jumping out of a window. If you want to help yourself get an online course or take a class, but this book is not a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I had to read this book for English Honors 1 but i could not even get past the first 10 chapters. They should have at least included a better plot. They should of also tried to make it less obvious that the book was just stuffed with the most longest words and in the most unhelpful way.

As being forced to read it for a class, I can't say enough that I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone. No matter how many fun voices you put into this book, it gets boring. There are so many other things you can do. Heck cleaning your house is more fun. This book just drones on and on. There is no mystery that we've been able to find yet and we are on Chapter 15. In the first chapter though you can make some sex jokes. Truthfully, this book has turned into a joke. Don't read it if you can avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a very good book!","review":"I thought this book was very out of date! I would not recomend this book to people that want to travel to Georgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful quality.","review":"I purchased this for my daughter because she is barely walking and I thought it would be precious for her to crawl around in. Little did I know it was handmade by someone with no motor skills what-so-ever.I got it and the eyeballs were glued on lop-sided. There's thread already coming undone. The zipper has a catch in the back so you have to force it up, practically tearing the fabric. The material is not designed for a child of the age wearing it. The dimensions listed were inaccurate in length, and the circle that makes up the shell I had to re-sew myself because it came to me unspiraled.It's too bad they didn't send me the one from the photo, I might have given this more than 1 star. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adorable but too expensive for poor quality","review":"This is an adorable costume. I didn't mind spending more money than intended because of the originality of the costume. When I received it though I was disappointed in the quality. The eyes on the cap are barely sewn on, the eyelashes are just dabbed w/ glue, & there were 2 decorative green pipe cleaners that are falling off at the base of the eyes. The first washing took care of those. The velcro chip strap was rough & scratched baby's chin, I had to snip the ends. The shell feels like it will unravel w/ any handling.I am pleased w/ the sizing, my son is very tall for his age, & there is still plenty of wiggle room."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY FROM THIS COMPANY","review":"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.

We loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"i am not a picky person however when i buy something i dont want it to fall apart before it is even worn. when this costume arrived i was disappointed on how thin the body suit fabric is, in the pic it looks warm and comfy in all actuality it is very close to being see threw and scratchy, most of the costume is glued together so the snail shell started falling off just by it hanging on a coat hanger, I wish i would have bought a blue jump suit and made it myself, and the sizing is off my son is 9 months and will hardly fit in it, he is avg. sz. oh yeah the shell part will all come unrolled if you slightly push on the middle its not stitched or even glued (which i can see that glue is there first choice of assembly) it is going to be fun to doctor this costume up, i gave it 2 stares only due to its originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE the snail costume","review":"Everyone LOVED this costume! It is just as cute in person as in the picture, and my daughter looked adorabe in it. It is warm enough to wear by itself by you can also put clothes under it if it is cool outside. The only reason I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 is because the snail shell is only hot-glued onto the back piece that velcros on. It is slightly heavy for the hot glue to hold on, so it is starting to fall off just from its own weight. For that reason, I fell it could have been better made. Otherwise, I love this costume and would buy it again in a hearbeat. Great choice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked the item BUT!!!!","review":"Yesterday I received the item after struggling with the company because of the delay of receiving .

I don't know how long it will take for the shearling on these slippers to mat down, but so far, these are more of a slipper than shoe and that is what I am looking for.

I turned to Amazon.I am delighted. The slippers are extremely cozy and warm. They are a bit snug if I wear socks. They are perfect with bare feet.

It helps paint a very realistic picture of what will be needed to setup and maintain a horse facility. If you are unsure of your level of commitment, this book will help show you the real deal.

All in all a great general refrence book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough depth","review":"This book seems okay as a cursory glance, but every time you have a specific question, the answer they give is too superficial.

These barns look like the Taj Mahal!No way I have that much room.However, it did have interesting info I can use...like info on daily feed planning (that's in my horse care book).

How much work it will take to furnish your horse with the facilities it needs. I found it very informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy for PFM","review":"This is an album by an Italian pop singer. He sings in a sixties pop style similar to someone like Tom Jones, except he is less melodic. I can't understand Italian, so I don't know if his songs have any deep meanings.I bought this album because the great Italian progressive band, PFM was playing accompaniment. This concert comes to 2 years after the PFM album, Jet Leg, and Mauro Pagani is no longer with the group. PFM is down to 4 musicians, who are all still in the group today.PFM just plays in the background music, written by De Andre. They are just accompaniment. They never break out. It could be anybody playing the background music.This is volume 1 of a two volume set. I must admit that I have only heard volume 2.

It is written in the style of The Night Before Christmas but the wording is very tedious and does not flow at all. As another poster mentioned, it needs a rewrite.This book does not mention god, rather dances around the topic. Personally as an atheist (yes, one who enjoys the season), I was glad for that and yet the message was very watered down. There was no warmth and joy, or perhaps it just seemed that way because I so hated reading it.I usually don't hesitate in choosing Berenstain Bears, but now I'll look twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Book.... If You're a Pantheist....","review":"Interesting how a book that professes to be about the real reason for CHRISTmas never brings Him into this story. I particularly disliked the line in the ending carol that stated how they would \\"pay homage to the stars above\\"... on Christmas? To celestian bodies? Interesting.Christ is how Chistmas is saved. A mirroring of the gospel message fits nicely here without a stretch... not some panteistic parable about how good finally wins over bad... and then in our \\"oneness\\" with this inner good we're compeled to pay homage to stars and such. This book was jettisoned from our collection as have all secular centric Christmas tales.It may seem like an over-reaction however our children are assaulted with the secular [read:worldly] things... no... they are pummeled with them.

And it is beautiful.If you love the well-thought out melodic and moving sounds of people like The Shins, Paul Simon, Harry Nilsson, Sufjan Stevens, Sam Phillips, Aimee Mann, or Elliot Smith, I can't see how you wouldn't embrace this record.There isn't a filler track on this album, from the upbeat and quirky \\"But We Did\\" to the smooth and moving \\"Held His Gaze\\" to the atmospheric \\"Center of Time\\" to the heartbreaking swell of interlacing melodies in \\"It's Now\\".This is an album in the true sense of the word. It's not a collection of singles, it's a well-thought-out presentation of wonderfully written music. We need more of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"great writing, but romance lost fizz","review":"I really enjoy Shanna Swendson's writing. And the plot of the book is fantastic, literally and figuratively. In Katie's new job, she has been tasked with finding the spy/traitor within the company. Along the way, her own safety is threatened. The fun part is when her parents go to New York to visit her and she finds out that her Mother has the same ability as she does, to see magic.The suspense with Owen, powerful wizard, is getting painful. All of his blushing and not coming right out to show interest in Katie drove me nuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, relationship not convincing","review":"The book was a good continuation from the first one, but the relationship between the main character and the man she liked was just not convincing.

An enjoyable read with heroine as quirky and engaging as in first book. Synopsis on this site accurate so not repeating. Amusing moments that flowed with plot (versus unrelenting humor or prats and jokes shoehorned in to hit reader over the head with fact that this is supposed to be funny). I detracted half a star versus first book in series because not quite as plausible, tried to take the magic folk and force them into mundane molds once too often, and one of the plot/romance devices was the trope where if she had only spoken up ... but, still a story that was a page turner for me and I will be reading on in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute","review":"I think I enjoyed the first one in the series more, but this one was still very cute. It did loose a bit of the magic from the first one in that she was discovering this whole new world that existed in downtown New York, no less. Swendson did manage to hold onto it a little when she had the Texan parents come to visit and the readers got to here the couple bicker over what mom SAW.For those of you out there anxious to discover if the herione gets cozy with one or the other of the men she is interested in, you will discover the answer to that one in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Great album.

There were two versions of \\"There She Goes\\" on the CD, one from the Boo-Radleys and one (infinitely more pleasing to the ear) from The La's. I recently bought The La's and wasn't disappointed. Now they are in no way better than the Beatles (hyperbole much?) but they are very good. Catchy tunes, spartan production values, and a generous portion of good old-fashioned British Pop make for an enjoyable and repeatable listening experience. \\"There She Goes\\" is far and away the best song on the album, but songs like \\"Doledrum\\", and \\"Son of a Gun\\" will have you tapping your feet.It is indeed a shame that they recorded so few songs, but the music they did make is classic. I'd recommend this disc to anyone who enjoys '60s style British Pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating illustrations","review":"This is a favorite of my 9-month old son who consistently chooses it for us to read together and regularly pages through it on his own.

It is a cute movie with good morals and enjoyable for children and adults. It is also narrated by Andy Griffith and brought to life by the voices of Jackie Vernon and Shelley Winters. 'Twas the Night Before Christmas has been one of my favorite Christmas shows since I was a little girl. It's the story of a mouse who wrote a letter to the editor claiming Santa Clause does not exist and signing it from \\"all of us.\\" So, Santa Clause decides he will skip that town on Christmas Eve.

Frosty takes a snow wife as Jack Frost tries to put a snag in his plans. And of course, one of my favorites, T'was the night before Christmas about a letter sent to the local newspaper denouncing Santa as a \\"fraudulant myth\\". The clock maker Jonathan Trundle makes a clock that goes haywire making him the object of ridicule in his town.

Their technical support is very slow in responding (they would not pick up the phone, and would not respond to your message sometimes for days), incompetent (constantly answering the wrong questions), and eventually they blame Outlook for the imcompatibility. If you buy their product not directly from their website, they will not refund you although the problem arises from their own false advertisement and their slowness in admitting it so you pass the period so that you can not return their product to the vendor that you purchased from.

Apparently you can't create a database in the Mac version, at least not as described in the manual, which is written for Windows users. This means that you *must* export the info you scan into another program because when you quit CardIris, everything you've done disappears. I haven't yet figured out how to save the card image, which seems to be connected to the database creation issue. While that isn't critical, it is annoying. The program also crashes frequently and/or gives ambiguous error messages. The scanning accuracy is around 90%, but scanning multiple cards on a flatbed scanner doesn't work -- another Windows-only feature apparently. Bottom line: I was very disappointed in the software's performance. It was not money well-spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero \\"customer support\\"","review":"I received a free copy of this software with my Fujitsu ScanSnap (a great product, BTW).

Myself, I was haunted, in a good way, and yet disturbed at the same time. The wonderful prose pulls you into this unknown mans life. The wonderful art work keeps you there. I personally love the work. I do recommend though, that it would probably be best to read this one with the young reader rather than let them try it by themselves for the first time. I find it difficult to think that a very young person would be able to identify with the lonely man in this story nor understand just what is happening (as a matter of fact, after several readings, I'm not all that sure myself, and I am as old as dirt). Be that as it may, this is certainly one worth giving a read, several reads as a matter of fact!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple kindness","review":"This story of an aging and lonely man living in an urban SRO who is brought back to joy in living by a smile from a stranger.

That was 60 days ago, and still no update. Recently, the player would not eject a disk. It was stuck in a 'open' loop, but would not open the tray. Again I contacted tech support, and they told me to force the tray open, or disassemble the unit (remove the cover) and go from there. I have sent countless emails for a warranty resolution, but am getting nowhere. I have now contacted my credit card company for a refund.While the picture quality at 1080i over HDMI is pretty good (the blacks are not very crisp), the build quality and lack of 1080P support makes this unit not worth the 'great price.'

You may have to switch off both top and rear off switches (possibly unplug the unit every time it's off?), and, despite owner's manual implications, connect only one output source at a time (I had component and RGB hooked up at the same time).

This book testifies that God does provide miraculously for the starving African children and we who love God are called to channel those blessings to the poor and needy through our faith in our Heavenly Father. The book is well-balanced and not only shares experiences about miraculous provision, but also shares about sacrificial giving of food, love, and other practical resources.

This style and ability, of the author, allows the reader to be deceived, which might be difficult on the \\"big screen\\".The books greatest strength, in my opinion, is it's in-depth descriptions of the characters.

Other chapters cover Lenses and Lens Shutters, Wooden View Cameras, Large-Format Focal-Plane Shutters, Medium Format, and the Minox C.

There was no attachment to any of the characters who die right off the bat, and I just couldn't ever fully sink into the story because of the technical errors. Much as I was looking forward to liking the novel, the style seemed off and by the time I reached the end of the second chapter, I gave up trying to make it through the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad title, great writing.","review":"The title of this book is somewhat misleading - the stories within (with one exception) are not really (in my opinion) \\"science fiction\\". All are alternative history stories, although somewhat atypical of the genre. It seems that some authors have alternative timeline theories and write stories to support them. The authors in this book use alternate timelines as frameworks for good stories. Being a fan of both SciFi and alternative history, I gave this book a read and was quite impressed with the quality of the writing. I'm not familiar with all of the authors, but will be looking out for their other works. \\"The Winterberry\\" stood out. At first you don't see the connection with alternate history, but eventually you catch on, with sad realization.

The only reason I continued to watch this horrific film to the end is it was with hopeful anticipation that there must be some exciting scenes forthcoming.

It contains eight sections dealing with a variety of emotions and situations consequent upon the loss of a parent, relating to grief, loss and pain.

There's nothing wrong with having A-cups, and we do not need to add anything to them to 'look better'. The only thing I have a small problem with is that the bra (like 99% of all bras) are made for someone with narrower shoulders than me.

The book itself is only fair. The case study is useful, but I never managed to get all the code to work. The explanations are sketchy at best. As an exam guide it is highly inadequate. The book only covers a fraction of the topics in the exam. Unfortunately, at this time it is the only MCSD book for InterDev available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book for exam 70-152 studying","review":"This book does an ok job describing the technologies surrounding web applications, but as a study guide it was no help at all. I read it cover to cover, and it was a complete waste of time. The exam focused on things that were not even covered in the book. To understand things at a high level, the book is ok. The only problem at the time I am writing this review, there are no other books or practice exams available to use to study for this particular exam.

It worked fine for about 14 months and then the right side would not stay down for toasting. I called the company but they were no help. The closest repair facility was 120 miles away in Philadeplhia. They will not ship parts to an individual. I would not recommend purchasing one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darn","review":"I really wanted to like this. Love the styling. Love the features. But, ultimately, it's a toaster. And it doesn't do well at that basic function. Doesn't toast both sides evenly, not consistent between toasts. If I look in the well when it's on, I can plainly see the problem. Unequal heated elements. Such a simple and basic first step. Equal number of elements, all on, equals perfect toast. And as some others mentioned, it's turned WAY down, otherwise black toast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another broken toaster....","review":"I bought this toaster because I had tried a friends and loved how it worked. I wish I had taken the time to read other reviews BEFORE buying. Less than one year later the lever won't stay down, and it shorts in and out even then. This is the most I have ever spent on a toaster and I have to wonder why I didn't stick with the $20 models as I ended up wasting my money on this one. Pathetic. Go buy 2 cheap ones, they will probably last a heck of a lot longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looks, but mediocre quality for a critical feature","review":"The DeLonghi toaster looks good and has some good features. However, when it wore out after only a few years, I took it apart, and found what I consider a major design defect. The darkness control mechanism is based on a small plastic V-shaped part which slides between two sets of high-power electric contacts. One side of the V melted off completely, so the toaster only does the warming cycle. It may be that this part took a while to melt off, but it also seems inevitable when you put a plastic part against a hot contact. I wonder how you say \\"planned obsolesence\\" in Italian."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap stuff","review":"Did not last 2 years.Company told me that they could not do anything because the warranty was over and they didnt have the parts anyway ,bought in Dec 2009."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped toasting both sides of bread after 2 weeks","review":"Beatiful to look at, function of toaster quite disappointing.

Have requested to exchange item and am awaiting reply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toaster (a little big though)","review":"After reading a bunch of reviews from a variety of different toasters, we decided on this one. We are very pleased with it thus far. It is bigger than the other 4-slice toasters we looked at, but seems to be better made.The only negative thing I can say is that at the lowest setting the toast is what we consider to be perfect. It would be nice to have a little lower setting. Maybe the reheat setting would be what to use instead if you need it less.Regardless, it makes great toast (and pop-tarts)."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY! EVER!!!","review":"The first toaster we received that had five obviously scratches, so we requested to have a replacement. However, when we received the second replacement, there was still two big scratches on the toaster. Now we are going to request to have another replacement again. We just not sure if they have do the quality check before the item was sent. It is the worst quality we have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"We received this toaster as a gift less than 2 years ago. Within 1 year, one lever would not stay down to toast (unless you held it down). Now the second lever is doing the same thing. Looking at the prices online, there are much less expensive brands that will most likely last at least 2 years. Buy one of those instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for the first couple uses but didn't meet expectations....read on","review":"I was really excited to get this toaster. It had replaced once that I had used for many years. At first it worked great. By \\"at first\\" I mean the first couple of toasts. Then the distribution of heat changed. The toast didn't toast evenly between sides of the bread, It would burn or get darker on one side then the other. The defrost selection didn't work as well...and, to top that off, some toast started to slip and fall to the bottom. I am very dissatisfied with this toaster. I wish that I had the box that it was shipped in, I would return it. It went in the recycling bin. The toaster will soon follow the same fate as its box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non existent quality","review":"We ordered this toaster despite the price expecting high performance. It has never browned evenly, and there is no consistency in onsecutive settings. We could have bought four toasters for the price with better results. Worthless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a year!","review":"We bought this toaster to replace a 15 year old Black and Decker toaster that finally broke. This toaster worked well until about a week ago, when it stopped toasting. I think the wiring must have shorted out somewhere, because I see the blue \\"on\\" light flicker a bit when toasting, and the toast pops up too soon to actually be anything beyond barely warm, no matter what the setting. We have had this toaster for almost exactly one year. Totally ridiculous. I would expect a decent toaster to last longer than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love it","review":"They did a great job, The product was a Christmas gift, and the best toaster mom ever had.

There are some velcro straps that you are supposed to use to secure it. There really isn't anything to secure it with in my 2010 Town & Country anyway. It broke when I placed it in my van and opened it up. This is going back to the seller. I also realized that even if this thing did not break, it still isn't a good option. It is heavy to take out and you can't remove it with things in it. I'm going to try the Chrysler minivan tote, which I think will be a much better solution. I fold the seats a lot in my van. Having to remove all my stuff from the van just to fold the seats down would be silly. I think a tote makes more sense if you fold your seats down a lot. You can just pick up the tote, fold the seats down and place the totle back on the flat surface. I wish I had thought of this earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great organizer, but groceries often get caught on the side","review":"I have another car with a trunk organizer (from the vehicle manufacturer), and I don't know how I ever lived without it. So, I ordered this one for my Honda Civic because the only thing Honda sells is nets. I much prefer this because it's easy to put bags in. It also folds flat out of the way, which is great for when you need to put suitcases in the trunk. In general, it works quite well. My only minor complaint is that bags tend to catch the edge and cause the edges to collapse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cargo system, but installation could be better","review":"The cargo system is great and convenient. Just as advertised, it's easy to put up and pull down; it folds to about 3.5 inches high when not in use (so larger items can be stored), but I usually leave it up and assembled now. Size of each cubby is large enough for a single packed shopping bag. Some larger items can be stored behind the organizer, the height of the walls is just low enough that one can reach through and access the back.My only minor complaint (and as the score indicates, it really is minor), the installation could be better designed. It has these hooks through which I can thread a double-sided velcro tape to attach to D-rings in the vehicle; but the only hook connection location on the cargo system is on the sides, but on my vehicle (Volvo S60) the D-rings are on the front and back of the trunk, not to the sides -- making the hookup awkward. Highland could add in a couple of more options for hook locations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I was expecting for the price that this product would at least be relatively durable. It's far from it. The plastic sides and dividers easily warp and become bent out of shape. Then it collapses in on itself. Basically useless.

It is a must-read for women, and many men would benefit from this information, as well. Howard includes chapters on a vast number of topics.

If you like westerns like I do, you'll enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised...","review":"Surprised. Not by Shepard, who I've long thought is one of our great under-appreciated leading men, but by the story, the style and feel of the movie. I think I loved it. I've read some critics have called it \\"slow\\".....absolutely, its what I call a \\"slow burner.\\" Not every story needs to move like a freight train.There are a lot of ways the writer and director could have screwed this up, in just my opinion they dodged all the bullets. Like so many people I have a long term love affair with \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\\" so any movie taking a stab at sequel-ing that is running on dangerous ground. But they pulled it off.If you like sweeping scenery, genuine-feeling westerns, GREAT acting (Shepard is beyond perfect all the way to amazing) those are all reasons enough to watch Blackthorn. I paid $9.99 to watch \\"before its in the theaters,\\" and it was definitely worth it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring","review":"I consider flashbacks a device that is often used when a straight plot line isn't interesting enough.

I love even okay westerns. Struggled to finish this one. Rather slow, completely pointless, and the direction of some quite capable actors is either non-existent or awful. Real shame. Underlying it all is a terrible script. I do wonder what the makers of the film though was worth making about this movie. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is not a typical shoot 'em up fast action style western. Nor is it a historically accurate western. It's a 'what if' story about a western character, Butch Cassidy (Robert Parker).The cinematography is wonderful. Shot in Bolivia and you can certainly tell that.Sam Shephard's acting is great and I think the acting of the mining engineer is also very good.I'm usually good at predicting the ends of most movies. This one I was still able to predict, but only because of a reaction by one of the posse. Many people might have missed that & would indeed be surprised at the ending.I thought it was a good plot.I purchased the DVD & am glad I did.It's a movie I could enjoy again.I think you'll be pleased if you enjoy westerns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you'd expect from good old Butch","review":"So... you're telling me that Blackthorn can shoot out oil lanterns at 20+ paces, in a dark mine shaft, but he can't shoot a fat, black rabbit from three feet away? And, when he misses, he picks up a rock?And... you're also telling me that his horse would run off, never to be seen again?I got 30 minutes into this melodrama and had to shut it off.

This was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch before you buy!","review":"This movie was a great disappointment. It is not one of those great westerns that occasionally pop up out of nowhere like Seraphim Falls, or The Proposition. Instead this film comes with a breathtakingly beautiful trailer and the rest is rather mediocre. In my opinion the film looks and feels a bit amateurish. I know this is a harsh critique, but in between the gorgeous landscape shots there is very little story, with a lot of repetitive, awkward dialog, continuity errors, and some scenes with lighting issues. Unfortunately I was so impressed with the trailer that I bought the Blu Ray, and now after having watched about half of the film I'm ready toss the disc. Save your $$, rent the movie and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Previews are better than the movie","review":"The writing is really awful. The movie gives you brief flashbacks into Butch Cassidy's life but that doesn't start until midway through the movie. You don't learn about the plot until the end.

Also, I do not know if it is standard in these clocks, but you cannot change the direction of the projection, so that the projection can be upside-down or side-ways depending on where the clock is positioned relative to the bed. I have to put my clock away from the bed (too snooze happy) and so the projection is upside-down. Sure, I can just look at the clock, but the projection thing seemed kind of fun.

Robert Morgan is an amazing writer and I truly enjoy reading his books.Ginny and Tom were well written and very real characters. They fought a lot about Ginny's religious beliefs and Tom being a true workaholic but I never doubted for one minute that they were devoted to their marriage and that they loved each other. This marriage teaches us a great lesson, you never appreciate what you have until you lose it.Through the vivid descriptions of Ginny and Tom's workload, this book has made me appreciate all of the modern conviences that we have today even more.This book was well written and enjoyable. I would recommend this book as well as Gap Creek to anyone and I'm looking forward to reading more books by Robert Morgan."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],M={key:0},H={key:1};function B(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(C,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-1ac65bf2"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/56.md","filePath":"people/56.md"}'),W={name:"people/56.md"},L=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
